2765571,"R v Barling, Daniel; R v Lim, Chin; R v Edmondson, Scott; R v Ralph, Damian [2014] NSWLC 24","JUDGMENT


	
	This is a prosecution of four police officers who were involved in detaining Roberto Laudisio Curti immediately before his death in Pitt Street Sydney in the early hours of the morning on 18 March 2012. The proceedings are not about responsibility for Mr Curti’s death. The evidence about what caused his death is inconclusive, and the Director of Public Prosecutions does not allege that any of the officers before me in these proceedings was responsible for his death.
	
	
	Daniel Barling and Scott Edmondson face allegations of assault occasioning actual bodily harm with common assault as an alternative. It is alleged that each of them used a Taser in assaulting Mr Curti after he was handcuffed and on the ground. Chin Lim and Damian Ralph face allegations of common assault. Those assaults are alleged to have been committed by use of a Taser and oleoresin capsicum spray (""OC spray"") respectively, also while Mr Curti was handcuffed and on the ground.
	
	
	On 9 December 2014 I gave a decision finding that each accused had a case to answer. That decision was given considering the whole of the prosecution case taken at its highest. Unfortunately I need to repeat some of the things I said last week in that decision here, for the sake of clarity.
	
	
	Evidence has now been given by each accused in the cases for Mr Lim, Mr Barling and Mr Edmondson. Mr Ralph did not give evidence. No inference may be drawn adverse to him as a result of that.
	
	
	These are criminal proceedings and the onus is on the prosecution to prove each element of the offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Police are entitled to use reasonable force in arresting persons suspected of offences. Actions that would be an unlawful assault if done by any other member of the community, such as spraying a person with capsicum spray or using a Taser to pass electric current through a person's body, are lawful if done by police in the execution of their duty. However, any force used in the course of arresting a suspect must be reasonably necessary: s 231 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW). The prosecution case is that each of these officers used more force than was reasonably necessary in the course of Mr Curti’s arrest. It is not alleged that the arrest itself was unlawful, or that the use of force of itself was unlawful.
	
	
	In this particular case it is essential that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt either one of the following, that:
	



	
	it is not reasonably possible that the accused believed that his conduct was reasonably necessary to effect the arrest of Mr Curti (or prevent his escape after arrest); or
	
	
	his conduct was not reasonably necessary in the circumstances as he perceived them to be.
	



	
	If I have a reasonable doubt as to whether the prosecution has proved either of those matters, the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt.
	
	
	Factually, the evidence must also establish beyond a reasonable doubt that each accused knew that Mr Curti was handcuffed when each of the accused acted as alleged. That is necessary for proof, but not of itself conclusive.
	
	
	Although I have heard these cases together, the prosecution does not say that these four accused were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise. Each case is to be considered separately, taking into account only the evidence that has been admitted in each case.
	
	
	The defendants, Mr Lim and Mr Barling, have raised their good character. Each is entitled to have his prior good character taken into account both on the question of whether his evidence is to be believed, and on the question of whether he is likely to have behaved in the criminal manner alleged.
	


Background

Legal Background


	
	The authorities in relation to the question of what is reasonable force come from a time before general duties police were routinely issued with Tasers and OC spray. However the test to be applied is the same.
	
	
	The common law test was originally set out in R v Turner [1962] VR 30 at 36, and adopted in Woodley v Boyd [2001] NSWCA 35 at 37, as follows:
	


“What is reasonable depends on two factors. He is entitled to use such a degree of force as in the circumstances he reasonably believes to be necessary to effect his purpose, provided that the means adopted by him are such as a reasonable man placed as he was placed would not consider to be disproportionate to the evil to be prevented…”


	
	In Woodley v Boyd (supra) at [37], Justice Heydon said:
	


“...in evaluating the police conduct, the matter must be judged by reference to the pressure of events and the agony of the moment, not by reference to hindsight.”


	
	Justice Heydon went on to quote McIntosh v Webster (1980) 43 FLR 112 at 123, where Connor J said:
	


“[Arrests] are frequently made in circumstances of excitement, turmoil and panic [and it is] altogether unfair to the police force as a whole to sit back in the comparatively calm and leisurely atmosphere of the court room and there make minute retrospective criticisms of what an arresting constable might or might not have done or believed in the circumstances.”


	
	In the decision of State of NSW (NSW Police) v Nominal Defendant [2009] NSWCA 225, there was a general discussion as to the question of the assessment of reasonableness in the context of a police officer performing his or her duties. In that case, which concerned the reasonableness of a police pursuit, police decisions were described at [46] as “...almost spontaneously reactive to the circumstances presenting themselves to the police officer.” 
	
	
	Those comments were made in a different context, but in this case it is argued that they are applicable to the split-second decisions that were required of the individual officers involved in this particular matter. Significant reliance has been placed by counsel for each accused in this matter on the need to avoid “minute retrospective criticisms” in the “leisurely atmosphere of the court room”.
	


Taser Operation


	
	I have heard evidence from many witnesses, but the prosecution case relies heavily on the footage which is available from the cameras mounted on the Tasers used by Senior Constables Edmondson and Lim, and Probationary Constable Barling. A Taser starts recording both video and audio from the time the safety is turned off, unless the trigger is pulled immediately, in which case the recording may be delayed. Every time the safety switch is turned back on, the camera stops recording.
	
	
	Each individual Taser has a time stamp that appears on the video footage. However, the times are not the same between different weapons due to inaccuracies that can arise for reasons explained by Mr Nerheim of TASER International in his report of 31 August 2012 (Exhibit 2 Item 17). Mr Nerheim corrected and standardised the times attributable to the operation of each Taser used against Mr Curti, and in table 6 of that report provided a list of the start and end time of each Taser discharge, corrected against each other. These corrected times were referred to in detail by the prosecutor in her submissions as showing in what order each discharge of a Taser is alleged to have occurred. Where I refer to times of Taser use in these reasons, I am using the “corrected” times that appear in Mr Nerheim’s report in Table 6 at page 6. However, caution must be exercised in giving undue weight to precise seconds for the reasons Mr Nerheim set out in discussing the values in that Table.
	


Police Training


	
	I have received evidence of the Tactical Options Model in which police are trained. It includes concepts related to the use of force that stress that, “[t]he ultimate goal is control of the situation”. The model requires police to evaluate the propensity for control versus injury; that is, the concept of reasonable force. Consideration of all the matters required to be taken into account makes clear the complexity of the assessment required to be made. Officers are required to “make judgments and decisions on their perceptions and observations at the time of each situation”. The “wheel model” requires all options to be “considered equally and selected with regards to their appropriateness to the situation at hand”.
	
	
	Standard Operating Procedures (referred to as “SOPs”) for Taser use as at March 2012, include as relevant “criteria for use”:
	


""4.2 Protect yourself or others from persons where violent confrontation or resistance is occurring or imminent.

4.3 Protect officer/s in danger of being overpowered or to protect themselves or another person from injury.”


	
	In relation to the use of Taser in “drive stun” mode the SOPs note that, “[d]rive stun mode may cause pain and will NOT achieve Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI). Therefore it should only be considered in exigent circumstances”: 5.5.3. 
	


“5.10 Continued use of the Taser must be justified in all the circumstances following assessment of the subject and in accordance with the Tactical Options Model.

5.11 Multiple use of the Taser should be avoided where practicable and must be justified in all the circumstances following assessment of the subject and in accordance with the Tactical Options Model. Note, multiple cycles or prolonged use of Taser may increase the risk of serious injury or death.”


	
	The training actually provided includes the following in relation to assessing a situation as “high risk”:
	


“The essential judgement that needs to be exercised is whether the real or impending violence or threat to be countered is such that the degree of force that could be applied by the police is fully justified.”

This guidance is given in the context of the Tactical Options Model and Use of Force concepts that underpin any use of force by operational police.


	
	Training in “legal implications” of Taser use includes the following:
	


“Multiple ECD applications cannot be justified solely on the grounds that a subject fails to comply with a command, absent from other indications that the subject is about to flee or poses an immediate threat. This is particularly true when more than one officer is present to assist in controlling a situation.”

Repeated applications of Taser are identified as a particular risk factor.


	
	The training actually provided indicates that, “[h]andcuffed prisoners must not be Tasered unless one or more of the ‘Criteria for Use’ exists as outlined.”
	
	
	The evidence of Senior Sergeant Davis is that in March 2012 there was no SOP in relation to the use of more than one Taser on the same subject. “Multiple” applications referred to one operator using a Taser more than once. In relation to the requirement for “assessment of the subject” Mr Davis said that related to whether the use of the device had achieved what it set out to do. He said, “[a]t some point it [would not] be worth using that device again. The expectation would be that you would try an alternative tactical option to maintain control of the subject.”
	
	
	The SOPs I have been provided with do not include any such precise restriction on the use of OC sprays. It is described as “a less than lethal defensive spray, devised for self-defence and arrest or control of violently aggressive or resistive subjects.”
	
	
	Under the heading of “[w]hen to use”, a possible situation is described as “a less than lethal option for controlling people where violent resistance or confrontation occurs (or is likely to occur)”. Officers are trained to shake the canister at the start of each shift.
	
	
	There is nothing in the SOPs for the use of OC sprays to suggest that it could be appropriate to use it on a handcuffed offender who is continuing to resist police but is lying face down on the ground with attempts being made by other offices to restrain him. It is inherent in everything in the SOPs that OC sprays are to be used defensively against a subject who is standing. It is to be sprayed for approximately one second.
	
	
	SOPs go on to require police to assess the effect of the OC on the offender:
	


“If there are no visible effects, you may use another one second spray of OC. If there are still no visible effects and the offender has still not complied with verbal commands, you should consider another tactical option or course of action.”


	
	Later in the SOPs the following appears:
	


“Remember: while many offenders who have been sprayed with OC will stop resisting and allow you to assist them in the decontamination process, some offenders might continue to violently resist and fight. Consider a further tactical option or course of action, including the application of restraint devices (such as handcuffs, if justified).”


	
	Although I have not received any specific evidence of training in relation to use of OC spray, it is reasonable to infer that police are trained to use the spray in accordance with the SOPs.
	
	
	All of the accused had completed relevant training.
	


The Evidence

The Attempt to Arrest Mr Curti


	
	I have received a large amount of evidence concerning what happened before the time of these alleged offences, as well as evidence concerning forensic examination and differing opinions about the cause of Mr Curti’s death. The actions that give rise to these charges, however, occurred over a period of up to five minutes, or less than three minutes in relation to the Taser use.
	
	
	Mr Curti had been identified as a suspect in relation to what was broadcast on police radio as an armed robbery. This robbery was believed to have been committed a short time earlier in the Sydney CBD. He had been inside a convenience store in King Street behaving in a very unusual way, including sitting on the floor behind the counter. At one point he climbed over the cage surrounding the person working behind the counter, landing on the counter and causing various items to fall to the ground. He then climbed back over the counter, took two packets of biscuits, and ran out with them. He left his shirt behind in the shop. A description was broadcast of him over police radio after a member of the public in the vicinity had called 000. That person had seen part of what was happening in the shop from outside. That person also (understandably, but incorrectly) thought that two other men might have been involved in what she perceived as a robbery. In fact, it seems they were standing looking into the shop to check that the person working there was all right, because they had also seen Mr Curti acting strangely.
	
	
	Mr Curti had taken a small quantity of LSD earlier the night before. At about 4.30 a.m. he rang his sister, with whom he had always been on good terms, and asked “why do you want to kill me”. His friends saw him acting strangely and lent him money to get a taxi home. A taxi driver who picked him up in the city thought he was “maybe crazy or [had taken] too many drugs”. He had been assaulted by three young men in George Street in the early hours of that morning, including being hit to the head and kicked to the body when on the ground. He was bleeding when he went into the convenience store, and at some stage he must have removed his clothes before he was observed walking down Pitt Street wearing only jeans.
	
	
	All of this behaviour was extremely out of character for him.
	
	
	Although a great deal of evidence has been tendered or given in this case concerning these matters, the police attempting to arrest Mr Curti did not know any of it. Officers involved in the arrest described him as appearing very fit and strong, sweating significantly, resisting violently, and as appearing drug affected. Civilian witnesses who were in the area at the time made similar observations.
	
	
	It is clear that a police radio (VKG) message had been broadcast sometime before this incident confirming that there were no weapons involved in the alleged robbery on King Street. However, more than an hour later, the message the police involved in the attempted arrest were responding to described it as an “armed robbery”.
	
	
	None of the police officers involved in trying to arrest Mr Curti had any personal knowledge of the robbery allegation. All they knew about it was what they had heard on the radio; which described it as an armed robbery.
	
	
	On its face, that is a serious offence. The police were entitled to use whatever force was reasonably necessary in arresting Mr Curti; that is, they did not have to let him go rather than use appropriate force. Unfortunately, by his own actions, Mr Curti did not let police form any view about his involvement in the offence, or the relative seriousness of it.
	
	
	There is nothing in any of the CCTV footage I have seen to suggest that Mr Curti ever deliberately tried to assault police. What he appears to have been trying to do was run away from them and, when caught, to get away from them. The prosecution does not allege that the use of Tasers or OC sprays in that situation was inappropriate to effect the arrest initially.
	
	
	Senior Constable Lim and Constable Collison (in vehicle SH35) were the first to approach Mr Curti in the middle of Bathurst Street at its intersection with Pitt St. Constable Collison has given evidence that, at that stage, he was simply trying to talk to Mr Curti to find out whether he had been involved in the earlier incident. Unfortunately, and for reasons unknown but likely to be associated with his earlier drug use and associated mental state, Mr Curti ran from those police. Senior Constable Lim fell over as he was pushed away. They ran after him. Two other officers, Probationary Constable Barling and Constable Ralph (in vehicle CI15), were already at Pitt St attending an unrelated job a short distance away to the south. Constable Ralph, identifiable in the CCTV footage from the City of Sydney camera located at that street corner, also joined in the chase down the western side of Pitt St.
	
	
	Mr Barling has given evidence that he saw this chase and ran diagonally across Pitt St and tackled Mr Curti to the ground. He did this by wrapping his arms around Mr Curti’s waist and he said, “the force of my forward motion brought him to the ground”. He described Mr Curti as kicking and thrashing about. The four police present were unable to hold him still. This evidence from police is consistent with evidence from other witnesses, including civilians in the area at the time, in particular Mrs Price. During that struggle Constable Barling drew his Taser, shouted “Taser, Taser, Taser” and deployed it. He believed that the probes hit Mr Curti. The technical evidence I have received from Mr Nerheim of Taser International suggests that 5 seconds of current were delivered (at 6:01:07 am). Mr Curti managed to get up and get away from these four officers. He ran to the eastern side of Pitt St and kept running south.
	
	
	By the time Mr Curti was running down the eastern side of Pitt St, other police had responded to the radio message and they also became involved. Sergeant Cooper drove his police sedan (CI14) up onto the western footpath in an attempt to cut Mr Curti off. Mr Curti ran around it. Sergeant Cooper joined the chase. He also deployed his Taser at about the same time as Probationary Constable Barling. His evidence is that his first deployment was after Mr Curti reached the eastern side, however the physical evidence suggests it was in fact on the western side. He did not believe that both probes struck Mr Curti. Probationary Constable Barling removed his Taser cartridge after the first deployment and reloaded it with another cartridge. He continued to chase Mr Curti down the eastern side. A number of members of the public were standing on the footpath. One tried unsuccessfully to trip Mr Curti as he ran past. From CCTV footage it appears the police behind him were not catching up to Mr Curti.
	
	
	Two other police officers, Senior Constable Edmondson and Constable Ryan (in CI16) had also responded to the radio call. They had seen the police interaction with Mr Curti at Bathurst St from further east, and went around the block to enter Pitt St from the south. When Senior Constable Edmondson got out of that police vehicle Mr Curti was running towards him down the eastern footpath of Pitt St being chased. He ran towards Mr Curti and barged him into the front window of Kings Comics. Constable Barling described Mr Curti as being “knocked off his balance only briefly, he placed his hand on the ground and continued running”. That description is consistent with CCTV footage. Constable Barling deployed his Taser again. This was at 6:01:24 a.m. He believed that he missed Mr Curti, and that Senior Constable Edmondson (who had come from the side) became tangled in the Taser wires. Mr Barling tried again to physically detain him a bit further south without success. He himself then fell over.
	
	
	Mr Curti ran across to the western footpath. He was still being chased by Senior Constable Lim, Probationary Constable Barling, Constable Ralph, Sergeant Cooper, and Constables Ryan and Collison. Probationary Constable Barling caught up, and has given evidence that he performed a “check drill” on Mr Curti in an attempt to disorient him to gain control, but Mr Curti lost balance for a second and continued on his way. Mr Barling says that he himself then ran into the window of a coffee shop and fell down some stairs.
	
	
	Mr Curti was taken to the ground on the footpath just south of that coffee shop on the western side of Pitt Street by another Taser fired by Senior Constable Lim (at 6:01:48 a.m.).
	
	
	Twenty-six seconds after Mr Curti is taken to the ground (for the third time) the footage from Senior Constable Lim’s Taser shows he is handcuffed. There were at least four police officers seeking to restrain him. One set of handcuffs, which were Constable Barling’s, were effectively placed on both wrists. Another set of handcuffs, which had come from Constable Ryan, were only placed on one wrist, with the other handcuff apparently unattached and potentially waving around as Mr Curti moved his arms. While the handcuffs were being attached, he was lying on his back breathing heavily but not apparently struggling. This Taser footage is continuous and reasonably clear. The footage from the other two Tasers is much less clear, shorter, and runs from more than a minute after the end of the aforementioned footage.
	
	
	A radio transmission is made “City one five we’ve got him in custody” at about this time. A foot pursuit had previously been called and other cars were already responding.
	
	
	Officers in CI17 (Constables Chan and Kim) and RX15 (Constables Waugh and Ferguson-Gornalle) arrive at about this time, from the south.
	
	
	The first conduct of any police officer said to be criminal is Mr Lim’s action in firing his Taser again 43 seconds after he first deployed it.
	
	
	Mr Lim’s Taser footage is exhibit 33 and is continuous from 26 seconds before Mr Curti falls to the ground until 48 seconds after.
	
	
	One minute and 2 seconds after Mr Lim discharged his Taser for the second time, Mr Barling discharged his Taser five times in drive stun mode within a minute and 15 seconds (at corrected times of 6:03:32, 6:03:45, 6:03:52, 6:04:20 and 6:04:47: Report of Magnes Nerheim Table 6). These discharges are alleged to be criminal conduct by Mr Barling.
	
	
	At 6:03:41 and 6:03:54 Mr Edmondson discharged his Taser, for five seconds on each occasion. These discharges are alleged to be criminal conduct by him. I note that there is some doubt about the comparison between the corrected time of the second of these activations and the corrected time of Mr Barling’s activation. In particular, Mr Nerheim suggests that rather than overlapping, it is possible that Mr Edmondson’s Taser was activated before Mr Barling’s for this activation, and not after, as the table appears to show: see report at p 6.
	
	
	At about the same time as these Tasers are being used, and also immediately thereafter, Mr Ralph is alleged to have used OC spray on Mr Curti in a way that is alleged to be criminal conduct by him.
	
	
	Evidence before me includes the VKG log of calls with approximate timings of those police radio transmissions. In the audio of the Taser footage of both Messrs Barling and Edmondson the words “this person was apparently Tasered” can be heard spoken by VKG. An officer using the call sign CI15 says “the male’s resisting violently” and after noises are heard over radio VKG says “City 15 you’re very broken up, take a breath and repeat. The male is resisting violently or was?” Constable Ryan then comes onto the radio and says “… [h]e’s really violent, about ten cops here and he’s still going”. I am satisfied from the timing that, even allowing for inaccuracies of seconds, these words are spoken at about the same time as, or within seconds of, Messrs Edmondson and  Barling using their Tasers on Mr Curti while he is on the ground. Shortly after Constable Ryan says “[y]eah radio can we have ambos [sic] and if there’s any other person, further cars that can help us.” CI18 (Constables Mayers and Bourke) responds. More than a minute after the last discharge of any Taser Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle transmits “… this bloke’s still playing up, we’ll wait for ambos [sic] to come, he may have to be tranquillised or something of that nature.” At about 6:07:40 Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle asks “radio can we just check if there’s any crews with a set of flexi-cuffs please”. The uncontradicted evidence is that flexi-cuffs had been requested by Sergeant Cooper as a possible means of restraining Mr Curti’s legs.
	
	
	According to the VKG log it was nearly eight minutes after the last Taser discharge that Mr Curti was found to have no pulse. CPR was immediately commenced by police. Tragically, Mr Curti died at the scene.
	
	
	Apart from the Taser video and audio, the VKG log and other physical evidence from the scene (which is essentially consistent with the summary I have set out above) I have heard evidence from other police officers and a number of civilians who happened to have been in the area at the time. Some of the civilians were quite intoxicated, which would make it difficult to rely on the evidence that they gave, with any confidence. Others were not. However, all of those witnesses were some distance from the location where Mr Curti was eventually brought to the ground, for most of the time. They made various observations which were either consistent with what I have set out above, or at least not inconsistent. A Mr Lee, who was not intoxicated, saw Mr Curti on the ground and described him as “struggling, like he was trying to get out, escape”. He also described a lot of grunting noises and officers trying to hold the man down. He described the man on the ground as moving violently, but was not sure whether he was face up or face down. Other civilian witnesses heard the police shouting at the man, “stop”, “don’t move”, “stop running”, “stop, police” and “Taser”. As is common in a matter that is observed by a number of different people, their individual perceptions of what happened focused on different aspects of the incident. That is not unusual for any witnesses, including police witnesses.
	
	
	Two sets of handcuffs were applied. One, by Probationary Constable Barling, was attached effectively and correctly. The other set, which was Constable Ryan’s, was not attached effectively. One cuff was attached and the other was loose, and the ratcheted claw-like end of the loose cuff posed a potential danger to anyone in close proximity to it. It may be that the presence of that loose cuff distracted some who saw it from the other handcuffs attached behind.
	
	
	I do not propose to go through the evidence of each police officer in great detail, largely because it is generally either consistent with other evidence or inconsistent as to matters of detail that are unimportant to the determination I have to make. However, I do need to summarise some of it. Having heard evidence from the three accused, which is evidence that is not contradicted by other police and in which each does not dispute applying force to Mr Curti, I do not consider that there are factual issues in dispute that would justify detailing the evidence that has been given over many hearing days more than is necessary for this decision. To a large extent, the evidence is all one way. There is nothing in the evidence of the other police officers that contradicts anything said by Mr Barling, Mr Lim or Mr Edmondson. I comment though that Constable Chan and Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle particularly impressed me as witnesses apparently able to give accurate and honest evidence. Some other witnesses were less impressive.
	
	
	Mr Ralph has not given evidence. Accordingly, I do summarise the evidence that he used OC spray and the way in which he did so, as that is something the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and must prove from the evidence admissible in his case. I must also be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew Mr Curti was effectively handcuffed when OC spray was used.
	


The Use of OC Spray


	
	Constable Collison recalled seeing someone with OC spray but did not recall who, and did not see it used. He saw it being held close to the male’s face when he was on his back. He heard the words, “stop or you will be sprayed”. Constable Ryan, after some hesitation, agreed she saw “consistent non-stop spray” aimed at the man’s face and thought it was Mr Ralph using it though she was not one-hundred percent sure. That was an account she had given two days after the incident. She also heard someone say “I need another bottle”. Constable Bourke must have arrived after the OC spray had been deployed. He saw Constable Barling affected by it. Constable Chan saw Constable Ralph holding an OC spray when he arrived, but did not see him using it. He did not see anyone else holding it. He also later heard Constable Ralph radioing for the ambulance. Senior Constable Kim described Constable Ralph holding an OC spray which was pointing towards the male. Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle described seeing OC spray applied from approximately 10 cm from Mr Curti’s face while he was lying on his stomach with his head to his side. He did not know who had applied the OC spray and could not recall whether that happened before or after the Taser was used. Constable Waugh only knew the OC spray had been used because the Constable with the beard (Mr Barling) had a secondary spray. None of those officers themselves used spray and they each gave evidence that no-one else used theirs.
	
	
	Mr Barling gave evidence of giving Constable Ralph his OC spray. He said that was after he himself had been tangled in the Taser wire. Constable Ralph asked him for it. He said he helped Constable Ralph get the spray from his belt.
	
	
	He gave evidence of seeing Constable Ralph attempting to spray the male with the can upside down while the male was moving about, and thrashing. He gave evidence of two occasions when OC spray was used, one some time after the other. Both were after he was having the Taser wires removed.
	
	
	He disagreed that by the time the OC spray was given to Constable Ralph that he knew that there were more police officers there. He described seeing Constable Ralph arching his back towards the street and himself becoming affected by OC spray. He described the distance of the can to Mr Curti’s face as “probably 20 cm, less maybe” at the time that Constable Ralph was using his can. He described himself to begin coughing and said he could not breathe properly and mucus started coming out of his nose.
	
	
	He believed that his first drive stun happened before he saw Constable Ralph use the OC spray.
	
	
	Mr Edmondson also gave evidence of giving Constable Ralph his can of OC spray. He said he did this after observing that Mr Curti did not appear to have been affected by the OC that had already been used, even though he himself could smell it. His evidence was that Constable Ralph was “trying to use [an] OC [spray], the canister was at about a 130 degree angle … I couldn’t see anything coming out of it.” (at 1032)
	
	
	He was cross-examined by Mr Hood for Mr Ralph and said “the canister was at about a 130 degree angle … I couldn’t see anything coming out of it.”
	
	
	He also said he had been involved with many violent offenders and this man was the worst he had ever encountered. Mr Edmondson weighed 120 kg at the time but said he was unable to control Mr Curti by putting his knee onto his back.
	
	
	He said the reason he passed his OC spray to Mr Ralph was “I had used my Taser. I believed it had no effect. My weaponless control had no effect. When I saw Mr Curti I did not believe he had the symptoms that he had actually been sprayed successfully. I couldn’t see the mucous, there was no coughing. I couldn’t see it on his face. I was going to use it, but I didn’t have a good view and good position and hence I handed it to Senior Constable Ralph” at 1043.
	
	
	The evidence that there was OC spray used at the scene is overwhelming. The evidence of scientific officer Kim Wong confirms that the cans issued to Messrs Ralph, Edmondson and Barling were for practical purposes empty. The evidence that it was Mr Ralph who used it is also sufficient to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that he did. There is no evidence from any witness of any other officer using an OC spray. It clearly was not used before Mr Curti was handcuffed, nor during the time when Senior Constable Lim’s Taser was recording (that is, up to Senior Constable Lim’s second Taser deployment). The only available inference is that it was used after that.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was used at least just before Mr Barling was using his Taser to drive stun Mr Curti, and again after all Taser use had stopped. In addition, I accept that it was directed into Mr Curti’s face from a distance of about 15 cm at a time when he was on the ground face down with his face to the side. I take that from Mr Barling’s evidence and also that of Constable Ryan and Constable Ferguson-Gornalle. While there have been criticisms made of the accuracy generally of the latter two witnesses, the three witnesses have given evidence of the same occurrence, which was something that one might hope is out of the ordinary for police as it is inconsistent with Standard Operating Procedures. As I have said, Constable Ferguson-Gornalle generally impressed me as a witness doing his best to tell the truth. Whilst Constable Ryan was a less impressive witness and indeed appeared to be trying to avoid giving this particular evidence, she ultimately did so.
	


Level of Resistance by Mr Curti once Handcuffed


	
	Constable Collison recalled Mr Curti rolling around trying not to be held by police, and heard police say “stop resisting”. He did not see a Taser or an OC spray used. He didn’t go in because “there was enough police”.
	
	
	Constable Ryan said she was worried Mr Curti was going to get free, and that she could only see one handcuff secured on his wrist. She described Mr Curti as getting up and running again after he fell to the ground. That evidence is inconsistent with what appears on the Taser video, and I do not accept it. She was trying to help restrain Mr Curti by putting her foot on his leg after he was face down. She felt a zap consistent with Mr Lim’s second use of his Taser.
	
	
	Sergeant Cooper was the external supervisor on the night and had 15 years’ experience as a police officer. He gave evidence of deploying his Taser on the eastern side of Pitt Street, although the crime scene evidence shows that he also deployed it on the Western side further up the street. He said that his deployment of his Taser had no effect on Mr Curti. He was unable to recall after he chased Mr Curti back to the western side whether both Mr Curti’s hands were handcuffed or only one. He described moving around to Mr Curti’s side and forcing him onto his stomach, so he had better control. He described Mr Curti kicking, bucking, twisting and fighting. He said he lay over the top of Mr Curti on his knees. He could hear other police say “stop resisting”. He repeated that he was unsure whether Mr Curti was handcuffed. He also gave evidence of seeing a Taser come over towards the bottom of his back, and the use of capsicum spray although he could not remember which came first. His evidence generally displayed such lack of recollection about some issues that I do not regard it as generally reliable.
	
	
	Constable Chan’s evidence is that when he got there it seemed quite calm, however Mr Curti suddenly got violent, his legs were kicking and he was trying to get up. Constable Chan said he tried to grab his ankles but could not gain control. He said that Mr Curti was turned onto his chest and that he then shifted both hands to Mr Curti’s left ankle while another officer (presumably Constable Waugh) grabbed Mr Curti’s right ankle. Mr Curti was still kicking and he said that they tried to handcuff Mr Curti’s legs but were unable to and gave up on the idea. He said that at some point he saw a Taser activated around Mr Curti’s lower back in drive stun mode, but it did not appear that it had any effect on him. He said that he could not be one hundred percent sure that it made contact. He described Mr Curti as shouting and screaming both before and after the drive stun.
	
	
	Constable Chan did not demonstrate any apparent reluctance to give evidence and there was nothing about the evidence that he gave that would lead me to reject it. Certainly one might think that if Mr Curti was on his back when Constable Chan first arrived that it might have been obvious that Mr Curti was handcuffed, however I note that Constable Chan does not say that he even saw the single handcuff that was unattached, and from viewing the video that was something that was very obvious because of the way in which it was attached. Mr Barling in his evidence said that it appeared to have been attached the wrong way round, and the video seems to bear that out.
	
	
	Constable Kim used his baton and described having difficulty in securing Mr Curti with the baton while he was lying face down and while Sergeant Cooper was applying his body weight.
	
	
	Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle arrived just after the vehicle containing Constables Chan and Kim. He said he placed one hand on Mr Curti’s leg to assist with the arrest but then stepped back because he saw another officer with a baton. He then assisted with radio calls.
	
	
	He described Mr Curti as going from his back to his front, yelling, and fighting and struggling with the officers. He described him as screaming. He described seeing a baton placed across his legs to stop him kicking and Sergeant Cooper kneeling and issuing instructions.
	
	
	Constable Waugh arrived in Pitt Street with Senior Constable Ferguson-Gornalle and believed that the male was trying to get up and run away. He described seeing his legs kicking around and said that he grabbed the male’s legs and attempted to handcuff them but could not. He described seeing an officer at the head of the male who had a Taser out. Clearly that was Mr Barling.
	
	
	Constable Bourke had been a police officer for three months. He arrived quite late in the struggle and observed Mr Curti lying face down struggling with police. He said that he placed his hands on the same leg as Constable Chan but that he wasn’t sure if the man was handcuffed. He described hearing the man groaning and screaming, and struggling violently. He did not see anyone use any Taser or OC spray. I accept his evidence as consistent with Mr Curti continuing to struggle well after the offences are alleged to have been committed. However, police there were clearly able to have some control at that stage.
	
	
	I have already noted some of Mr Barling’s evidence. He says that after he fell down the stairs he realised Mr Lim had deployed his Taser and saw Mr Curti on the ground. He removed some Taser wires from around Mr Curti’s neck. At that point he also had wire wrapped around his own shoulders and waist. He said he assisted in handcuffing the male with his own handcuffs, and said there was more than one police officer assisting. He was asked whether Mr Curti resisted that, and he said “not so much at that stage, he was straight arming and not bringing his arm towards me, he wasn’t assisting but he wasn’t thrashing around at that stage”. He gave evidence of observing the second set of handcuffs with one cuff loose. A short time later Mr Curti rolled slightly to his right and then to his left and placed his hand on the ground and attempted to get up. He said he was unable to recall exactly what happened but that on the footage he had seen the loose handcuff opening up in a clawlike fashion.
	
	
	Mr Barling gave evidence of being taught that handcuffing a person does not stop them from kicking, punching, choking or head-butting and that a loose handcuff is very dangerous and could cause serious injury. He says that he believed that Mr Lim then pulled the trigger of his Taser again, zapping him in the process. He says that at that point he turned his mind to the loose handcuff being very dangerous. He then got up to remove the Taser wires from himself.
	
	
	He gave evidence as follows, “[a] short time later he began what I would call flaring up again, kicking, thrashing about, and the officers obviously looked like they were having some trouble restraining this person, so I have gone around to the shop side and taken a position up near his head area… He looked like he was going to get away… I took my Taser out of its holder. Both of my cartridges had already been deployed, I pressed the trigger and pushed the Taser into his upper shoulder area. I can’t recall whether he was on his back or his belly at that stage. He was moving, he was just rocking back and forwards kicking about. He was moving quite violently.… I don’t [sic] believe we had control of the situation and I believe [sic] that if he did get loose from our grasp or did get away again serious injury would happen not only to ourselves but to him.”
	
	
	Mr Barling went on to say that he believed he turned his Taser off after that cycle and that Mr Curti had relaxed but then flared up again, kicking his legs again in what he described as a pedalling motion and thrashing his body backwards and forwards, moving out of the police grasp. He said he deployed his Taser again. He went on to give evidence that he did not believe that his Taser made full contact this time, that the rocking back and forwards meant that he was struggling to maintain contact of the probes.
	
	
	He was asked whether he thought of any other available option and said that he did not consider that there was another course he could have used that would have effectively restrained him. He said he was just focused on his little area and that, however many officers were there, they were not in control of the situation. He said, in effect, that each time Mr Curti tried to get up by rocking his body backwards and forwards he deployed his Taser in the same area. He said “I had used physical force, I had used restraint, I had tried to tackle him, I had put handcuffs on him and still we had no control of the situation” (at 964). He described Mr Curti as shouting and grunting the whole time even when the Taser was not being deployed.
	
	
	Mr Barling did make a notebook entry on the night. It was put to him in cross-examination that the notebook entry is inconsistent with the evidence he has given in court. He denied intending to put misleading information into the notebook.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Barling in cross-examination that the reason that he made notes in the order that he did was because he knew that drive stunning Mr Curti on multiple occasions after the application of handcuffs was unreasonable. He denied that. He said “I believe it was completely justified and I did what was reasonably necessary to effect the arrest.” I will return to that issue later in these reasons.
	
	
	Mr Lim also gave evidence. He said he was pushed to the ground by Mr Curti when he first approached him in Bathurst Street. He then chased him down Pitt Street, falling over when another officer tackled Mr Curti. He described getting on top of Mr Curti and trying to bring his right arm behind his back but said somehow he managed to buck them off and start running across Pitt Street. Mr Lim chased him. He saw another police officer try to shoulder barge him into some glass doors. He heard another Taser go off. He said that he managed to deploy his Taser into the man’s back. That was on the western side. He said “I believe I said Taser Taser”. He said “[a]s my probes hit the male I said 'Stop resisting or you will be Tasered again'"", as he fell to the ground. He said the male’s behaviour displayed a contact. Police converged around him.
	
	
	He said “[w]hen my Taser finished cycling he started to resist.” He said police were trying to handcuff his arms. He was still rolling around bucking up and down. He said “I was basically focused on where my probes [had] hit him in the back[,] where the wires were.” He said “[n]ext thing I know[,] I’ve seen basically one loose cuff before he tried to get up and basically run. I cycled my Taser a second time.” Explaining why he cycled his Taser a second time he said, “[b]asically what I was seeing at that time, police were struggling to control him. There was a loose cuff, he was attempting to get up. I knew if he managed to get up, one, he will probably start running again or, two, he would remain and fight with us[,] and that was basically to prevent any of that and prevent police from being injured”. He described the man falling back down onto his back. He described conducting a reload, that is putting a new cartridge on. He said it appeared that police had a bit of control over the male. He said he re-holstered his Taser. He did not deal with Mr Curti any further. He thought there were enough police there to deal with it.
	
	
	In cross-examination he agreed that he used his handcuffs to try to handcuff Mr Curti’s ankles, however that was not possible and so he assisted in removing the first one that was already on one of his ankles. He said he did not get his handcuffs out earlier because “[i]t is not the Taser operator’s job to handcuff the offender”. He agreed that after his first use of the Taser other police officers were moving in, in order to handcuff Mr Curti. He agreed that three officers were over the top of him struggling to control him. However he denied that he was able to see Mr Curti handcuffed effectively to the front. He agreed that Mr Curti on the footage was not thrashing his arms about, but said he believed that he was thrashing his legs about. He did not remember an officer having his knee on Mr Curti’s abdomen on the night. He did not remember an officer holding the chain between the handcuffs. He agreed he was right there, but said “I didn’t see that”.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Lim that he knew it was not necessary to deploy his Taser again and he disagreed. He could not remember and still did not accept anyone said, “cut it off, cut it”, although it was put to him that those words can be heard on his Taser footage. Mr Lim denied even knowing that an OC spray had been deployed. He said he was around Mr Curti’s feet area. He said at that time there were probably already maybe six officers around him, leaning over the top of him, and he said “I couldn’t see through them”. He also did not see anybody drive stunning Mr Curti.
	
	
	He said that the reason he waited almost 30 seconds before cycling his Taser for the second time was in order to assess and see if police were able to restrain Mr Curti and gain control. He said “all I have seen is a loose handcuff flapping around and at the same time he has attempted to stand up.”
	
	
	Mr Edmondson gave evidence. He parked his police vehicle on the eastern side of Pitt Street. He saw Mr Curti running towards him, and shoulder charged him into the window at Kings Comics. That was unsuccessful although Mr Curti went down in a crouched position. At that time he heard someone yell ""Taser"" and described being hit by a Taser. He said “I could feel wires on me, I’ve started pulling wires off me.” His evidence is that he then decided to go back to the police truck, and back the truck down the street.
	
	
	After he got out of the vehicle near where Mr Curti was on the ground, at a time I infer was after Mr Lim’s second use of his Taser, he said that he didn’t believe that the police there needed assistance. He said “I was thinking about finishing my shift.” He said he was still pulling wires off himself and he heard some yelling and turned around to see Mr Ralph and Sergeant Cooper get thrown back into the air. He said there were other police officers he did not recognise, also getting thrown back. He described going around another officer who was at the top of the male’s body. He said he saw Sergeant Cooper putting his weight onto his back and several officers trying to grab his legs and around his buttocks.
	
	
	He described Mr Curti as “moving his buttocks...torso and legs up into the air[,] and he appeared to bring his knees up..getting that running sprinting start.” He said he tried to put his knee on Mr Curti’s back but it was having no effect. His evidence was that usually in a violent confrontation that would be the end of the fight. He said he had been in more than a hundred violent confrontations.
	
	
	He gave evidence of taking his Taser intending to drive stun Mr Curti but that, “[a]s I have gone in to place the Taser against Mr Curti's right‑hand side, he has bucked up again, and brought his ‑ he was bringing his legs up and brought his right side of his body towards me and the right side of his body hit the front of my Taser just as I pulled the trigger. At that stage I wasn't sure if I actually hit him or what happened with my Taser because as I said the cartridge, I was where the probe shoots out of the cartridge, I wasn't sure if that had gone into him or where they had gone. When he kept on bucking up I started to fall off him. My left knee fell off his body and started going to the ground. … I re‑positioned my knee and as the violent confrontation was still occurring, he was still resisting my attempt to try and restrain him. I was fearful he was about to get up and fearful I might have been injured and other officers might have been injured. I have used my Taser, gone in to try and do another use of the Taser.” (at 1031)
	
	
	He said it was after the drive stun that he noticed Mr Curti was handcuffed, with one loose cuff.
	


Consideration


	
	As I have already indicated in my earlier decision, there is no evidence in this case of any particular malicious intent or other hostile action specifically towards Mr Curti by any of the police involved. Certainly the mere act of using a Taser or administering capsicum spray can be seen as hostile in itself. However, those are tactical options that have been determined appropriate to be available to NSW Police. They are non-lethal force options that are among the options available to police officers in seeking to deal with a suspect who is resisting or seeking to escape arrest. There are guidelines in relation to their use. Those guidelines require that there be a balancing act undertaken between the use of the particular option, and the risk of harm that may come if that option is used.
	
	
	The use of Taser in particular is relatively recent in the range of force options available to NSW Police. At the time of this incident in 2012, Tasers had only been issued to general duties police for about three years. Mr Lim, who had been in the police force for six years and had regular training in the use of Taser, had never used a Taser in operational policing, nor been involved in an incident in which one was used.
	
	
	I have not received any evidence by way of expert opinion as to what use of force was appropriate in the circumstances faced by these officers this morning. The defendants who gave evidence each gave evidence that they considered it was reasonably necessary to do what they did in the circumstances at the time. I cannot reject that evidence. However, there is also an objective standard to be applied. It is not enough that a police officer says that he thought it was reasonably necessary for the test that I have set out earlier in these reasons to be satisfied.
	
	
	The use of a Taser and the use of capsicum spray is not the sort of matter that is within the common knowledge of a member of the community. Both items are prohibited to the general community under the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW). In that situation, I consider that the police Standard Operating Procedures and guidelines do have relevance to the determination of reasonableness.
	
	
	There has been evidence given concerning a condition known as Excited Delirium Syndrome, and expert opinion evidence from Dr Vinen to the effect that it is probable Mr Curti was suffering from it at the time of the incident. Features of Excited Delirium Syndrome that Mr Curti was exhibiting included extremely aggressive and violent behaviour, constant physical activity, not responding to police presence, being inadequately clothed, breathing rapidly, sweating profusely, making unintelligible animal-like noises, being insensitive to or extremely tolerant of pain, appearing to have excessive strength, and failing to tire despite heavy exertion (Expert Certificate Dr Brouwer, 3 June 2014, at p 14 and evidence of Dr Vinen). Those witnesses agreed that in a medical context it is very hard to get control of a person suffering from that syndrome without aggressive sedation. Dr Vinen described sedation as “standard practice”. Of course, that is not available to police officers in the field.
	
	
	I have heard uncontradicted evidence from Professor Mark Kroll, an expert in biomedical engineering and, specifically, bioelectricity supporting his concerns that the general community does not understand the use of electronic control devices (ECDs), of which a Taser is one. In particular, he refers to what he calls a “false lay-intuition” that electricity builds up in the body in the way that other applications of force do. He says that it is not possible for an electric shock to kill a person unless it does so within a few seconds of application and that the public generally misunderstands the nature of ECDs in law enforcement. He also gave evidence that drive stun applications are very superficial and “[i]n the case of Mr Curti it is doubtful that there were even any psychological effects in that he was exhibiting an excited delirium state, which typically features a very high pain threshold” (Statement Mark Kroll, 22 September 2014, para 8).
	
	
	I have also heard uncontradicted evidence that in some medical contexts the use of an ECD is preferred to the use of physical restraint to quickly gain control of a patient who is out of control.
	
	
	In relation to the use of OC spray I have received evidence that police training is that OC should not be sprayed less than 60 cm from the subject’s face “where practicable”. Senior Sergeant Davis’ evidence is that if it is not practicable for OC to be used at 60 cm from the person’s face, it should not be used. Senior Sergeant Davis is a trainer with NSW Police. He did, in cross-examination, concede that in some circumstances it may be appropriate to move from one use of force to another even where a person is already handcuffed, and that there may be circumstances in which spray could be used at less than 60 cm.
	
	
	The Crown submits that it was not objectively reasonably necessary for any of the accused to use the appointments they used in the way they did. That is not only because Mr Curti was handcuffed, but also because there were by that time at least eight police in the area, and as I understand the submission it is that alternative means could have been used to control Mr Curti and stop him getting away or injuring anyone. It is inherent in that submission that those alternative means would not have involved the infliction of as much pain, or incapacitation, on Mr Curti. Otherwise, it is difficult to see how the use of these devices can amount to an assault, if the use of force (even if only by restraint) generally is justified.
	
	
	I have not received any evidence of what those alternative means might have been. It is always possible to think of other ways in which a particular outcome might be achieved. In this case the goal of each accused before the Court, in accordance with their respective training, was to achieve control of Mr Curti. With the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that police action on this particular morning was uncoordinated, that the use of Tasers and OC spray in the way that they were used may not have been reasonably necessary, and that Mr Curti was not actually likely to have posed a significant threat. However, that is not sufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. I am required to consider the situation as perceived by each officer at the time, in what has been referred to as the “agony of the moment”, and determine whether, taking that into account, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that each individual action was not reasonably necessary.
	
	
	Police training tells officers that the purpose of the use of a Taser in drive stun mode is to inflict pain on the subject. The purpose of the use of OC spray is to inflict pain on the subject. In each case, the infliction of pain is to overcome resistance, other than passive resistance. While initially Mr Curti may have been passive after being Tasered by Mr Lim, that situation did not continue even though he had been handcuffed.
	
	
	It is in the context of everything I have just said that I turn to consider the case against each accused.
	


The Case against Mr Ralph


	
	I have already indicated that the evidence is overwhelming that Mr Ralph used OC spray, spraying it at one stage directly into the face of Mr Curti while he was on the ground, at about the same time as other officers were both physically restraining Mr Curti and using Tasers to attempt to drive stun him. I also accept that the evidence establishes that Mr Ralph used at least two cans of spray on Mr Curti, although of course the evidence cannot establish exactly how much spray each of them contained before they were used. Although there was some suggestion in submissions that I could not be satisfied that there was in fact anything in Mr Ralph’s OC canister that day, I do not consider that even reasonably possible.
	
	
	The evidence also cannot establish how much of the spray actually affected Mr Curti. The only evidence from the scene is that of Mr Edmondson, before he handed over his spray to Mr Ralph, that Mr Curti did not show physical signs of being affected. The forensic evidence is quite inconclusive – the autopsy included some findings that could have been caused by an OC spray, but could also have had other causes. Clearly Mr Barling was affected by the spray directed towards Mr Curti at a time when he was located near his head. However, whether it had measurable effects or not, to spray OC towards someone’s face from 15 cm away satisfies the requirement for an assault (in the absence of lawful excuse).
	
	
	Constable Chan gave evidence of hearing Mr Ralph radioing for the ambulance. The prosecution relies on that evidence as showing that it was Mr Ralph who was speaking to VKG at times after Mr Curti no longer had a pulse under the call sign CI15. I accept that it must have been. The other officer in CI15 was Mr Barling. The evidence is clear that by the time these calls were being made, Mr Barling was up near Bathurst St and not making radio calls. The prosecution relies on a transmission in the following terms, “City 15 I believe he’s been Tasered six times, two and a half maybe three cans of OC spray”. The prosecutor argues that the reason Mr Ralph is able to relay that information is because he was responsible for discharging that OC spray into Mr Curti’s face. I accept the inference that he was is overwhelming. Three effectively empty bottles of OC spray were located at the scene. Two of those had been issued to Messrs Edmondson and  Barling.
	
	
	Ms Dodds submits that I should find that Mr Ralph was actually involved in handcuffing Mr Curti, and that he therefore knew that he was handcuffed. CCTV footage shows an officer in a cap but no load-bearing vest chasing Mr Curti down Pitt St. That officer was also wearing a black watch. I accept that the same officer is the one pulling Mr Curti’s wrist towards Mr Barling when he is handcuffing Mr Curti on the Taser footage. I also accept that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that it is Mr Ralph. There is no-one else it could have been when regard is had to his appearance for the first time on the CCTV footage at the corner of Bathurst and Pitt Street, and to all of the other evidence in the case as to where other officers were at the time.
	
	
	I accept Ms Dodds’ submission that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Ralph was involved in handcuffing Mr Curti, and therefore that he knew he was effectively handcuffed. He also must have known that there was a loose handcuff attached to his wrist as well as the handcuffs that were correctly attached.
	
	
	Police SOPs and training concerning the use of OC spray do not anticipate its use in the way that it was used on this occasion at all. It is difficult in those circumstances not to find that its use was not objectively reasonably necessary. The onus remains on the prosecution to prove that. Mr Hood has submitted that the circumstances in which Mr Ralph found himself required that he do whatever was reasonably necessary to get Mr Curti under control. He submits that the SOPs are guidelines only, not rules that when breached will result in criminal liability. He submits that I should look at all of the evidence in this case and, in particular, the uncontradicted evidence that at about the time that the OC spray was being used Mr Curti was struggling violently and police were not succeeding in trying to use physical restraint to contain him. He points to Mr Edmondson’s evidence that his attempts to control Mr Curti using his knee in his back was unsuccessful. Apart from during the handcuffing process when Mr Ralph appears to have had his knee on Mr Curti’s stomach, there is no reference in any of the evidence to him trying to use techniques of weaponless control on Mr Curti at all after Mr Curti was handcuffed.
	
	
	With the wisdom of hindsight, clearly it was not reasonably necessary to apply OC spray in those circumstances. It was reasonably necessary to restrain Mr Curti in some way. Mr Ralph had been involved in the chase of Mr Curti from Bathurst St. All of the other evidence in this case is that after initially being calm when handcuffed, Mr Curti continued to struggle and showed extreme strength in doing so. He was struggling sufficiently for police to try to use handcuffs to control his legs; something that is also not apparently suggested in police training and which was unsuccessful. Three police officers then struggled to hold his legs down. Two police officers have given evidence of giving Mr Ralph their cans of OC spray for him to use at a time when clearly, in the circumstances of this matter, the spray was about to be used in a way inconsistent with the SOPs. I have  Mr Edmondson’s direct evidence that he would have used it himself if he had been in a better position.
	
	
	As I said earlier in this matter, the only inference available in the absence of any evidence of malice, desire for revenge, or specifically targetted hostility is that Mr Ralph believed that it was reasonable to use whatever force was necessary until Mr Curti submitted to police authority and stopped struggling and trying to get away. That included using OC spray.
	
	
	The evidence the Crown can rely on as proving that the use of OC spray in these circumstances was not objectively reasonably necessary is that it is not consistent with the training police are given and not consistent with the SOPs. On one hand, that does seem powerful evidence that such use was not reasonably necessary. On the other hand, to find a person criminally liable for what is in effect an error of judgment in a situation that was volatile, violent and uncontrolled is also something that has been cautioned against in the cases I have earlier discussed. However, that is what the imposition of an objective standard in the test requires. It is a test that requires an independent assessment based on evidence.
	
	
	When I look at the evidence of the use of OC spray from a distance of 10 to 15 cm (rather than 60 cm) in a constant spray (rather than in one second bursts) while Mr Curti was lying face down and handcuffed with other police officers attempting to restrain him, and when I consider that the use by Mr Ralph of Mr Edmondson’s OC spray was after the use of two Tasers on Mr Curti in Mr Ralph’s immediate vicinity had stopped, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that such use was objectively not reasonably necessary. It was not only inconsistent with police training, but was contrary to it. On all of the objective evidence the spray was not achieving the purpose of its use. There is no suggestion on the evidence that any real assessment of the situation was made, and a decision made to stop using Tasers and continue to use the OC spray because it was having any desired effect. The evidence is to the contrary.
	
	
	While I accept that in the heat of the moment Mr Ralph may have thought it appropriate to continue to use the third bottle of OC spray, at least by the time Mr Edmondson handed over his spray (by which time there were ten police officers at the scene) it is obvious that it was not. I say that keeping in mind the necessity to avoid engaging in “minute retrospective criticisms” of what a police officer might have done. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in the circumstances, even as I would infer Mr Ralph perceived them, the prosecution has proved that the use of OC spray was not reasonably necessary to effect the arrest or prevent Mr Curti’s escape.
	
	
	I find Mr Ralph guilty of common assault.
	


The Case against Mr Lim


	
	The way the prosecution has run its case I must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Lim knew Mr Curti was effectively handcuffed before he Tasered him for the second time. I have already summarised the evidence Mr Lim has given concerning what happened before he used his Taser on Mr Curti for the second time.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Curti was initially compliant and still, after being taken to the ground by Mr Lim. After being handcuffed, but with an additional handcuff hanging from his wrist, I am satisfied that he rolled and tried to get up. That can be seen on the Taser video.
	
	
	I have already referred to Mr Lim’s evidence and in particular to his evidence that he did not see the handcuffs effectively applied to Mr Curti. I accept that what is seen on the Taser video is not what Mr Lim necessarily saw. I also note that the apparent brightness of the images on the video are a function of the camera workings and not the light that was there at the time. Mr Lim must have known that police officers were trying to handcuff Mr Curti. However, he denies knowing that they did so effectively. The prosecution must prove he actually knew.
	
	
	Having regard to his evidence, and to the evidence of other police officers present at the scene, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Lim knew, at that point, that a set of handcuffs had been effectively applied. He activated his Taser again because he perceived further resistance and attempted flight by Mr Curti. For him to have that perception was reasonable, given that he had been involved in chasing Mr Curti from Bathurst St and seen him taken to the ground twice and on each occasion manage to escape. In those circumstances I cannot be satisfied that, in the position he was in at the time and, in particular, noting his evidence of what had happened in the chase since he had first been pushed to the ground by Mr Curti at Bathurst St, it was not reasonably necessary for him to do what he did.
	
	
	I find Mr Lim not guilty.
	


The Case against Mr Edmondson


	
	In respect of Mr Edmondson, the evidence is clear that he was not at the location on the western side of Pitt St while Mr Curti was face up after he had first been taken to the ground. He has given that evidence himself, and it is consistent with CCTV footage that shows the vehicle Mr Edmondson arrived in being backed down Pitt St.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that when Mr Edmondson used his Taser in drive stun mode, Sergeant Cooper was already positioned partly across the middle of Mr Curti’s back, Constable Ryan had one foot on Mr Curti's leg (because there were too many other police officers there for her to be able to get closer), Constable Chan was restraining one foot, Constable Waugh was restraining the other foot, and Constable Kim and the other police officers were also in the immediate vicinity including Messrs Ralph and Barling. The way the prosecution case has been run, it is necessary to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that, at that point, Mr Edmondson knew that Mr Curti was handcuffed. The fact that there were so many police officers in the immediate area may make it difficult for a person coming onto the scene to ascertain whether the person being restrained is already handcuffed. Mr Edmondson first uses his Taser at a corrected time of 6:03:41 a.m. The evidence establishes that Mr Curti was handcuffed at least by 6:02:27 a.m. It is therefore a minute and 14 seconds later that Mr Edmondson can be proved to be at the location using his Taser.
	
	
	Mr Edmondson has given evidence that he did not know that Mr Curti was handcuffed. He has given evidence that when he came to the scene he made observations initially that the arrest had already been effected and that things were effectively under control. He says he did not know that Mr Curti had been brought to the ground by a Taser. He says he did not turn his mind to the question of whether Mr Curti was handcuffed, because he was thinking about other things, including the fact that it would not be his job to do the charge process in respect of Mr Curti. His 12 and a half hour shift was almost over.
	
	
	When things flared up and he went in to help restrain Mr Curti he says that he did not ask whether Mr Curti was handcuffed, and he did not consider assisting in that way because at that point Mr Curti was not under effective control and his focus was on achieving control. He agrees that he knew that Sergeant Cooper was there and was on Mr Curti’s back, he agrees that he knew that there were three police officers trying to restrain Mr Curti’s legs. He also knew that Mr Ralph was in the general vicinity. He says he did not know that Mr Barling was at Mr Curti’s head, notwithstanding that the evidence is that the Taser used by Mr Barling had already been used before the first time that Mr Edmondson used his Taser. He says that his focus was on the area that he was attempting to control given the volatility of the situation. I do note that Mr Barling had been removing Taser wire with the assistance of Constable Kim until a very short time before.
	
	
	Ms Dodds argues that I would not accept this evidence. She has submitted that on all of the evidence Mr Edmondson was standing right beside Mr Barling at the same time the latter was deploying his Taser, and at a time when Mr Curti was moving from his front to his side and back again. In those circumstances, his handcuffed hands and the fact that Mr Barling was deploying his Taser, must have been obvious.
	
	
	Noting that the onus is on the prosecution to prove the issue of actual knowledge of handcuffing beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not consider that the only reasonable inference available to be drawn from the circumstances is that Mr Edmondson, contrary to his evidence, did in fact know that Mr Curti was handcuffed. I accept that had he given consideration to it, he should have known. That is not sufficient to prove actual knowledge in the circumstances of this matter. The handcuffs which were on Mr Curti at that time were effectively hidden from Mr Edmondson’s view by Mr Curti’s body and by the other police officers in the vicinity. I note Constable Chan’s evidence to which I have already referred. Simply looking in his direction from the point on the footpath where Mr Edmondson is shown to be standing when he first approached the location (on the council CCTV footage from the corner of Liverpool and Pitt Street) would not have necessarily shown that Mr Curti was handcuffed. That is sufficient to mean that the case against Mr Edmondson for assault occasioning actual bodily harm must fail.
	
	
	I do, however, note his further evidence that even had he known Mr Curti was handcuffed he still would have regarded it as appropriate to use his Taser in the manner which he did. He said that is because Mr Curti was not under effective control. He himself had already attempted to shoulder charge Mr Curti into a window and Mr Curti had managed to get up from the ground and run away. I accept he did not know that Mr Curti had already been Tasered by Mr Lim on the Western side of Pitt Street. In those circumstances I accept his evidence that he regarded the use of the Taser on two occasions as an appropriate use of force in the circumstances. I do in particular note his evidence that he did not believe the first use of the Taser was effective. The technical evidence, in particular the report of Professor Kroll and the crime scene examination, provides some support for that interpretation. In those circumstances, using the Taser on the second occasion was equivalent to using it only once. I accept that Mr Edmondson did not know that Mr Barling was also using his Taser on Mr Curti’s shoulder at the same time. Both officers reacted at about the same time to Mr Curti’s increased movement and resistance to being restrained. I note his evidence of hearing a crackling sound during his second deployment of his own Taser. I am unable to reject the evidence he has given, particularly given the uncertainty about the precise timing of these particular Taser deployments as indicated by Mr Nerheim.
	
	
	I am unable to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Edmondson knew Mr Curti was handcuffed.
	
	
	I find Mr Edmondson not guilty.
	


The Case against Mr Barling


	
	I have already summarised much of the evidence of Mr Barling. Essentially, he does not dispute that he himself handcuffed Mr Curti, nor that he used his Taser in drive stun mode five times. Nothing he has said is inconsistent with the other evidence in the case, and generally I accept the evidence he has given. He does say that he did not believe that all of the drive stuns successfully made contact with Mr Curti. That appears to be borne out by the technical evidence of Professor Kroll, who says that in total, of all the drive stuns administered, Mr Curti received a total of 12 seconds of drive stun current, far less than the total periods the weapons were activated. Some of both Messrs Edmondson’s and Barling’s must not have made good contact, consistent with their evidence and other evidence that Mr Curti was moving around significantly.
	
	
	Mr Barling did not accept that the 14 second drive stun recorded in the evidence actually made contact for 14 seconds, because Mr Curti was moving around, and the evidence I have just referred to supports that. He described the Taser as having no effect on him. Mr Barling's evidence was that he turned the Taser off, or put the safety on, after each use of his Taser.
	
	
	He was cross-examined to the effect that the very very short time in between each drive stun indicated that he did not make a proper assessment of the situation before using that force again. His evidence in response to that was “[r]egardless of if there was other police officers around or not, if he is still resisting and attempting to get up and almost doing so, I believe I am justified in doing that a second time” at 986. It was put to him that he Tasered Mr Curti for a second time without any reference to what others were doing and he said “I Tasered him for a second time with reference to his resistance to myself and the people that I could see in my periphery… I don’t recall anyone else being there.” He gave evidence that Mr Curti was moving from his belly to his back and mostly in between attempting to get up. He gave evidence he believed Sergeant Cooper fell off Mr Curti’s back. It was put to Mr Barling that between his second and third drive stuns only two seconds passed. He disagreed that he had not made a proper assessment of the need in that time. He said “while I was trying to deploy the Taser he was moving around that much [sic] I didn’t have much contact, so there was a short period of time where I did have contact and he seemed to react to that”.
	
	
	In response to further questions about his ability to make a proper assessment he said “[i]f there were that many officers around they obviously weren’t doing a very good job of holding him down because he was still resisting, or almost getting away on each occasion and he was still thrashing about and kicking in a dangerous manner. So even if there were officers there, which I didn’t see, my reaction was to what I could see and his movements and my assessment of the situation.” He made further reference to the situation being volatile and quick.
	
	
	Ms Dodds placed reliance on what she submitted was an inevitable conclusion that Mr Barling knew that there were more police officers at the scene than the three in his immediate vicinity. I accept that he must have known other police officers were there, as he had been helped in removing Taser wires from himself by Constable Kim, who arrived at the same time or about the same time as three other officers. He knew that Sergeant Cooper was at least partly over Mr Curti’s back. However, I also take account of the evidence I have already quoted of Mr Barling in cross-examination, to the effect that the presence of those police officers was having no effect on Mr Curti’s level of resistance.
	
	
	Mr Barling said he believed that his use of his Taser was reasonably necessary. He did not know that Mr Edmondson was also Tasering Mr Curti at that time. He described the situation as quick and volatile. He described Mr Curti as thrashing about, kicking, screaming, and described potential for danger and injury to everyone involved, including him. I have already noted his other evidence concerning his earlier attempts to detain Mr Curti and Mr Curti’s success in getting away despite having been taken to the ground by a tackle and having four police officers trying to hold him.
	
	
	I accept the prosecutor’s submission that the notebook entry made by Mr Barling on the morning sets out a sequence of events which is inconsistent with the evidence he has given in court. While he may have been simply writing down notes as they came into his head, the notebook entry notes “a short time later we cuffed the male” after describing the Tasering and the OC spraying. It is clearly setting out the order in which things were said to have happened. It was put to Mr Barling that he wrote that because he knew that the use of the Taser was not reasonably necessary. I accept that that is an available inference. Those notes were written at a time when Mr Barling knew that Mr Curti had died. He himself had been affected by OC spray, and he was described by Sergeant Ansted as wandering around apparently in a daze. He still appeared affected by spray when the notebook was witnessed by Constable Bourke.
	
	
	In order to rely on the note as a lie, demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, I would need to be satisfied that the lie was deliberate, that is, that when Mr Barling wrote those words he knew that they were not true. I must also be satisfied that Mr Barling wrote what he wrote because he feared that writing the truth would implicate him in the matter that I am now dealing with. Where there is an alternative explanation for telling a lie I should be cautious not to use a lie as evidence of guilt unless I can reject that alternative explanation. There was no evidence in relation to this. Mr Barling simply denied that it was a lie. However even accepting as I do that what was written was untrue it does seem to me that having regard to Mr Barling’s relative inexperience, and having regard to the training that police officers are provided, that it is only appropriate to use a Taser on a person who is handcuffed in “exigent circumstances”, he may well have feared disciplinary action, whether justified or unjustified. It is possible the note was made in a state of panic. I am not satisfied that I should use it as demonstrating consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Although I can use it as going to his credit, I still need to consider the evidence he has given overall in determining whether I believe what he has said. Generally speaking his evidence appeared to me to be given honestly and I do generally accept it. Ms Dodds submits that I would find that the number of times he used his Taser, and the short period of time between each use, shows that he did not make a proper assessment of the situation before he used the Taser on subsequent occasions. It is submitted that he did not act in accordance with the SOPs.
	
	
	In that respect, I note that when Mr Barling began using his Taser on Mr Curti, Mr Edmondson was not beside him based on the evidence of the times. He came a very short time later. Mr Curti was being described to police radio as “really violent” at the time. Mr Barling turned the safety of the Taser back on after each use, suggesting that he gave consideration of some sort to turning it back on and using it again, even if very quickly.
	



	
	Mr Barling had been a general duties officer at the time for eight months. Considering the situation as he perceived it to be at the time, in particular taking into account that he had personally tackled Mr Curti to the ground further up Pitt St but with the assistance of three other officers had been unable to keep him there, he had observed the lack of success of other police officers in restraining him during the chase, that he had managed to handcuff him but there was still a handcuff loose and potentially dangerous, and that Mr Curti was continuing to resist and struggle after a period of calm even though other officers were trying to physically restrain him, I accept that he believed it was reasonably necessary to use his Taser to drive stun Mr Curti in an attempt for police to maintain control of him. I make that finding keeping in mind the admonition of superior courts not to make minute retrospective criticisms of what officers have done in a volatile situation.
	
	
	The training given to police officers at that time, in my view, left open to Mr Barling the possibility that it could be reasonably necessary to Taser a person who was on the ground and handcuffed.
	
	
	In the absence of evidence from any prosecution witness as to what should have been done by him in this situation, I do not consider the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that what he did was not reasonably necessary in the circumstances as he perceived them at the time.
	
	
	I find Mr Barling not guilty.

2765576,"Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v El Ali, Khoder (No 1) [2014] NSWLC 28","JUDGMENT

Background


	
	These are committal proceedings for the trial of the accused, Khoder El Ali, on a Commonwealth importation offence and a number of State firearm offences concerning the unlawful importation and sale of firearms and firearm parts (collectively, “the firearms”). The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“CDPP”) prosecutes the Commonwealth offence in its own right and purportedly carries on the prosecution of the State offences on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“NSWDPP”).
	
	
	The accused has been charged along with two others, Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros. Generally, all three are charged with the importation, possession and subsequent supply of some 140 Glock pistols in 2011 and 2012 (by the unlawful importation of the Glock pistols in parts) through the Sylvania Waters Post Office and adjacent business addresses. Both Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros took part in a contested committal with the calling of a witness Patrick Fuge (the seller and exporter of the Glock pistols and its parts) from Germany under s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The accused did not take part in the s 91 hearing. Both Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros are currently before the District Court awaiting sentence.
	
	
	The case against the accused is that he arranged for the purchase, delivery and ultimate importation into NSW, Australia, of the firearms, firearm parts and firearm magazines. The accused used various false identities for the unlawful importation from suppliers in Germany (19 importations via Fuge) and the USA (two importations) by having the firearms broken down into parts for export into Australia. All 21 importations into Australia were successful, totaling 140 Glock pistols. Only eight Glock pistols have been recovered to the Court’s knowledge. One hundred and forty Glock pistol magazines and eight magazine speed loaders were seized on 10 February 2011, which then became the subject of a controlled delivery. Ahmed Karnib arranged for the transport of the firearms into Sydney and either took delivery and possession himself or arranged delivery and possession through Andrew Botros via the Sylvania Waters Post Office.
	
	
	At the close of the CDPP’s case the accused entered a plea of guilty to the Commonwealth importation offence. The Court notes that the entering of that plea of guilty will, by itself, have the consequence of establishing some of the elements of the State firearm offences; at least, the possession of the firearms in NSW once the firearms came into Sydney (some being delivered to an address at Dulwich Hill and the majority delivered to Sylvania Waters).
	
	
	However, the accused submits that the State offences should be dismissed because the CDPP had no power to carry on the proceedings on behalf of the NSWDPP and, as the latter did not appear at the hearing, the accused must be discharged pursuant to s 61(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, subject to the discretion in subs (1)(b) to adjourn the proceedings to allow the NSWDPP to appear.
	
	
	Alternatively, the accused submits that the State Court Attendances Notices (“CANs”) should be quashed as either “embarrassing” as averred, or on grounds that the elements of the offences are not proven.
	
	
	The accused’s latter submission is to be considered and properly only determined at this stage under s 62(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act; namely, the legal test “…whether the prosecution evidence is capable of satisfying a jury, properly instructed, beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person has committed an indictable offence."" That determination requires the Court to, “...not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case"": R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377; 48 NSWLR 101 at [127]. The CDPP’s case is to be taken at its highest and there is still a case to answer even if the CDPP’s evidence is tenuous, inherently weak or vague: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21 at [47].
	


The CANs


	
	Given the nature of the accused’s contentions that the State CANs should be discharged, it is instructive to set the individual averments in the CANs, and they are:
	



	
	Matter 2014/30842 alleges an offence under s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), shortly described as a “[c]onspiracy to import Tier 2 goods without permission...[b]etween about 27 July 2011 and about 13 March 2012”. The short particulars are, ""[d]id conspire with one or more of Ahmed KARNIB, Andrew BOTROS or divers other person to, without requisite permission, intentionally import prohibited Tier 2 goods, comprising firearms parts and firearms magazines, the importation of which was prohibited under the Customs Act”.
	


On 28 February 2014 the accused pleaded guilty to this charge and awaits committal for sentence pending the resolution of the State offences before the Court. The CAN was laid by Detective Sergeant Fabio Furia, NSW Police Force, State Crime Command-Firearms and Organised Crime, on 26 March 2013.


	
	Matter 2012/81506 (H47219172) Sequence 2 alleges an offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), described as “[c]onspire to possess more than [three] unregistered firearms including prohibited firearm or pistol…[b]etween about 27 July 2011 and about 13 March 2012 at Sydney, NSW, and elsewhere...Khoder EL ALI did conspire with one or more of Ahmed KARNIB, Andrew BOTROS or a divers other person to possess more than three firearms, at least one of which was a prohibited pistol, in circumstances where the firearms were not registered and none of those persons were authorised by a permit or licence to possess the firearms.” The CAN was laid by Detective Sergeant Fabio Furia, NSW Police Force, State Crime Command-Firearms and Organised Crime, on 13 March 2012.
	
	
	Matter 2012/81506 (H47219172) Sequence 3 alleges an offence under s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act, described as “[u]nlawfully sell firearms three times or more within a 12 month period…[b]etween about 10 November 2011 and 9 November 2012 at Sydney, NSW, and elsewhere. Khoder EL ALI did contravene s 51...on three or more separate [occasions] during the period of 12 months between 10 November 2011 and 9 November 2012 inclusive."" The CAN was laid by Detective Sergeant Fabio Furia, NSW Police Force, State Crime Command-Firearms and Organised Crime, on 13 March 2012.
	
	
	Matter 2012/81506 (H47219172) Sequence 4 alleges an offence under s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), described as “[p]articipate in criminal group, contribute to criminal activity…between 12:01 am on 27 [July] 2011 and 11:05 am on 13 [March] [20]12 at Wentworth Point. Did knowingly participate in a criminal group knowing that his participation contributed to the occurrence of a criminal activity, to wit, the possession of a firearm or firearms parts by a person not authorised to do so by licence or permit.” The CAN was laid by Detective Sergeant Fabio Furia, NSW Police Force, State Crime Command-Firearms and Organised Crime, on 13 March 2012.
	
	
	In Matter 2012/81507 (H47145911) the accused is also charged with fifteen offences under s 70 of the Firearms Act; namely, that in connection with applications made under the Firearms Act or the Regulations thereunder he did provide information that he knew to be false or misleading in a material particular. These offences are Table 2 offences under the Criminal Procedure Act and the NSWDPP has elected to deal with these offences on indictment although they have not formed part of the current hearing with the other Commonwealth and State offences. Those CANs were laid by Detective Gilbere Gassin, NSW Police Force, State Crime Command-Firearms and Organised Crime, on 13 March 2012.
	



	
	Although the CANs for the State offences were laid by officers of the NSW Police Force on the available evidence, the court is satisfied that they were taken over by the NSWDPP by 8 May 2012 (the NSWDPP’s first appearance), or by no later than 16 May 2012. It appears no notice in writing was sent to the Registrar of Central Local Court or the Court itself, as there is no written notice on the Court’s papers that the NSWDPP had taken over the State charges under ss 10(1)(a) or (b) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) (""DPP Act""). However, s 10(4) of the DPP Act provides that a failure to to give such notice does not affect the NSWDPP’s functions in relation to the matter: Price v Ferris (1994) 34 NSWLR 704 at 708F.
	
	
	Having taken over all of the State charges under s 9(1)(a) of the DPP Act, the NSWDPP is deemed to be the prosecutor at the exclusion of Detective Sergeant Fabio Furia and Detective Gilbere Gassin: Price v Ferris (supra) at 707D - 709A-E, and 714E.
	
	
	The issue is whether the CDPP had the power to carry on the hearing of the committal proceeding for the State charges as argued, in its own right and on behalf of the NSWDPP, by the CDPP. 
	


Did the CDPP have the Power to Prosecute the State Offences?

Chronology


	
	The following chronology assists in determining this issue:
	



	
	The CANs for the State offences first came before Central Local Court on 14 March 2012. It appears, as is the usual case, that a police prosecutor appeared on the first mention. The matter was adjourned to 8 May 2012 for reply to brief service orders.
	
	
	It appears that on 8 May 2012 there were separate appearances for the CDPP and the NSWDPP. The matter was adjourned to 7 July 2012 again for reply, and further brief service orders were made.
	
	
	On 7 July 2012 only a single appearance, seemingly by a NSWDPP officer, was noted on the Court’s papers. The matter was adjourned to 18 September 2012 again for reply, and further brief service orders were made.
	
	
	On 18 September 2012 there were separate appearances for the CDPP and the NSWDPP. The matter was adjourned to 30 October 2012 again for reply, and further brief service orders were made.
	
	
	On 30 October 2012 there were separate appearances for the CDPP and the NSWDPP. The matter was adjourned to 27 November 2012 again for reply, and further brief service orders were made.
	
	
	On 27 November 2012 there were separate appearances for the CDPP and the NSWDPP. The matter was adjourned to 5 February 2013 again for reply, and further brief service orders were made.
	
	
	On 5 February 2013 there was an appearance by a CDPP officer but no appearance for the NSWDPP. The CDPP in its written submissions, stated that the CDPP officer, Anthony Powell, a legal practitioner and staff member of the Office of the CDPP appearing as authorised under s 15 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (""CDPP Act"") informed the Court that the, “[CDPP] had taken over the conduct of the prosecution of the existing State offences from the NSWDPP and that the CDPP elected to prosecute the existing State offences on indictment"": MFI “F”.
	


While the Court does not have a transcript of those proceedings, nor does its own written record confirm that statement by the CDPP, it will proceed on the basis that the Court was so informed. The accused has not taken issue with this statement and the record of correspondence between the CDPP and NSWDPP (Ex 16, see below) is consistent with that statement.


	
	After 5 February 2013 the CDPP exclusively appeared, prosecuting both the Commonwealth and State offences, and appearing at the further mentions on 6 March 2013, 27 March 2013, 1 May 2013, 29 May 2013, 12 June 2013 and 22 July 2013 when further brief service orders being made.
	
	
	On 22 July 2013, the hearing date of the committal proceedings which involved the calling of a number of witnesses for examination by the two other co-accused pursuant to s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act, was fixed to be held from 9 to 13 December 2013. The accused did not take part in the making of the orders for the examination of the witnesses pursuant to s 91, however did take part in argument as to the admissibility of the paper committal evidence. The contested committal proceedings were heard on 9, 11 and 13 December 2013. The matter was adjourned to 28 February 2014 for submissions on whether the accused should be committed for trial. A timetable for written submissions was fixed.
	
	
	The issue of the CDPP’s right to appear for the NSWDPP was first raised in the accused’s written submissions dated 26 February 2014. Unfortunately, that issue has since been delayed with the need to issue notices to the Attorneys-General under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (""s 78B Notices"") and the unavailability of the Court due to leave.
	


Correspondence of the CDPP and NSWDPP to “Carry On” the State Offences


	
	Formal discussions between the Director of the NSWDPP (""State Director"") and the Director of the CDPP  (""Commonwealth Director"") (together, ""the Directors"") began on 16 May 2012 when the NSWDPP wrote a letter to the CDPP. In the redacted copy of that letter (Ex 16) the NSWDPP stated, in part:
	


“For the following, I am of the view that it would be appropriate for your Office to have conduct of the prosecution of all charges, Commonwealth and State, against each of the defendants...I would be grateful for your views on the proposed course at your earliest convenience. If you agree to your Office conducting the prosecution of all charges, pursuant to the Instrument of Delegation signed on 22 September 2011, I consent to your Office conducting the prosecution of the defendants for the NSW charges and I elect for the charges under s 70 of the Firearms Act against EL ALI being dealt with on indictment.”


	
	It seems that further correspondence then ensued between the two Directors because on 24 January 2013 the CDPP wrote to the NSWDPP and, after referring to a series of correspondence, stated, in part: 
	


“…and your request that this Office take over the prosecution of the State offences…it has been decided to accede to your request.”


	
	Since this issue arose, written submissions exchanged as well as the issue of the s 78B Notices (no Attorney-General has determined to intervene to the present), the NSWDPP wrote to the CDPP on 1 May 2014 and stated, in part:
	


“In particular, I agree with your reliance on [ss 6(1)(m), (n) and 17 of the CDPP Act and s 33 of the DPP Act] and the related instruments...I also note that s 6(2)(b) of the [CDPP Act] provides for the Director to exercise such other functions as are prescribed. For the purpose of this provision, cl 3(1)(a) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1984 (Cth) allows the Commonwealth Director to carry on committal proceedings instituted by a State officer...In the event that it is necessary to rely on any further or alternative basis for the Commonwealth Director’s authority to conduct these proceedings…I authorise the Commonwealth Director to appear as my agent with respect to the [NSW] charges, being sequences 2 to 4, and to continue to carry on the committal proceedings with respect to those charges"". (This letter now forms part of Ex 16).

The Relevant CDPP Instruments of Appointment/Consent to Prosecute under State Law and NSWDPP Instrument of Delegation and Order


	
	The Directors rely upon the five instruments in Ex 16 issued respectively under their enabling Acts which they submit confer power on the CDPP to prosecute the State offences.
	
	
	For present purposes, at the time of the commencement of, and continuation of, the committal proceedings for the State offences, the following various instruments establish the appointment of Robert James Bromwich SC as the Commonwealth Director:
	



	
	consent by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, pursuant to ss 6(1)(m) and 17 of the CDPP Act for Robert Bromwich SC and for the persons specified in the relevant Schedules, being staff members of the CDPP, including Paul Shaw, to “...holding an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of [NSW]”; and
	
	
	two Instruments of Delegation and Order under s 33(1)(c) of the DPP Act by the NSWDPP delegating to Robert Bromwich SC and staff members of the CDPP, including Paul Shaw, in part:
	


“2. Delegate to the persons listed in the Schedule, who have been approved by the Attorney General for the State of [NSW], my functions and responsibilities; a) To institute and conduct committal proceedings for indictable offences…”

The two delegations cover the period 8 February 2013 to 12 June 2013 and 12 June 2013 to date. The Instrument of 8 February 2013 revoked:

“1. All delegations issued to members of the [CDPP]…”

Those prior Instruments have not been tendered (the accused has raised no issue in this regard) and ostensibly they were in similar terms. In the absence of evidence to the contrary the Court will proceed on the basis of presumptive regularity that the prior delegations were in similar terms.


	
	The CDPP relies upon both the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s consent and the NSWDPP’s delegation to Paul Shaw, a staff member of the CDPP, as it was he who made the decision to agree to the NSWDPP’s consent to carry on the committal proceedings for the State offences.
	


Consideration

The Parties’ Contentions


	
	The thrust of the accused’s objection to the CDPP’s power to appear and prosecute the committal proceedings for the State offences is that he had no power to “take over” the State offences under s 9(5)(a) of the CDPP Act: see MFI “E”. Consequently, the announcement in Court on 5 February 2013 by the CDPP officer, Anthony Powell, that the “CDPP had taken over the conduct of the prosecution of the existing State offences"", presumably under s 14(1)(a)(i) of the CDPP Act, was without power as the CDPP Act confers no power to “take over” State offences. From the Court’s analysis of the CDPP Act so much may not be disputed (the CDPP does not submit otherwise). In those circumstances, the accused submits that only the NSWDPP has the power to institute or carry on the committal proceedings for the State offences. The CDPP could only do so in the right of the State of NSW as the person instituting the proceedings, which has not occurred: see R v Fukusato [2002] QCA 20; [2003] 1 Qd R 272 per McMurdo P at [48] and Thomas JA at [47].
	
	
	The CDPP responds that it did not in fact take over (presumably a poor choice of words) the State charges, “but rather to have assumed the responsibility, in response to a request from the [NSWDPP]…to carry on the conduct of the prosecution of the committal proceedings for offences against the laws of the State of [NSW]”: see MFI “F”.
	
	
	The CDPP further responds it had the right to “carry on” the proceedings for the State offences under s 17 of the CDPP Act (s 6(1)(m) is in identical terms, save for the recipient of consent), “[w]here a [staff] member of the [CDPP], with the consent of the Attorney-General, holds an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of a State, the member may institute and carry on, in accordance with the terms of the appointment, prosecutions for such offences” and, pursuant to s 6(1)(n), “ ...to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the functions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (mb) and in subs (2)”. Relying upon the Instruments in Ex 16 the CDPP submits that “the proceedings have been carried on by the staff members of the [CDPP] on behalf of the [Commonwealth Director].”: see MFI “F”.
	
	
	The accused responds that the function in ss 6(1)(m) and 17 to “institute and carry on” is conjunctive and as the CDPP has not instituted the proceedings for the State offences it does not have legislative authority to appear for the NSWDPP.
	
	
	Alternatively, the CDPP also relies upon the incidental power in s 6(1)(n) of the CDPP Act, cl 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1984 (Cth) (""the Regulation"") and the purported authorisation by the NSWDPP in the letter of 1 May 2014 (part Ex 16) for the CDPP to “appear as my agent with respect to the [NSW] charges, being sequences 2-4, and to continue to carry on the committal proceedings with respect to those charges.”
	


The State Charges were not “Taken Over”


	
	The CDPP’s argument that it did not in fact “take over” the State charges is accepted. In the letter of 24 January 2013, the CDPP in consenting to the NSWDPP’s request stated, in part, “…and your request that this Office take over the prosecution of the State offences…it has been decided to accede to your request.” The NSWDPP’s request of 16 May 2012 was in fact “to have conduct…..to your Office conducting…I consent to your Office conducting..” Viewed in the context of the NSWDPP’s request, nowhere is it said that the CDPP “take over"" the State charges; what the CDPP did was to “…accede to your request"" which was to conduct the proceedings for the State charges, not “take over.”
	


The CDPP had the Power to “Carry On” the State Charges under ss 6(1)(m) and 17 of the CDPP Act


	
	As the CDPP is entirely a creature of statute he may only exercise such powers as are conferred upon him by his enabling statute or by any other statute or legislative instrument: see Byrnes v R [1999] HCA 38; 199 CLR 1 where at [86] Kirby J said:
	


“The [CDPP] holds an office created by legislation. He has no more powers than those enjoyed under: (1) the [CDPP Act]; (2) any other law of the Commonwealth conferring powers upon him; (3) any law of a state or territory which with the authority of the Federal Parliament confers such powers, or (4) the incidents and implications necessarily read into the foregoing, express grants of power. In this respect, the [CDPP] does not succeed to those prerogative powers of the Crown which have devolved by history and law to an Attorney-General. His powers must be expressly stated, or necessarily implied, in a valid grant of power given by, or under the authority of, the Parliament.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	The competency of the CDPP to carry on these proceedings does raise a constitutional issue if the DPP Act sought to confer a power which was not enjoyed under the CDPP Act: Bond v R [2000] HCA 13; 201 CLR 213 at [29] and [31]. In Bond v R (supra), the High Court unanimously said of s 17 of the CDPP Act at [29], that:
	


“The power which a State may give to a staff member of the [CDPP] in accordance with s 17 is limited to a power to institute and carry on a prosecution for offences against a law of the State. A State law which purports to give wider powers is, to that extent, inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth (s 17 of the [CDPP Act]), and invalid. Members of the staff of the [CDPP] had no power to institute an appeal against the sentence imposed on the appellant.”


	
	The words of Justice Fullagar in Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5; 83 CLR 1 in a constitutional context are apt in the circumstances of this matter. At 258, His Honour stated, “[i]t may be thought that herein lies an exception to an elementary rule of constitutional law which has been expressed metaphorically by saying that a stream cannot rise higher than its source.” Either the right to “carry on” the proceedings for State offences resides within ss 6(1)(m) or 17, or it does not otherwise.
	
	
	The Courts have tended to adopt a literal approach in construing the CDPP’s powers (Gillis v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (1993) 43 FCR 458) as to the power to prosecute on indictment for a Commonwealth offence where the accused had been committed for trial on a State offence but no Commonwealth offence; Byrnes v R (supra) at [52] and [88]; Bond v R (supra) at [29] as to the rights of appeal where the Director otherwise had the authority to prosecute the offences.
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, and not without some significant reservations the Court concludes that it should follow R v Dexter [2002] QCA 540; 136 A Crim R 276 which held that s 6(1)(m) of the CDPP Act does confer power upon the CDPP to carry on proceedings for State charges instituted (here “taken over"" by the NSWDPP but to the same effect: see Price v Ferris (supra)) by a State officer rather than the CDPP.
	
	
	In R v Dexter (supra) the accused had been committed to stand trial for both Commonwealth and State offences. The Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions for QLD subsequently gave consent for an ex officio indictment to be presented for State offences only. An indictment was subsequently signed and presented by Allan MacSporran, a private practice barrister who held a commission on behalf of the Attorney-General for the State of QLD and was authorised to sign and present indictments on behalf of the Crown. The CDPP funded and instructed Allan MacSporran’s appearance at the trial. On an appeal challenging the validity of the indictment, McMurdo P held at [29]:
	


“As the CDPP had the consent of the Commonwealth Attorney-General to hold an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of [QLD] under s 6(1)(m) CDPP Act (and held a commission to prosecute under s 560(2) Criminal Code (QLD)) the CDPP's functions included ""to institute and carry on ... prosecutions"" for [QLD]. The term ""carry on"" is not defined in the CDPP Act. The meaning of the phrase in the Macquarie Dictionary is ""to manage; conduct;..."". Although the CDPP did not institute this prosecution on indictment he did, with the consent of the [QLD DPP], carry on the prosecution in preparing the case and briefing and instructing Mr MacSporran. [Section] 6(1)(m) [of the] CDPP Act does not limit the function of the CDPP to the conduct of [QLD] prosecutions which he has also personally instituted (that is, where he has signed and presented the indictment); it also includes the carrying on of prosecutions, which incorporates the preparation and management of a prosecution case.” [Footnotes omitted]

Davies JA dealt with the challenge without needing to consider whether the CDPP had lawful authority to carry on the prosecution as it was irrelevant, simply holding at [62]:

“As appears from what I have said so far, the indictment was signed and presented by Mr. MacSporran, a person appointed by the Governor-in-Council to sign, present and prosecute indictments charging offences under the Criminal Code. There is nothing on its face which would lead one to think that it was presented by the...the Commonwealth Director...or by Mr. MacSporran as the servant or agent of the Commonwealth Director.”

Jerrard JA agreed with the orders proposed by both McMurdo P and Davies JA , essentially that Allan McSporran did have the authority to indict the appellant, that the CDPP had not in fact done so and therefore the lawful authority of the CDPP to assist Allan McSporran was irrelevant. However, in relation to McMurdo P’s reasons about the CDPP’s right to “carry on” the trial proceeding, he said at [89]:

“In her learned judgment, the President does consider separately and in detail the merits of the appellant’s complaint that the CDPP had no lawful authority to prosecute him. The President holds that the CDPP certainly conducted (para 25), or carried on (para 29), the appellant’s prosecution by reason of preparing the case, briefing and instructing Mr. MacSporran and the like. I respectfully disagree with that conclusion, but respectfully agree with the President’s carefully expressed reasons for holding that if the CDPP did conduct or carry on the appellant’s prosecution, he did not do so unlawfully. There is nothing I can usefully add to the President’s analysis of each of the appellant’s separate arguments on that matter.”

Should the Court follow R v Dexter?


	
	Both parties submit that the reasons in  R v Dexter (supra) are obiter dicta.
	
	
	The accused submits that only McMurdo P determined that the words in s 6(1)(m) (a fortiori s 17) of the CDPP Act  are disjunctive, and that determination and reasons are not binding on this Court. The accused accepts that while the President’s reasons are persuasive, this matter is distinguishable as it involves the CDPP “taking over” the State CANs which was not considered in R v Dexter (supra). The accused submits (and which the Court accepts the force of; see below), that the President considered the power to “carry on” in s 6(1)(m) in isolation and not from the CDPP Act as a whole. In any event the accused submits that Jerrard JA expressly disagreed with McMurdo P. The accused argues that if the CDPP Act does permit the CDPP to carry on the proceedings, then it leaves the CDPP power to “take over” proceedings with no work to do, as to “carry on” the proceedings is a de facto take over. On that basis, the conclusion can only be that the words are to be read conjunctively.
	
	
	The CDPP responds that the reasons in R v Dexter are highly persuasive and that McMurdo P explicitly held that the words in s 6(1)(m) of the CDPP Act, “institute and carry on”, are disjunctive, that is, that they are separate functions. The CDPP responds that both Davies and Jerrard JJA implicitly recognized that s 6(1)(m) did extend to permitting the CDPP to carry on the proceedings instituted by Allan McSporran and, contrary to the accused’s submission, that Jerrard JA did in fact agree with McMurdo P’s disjunctive interpretation. The CDPP further submits that additional support for McMurdo P’s express comments and Jerram JA’s adoption is that the High Court subsequently refused the appellant special leave to appeal. The CDPP has provided a transcript of the special leave hearing and accepts that part of the argument advanced (and rejected) was that s 6(1)(m) and the CDPP Act as a whole did not contain “a mandate to carry on a State prosecution”: [2004] HCA Trans- 229 per Brett Walker SC for the appellant.
	
	
	This Court considers that McMurdo P and Jerrard JA, in part, did construe that s 6(1)(m) of the CDPP Act is to be read disjunctively. While Jerrard JA disagreed that the CDPP was carrying on the prosecution (implicitly as a matter of fact because it was Allan McSporran doing so) nevertheless agreed with McMurdo P otherwise that s 6(1)(m) does enable the CDPP to carry on proceedings for State offences not instituted by the CDPP. Given the nature of the challenge in R v Dexter (supra) it may be said that the reasons of McMurdo P (with the agreement of Jerram JA in part) are in fact ratio decidendi as that is what the President did determine.
	
	
	The doctrine or principle of precedent (more properly stated as “stare rationibus decidendi”) requires courts to apply the legal principles decided by higher superior courts in the same appellate hierarchy: R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [30]. As the QLD Court of Appeal is not in the appellate hierarchy of the Local Court of NSW the ratio decidendi in R v Dexter (supra) (especially McMurdo P at [29] with Jerrard JA agreeing) is not strictly binding on this Court.
	
	
	However, the High Court has emphasised in a number of decisions that it is the obligation of Australian courts not to depart from an interpretation placed on uniformly or similarly worded legislation unless convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong (and even more so regarding Commonwealth legislation): Wells v Commonwealth [2014] NSWSC 148, citing at [49] Farah Constructions v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 90, in which Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon & Crennan JJ said at [135]:
	


“Intermediate appellate courts and trial judges in Australia should not depart from decisions in intermediate appellate courts in another jurisdiction on the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation or uniform national legislation unless they are convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong. Since there is a common law of Australia rather than of each Australian jurisdiction, the same principle applies in relation to non-statutory law. There has already been an example of a single judge feeling obliged to follow the Court of Appeal despite counsel's submission that he was obliged not to do so.”

In Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485, in considering the construction of uniform national legislation, the High Court said at 492:

“Although the considerations applying are somewhat different from those applying in the case of Commonwealth legislation, uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the Law is a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	As ss 6(1)(m) and 17 of the CDPP Act do not differentiate between proceedings on indictment, committal proceedings or summary prosecutions there is no enabling power, procedural or other basis to distinguish the circumstances in R v Dexter (supra) from the present. In both cases the proceedings are either instituted (Allan McSporran under his Commission from the State and by the presentment of the indictment signed by him) or here “taken over” (by the NSWDPP) by State officers exercising powers and responsibilities under State laws. The CDPP in both cases is doing the same thing, namely carrying on the prosecution by instructing Mr Flood of counsel by a member of the CDPP staff under ss 15(1)(d) and (e) of the CDPP Act. In both cases (here the Ex 16 Consent) the CDPP held the relevant statutory consent of the Commonwealth Attorney-General as well as the practical consent of the NSWDPP.
	
	
	Strictly speaking s 6(1)(m) of the CDPP Act does not require the consent of the State nor is there anything in the DPP Act that requires that consent to be given (even if it validly could). However, as the NSWDPP was the prosecutor (in the sense of being a party) and the CDPP had no power to take over the committal proceedings for the State charges, the NSWDPP’s consent was effectively required to “carry on” the proceedings.
	
	
	While R v Dexter (supra) may be distinguished on the basis that Allan McSporran did in fact appear during the trial proceedings while here the NSWDPP (or a State representative on his behalf) did not appear at all, that is not a distinction of any materiality given the ratio of R v Dexter (supra). If s 6(1)(m) (and a fortiori s 17) of the CDPP Act enables the CDPP to carry on proceedings for State offences not instituted by the CDPP, then it should not matter whether or not there is a State representative in court either appearing or instructing, as in this case, Mr Flood.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the misgivings of this Court (see below) as to the correctness of R v Dexter (supra) it cannot conclude that it is plainly wrong and should not be followed. That the High Court was not prepared to grant special leave is a further reason, although it could not be said that the High Court agreed with all that was said in R v Dexter (supra), given that Davies and Jerrard JJA both held that it was Allan McSporran and not the CDPP who was prosecuting the appellant.
	


The Specific Functions and Powers of the CDPP Act to “Carry On” Proceedings - The Misgivings  


	
	Of consequence to this Court is that in R v Dexter (supra) there was no textual analysis of the CDPP Act as whole, and more particularly ss 6 and 9 which sets outs the functions and powers of the CDPP, to glean the nature of the meaning of the words “institute and carry on”.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(m) of the CDPP Act provides:
	


""6 Functions of the Director

(1)  The functions of the Director are:

...

(m) where the Director, with the consent of the Attorney-General, holds an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of a State-to institute and carry on, in accordance with the terms of the appointment, prosecutions for such offences”

Section 17 provides:

“17 States may give members of staff of Office prosecution and appeal functions relating to State offences

(1) Where a member of the staff of the Office, with the consent of the Attorney-General, holds an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of a State, the member may institute and carry on, in accordance with the terms of the appointment, prosecutions for such offences.

(2) If a member of the staff of the Office is authorised by or under a law of a State to institute and carry on appeals arising out of prosecutions of offences against the laws of the State, being prosecutions by the Director as mentioned in paragraph 6(1)(m) or by members of the staff of the Office as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, the first-mentioned staff member may institute and carry on such appeals in accordance with requirements of or under that law.”


	
	The function and power of the CDPP to “carry on” proceedings, express or implied must be found in the text of the CDPP Act as it is entirely a creature of statute: Byrnes v R (supra) and Bond v R (supra). Presently, the power to “carry on” the committal proceedings for the State firearms offences must reside in either the express power under ss 6(1)(m) or 17 the incidental power under s 6(1)(n) attaching to s 6(1)(m). However, the interpretation of those two powers is not to be considered in a vacuum but rather from the text of the CDPP Act as a whole.
	
	
	In so far as the CDPP seems to rely upon the delegations issued by the NSWDPP those delegations must be consistent with ss 6(1)(m) or 17 and not otherwise. As statutory instruments, if they purport to confer greater functions or powers than those enjoyed under the CDPP Act, then those delegations would be invalid: Bond v R (supra) at [29].
	
	
	In Lacey v Attorney General (Qld) [2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573 at [43] - [44], the High court said of the interpretative content of a statutory provision:
	


""The approach to construction

43.   The objective of statutory construction was defined in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority as giving to the words of a statutory provision the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. An example of a canon of construction directed to that objective and given in Project Blue Sky is ""the presumption that, in the absence of unmistakable and unambiguous language, the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms or immunities"". That is frequently called the principle of legality. The legislative intention there referred to is not an objective collective mental state. Such a state is a fiction which serves no useful purpose. Ascertainment of legislative intention is asserted as a statement of compliance with the rules of construction, common law and statutory, which have been applied to reach the preferred results and which are known to parliamentary drafters and the courts. As this Court said recently in Zheng v Cai:

""It has been said that to attribute an intention to the legislature is to apply something of a fiction. However, what is involved here is not the attribution of a collective mental state to legislators. That would be a misleading use of metaphor. Rather, judicial findings as to legislative intention are an expression of the constitutional relationship between the arms of government with respect to the making, interpretation and application of laws. As explained in NAAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the preferred construction by the court of the statute in question is reached by the application of rules of interpretation accepted by all arms of government in the system of representative democracy.""

44.   The application of the rules will properly involve the identification of a statutory purpose, which may appear from an express statement in the relevant statute, by inference from its terms and by appropriate reference to extrinsic materials. The purpose of a statute is not something which exists outside the statute. It resides in its text and structure, albeit it may be identified by reference to common law and statutory rules of construction.” [Footnotes omitted.]


	
	On a close scrutiny of the CDPP Act it is readily apparent that while it confers very wide ranging powers each of those powers is circumscribed by limited circumstances by and in which they may be exercised. In each case the specific power to only “carry on” proceedings is limited to a strictly Commonwealth offence or Commonwealth proceeding. In some cases the power is enlarged to include “whether or not instituted by the Director”. For instance:
	



	
	Section 6(1)(b) “to carry on” prosecutions on indictment for Commonwealth offences (save for some exceptions) “whether or not instituted by the Director”.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(baa) at the request of the Attorney-General “to carry on” proceedings on indictment instituted by the Attorney-General.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(e) “to carry on” commitment proceedings and summary proceedings for Commonwealth offences “whether or not instituted by the Director”.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(fa)(i) and (ii) in respect of “relevant matters” to take civil proceedings “on behalf of and in the name of the Commonwealth and authorities of the Commonwealth” or “to co-ordinate or supervise” those proceedings. The latter is akin to carrying on those proceedings.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(g) in respect of where there is an instrument by the Attorney-General specifying a class of matters under ss 6(3) to 6(1)(g)(i) “to institute proceedings”; or (it follows from the disjunctive at the end of (ii) but also s 6(6) “the institution or carrying on” of those proceedings) to (ii) “to carry on proceedings” (whether or not instituted by the Director); “or” (iii) “to co-ordinate or supervise the institution or carrying on of proceedings” for the recovery of pecuniary penalties under the law of the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(h) in respect of where there is an instrument by the Attorney-General specifying “relevant matters” under s 6(3) to take civil proceedings “on behalf of and in the name of the Commonwealth and authorities of the Commonwealth” or “to co-ordinate or supervise” those proceedings. The latter is akin to carrying on those proceedings.
	
	
	Section 6(1)(ma) where the Director has the consent of the Attorney-General “to institute and carry on” appeals for State offences prosecuted by the Director under s 6(1)(m) of ODPP members under s 17(1).
	
	
	Section 6(1)(mb) for the purpose of enforcing orders under Chapter 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to (i) “to institute proceedings”; “or” (ii) “to carry on proceedings” (whether or not instituted by the Director); “or” “(iii) “to co-ordinate or supervise the institution or carrying on of proceedings”.
	
	
	Section 6(5) where the Director is authorised to consent to prosecutions against the laws of the Commonwealth and consents to a prosecution the prosecution may be “instituted and carried on without the consent of any person.”
	



	
	It is instructive to note that the functions to “institute” indictable, commital or summary proceedings or prosecutions in ss 6(1)(a), (c) and (e) of the CDPP Act are further enlarged by a separate and distinct function to “carry on” on those very proceedings or prosecutions “whether or not instituted by the Director”. Similar observations may also be made of the functions referred to in s 6(1)(baa) and (ba), those concerning civil and pecuniary order proceedings in s 6(1)(g) and (mb)(ii) as well as those powers to “co-ordinate or supervise” proceedings under s 6(1)(fa)(ii), (g)(iii), (h)(ii) and (mb)(iii). No specific separate and additional power to “carry on” a prosecution under s 6(1)(m) (or the related ODPP member power under s 17) or an appeal under s 6(1)(ma) is made.
	
	
	It is striking that for Commonwealth prosecutions and civil proceedings there is a specific power to do so but for State offences and State appeals there is no such express power. The canon of statutory construction expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusion alterus (the express reference to one matter indicates that other matters are excluded) potentially has some force for the function where and when the CDPP may “carry on” a proceeding simpliciter: see generally Emeritus Professor Dennis C Pearce AO, FAAL and Adjunct Professor Robert Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, (8th ed 2014) at 4.33 - 4.35. While the High Court has repeatedly said that the maxim “must always be applied with care” (Houssein v Dept of Industrial Relations and Technology [1982] HCA 2; 148 CLR 88 at 94) the maxim here appears to have much force in the present statutory text given the selective conferral of the function to “carry on” proceedings instituted by others but not for State proceedings and State appeals.
	
	
	For instance, where the Director has not taken over committal or summary proceedings for Commonwealth offences but has been “carrying on” those proceedings the Director is empowered under s 9(5) of the CDPP Act to decline to carry on those proceedings. Again, similar observations may be made concerning the CDPP’s appeal powers under ss 9(8A) and (8B) for Commonwealth summary offences, whether or not carried on by the CDPP. However, it is telling that there is no such power in the CDPP Act (it can only exist there) where the Director or CDPP staff member are only carrying on the State offence proceedings as he asserts. Surely, it could not have been the intention of the Commonwealth Parliament that the CDPP would, in respect of State offence proceedings, whether or not instituted by the NSWDPP, be no more than a servant of the prosecutor party to the proceedings. As ss 6(1)(m) and 17 refer to State offences only and with no limitation as to whom instituted those proceedings (nor do the Commonwealth-Attorney's Consent in Ex 16 contain any limitation, as all they say is “CONSENT….to prosecute offences against the laws of each and every State.”) the CDPP could in fact carry on proceedings instituted by a private person. It is, of course not unknown for private persons to institute committal proceedings for trial.
	
	
	There are real significant public policy considerations that suggest that that was not the intention of the Commonwealth Parliament and that the s 6(1)(m) (and s 17) power should be read in the conjunctive to make it clear that the sole responsibility and authority for the prosecution of the State offence (and for that matter the s 6(1)(ma) appeal power) should solely rest with a single Director to the exclusion of all others, including the NSWDPP. That is not to say that the Directors would not consult each other. However, the manifest purpose for the establishment of DPP, Commonwealth or State, was, to enshrine independence in the decision making process of the criminal justice process: see Price v Ferris (supra). In Price v Ferris (supra) the NSWDPP had taken over proceedings in the Local Court which had been laid by information by an Inspector of Police. The magistrate dismissed the information. An appeal was then lodged by Inspector Price. In dismissing the appeal, because the appeal was lodged under a mistake of identity and not name, Kirby P. had this to say at 708G - 709A:
	


“The appearance of total impartiality in prosecutorial decisions is far from theoretical. It is designed to achieve the very practical object of faith in the manifest integrity of the process. This is not so much to exclude people like Inspector Price from having a part after the DPP has “taken over” his proceedings. It is to uphold the office of the DPP and to assert, after the “take over”, that the decisions are manifestly the DPP's and the DPP's alone.”

Meagher JA identified the public policy considerations that a construction of the NSWDPP “take over” provision was to extinguish the rights of the earlier informant when he said at 714C - E:

""For Kirby P, to “take over” a matter involves not only prosecuting the matter but doing so in one's own name; for Priestley JA it involves no more than, as it were, an equitable assignment of the matter, so that the matter remains in the name of the original informant but is conducted by the Director. The problem is to determine which of these two views parliament intended, a more than usually esoteric task in cases such as the present where one can be reasonably certain that the problem would not have occurred to parliament. However, despite the logical force of Priestley JA's analysis, I am inclined to think the learned President is correct. If Priestley JA's view were correct, after a “take over” had taken place the original informant might wish to take some course which was opposed by the Director, in which case the Director would presumably have to obtain an injunction against the informant, a procedural complexity which I do not think would have commended itself to our Patres Conscripts, had they thought about what they were doing. I therefore agree with Kirby P, and with McInerney J.”


	
	Of course, if the CDPP or s 17 member did in fact “institute” these proceedings, then as a party they would have the undoubted right to withdraw the CANs. That lends considerable support to a conjunctive interpretation. The conjunctive construction is further supported in the context of indictable trial proceedings as it is the signing, filing and presentment of the indictment that commences the proceedings: see R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 223 ALR 580, following R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 at 367. The words “carry on” then have some context in that the function in ss 6(1)(m) and 17 is not only to “institute” proceedings by the finding, signing, filing and presentment of the indictment (both functions delegated by the NSWDPP in the Instrument of Delegation and Order) but also to “carry on” the proceedings and conduct the prosecution. As ss 6(1)(m) and 17 do not differentiate between summary, indictable offences dealt with summarily or proceedings on indictment there is basis to distinguish the nature of the proceedings.
	
	
	It is also instructive that the appeal function for State offences in s 6(1)(ma) was inserted to overcome the High Court decisions in Byrnes v R (supra) and Bond v R (supra) where there had been a lack of power to lodge an appeal where the CDPP had been the prosecutor party. The function to “institute and carry on” is in identical terms to ss 6(1)(m) and 17. It would be curious to say the least that the Commonwealth Parliament in intending to cure the Byrnes v R (supra) and Bond v R (supra) deficiency was in fact at the same time intending to add a function to “carry on” an appeal, where the substantive proceedings had not been “instituted” by the CDPP.
	
	
	Finally the CDPP has submitted that a disjunctive interpretation favours the notion of co-operative federalism –it avoids unnecessary duplication and use of public resources; oppressive prosecution by separate proceedings or double punishment and minimises the possibility of inconsistent verdicts. The Court unreservedly accepts that submission but that notion cannot confer an absent function or power. The High Court decisions in Byrnes v R (supra) and Bond v R (supra) easily dispose of that argument.
	
	
	In any event those difficulties and the CDPP’s right to prosecute these offences could easily be resolved by either the CDPP or more likely an authorised member of the CDPP staff filing fresh CAN’s in identical terms. The earlier CANs could then have been withdrawn. That would be an administrative step easily accomplished. The Commonwealth Director or CDPP member would then have the right to carry on the proceedings as he or the member would have instituted the proceedings within the meaning of ss 6(1)(m) or 17 of the CDPP Act. Any earlier brief service orders would then satisfy any requirements for the fresh CANs.
	


The Incidental Power in s 6(1)(n), Clause 3 and the “Agency”

The incidental power in s 6(1)(n) of the CDPP Act


	
	Section 6(1)(n) of the CDPP Act provides:
	


""6 Functions of Director

(1)  The functions of the Director are:

....

(n) to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the functions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (mb) and in subsection (2).”


	
	In Grofam Pty Ltd and Others v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Others (1993) 117 ALR 669 at 673 - 674, Northrop, Ryan and Beazley JJ said of the incidental power in the CDPP Act:
	


""The fact that a provision may, upon its proper construction, be categorised as a power notwithstanding that it is not labelled as such, was recognised in Edelsten v Health Insurance Commission (1990) 27 FCR 56 at 62-3; 96 ALR 673 at 677 where Northrop and Lockhart JJ described the distinction between functions and powers in these terms:

The distinction between the functions and powers of an administrative body is between functions or purposes or activities of an administrative body on the one hand and the powers conferred upon it to perform or execute those functions, purposes or activities on the other. This is the primary sense in which the words are understood. The types of statutory contexts in which the expressions ``functions'’ and ``powers'’ of such bodies appear differ considerably. Sometimes the two expressions are treated interchangeably or with blurred dividing lines; whilst some statutory definitions of ``functions'’ provide that ``functions includes powers and duties'’.

There is force in the respondents’ submission as to the categorisation of s 6(1)(n). In our opinion the ``incidental'’ provision in s 6(1)(n) is not a ``function'’ in the primary sense in which that word is used, despite the apparent separation between ``functions'’ and ``powers'’ in ss 6 and 9 of the Act. If a statutory provision specifies the administrative function or purpose or activity to be undertaken or performed, it is likely, if not essential, for that function to have an independent operation, even though it may be related to other functions. Section 6(1)(n) could not have any independent operation of that kind. It is purely incidental. Further, its language is the language of permission or of enabling things to be done or activities to be performed. In other words, it is the language of a power and not of a function.""

 At 674 the Court continued:

""In Leon Fink Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Film Commission (1979) 141 CLR 672; 24 ALR 513 Mason J, in dealing with the operation of general and special powers, stated at CLR 678; ALR 518:

It is accepted that when a statute confers both a general power, not subject to limitations and qualifications, and a special power, subject to limitations and qualifications, the general power cannot be exercised to do that which is the subject of the special power. In Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7 Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J said: ``... When the legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must be observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same power.'’

This principle is, however, a principle of statutory construction which must at all times be applied so as to give effect to the intention of the legislature. In Refrigerated Express Lines (A'asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corp (1980) 29 ALR 333, Deane J said at 347:

As a matter of general construction, where there is repugnancy between the general provision of a statute and provisions dealing with a particular subject matter, the latter must prevail and, to the extent of any such repugnancy, the general provisions will be inapplicable to the subject matter of the special provisions. ``The rule is, that wherever there is a particular enactment and a general enactment in the same statute, and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be taken to be operative...'’: per Romilly MR, Pretty v Solly(1859) 26 Beav 606 at 610 ; 53 ER 1032 at 1034. Repugnancy can be present in cases where there is no direct contradiction between the relevant legislative provisions. It is present where it appears, as a matter of construction, that special provisions were intended exhaustively to govern their particular subject matter and where general provisions, if held to be applicable to the particular subject matter, would constitute a departure from that intention by encroaching on that subject matter. A more fundamental example of such repugnancy is where the particular provisions prescribe or encourage conduct which the general provisions would render prima facie, though not irremediably, unlawful or where the particular provisions assume to be lawful conduct which the general provisions would render prima facie unlawful. I have already indicated my view that the latter, more fundamental, example of repugnancy is present in the instant matter. I consider that the former example of repugnancy is likewise present.

See also Saraswati v R (1991) 172 CLR 1 at 22; 100 ALR 193.""


	
	Given the express conferral of powers to “carry on” proceedings which the Court has identified the incidental power could not supplant the right to carry on the proceedings for the State offences. Either, that function falls within s 17 (or s 6(1)(m)) of the CDPP Act, or not at all. That is not to say that the incidental power serves no function in the current circumstances. For instance, it would enable the CDPP to appear on behalf of the NSWDPP in the early procedural appearances as those charges were inextricably linked with the Commonwealth importation offence which the CDPP had undoubted power to carry on while it was determined who would ultimately prosecute the CANs, Commonwealth or State.
	


Clause 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 


	
	Clause 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations provides, in part:
	


“3 Other functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions

(1) For the purposes of paragraph 6(2)(b) of the Act, the other functions of the Director are:

(a) to carry on proceedings instituted by:

(i) an officer of, or a person employed by, the Commonwealth or a body established by an Act or a law of a Territory; or

(ii) a person holding office under an Act or a law of a Territory; or

(iia) a person who performs services for the Australian Crime Commission under an arrangement under subsection 58 (1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002; or

(iib) the Australian Securities Commission;

being proceedings instituted for:

(iii) the commitment of persons for trial in respect of indictable offences against the laws of a State; or

(iv) the summary conviction of persons in respect of offences against the laws of a State

... ”


	
	Plainly, the contention advanced by the NSWDPP in his letter of 1 May 2014 cannot be accepted as the committal proceedings for the State offences were not instituted (or deemed as taken over) by the class of persons enumerated in Regulation 3.
	


The Agency


	
	Again, the request by the NSWDPP for the CDPP to appear on its behalf as his agent must have an enabling statutory basis in the CDPP Act: Byrnes v R (supra) and Bond v R (supra). If the right to appear and conduct or carry on the hearing (rather than the early interlocutory mentions) of the State offences cannot be found in ss 6(1)(m), (n) or 17 of the CDPP Act then it cannot be given to the CDPP by the NSWDPP by some informal arrangement. This submission is also not accepted.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the foregoing reasons the CDPP did have the lawful authority to “carry on” the committal proceedings for the State firearm offences and in doing so to appear for the NSWDPP. Consequently, the NSWDPP did not fail to appear at the committal hearing.
	
	
	The Court will separately consider and determine the accused’s further contentions.

		26 August 2015",2014-12-15 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2765582,Application by Thomas Hudson Wilson pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1792,"Judgment

1In April 2012 the applicant, Mr Wilson, sought an order under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into his conviction in 1996 of having maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm, with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Ms Catherine Sommer, when he broke into her home in February 1992. Under s79 of that Act, on considering such an application, the Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into a conviction or sentence, or may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
2Such an application gives rise to an administrative, rather than a judicial act (see Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124]). 

3When the application was filed, relevant material had not been obtained by Mr Wilson (see written submissions of April 2012 at [13]). That material was later provided by the Crown, which opposed his application. What lies in issue between the parties must now be considered in light of the voluminous material provided to the Court, which includes the judgment given on appeal, the transcript of the trial, certain exhibits tendered at trial and the sentencing judgment given by Karpin DCJ (see R v Wilson (District Court (NSW), Karpin J, 24 May 1996, unrep). The Court is also entitled to consider the written submissions advanced by the Crown (see s 79(4)). 

4Mr Wilson was given an opportunity to respond to the Crown's submissions, which he did not take up, understandably perhaps given what the materials before the Court reveal.

5The application was made in circumstances where on 2 August 1994, at the committal hearing, the presiding Magistrate declined to commit Mr Wilson for trial. The Crown later preferred an indictment ex-officio against Mr Wilson. At the trial conducted before a jury in 1996, the Crown's case was that a Mr Mitchell had procured Mr Wilson to assault Ms Sommer. 

6As Karpin DCJ later observed in July 1996 on sentencing Mr Wilson, the central issue at trial was the identity of the person who assaulted Ms Sommer. At p 8 of the sentencing remarks it was observed that the verdict which the jury had reached was the only rational verdict available in light of Ms Sommer's evidence. In the result Mr Wilson was sentenced to penal servitude for 18 years, 8 months with a minimum term of 14 years and an additional term of 4 years, 8 months. 

7Mr Wilson's appeal from that conviction and sentence was dismissed in December 1997 (see Regina v Wilson (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Sully, Abadee, Dunford JJ, 18 December 1997, unrep). The case which Mr Wilson advanced did not deal at all with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment.

8In the joint judgment the Court described the evidence on which Mr Wilson was convicted in these terms:
""At about 9.35 p.m. on 19 February 1992, Catherine Jane Sommer, a young woman then aged 24 years, returned home to 50 Carrington Parade, Curl Curl, a house which she was then sharing with her brother and another friend. A short time later she heard her dogs barking outside. She went outside to investigate but was unable to see anything suspicious. She walked back into the house, passing through the kitchen into the dining room and there turned on a light that illuminated the rear courtyard of the premises. She heard banging noises coming from outside the rear of the house and walked from the dining room back to the kitchen. At this point she heard heavy footsteps enter the kitchen and, as she herself reached the door between the dining room and the kitchen, she was confronted by a male intruder. The intruder was wearing a balaclava and he was carrying a pinch bar. The intruder did not say anything to Miss Sommer but he began to assault her with the pinch bar that he was carrying. The first blows fractured Miss Sommer's left cheek bone and caused her to fall backwards. The intruder thereupon took hold of her and threw her into the dining room. She managed to get herself under the dining room table in the hope that that would shelter her from further attack. The intruder pursued her, took hold of her left leg, and struck it with the bar. He aimed further blows at her head and, she, in self defence, put up her left arm to shield her face. Blows were struck to that arm and it was broken. Further blows were struck; and Miss Sommer, with remarkable presence of mind, took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and feigned unconsciousness. Her assailant struck a few further blows to her legs; but shortly thereafter decamped. At no time did the assailant say anything to Miss Sommer.

The attack thus made upon Miss Sommer was unprovoked and vicious. Undisputed medical evidence given at the trial was to the effect that she presented to the treating specialist who first saw her about 2 hours after the attack, with bruising around her left eye and the left side of her nose and across the forehead to the mid-line. She had two small puncture wounds over the medial side of the left arm. She had lacerations to the front of her right leg and lacerations to the front and lateral side of her left leg. There were three skin lesions over the front of the right tibia; and these had the appearance of having been caused separately because there was separate associated bruising to each of them. Subsequent examination established that Miss Sommer had suffered a fracture of the mid-shaft of the left radius and ulna, with some comminution. It was found, similarly, that she had suffered a fracture of the right tibia and fibula, with an associated butterfly fragment. Her left leg was found to have a marked degree of comminution. X-ray examination established that she had suffered, as well, a fracture of the zygoma.

The relevant evidence at trial described, in a detail which need not be repeated here, the course of post-traumatic operative and other treatment undergone by Miss Sommer. It is sufficient to say that she required a number of discrete operations; and that her physical injuries did not finally stabilise until about the end of 1993 or the early part of 1994, at which time she underwent operation for the final removal of various metal insertions in an arm and leg.
The treating specialist was asked about his observations of Miss Sommer's demeanour at the time of his initial examination of her. He replied as follows:

""I think the most striking feature was that she was - appeared extremely calm and collected, and rational. Most people that have been assaulted, in my experience, are fairly stressed. In comparison with a person who's say been injured in a car accident and suffered similar sort of injuries, there's often a lot of emotional trauma with being assaulted and it really struck me that the lady was really quite relaxed and calm. She was quite happy to sit there and lie there and talk about where it hurt and where it didn't hurt and it was at localised areas. She was very helpful.""

Later, and in cross-examination, this witness added that, so far as he was concerned ""there were no problems with her cognitive faculties, as far as her ability to communicate with me, to point to me - to point to things""; and he agreed with the proposition put by cross-examining counsel that: ""given the horrible beating that she got, she seemed calm, cool and collected"".

Miss Sommer gave the investigating police a description of her assailant, and it will be necessary to return presently to the detail of that description. Police investigations into the attack continued throughout 1992, but with little apparent progress. The appellant had been seen in Manly at about 7.50 p.m. on the evening of the assault; and on 27 February 1992 he was interviewed by two police officers. He was questioned in particular about his knowledge of a man named John Michael Mitchell, who was a person with whom Miss Sommer had had a short relationship during 1991. That relationship had broken up acrimoniously; and it was, ultimately, the Crown case at trial that Mitchell had procured the appellant to carry out the assault previously described, as an act of revenge upon the victim. The appellant denied any knowledge of the assault; and said that he did not know Mitchell.
In October and November of 1992, the police were able to establish, by the use of a police under-cover operative, that Mitchell and the appellant were, indeed, well acquainted. It will be necessary to return presently to the detail of these police operations.

In December 1992 the police executed a search warrant upon the appellant's then residence at Campbell Parade, Manly Vale. This search uncovered a number of items that became very important at the trial of the appellant. It will be necessary to discuss later the details of this particular police search, and of the items obtained by means of it.

On 23 January 1993, that is to say about 11 months after the attack upon Miss Sommer, the appellant was arrested and charged with having been the assailant. On 24 February 1993 he was offered, in the presence of his solicitor, an opportunity to take part in a line-up; but he declined to do so. Evidence was given at trial of subsequent approaches by the police to have the appellant take part in a line-up; but all such further approaches proved fruitless.

On 6 July 1993, that is to say about a year and five months after the date of the assault upon her, Miss Sommer took part in a video identification exercise. Once again, it will be necessary to return later to a discussion of the detail of what then occurred; but it is sufficient for the present to say that Miss Sommer made a clear and unqualified identification of the appellant.""

The statutory regime

9Action may only be taken under s 79(1) ""if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"" (s 79(2)). The s 78 procedure does not, however, provide a further avenue of appeal after a convicted person has exhausted their normal appeal rights. 

10The purpose of this aspect of the legislative scheme was discussed by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland [2008] NSWSC 251 at [5]. It is remedial, designed to overcome injustices that sometimes arises in the course of the administration of criminal justice (see Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCA 72; 66 NSWLR 151 at 154 [5], 155 [8]). As Johnson J also discussed at [7] - [8]:
""7 Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19]. 

8 There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].""

11It follows that in order for an application such as this to succeed, there must be material identified which gives rise to the necessary doubt or question which must be established, before an inquiry may be ordered. 

12The Court also has a discretion to refuse to consider or deal with an application in circumstances specified in s 79(3), namely if:
""(a) it appears that the matter:
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or
(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or
(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.""

13In this case it is accordingly relevant to take into account that Mr Wilson unsuccessfully pursued an appeal against his conviction in 1997. 

The matters relied on by Mr Wilson

14Mr Wilson's application rests on two matters: photo identification evidence, which he submits ought not to have gone to the jury and photographs of items located at his house during a search conducted on 10 December 1992, in circumstances where the items themselves had gone missing and photographs of Mr Mitchell. 

15The photo identification evidence was the result of a photo line-up of 20 faces which took place some 16 months after the assault. Mr Wilson's case was that this evidence should not have been permitted to go to the jury.

16The items seized at Mr Wilson's home were a balaclava, a pinch bar and a jumper which Ms Sommer had identified as having seen, or being used, during the assault. Mr Wilson alleged that she had been told prior to identification that the items were found in the home of the person charged with her assault. Those items had gone missing and the Crown led photographs of them.

17It should be noted that while not raised on Mr Wilson's application, it is relevant that the Crown's circumstantial case also relied on an association between Mr Wilson and Ms Sommer's former boyfriend, Mr Mitchell. Mr Wilson had denied any knowledge of Mr Mitchell, despite photographs found in his house depicting him in the company of Mr Mitchell. It also relied on entries in a diary found at Mr Wilson's, as well as evidence called from various witnesses, which it is unnecessary to explore. 

The Crown's position

18The Crown's case was that the Court would refuse to consider the identification evidence relied on by the applicant, because, on appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal had already comprehensively assessed the evidence on which Mr Wilson was convicted at trial. The trial had followed a voir dire in relation to the admissibility of the picture identification evidence on which the Crown's case rested. The photographic evidence and the arguments now advanced by Mr Wilson had also, for the most part, been dealt with on the appeal and were not capable of satisfying the test provided in s 79(1). Accordingly, his application for an inquiry would be refused. 

Mr Wilson's case on appeal

19In order to resolve the issues lying between the parties it is necessary to consider the case Mr Wilson advanced on appeal, where he pressed five grounds, including that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory (ground 5). That ground had to be considered on the basis of an assumption that all of the Crown evidence was correctly admitted and that the jury was correctly charged. The evidence also had to be taken at its highest (see judgment at p8).

20The other four grounds pursued were:


Ground 1 - the learned trial judge failed to warn the jury at all in relation to the dangers of identification evidence of the pinch bar and the balaclava by the witness, Miss Sommer.


Ground 2 - the learned trial judge erred in allowing such evidence of the identification of the pinch bar and balaclava to be used as corroborative evidence of the video identification.


Ground 3 - the learned trial judge erred in allowing such evidence of the finding of the pair of shoes and pair of gloves to be used as corroborative evidence of the video identification.


Ground 4 - the learned trial judge failed to properly warn the jury in relation to the evidence of the identification depicted on the video.

The photo identification evidence 

21On this application Mr Wilson's case was that the photo identification evidence was the ""key determining factor"" in the finding made by the jury and that this had led to a miscarriage of justice. On his case Ms Sommer's identification could not have been reliable, given that she had observed her assailant for only a brief period, in varying conditions of light. In the result, the evidence should have been excluded under s 114, s 115, s 135, s 137 and s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), consistently with the approach discussed by McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [65]:
""In exercising the discretion to exclude positive-identification evidence, the judge must take account of the risk that that evidence will be given greater weight than it deserves and will operate to the prejudice of the accused. In considering that risk, the judge must determine whether the Domican directions that will be given will be likely to overcome the prejudice that might ensue without those directions. If, despite those directions, the risk of prejudice remains and the evidence is weak, the proper exercise of the judicial discretion may require the exclusion of the evidence. Because circumstantial identification evidence is usually no more presumptively prejudicial than other forms of circumstantial evidence, the occasions for its exclusion under the unfairness rule are likely to be fewer than the occasions for excluding positive-identification evidence.""


22It was also submitted:
""32. In the present case, there were numerous problems with the identification evidence, which reduced its probative value. The lapse of time - namely 16 months - was clearly a relevant factor: R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 429-430. The victim's evidence that a man wearing a balaclava, that covered his face from one inch above and below the eyes, made plain the inherent limitations and unreliability of any identification evidence.
33. When the victim was shown an identification video, she was shown 20 faces, many of which did not have green eyes or hazel eyes. Of the 20 faces, only two of the photographs showed a man with no eyebrows (one of whom was the accused). The victim never described her assailant as having no eyebrows prior to identifying the applicant. It is suggested that a lack of eyebrows is a significant and somewhat memorable facial feature, particularly in the context of how much of the assailant's face the victim purported to see.
34. Further, the video depicted a larger face area of each individual shown, rather than pursuant to the description given by the victim to police, which indicated the victim had only seen to the bridge of her assailant's nose. It also depicted persons with and without hair, although this feature was unknown to the victim.
35. As Buddin J said in R v Nguyen [2003] NSWSC 1068, at [14](xxi):
""It is axiomatic that the photographs selected for inclusion in the array should be totally consistent with the original description provided by the witness of the suspect's physical features and any other identifiable features, including the clothing worn by him or her. It therefore follows that very considerable care needs to be taken to ensure not only that the original description itself is accurately recorded, but that the details of it are comprehensive and that they are obtained as close in point of time to the incident, as circumstances permit. ""
36. It should be noted that the identification video and the photographs of the items found at the applicants[sic] home were allowed into evidence, over objection from defence counsel. Further, issue made at trial that the video had two screens depicting two images of different colours, namely the image on the larger monitor depicted the colour skin as tan or yellow and the image on the bottom monitor depicted the skin colour as pinkish white. (Trial @T50)""


23I am satisfied that the matters on which this aspect of Mr Wilson's application rests were fully ventilated both at the trial and on appeal and that no special facts or circumstances warranting the application being further dealt with have now been established by Mr Wilson.

24Ms Sommer's description of the assailant was referred to at pages 9 -11 of the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment. How the identification evidence came to be videoed was also described. The authenticity and integrity of the videos themselves was not in issue (see at p11-12). The videos were described as follows:
""She is shown entering the room; going through the ordinary civilities as to introductions and the like; and, then, seating herself in front of a video monitor. Twenty images, previously compiled by the police into a video tape, are then screened to the victim. Each photograph in the compilation shows a face, the central area of which, only, is clearly depicted. The screening proceeds uneventfully to the point where such a photograph of the appellant appears on the screen. Miss Sommer at once reacts. She shudders visibly, begins to sob, and, having regained her composure, identifies the person in that particular photograph as the person who attacked her. She is asked, thereafter, to look carefully and patiently at the balance of the photographs in the particular compilation; and she does so without any reaction. She is then shown a second video taped compilation of photographs. They are the same photographs, and in the same sequence, as the photographs first shown to her; but this time the whole head of the subject is shown. The course of the screening is exactly the same on the second occasion as on the first."" (at p 12)

25This evidence made a powerful impression on the Court of Criminal Appeal, which observed it must have made a similar impression on the jury. It concluded at p13 that:
""... the material in the two video tapes was such that the jury was entitled to regard it as powerful evidence confirming the fundamental assertion of the victim, - and the fundamental assertion, also, crucial to the Crown case, - that it had been, indeed, the appellant who had carried out the attack upon her. This was, in our opinion, more so the case if the jury accepted, as, in our opinion, the jury was perfectly entitled to do, that Miss Sommer, whom the jury saw and heard for itself, was an intelligent, responsible, and resourceful young woman whom they were prepared to accept, not only as truthful, - (a matter not in issue at the trial), - but reliable as well.""

26Extensive reference was then made to Ms Sommer's cross-examination as to the reliability of her identification, given the contrasting light in the kitchen and dining room; her concessions as to the strength and clarity of the light; the brief period she had seen the assailant's eyes; how the colour of his eyes had varied in the light, so that she had variously described them to be green or hazel/green; the differences in eye and skin colour depicted at various points of the video recording; what she had later said about the eye colour; that part of the assailant's face had been obscured by shadow; and the colour of the bright red bar, which on the Crown case had been used to assault her, which she had described as being a dark brown colour. 

27The Court of Criminal Appeal observed at p 6 that the only ultimate issue for the jury at the applicant's trial was whether the Crown had proven the identity of the assailant beyond reasonable doubt. 

28It referred to Ms Sommer's extensive cross examination and the questioning designed to discredit her, including questions she was asked as to her and her father asking police as to their ongoing enquiries and whether she had dealt in cannabis. The Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that:
""We do not see anything in this part of the cross-examination, apt to suggest, that the suggested activities of the victim gave rise to some reasonable inference adverse to the reliability of her identification of the appellant.""


29As well as referring to the other evidence led in the Crown's circumstantial case, the Court referred to Mr Wilson's evidence and the unsworn statement which he made to the jury, as well as the evidence called from his solicitor and an expert in optometry, Professor Stephen Dain, who explained how an individual's perception of eye colour can change in different kinds and intensities of electric lighting.

30The Court concluded as to ground 5:
""Proceeding, as we now do, to apply the principles stated in M v The Queen to the facts of the present case as disclosed by the foregoing canvass of the evidence at trial, we acknowledge at once that an evaluation by this Court of any Crown case which is essentially dependent upon identification evidence, is to be carried out with a constant awareness of the dangers inherent in such a case. We accept that, in the present particular case, it is possible to point to particular things said by Miss Sommer in connection with her identification of the appellant, that are plainly incorrect in detail. For example, the suggestion that the person who assaulted her ""may have had dark featured eyebrows"" is, on its face, incorrect, in that the appellant has no eyebrows at all because of a particular skin condition, which he has had since childhood. The submissions put for the appellant seize upon precisely this point, and argue that logically the appellant could not have been the person who carried out the attack.
We think, however, that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premise. For, even granting that the appellant has in fact no eyebrows, it is necessary nevertheless to consider whether the appellant, when viewed in certain lighting conditions, might give momentarily the impression of having dark or darkish eyebrows. The appellant was not present in Court on 7 November, the first day of the hearing of the appeal; but he was present in Court throughout the second day of the hearing on 21 November, and we had a good opportunity of seeing him for ourselves. We were struck by the fact that, looked at from certain angles, the appellant's face was indeed shadowed in such a fashion as to suggest, albeit briefly, that he did in fact have such eyebrows.
Quite apart from that matter, we were struck not only by the physical appearance of the appellant which, in our opinion, accorded closely with the appearance described by the victim. We were struck, also and particularly, by the appellant's eyes and their immediate facial surrounds. The appellant's eyes and their facial setting are, in our opinion, very distinctive. It is true that Miss Sommer's assailant was wearing a balaclava, but it was a balaclava which left exposed the central area of the assailant's face. The victim's view of that area of her assailant's face made a searing impression upon her, and that impression under-pins her identification of the appellant. We think that the descriptions given by the victim of her assailant do not contain inconsistencies of such a kind as to render suspect her identification so under-pinned.
In making, as we are required by law to do, our own independent assessment of the evidence at trial, we do not overlook other features of that evidence capable of strengthening the inculpation of the appellant in the assault on Miss Sommer. We have particularly in mind the appellant's hand-written diary note for 17 February 1992; and the clear evidence of the appellant's false denial of any knowledge of or acquaintance with the man Mitchell, albeit that the evidence did not establish in a precise and particular way such association at times preceding the date of the assault.
It must have been apparent to the jury at trial that the whole point which the Crown sought to make concerning the association between Mitchell and the appellant, was that the appellant had been procured by Mitchell to assault Miss Sommer. The appellant, when he came to make his unsworn statement, could not credibly have denied any knowledge of the man Mitchell, given the volume of evidence available to the contrary. The appellant chose, however, not to tell the jury why he had denied to the investigating police any knowledge of Mitchell. We think that the jury was entitled to infer that the appellant did not give any such explanation for the reason that any truthful explanation would have been disadvantageous to his case; and it is nowhere apparent that there could have been any such disadvantage deriving from anything other than that his association with Mitchell, if explained truthfully, would tend to support the Crown case that he was indeed the assailant.
As to his hand-written diary entry, the appellant chose to say nothing at all by way of explanation consistent with innocence. We think that the jury was entitled to infer that the reason why the appellant gave no such explanation was because a truthful explanation would have tended to strengthen the Crown case that he was the assailant.
We have come to the conclusion that the principles established by the decision in M v The Queen do not entail, when applied to the given facts of the present case, that the jury at trial ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt as charged of the appellant. We ourselves have no such doubt. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Ground 5 has not been established.""

31As to ground 4, that the trial judge failed to properly warn the jury in relation to the identification depicted in the video, the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the summing up, fairly read, complied with the requirements established in the Queen v Domican [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555; that specific directions under s 165(2) of the Evidence Act could have been sought, but that the directions in fact given, had satisfied the requirements of that section.

32In the result I am well satisfied that despite the observations relied on by Mr Wilson in R v Tugaga (1997) 74 A Crim R 190 at 193-4, that it is always open to a trial judge to withdraw evidence of identification from a jury, if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, on the material on which this aspect of Mr Wilson's application must be determined, it must be concluded that the matters he now raises in relation to the photo identification evidence were fully dealt with both at the trial at which he was convicted, and on appeal from that conviction. 

33The matters now advanced do not raise any special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of the further action sought in relation to his conviction and thus cannot provide a basis for the further inquiry that Mr Wilson now pursues. 

The photographic evidence

34At the trial, over the applicant's objection, the Crown tendered three photographs of items seized from the applicant's home, which had gone missing after the committal hearing, including a balaclava and pinch bar. Mr Wilson had admitted owning those items (p 27 judgment). 

35The submissions advanced by Mr Wilson on this application as to the receipt of this evidence at trial were:
""37. At the trial of the applicant, above objection, the Crown were permitted to tender 3 photographs of items located at the applicants[sic] house during the search conducted on 10 December 1992. (Trial @ T 132) What can be inferred from the transcript is that those photographs depict a balaclava with a single hole, a red pinch bar and possibly a blue woollen jumper. The Crown relied on photographs as the items themselves had gone missing after the Committal.
38. The victim gave evidence that prior to viewing these items in January 1993, she had been informed that an arrest had been made (Committal @ T52) and that the items had been found in the premises of the arrested person: (Comittal@T54).
39. Prior to the identification of these items in January 1993, the victim had described the iron bar as a ""crow bar"" that was ""dark brown"" or ""dark"" in colour: (Trial @ T67) the photograph tendered and identified by the victim as being used in the assault depicted a ""very red pinch bar"".
40. The victim gave evidence at trial, obviously after viewing the red pinch bar at the police station in January 1993, that she believed the bar to be about 16-18 inches in length: (Trial@T27). Of note is that when the police went to search the applicants[sic] house Officer Moran asks the applicant: ""Have you got a pinch bar about one metre in length: ""(Thai @ 131), the inference being that the victim at some point had described the bar as about one metre in length.
41. The victim identifies the balaclava depicted in the photograph as the one worn by the assailant. The photograph depicts a balaclava with a single hole, the fabric of which is unclear from a reading of the transcript at committal. The evidence of Officer Caddy is that he records in the critical incident report that the assailant is ""wearing a black woollen balaclava with holes for eyes and mouth. (Trial @ T155).
42. Given both the time that had elapsed and the circumstances surrounding the identification of these items, this identification evidence should not have been permitted to go to the jury. It was highly unreliable, lacking in probative force and of great prejudice to the accused. At the time of identifying the items the victim is not shown other iron bars, or balaclavas or jumpers and the victim is informed that the items come from the house of the man arrested for the crime. The identification takes place close to 11 months after the offence.
43. There were significant issues with the evidence, not least the fact that it was photographs and not the items themselves being tendered. The photograph of the pinch bar tendered in the trial was a different colour, being bright red, to the dark coloured bar the victim stated she saw. Further, the balaclava appears to have been of an entirely different description - the one found at the defendant's home was described as 'open faced'.
44. In R v Razzak [2004] NSWCCA 62, Levine J stated, at [28]:
""It is as much a matter of common sense, if not logic, as it is a matter of principle, to assert that other evidence, other circumstantial evidence, touching upon the issue of identification, cannot bolster flawed evidence of identification to the point where the flaws are eliminated and a finding can be made that that flawed identification is correct"". Such sentiments were echoed by Kirby J in Festa at [165].""

36Grounds 1 and 2 of Mr Wilson's appeal were directed to this evidence. At p38 of the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment, after referring to the principles discussed in Domican v The Queen, it was observed that the evidence as to the balaclava and pinch bar were not in a real sense identification evidence, but a small category of the Crown's circumstantial case which tended to strengthen the reliability of Ms Sommer's identification of Mr Wilson. 

37As to the tender of the photographs now relied on by Mr Wilson the Court of Criminal Appeal observed:
""For some reason that remains unexplained, the balaclava, the pinch bar, the black gloves and the shoes, which were taken by the police from the appellant's home, were lost between committal and trial. The Crown sought, therefore, to tender in its case at trial a photograph of each of the missing items. The four photographs were admitted over objection and became Exhibit G in the trial. It was not contended at trial, either that the photographs were not authentic or that they showed something other than the items actually taken by the police.
The photographs were tendered during the course of the evidence-in-chief of Miss Sommer. She gave evidence that Det. Sgt. Monk had shown her the items depicted in the four photographs. She said that this had happened sometime after her assault. She then gave the following evidence:
""He handed me enveloped or part-wrapped items and of those items I identified a balaclava being I believe the same one that was used by the attacker on the night. He showed me the bar. As I unpacked it I identified that as being identical to the one being used by the attacker that attacked me on the night. He showed me some black gloves. I couldn't be specific about those gloves. They were black. They looked similar, I couldn't say if they were the same ones, and some sport shoes, some running shoes of which I couldn't identify.""
As to the pinch bar and the balaclava, we have no present need to add to what we have said earlier herein. (at p47-48)"" 

38Ms Sommer was cross-examined for days on her evidence, including in relation to the balaclava and the bar. The circumstances in which Ms Sommer came to be shown and identify the balaclava and pinch bar and the discrepancy in her description of the colour of that bar and what could be seen on the photographs, were all explored with her at length. 

39The Court of Criminal Appeal concluded at p 45, in relation to the various, detailed directions given to the jury about the identification evidence and the balaclava and pinch bar, that:
""First, that no piece of evidence in the Crown case lying outside the direct visual identification by Miss Sommer could be of itself sufficient to convict the appellant; secondly, that such evidence as was to hand concerning the balaclava and the pinch bar might, if accepted by the jury, afford some circumstantial evidence tending to strengthen the reliability of that critical direct and visual identification of the appellant by Miss Sommer; thirdly, that even were the evidence concerning the balaclava and the pinch bar to be accepted, it was necessary nevertheless to bear carefully in mind past demonstrated cases of mistaken identification, and the consequent need to be particularly careful, because of particular considerations pointed out carefully to the jury by the trial Judge, before finally deciding to accept as reliable, and to act upon, the critical direct and visual evidence of identification coming from Miss Sommer. There were, of course, the additional considerations that the appellant, when first questioned about his ownership of a balaclava or a pinch bar, had denied that he owned either; when in fact he owned one of each; and that both the balaclava and the pinch bar had been the subject of evidence which, if accepted by the jury, established that they were similar to the balaclava worn, and to the pinch bar wielded, by the assailant of Miss Sommer.
We observe, finally, that no objection was taken at trial upon the basis now advanced by the appellant. As we have earlier remarked, the appellant was represented at trial by senior counsel of great experience in the conduct of criminal cases. That capable and experienced senior counsel, having the advantage of having seen and heard the delivery of the charge to the jury, did not think it necessary to seek further directions as to the matters now propounded by the appellant, strengthens us in the conclusion to which we have come: namely, that the matters of which present complaint is made by the appellant were sufficiently covered both in law and in fact by the directions to the jury.""

40It was also considered that the directions given fulfilled the applicable requirements of s 116 of the Evidence Act. It was observed that no application had been made under s 165(2) of that Act as to the giving of further directions as to the unreliability of this evidence. 

41In the result the case advanced on this application, that this evidence ought not have gone to the jury, may not be accepted. The applicant's objection to the receipt of that evidence was dealt with both at trial and on appeal. It was part of the circumstantial case on which the Crown relied in respect of things which Mr Wilson had conceded belonged to him. It was accordingly proper for that evidence to be considered by the jury and was not so unreliable or prejudicial that it necessarily had to be excluded as a matter of fairness. 

42In all of those circumstances I consider that this aspect of Mr Wilson's application also does not raise the necessary sense of unease or disquiet required, which must arise before the discretion to order an inquiry can be exercised. No special facts or circumstances justifying the further inquiry sought have been established. 

Conclusion

43In the result, Mr Wilson's application must be dismissed.

2765595,R v Briggs (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1805,"Judgment
1On 4 June 2014, Cecil Paul Briggs (the offender) was arraigned on an indictment in the Supreme Court at Armidale before a jury panel and me. The indictment contained a single count alleging that, on 26 December 2012 at Armidale, the offender murdered Douglas James Bindley (the deceased). The offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. In fact, he had entered the same plea many months before on arraignment. That plea was not accepted by the Crown, and a trial commenced.  It became clear during the trial that the position of the offender was that his guilt was reduced from murder to manslaughter by way of excessive force used in self-defence. 
2The trial proceeded for just over two weeks. Very close to the end of the Crown case, senior counsel then appearing for the offender requested that he be re-arraigned. On that occasion, the offender changed his plea and pleaded guilty to murder. I accepted the plea, returned a verdict of guilty of murder pursuant to s 157 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and discharged the jury.
3Thereafter the offender dispensed with the services of his solicitor and senior counsel. The matter was delayed for many months, chiefly because of the inability of the offender to arrange new legal representation. Whilst that delay is regrettable, in the circumstances that I shall go on to explain I do not take it into account against the offender.
4Oral and documentary evidence was received by me on sentence on 17 June 2014 in Armidale and on 11 December 2014 in Sydney. The culmination of the procedural background is the imposition of sentence by me today.
5The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without parole. Parliament has prescribed an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years. I have regarded both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as important guideposts in the exercise of my sentencing discretion.
6My approach to the determination of any disputed facts is as follows.  Any fact that is adverse to the offender, above and beyond the elements of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  A fact that is in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270.  Some facts may be unable to be determined on the evidence placed before me.  Undisputed facts
7It is convenient to discuss the relevant events in general chronological order.
8In December 2012 the offender and his family were visiting Armidale from their home in Dorrigo.
9During the morning of Christmas Eve 2012, Mr Moran, a friend of the offender, and Mr Moran's partner, Ms Kim, ran into the offender in the centre of Armidale while doing some Christmas shopping.  At the time, the offender had been abstinent from alcohol for at least some weeks. Mr Moran was himself abstaining from drinking.  For some reason that is very hard to understand, Mr Moran encouraged the offender to join him on a visit to a number of hotels near the centre of Armidale. Regrettably, the offender drank quite a few schooners of full-strength beer. At some stage Mr Moran saw fit to purchase a large bottle of port for the offender. For a time during the day the offender was in the presence of neither Mr Moran nor Ms Kim.  Eventually, the offender and his friend met up with Ms Kim.  All three of them returned to the home of Mr Moran.  By that stage the offender was well affected by alcohol.
10A couple of hours later, whilst being driven through the streets of Armidale by Mr Moran and Ms Kim, the offender suddenly asked to be dropped off at the home of the deceased.  The deceased and the offender were, in fact, old friends.  Prior to that request the offender had seemed to be happy and untroubled. He had not said anything negative about the deceased. When he alighted from the car he was not armed with any weapon, and did not appear to be angry or upset.  He approached the small apartment of the deceased, who opened the door to his old friend.
11Mr Bindley was aged 47 years, and suffered from a serious problem with alcohol. It had badly affected his health in a number of ways. Although not an old man, he had difficulty walking, and was assisted on occasion by his next door neighbour and by the proprietor of a general store across the road. A post-mortem would later reveal that he had suffered a heart attack a couple of weeks before the offender visited.
12Very soon after he entered the home of the deceased, the offender commenced to beat him brutally. At least 24 separate blows were applied to the person of the deceased, causing 24 separate injuries. The evidence establishes that two weapons were used: a wooden chair leg and a small baseball bat.  The offender suffered no injuries whatsoever. Whilst the bashing was being inflicted, two young men who were visiting the general store across the road heard the offender shouting ""fucking with my family"" and ""I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna fucking kill you"". At one stage the offender left the apartment, and was seen to come out onto the street. He returned indoors, and continued his assault upon the deceased.
13The police were called and the offender arrested. The offender initially denied inflicting any injuries to the deceased, and falsely claimed that he had found the deceased in his injured state after someone else had assaulted him. The police officers formed the view that, during the assault, the offender had been accusing the deceased of sexually interfering with at least one of the children of the offender.  There was no dispute between the parties about the correctness of that interpretation.
14The deceased was conveyed to hospital. Later that afternoon a detective spoke with him there.  The detective gave evidence in the witness box at trial that the deceased told him that ""I was at home and I heard banging on the door.  When I opened the door it was Cecil Briggs.  He was going off at me and he came inside.  He smashed a chair in the lounge, picked up the leg and started hitting me.  I tried to get up but he pushed me back onto the chair and kept hitting me."" 
15Were it not for the pre-existing frailty of the deceased, in all likelihood the injuries inflicted by the offender would not have caused his death. However, the combination of the prior ill-health of the deceased with the injuries inflicted upon him by the offender tragically led to him passing away on 26 December 2012.
16On arrest on the charge of murder later that evening, the offender said to the arresting detective ""I knew it was bad, this is terrible, but I can't justify what happened.""
17In short, there was no dispute between the parties that a voluntary act of the offender - the bashing inflicted upon the deceased - substantially contributed to the death of Mr Bindley. Nor was there any dispute that, at the time of the bashing, the offender possessed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury upon the deceased. The parties were agreed that I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill. The parties were also agreed that I would not be satisfied that the assault was anything other than a spontaneous, unplanned and unpremeditated explosion of violence.  Although neither party submitted that I could take the intoxication by alcohol of the offender into account as a mitigating feature, both parties were content for me to consider it as part of the explanation for what occurred.
Resolution of disputed facts
18The facts in dispute between the parties were of a small compass, and focused upon why it was that the offender came to assault the deceased very shortly after the offender arrived at the premises.
19The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I would safely infer that, during the time whilst the offender was absent from the company of Mr Moran and Ms Kim, some malicious person told the offender the completely false story that the deceased had been sexually interfering with a member of the family of the offender. Having been told that, the offender brooded upon it, but said nothing to his friends about the allegation. When he alighted from the car outside the home of the deceased, the offender had not formed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury. He had, however, in the submission of the Crown Prosecutor, formed an intention to confront the deceased angrily about what the offender had been told.
20Senior counsel for the offender submitted that, to the extent that it would be an aggravating feature of the offence for the offender to have decided upon a confrontation at the time he alighted from the vehicle, I could not be satisfied of that feature beyond reasonable doubt. He invited my attention to the evidence in the trial of Mr Moran and Ms Kim that, as I have said, the offender seemed untroubled in the period leading up to his unexpected visit to the deceased. The thesis of senior counsel was that, as can happen between old friends who are heavy drinkers, some badly crossed wire or deep misunderstanding developed between the offender and the deceased very soon after the arrival of the offender. It was that misunderstanding, he submitted, and not something that the offender had been told previously, that led the offender to do what he did.
21This dispute is a very limited one, in that, as I have said, each party accepts that the offence was spontaneous, and the Crown does not assert that the offender had formed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury when he alighted from the car. 
22I think that there is force in the submission of the Crown Prosecutor.  I strongly suspect that somebody, for whatever reason, told the offender lies about the deceased, with catastrophic results. But in light of the evidence of Mr Moran and Ms Kim, I am not satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore put my suspicion to one side.
23I accept the submission of defence counsel that, for some reason that I am unable to determine, very soon after his arrival in the apartment the offender formed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury. Having said that, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased did anything to provoke the assault.
24Separately, it is true that, in the proceedings on sentence of 17 June 2014 in Armidale, the offender gave evidence before me that he had acted in self-defence. I inferred that his implicit position was that that was not sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter (in light of the plea of guilty to murder that he had entered the day before), but that it was in some sense mitigating.
25The eminent member of the Inner Bar who appeared at the conclusion of the proceedings on sentence did not seek to persuade me that I should accept that evidence on the balance of probabilities. Accordingly, I have put that evidence to one side, except of course to the extent that it sheds light on the remorse of the offender, and his general credibility.
26As against the possibility that I have misunderstood the position of defence counsel, and the possibility that it may be said in future that there was evidence before me that the offender acted to some degree in self-defence, I should say that I completely reject that proposition. In light of my understanding of the position of senior counsel, I shall not engage in a detailed analysis of the evidence. It is enough to say that the evidence of the offender was inconsistent with objectively proven facts coming from disinterested witnesses. It also beggared belief that a man of the frailty of the deceased would attack the offender, a solid and healthy man. It is also the case that no motive whatsoever was ascribed to such an attack.  It is to be noted that an assertion that the offender was acting in self-defence is completely inconsistent with what the offender said when arrested for murder. Finally, I assess the oral evidence of the offender in the context of the fact that, in May 2013, he told a forensic psychiatrist that, in truth, he had no memory of the day of the offence.
Assessment of objective seriousness
27I turn to discuss the objective seriousness of what the offender has done.
28Of course, all murders are crimes of great gravity, constituting as they do the unlawful taking of the life of a fellow human being in the most serious circumstances known to the criminal law. Having said that, it is possible to grade them in their seriousness to some degree. For example, the cold-blooded murder of a sleeping victim by a contract killer with a silenced pistol will almost always be more serious than a murder that occurs in the course of a hotel brawl between two fit young men, one of whom goes too far in defending himself, and who at the time intends to inflict nothing more than really serious physical injury by way of his fists.
29Here, the victim of this homicide was a frail and defenceless middle-aged man. He was attacked in his own home. The beating was extended and no doubt painful and terrifying. It featured a pause, during which the offender left the premises and collected himself, but thereafter re-entered and continued the fatal attack.
30To be balanced against all of that is the fact that the offender intended to inflict really serious physical injury, and not to kill. The injuries directly inflicted by the offender were not of the utmost gravity, and did not feature fractures of the skull, the nose, or indeed any other bone. As well as that, the attack was not cold-blooded but rather completely unplanned, and occurred when the offender was in a highly emotional state.
31To my mind, this is not one of the gravest murders that has come before the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  But nor can it be assessed as an example of that offence that is at the lower end of the range of objective gravity; quite the contrary. It is an objectively serious example of the most serious offence known to law.
Subjective features
32I turn from a discussion of the offence to a discussion of the life and character of the offender.
33As I have said, the offender pleaded guilty to murder at a late stage of his trial. Still and all, that plea saved a number of days in court that would have been occupied by any evidence in the defence case, the final addresses of counsel, and my summing-up. It also spared 12 members of the community from the always difficult task of sitting in judgment on a fellow citizen with regard to a violent homicide. I consider that the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed should be discounted by 5% to reflect the usefulness of the plea of guilty of the offender. To the extent that that reduction from a putative starting point results in a few spare days or weeks, they will be rounded down, because the law does not concern itself with trifles.
34As for remorse, the evidence is not all one way. As I have said, on the day immediately after the plea was entered, the offender gave sworn evidence that generally sought to excuse his conduct.  I have already explained that I have not been asked to act upon that evidence; in any event, I reject it. Other than a brief remark on that occasion that ""Dougie was my mate.  I didn't want to hurt Dougie"", I have not heard from the offender on oath about how he feels about what he has done.
35Having said that, I think that, in truth, what the offender said in the proceedings on sentence, and indeed much of what he has said in the last two years generally about the offence, is the result of alcoholic confabulation. I accept the accuracy of what the offender said to Dr Westmore almost 18 months ago: the reality is that he cannot really remember the day of the murder.
36It is also the case that, on occasions over the past two years, the offender has indeed expressed remorse.  As I have said, upon his arrest on 26 December 2012, he said to a detective ""I knew it was bad, this is terrible, but I can't justify what happened."" To Dr Westmore on 10 May 2013 he said ""it's terrible, it's sad.  You feel for any person it's happened to"". A letter from a prison chaplain of 21 July 2014 that became exhibit 7 records that ""[the offender] appeared to be extremely remorseful for his actions, the pain and stress it has caused his family, friends, loved ones, victims and the community.""


37The presentence report of 1 December 2014 records that:
[The offender] is ""saddened"" by the victim's death as he was a friend but furthermore he is also upset by the impact this incident has had on not only the victim and himself but also their respective families and the local community.
38It is certainly true that, over the past many months, the offender has struggled to come to grips with the enormity of what he has done, and the inevitable consequences that he will suffer as a result. I think that the disrupted conduct of his litigation is very much a reflection of that struggle. Nevertheless, having reflected upon the matter, I have come to accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender regrets not only the punishment that will be imposed upon him, but also what he did to the deceased, his family and friends, and the community generally. It follows that my sentence will reflect a finding of remorse on the part of the offender.
39The offender was born in May 1971. He was aged 41 at the time of the offence, and is now aged 43. He is an Aboriginal man from Gumbaynggir lands. He left school in Year 9, and worked mainly as a labourer.  At the time of the offence the offender was in a long term de facto relationship.  He has five children from that relationship, and another child from a previous relationship.
40Far from being born into deprivation, he enjoyed a happy and stable childhood. His parents were hard-working and religious people who took pride in their respected position in the Armidale community. The offender was well adjusted and outgoing as a child, and a good sportsman.
41For reasons that are not easy to understand, something went wrong in his adolescent years. He fell in with the wrong crowd, and began to abuse alcohol and thereafter prohibited drugs.  A very insightful and reflective letter from his sister has detailed that process, and tried to provide an explanation as to why it occurred. In truth, alcohol and, to a lesser degree, prohibited drugs, have marred the life and happiness of the offender for many decades. 
42In the proceedings on sentence, the offender gave frank evidence that he regarded himself as an alcoholic. To his credit, he has sought to deal with the problem, including by way of residential rehabilitation programs on at least four occasions. His inability to succeed in that struggle culminated in the tragic death of the deceased on Boxing Day 2012.
43Defence counsel has accepted that his client was subject to two forms of conditional liberty on the day of the offence. That was by way of a good behaviour bond and a suspended sentence, imposed for the offences of stalking or intimidation and contravening an apprehended violence order respectively.  He also accepted that his client has an extensive record for violence, and has been imprisoned for such offences. Still and all, there is force in the submission of defence counsel that one can infer that those offences were not of the greatest seriousness, all of them having been dealt with in the Local Court. I also accept that the criminal record of the offender shows that the longest period of full-time imprisonment to which he has been sentenced is nine months with a six month non-parole period (he has also been sentenced to a longer period of periodic detention). Finally, I accept that most if not all of those entries were connected to drunkenness, and that some of them were interactions with the police that began relatively trivially and thereafter escalated.
44There can be no question but that the commission of this grave offence of violence whilst on conditional liberty, itself imposed for an offence founded upon fear of violence, is a serious aggravating feature. To be weighed against that is the proposition that the criminal record of the offender would not of itself lead one to be unduly pessimistic about his prospects of rehabilitation, a topic to which I shall return.
45A neurologist has assessed the offender as operating at the borderline between normal functioning and intellectual disability. He also expressed the opinion that 96% of people who share the age of the offender would operate at a higher intellectual level than he does. Defence counsel submitted that that would lead me to place less emphasis in my sentence on personal and general deterrence.  To the contrary, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offender well appreciated the link between drinking and criminality on his part; so much is established, indeed, by his repeated efforts to get help. I accept that submission.  As well as that, I think that the offender understood and understands perfectly well the complete unacceptability of inflicting a severe bashing on a defenceless invalid. My sentence reflects reduced emphasis on general and personal deterrence, but only to a very small degree.
Prospects of rehabilitation
46In custody, the offender has progressed very well. He has been appointed head sweeper of his pod, and is regarded as a role model for newly imprisoned young offenders in general, and young Aboriginal offenders in particular. Quite apart from working, he busies himself with Bible study and is highly regarded by the prison chaplain at the MRRC.
47Regrettably, his relationship with his partner has come to an end as a result of his incarceration. The offender hopes in due course to be moved to a prison on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, so that he can more easily have contact with his family and friends. 
48It is very much to be hoped that the offender is able to get help over the years ahead with regard to his problems with alcohol and prohibited drugs. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that, in light of the repeated failures in the past, culminating in the most serious offence known to law, one should exercise caution in assessing the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender favourably. Nevertheless, having reflected cautiously on that topic, I think that, if the offender is able to get help, both whilst in custody and upon his release, his prospects of rehabilitation are quite good.
Various matters
49I turn to deal briefly with a number of separate aspects of my task.
50First, each party agreed that my sentence should be backdated to the date of arrest with regard to this offence; namely, 26 December 2012.
51Secondly, I do not propose mechanistically to state the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  These remarks on sentence fulfil that role.  I have referred to the section, and taken care to avoid double counting. 
52Thirdly, defence counsel submitted that I should find special circumstances that would reduce the non-parole period, even despite the inevitable length of any parole period. His submission was that the offender will require a great deal of help after having spent a substantial period in custody, and that an extended period of conditional liberty is not only in the interests of his client but also of the community. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, in light of the repeated failures of the offender in the past, such an approach would be of no utility.
53It is true that, in the past, the offender has committed offences of violence. It is also true that he has been imprisoned on occasion. But returning to the community after many years in prison will be a massive re-adjustment for him.  I do not think that his sincere but ultimately fruitless efforts to rehabilitate himself in the past should stand in the way of a finding of special circumstances for the future. I propose to reduce the non-parole period, but only to a very small degree. That is because I would regard any non-parole period shorter than the one that I shall impose as not adequately reflecting the objective seriousness of this offence, and the moral blameworthiness of this offender.
54Fourthly, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that he may be detained even after the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is considered that he remains a danger to the community.
Victim impact statement
55I received a victim impact statement from Ms Lisa Bindley, the sister of the deceased. It reflected the deep pain that she and many others who loved Douglas James Bindley have suffered since the death of her brother almost two years ago. I consider it appropriate, pursuant to s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to take the contents of that victim impact statement into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the murder of the deceased.
56Ms Bindley stated that her brother's death had left a ""huge hole"" in her family, and has had ""detrimental effects on the physical and emotional health and wellbeing"" of all family members.  The fact that the fatal assault occurred on Christmas Eve means that, every year, what should be a happy family celebration must become a wounding anniversary.
57On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to all those who have suffered, and will continue to do so, as a result of the senseless crime of the offender. I hope that the conclusion of proceedings in this Court after many months will provide a degree of closure and relief to all of those who are grieving.
Imposition of sentence
58Cecil Paul Briggs, you are convicted of the offence of murder.
59I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years to date from 26 December 2012. That will be followed by a parole period of five years. The earliest possible date for your release to parole is 25 December 2025.
60To express my sentence another way, the offender is sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 18 years to date from 26 December 2012 and expire on 25 December 2030, with a non-parole period of 13 years.

2765606,Police v Beth [2014] NSWChC 8,"Judgment

Reasons for decision


	
	The Young Person, Beth (not her real name), is currently before this Court having been charged with a total of thirteen offences committed during a four week period between 27 June and 26 July this year. There are five charges of common assault, one charge of assault police, one charge of causing intimidation, four of damaging property, one violation of an AVO and one larceny. The Young Person is 11 years of age.
	
	
	It is not necessary to go into detail in relation to the facts giving rise to these charges.
	
	
	The Court understands that the Young Person is under the parental responsibility of the Minister. The Young Person has suffered severe trauma in the care of her parents, being exposed to significant neglect, emotional and psychological abuse, exposure to domestic violence and possible sexual abuse. The result has been that the Young Person became engaged in extreme and uncontrolled behaviours, characterised by the use of violence and behaviour that placed her and others at significant risk. She has been described as being uncontrollable, and she is currently placed in secure residential accommodation under the care of the Department of Family and Community Services for her own safety, and the safety of others.
	
	
	The Supreme Court, exercising its parens patriae jurisdiction, has made a secure accommodation order. The Court understands that the Young Person is currently placed in suitable accommodation, and is responding positively to her current reparative and therapeutic care arrangements.
	
	
	In relation to the Young Person’s mental capacity and behaviours, assessments were undertaken in July and August this year by Dr Dee Neveling, Clinical Psychologist, with the latter report addressing, inter alia it would appear, the issue of doli incapax. Dr Neveling had been working with the family since 2010. The Court has access to Dr Neveling’s reports prepared in relation to Beth on 30 July and 15 August 2014. The July report recounts concerning behaviours of the Young Person secreting dangerous weapons to use in attacks on refuge staff when she lures them into her room. Dr Neveling describes instances of the Young Person dissociating. The same report details the Young Person’s family history between 2003 and 2014 and contains some frightening accounts of the Young Person’s aggressive, threatening and dangerous behaviours, both to herself and to others.
	
	
	Dr Neveling concurs with the diagnosis by other medical experts that the Young Person meets inter alia the criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Reactive Attachment Disorder.
	


Application for a permanent stay of the proceedings


	
	When the criminal proceedings came before this Court on 23 October 2014, Mr Robinson, on behalf of the Young Person, made what he described as a Presser application, namely an application for a permanent stay of the proceedings in light of the Young Person’s unfitness to be tried.
	
	
	The decision of Smith J in the case of R v Presser [1958] ARL 248, in dealing with the issue of fitness to be tried, sets out the test or minimum standards required before an accused can receive a fair trial.
	
	
	It is convenient to set out the decision of Smith J in relation to the test. His Honour said:
	


“(An accused) needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charges and to exercise his right of challenge He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this though his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.”


	
	The High Court has approved the Presser test. Relying on the test set out in that case, and also making reference to the decision of Magistrate Mulroney in the case of Police v DK, an unreported Children’s Court decision dated 17 December 2010, Mr Robinson submitted that given the circumstances of this case, it was appropriate for the Court to grant a permanent stay of the proceedings.
	
	
	In the case of Police v DK, Magistrate Mulroney was satisfied that the defendant came within the ambit of the Presser test, and finding that the defendant could not give appropriate instructions, could not understand or follow the proceedings, and could not comprehend the consequences of any court order, Magistrate Mulroney concluded that the defendant would be exposed to unacceptable unfairness or injustice. Accordingly Magistrate Mulroney granted a permanent stay of the proceedings.
	
	
	It is relevant and important to note that Magistrate Mulroney was dealing with an application for an apprehended violence order, and noted that “if this was a criminal prosecution the court may have considered making an order pursuant to section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, but that is not available in this situation”.
	


The prosecution response to the application


	
	In response to Mr Robinson’s application, the prosecution opposed the application that the matter be subjected to a permanent stay order, and submitted that the matter may be more appropriately dealt with under s32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.
	
	
	Mr Robinson subsequently submitted that if the Court was not satisfied that it was appropriate to grant a permanent stay, the Court might also consider applying the provisions of s 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.
	


Decision


	
	Dealing first with the application for a permanent stay of the proceedings, it is my view that having regard to the availability and applicability of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, which is specifically designed to divert persons with mental health issues away from the criminal justice system, it is not appropriate to consider granting a permanent stay of the proceedings involving the Young Person.
	
	
	In my view, this is an appropriate case for the application of that Act, and that given the age of the Young Person and the apparent successful response to the current care arrangements, notwithstanding the serious nature of the charges, it is appropriate to divert the Young Person away from the criminal justice system.
	
	
	The Court notes, as an observation only, that if the seriousness of the charges resulted in the Court refusing to exercise its discretion to deal with the matter under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, but rather decided to deal with the matter according to law, there may be some scope, under those circumstances, for the Children’s Court to consider the applicability of the Presser test and the appropriateness of granting a permanent stay.
	


Order


	
	Accordingly, the application for a permanent stay is refused.

2765607,Chime v R [2014] NSWCCA 304,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J and with his reasons.
2ADAMS J:
Introduction 3On 21 February 2012, the appellant was convicted of nine counts of aiding and abetting marketable quantities (2 grams or more) of border controlled drugs contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) ss 307.2(1) and 11.2(1) (carrying a maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment and/or $550,000 fine) and one count of dealing with money (comprising numerous transactions made between 19 November 2009 and 31 August 2010) that the appellant believed to be proceeds of crime, where the value of the money was $100,000 or more, an offence under the Criminal Code s 400.4(1) (carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and/or $132,000 fine).  In respect of the former offences, count 1 involved 42.3 grams of heroin (2 July 2010), count 2, 64.7 grams of cocaine (8 July 2010), count 3, 174 grams of heroin, count 4, 106 grams MAM or 6-monoacetylmorphine, a derivative of morphine (both 3 August 2010), count 5, 116.7 grams of cocaine (6 August 2010), count 6, at least 2 grams heroin (20 August 2010), count 7, 158.6 grams methamphetamine (21 August 2010), count 8, 332.1 grams of heroin (24 August 2010), and count 9, 159 grams of cocaine (7 September 2010). On 18 July 2012 he was sentenced to an effective head term of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing on 31 August 2010.  
4The appellant, who appeared unrepresented in this Court (though represented at trial), appealed both his conviction and sentence.  Amongst other things, he sought bail from this Court to enable him to assist police to identify the offenders who were involved in the offences by making contact with them.  Unsurprisingly, the Crown did not join in this application.  There is no power to grant bail in these circumstances or for such a purpose.  Since there can be little doubt that the appellant acted with others, his application perhaps should not be dismissed as an altogether empty gesture and might be some evidence of contrition.  However, in light of the view I have taken concerning his sentence appeal, the matter does not arise for consideration.  I mention it only for completeness.
5It is convenient first to briefly outline the prosecution case to provide a context for his various complaints, which will then be dealt with seriatim.
The prosecution case
6(Much of what follows has been extracted from the extensive and helpful submissions of the Crown prosecutor in this Court which, as to potentially controversial matters, I have compared with the evidence, and appear to me to summarise the case accurately and adequately.)  
7The drugs whose importation the appellant allegedly aided and abetted were concealed inside packages sent by mail to Australia.  On each occasion, the quantity of pure drug exceeded the ""marketable quantity"" (2 grams pure) set out in the Criminal Code.  There were eight packages (but nine charges, because one of the packages contained two types of drug).  Four of the packages were addressed to ""Stanley Nartey"" one to ""Stanley Natay"", one to Stanly Nartey, one to Nartey Stanley, one to Stanley Nartery (for convenience, called ""Nartey"") and one to Chidere Udo.  Seven of the eight packages were intercepted by authorities, and were not delivered to their designated addresses.  One package however (count 6) was not detected, and was delivered to a post office box in Rosemeadow (the remnants of that package, with traces of heroin, were later found in garbage bins at the appellant's home).  The addresses on the packages (three post office boxes, and two residential addresses) were all linked to the appellant.  The prosecution alleged that the appellant had used the names ""Stanley Nartey"" and ""Chidere Udo"" for the purpose of facilitating the importations.
8The prosecution case was that the appellant ""aided and abetted"" the importations, by arranging the delivery addresses to which the packages were sent.  That he intended to collect the packages (and did successfully collect one on one occasion) was evidence of the purpose for which the addresses were organized.
9The appellant was arrested on 31 August 2010 at his home 118 Englorie Park Road, Glen Alpine (near Campbelltown).  Federal Police officers executed a search warrant at the same time.  Those present were the appellant, his wife Melody Chime (aka Marie Deanshaw), and her three children.  A large number of items relevant to the offences for which the appellant has been convicted were seized.  Those exhibited in the trial were listed in the Crown's submissions.  For convenience, I insert that list below - 
A brown box with the name ""Stanley Nartey"".  
A wallet (in men's jeans in the main bedroom) which contained:
2 Travelex cards - one issued in the name Stanley Nartey, the other in the name Jude Chime;A receipt in name Stanley Nartey;A SIM card registered to Mr Tran Chan, which contained, (among other things) a text message ""PO box 86 bringelly nsw 2556"" (the delivery address for the package referred to in Counts 3 & 4);10 passport sized photos, 5 of which the appellant agreed were pictures of him.
Various documents with the name Stanley Nartey, which were located in a white plastic bag (in a storage room) along with documents in the name of his wife and documents in the name of the appellant.  Also found in the bag were five passport photos which the appellant agreed depicted him. 
Three knives (in the en suite bathroom attached to the main bedroom upstairs) - two of which when tested revealed traces of heroin.
A copy of a letter (on a computer hard drive) which read - ""To whom it may concer (sic) - I Stanley Nartey of 155 Englorie Park Drive, Glen Alpine, NSW 2560, give permission for my friend Uchenna Chime, to collect my parcel EM950 354439KR from Korea, asm (sic) I am unable to do so. Thanks. Yours truly, Stanley Nartey."".
Pieces of paper which contained scanned copies of two (false) NSW Driver's licences - one in the name Stanley Nartey and the other in the name Chidere Udo.
The false NSW Driver's Licence in the name Stanley Nartey contained the residential address ""36 Morton Terrace Harrington Park NSW"". The appellant had previously lived at that address.
A Western Union receipt in the name Stanley Nartey. This receipt was found in a locked suitcase under the Appellant's bed. The appellant gave police a passcode which opened the case.  The receipt quoted phone number 0432 232552 as a contact for Stanley Nartey - this phone was registered in the appellant's name.
A Moneygram transfer for US$8000 in the name Chidere Udo (Count 8) addressed to the appellant's brother) which was found in the main bedroom.
A Post Office Box application form in the name Chidere Udo (Count 8) which was found beside a dresser in the main bedroom.
A piece of paper with the name Chidero Udo and numbers ""155"" and ""103725681"" (Count 8). The number ""155"" matched the house number for the delivery address of the Count 8 package (a house opposite the appellant's house). The number ""103725681"" matched the numerals in the consignment number for this  package - ""EE103725681BD"". This paper was found in the en suite to the main bedroom.
Various items inside a red garbage bin and a yellow recycling bin. These included - the (Count 6) packaging addressed to Stanley Nartey PO Box 3038 Rosemeadow, and a number of items which contained traces of heroin.
The appellant's fingerprint was found on a ""Moneygram send money form"" in the name of Stanley Nartey for $5000. This document was found in a red waste bin outside the Appellant's house.
The appellant's fingerprints (4 of them) were also found on plastic bags retrieved from the red waste bin. Other items inside that bin contained substantial traces of white powder, which tested positively for heroin.
A GPS device seized from a car in the driveway of the appellant's house - which contained the address ""138 Lansdowne Road, Canley Vale"" (the delivery addresses for packages in Counts 1, 2, 5, and 7).
A mobile phone 0406 232685 with SIM card registered to ""Victor Agu"" of 1 Birmingham Ave, Villawood. This phone number was quoted on the application for PO Box 86 Bringelly (Counts 3 & 4) as the contact number for Stanley Nartey, 86 Morton Terrace Harrington Park. The contact list stored in this phone contained the appellant's bank account number, as well as links to other seized phones.
A mobile phone 0410 206717 with SIM card registered to ""John Sand"" of 1/2A Birmingham Ave, Villawood. This phone contained various links to the appellant (eg it listed a phone number registered in the appellant's real name, and also a phone number for his wife).
A mobile phone 0412 139368 with SIM card registered to ""Tan Chan"" of 1 Birmingham Ave, Villawood. This phone also contained links to the appellant (eg the phone number of his wife and her son), as well as a link to a phone in the appellant's real name.
A mobile phone 0432 232552 with SIM card registered in the appellant's name, of 15 Birmingham Ave. This number was quoted as the contact for ""Stanley Nartey"" in application for PO Box 3038 Rosemeadow (Count 6).
A mobile phone 0432 232197 with SIM card registered in the appellant's name, of 118 Englorie Park Drive, Glen Alpine. This phone was linked to the ""Tan Chan"" and ""John Sand"" phones (above) and to the ""Tran Chan"" phone (below) because those phones contained this phone number in their contact lists.
A loose SIM card 0451 589308 registered to ""Tran Chan"" of 11 Sutherland Road, Jannali. This SIM card was found in a men's wallet in a pair of jeans in the main bedroom. This SIM card was linked to the appellant because (as well as being found in a wallet in his bedroom) it contained contact numbers for - the appellant's wife (under the name ""SW Heart"") and the number for one of the phones listed in the appellant's own name (recorded as ""My Optus""). This SIM card also contained a text message sent from another phone on 25/6/10 - ""Po box 86 bringelly nsw 2556"" (the address for the package referred to in Counts 3 and 4). 
Subsequently, police obtained a copy of the Australia Post application form for PO Box 3038 Rosemeadow, which was rented in the name ""Stanley Nartey"" (Count 6). That application form quoted telephone number 0432 232552. That telephone number was registered in the name of the Appellant.
10The ""count 6"" package (found in the bin) had been sent from India, and arrived in Australia on 20 August 2010.  The sender's details were ""Amuta Chukwononso"" (of Delhi, India).  As well as being found in the bin, the prosecution linked this package to the appellant in another way: on 4, 5 and 8 April, amounts of AUD2,500 were transmitted via Western Union to ""Amuta Chukwnonso"" (with some minor spelling variations) in Delhi, India. These transfers were made in the name ""Stanley Nartey"" and quoted the false driver's licence of ""Stanley Nartey"" (a scanned copy of which was found at the appellant's house).  In addition however, the ""Sender phone"" quoted for each of these transfers was 0432 232552 which was registered in the name of the appellant, Uchenna Chime.
11One of the two residential addresses used was 155 Englorie Park Drive, almost opposite the appellant's residence at 118 Englorie Park Drive.
12There was no dispute that the packages referred to in counts 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 had been imported, and each contained a marketable quantity of border controlled drugs but whether the prosecution had proved the importation of a marketable quantity as charged in count 6 was in issue. The fundamental dispute at trial, however, concerned whether the appellant had been involved in the Nartey or Chidere Udo transactions.  The three post office boxes used to receive the various parcels which contained the drugs were Box 86, Bringelly NSW, Box 3038 Rosemeadow, NSW and Box 6159 Canley Vale NSW.  Each had been obtained by use of the false driver's licence in the name ""Stanley Nartey"" to identify the user.  A copy of another false driver's licence in the name of ""Chidere Udo"" was found in the appellant's house.  Copies of these licences on the prosecution case, depicted the appellant.  I should interpose here the evidence relied on by the prosecution for this contention.  First, the prosecutor invited the jury to compare the photographs with the appellant.  Second, he submitted that, if the jury compared the copy photos with other photos of the appellant which he agreed in his evidence depicted him, they would see, by referring to particular distinct characteristics appearing on both the photos and the copies that the latter were copies of the former.
13It is not necessary for present purposes to detail the whole of the extensive evidence showing the links between the various phones and documents relevant to the offences.  It is useful to take but one example, the phone whose number ended with 368 (phone 3) was registered to Tan Chan at Birmingham Avenue, Villawood, also the street in which the Villawood Detention Centre was located.  The phone ending in 330 was, on the prosecution case, one of the appellant's wife's phones.  She had the nickname ""Honey"" which he used from time to time, the appellant said, and was entered in the call list in the appellant's phone (phone 4).  From 330 to phone 3 from the person who has the nickname Honey was a message, ""I tried to call you, this wrecker has found a front seat for your car for 200, but you're not answering your phones.""  The appellant said that he could not remember if this was from his wife to him.  The next message read, ""I went to the doctors, had a blood test and a pap smear and she told me it's all okay to have it every day to make our baby.  Are you ready to try again?""  He could not remember this message: ""It's been a long time"".  A message sent on 2 March 2010 from ""Ugo"" in China (whom the appellant agreed he knew) to phone 3 said, ""Uche, how is your family?  Tried to check your offline message and after that you reply me, BK, thank.""  The appellant said he was not ""uche"" and the message was not addressed to him. The next message, from ""Honey"" said, ""You know it was nice getting messages once in a while from you.  It made me feel like the man I met and fell in love with is back.  I want Uche, my love back.""  The appellant repeated his name was ""Uchenna"" not ""Uche"" and said the message was not addressed to him.  The next message was also from ""Honey"" and said, ""Baby I love you so much and I will just about do anything to keep us together but I need you to feel the same"".  The appellant said he could not remember if this message came from his wife.  Neither could he remember a later message from ""Honey"" saying, ""Baby just to let u know love u and Ty for being with me"".  He was taken to a message from a phone number ending in 367 (his wife's) saying, ""My battery is dead.  I love you.  Remember that you need to read 1 Corinthian 7 and understand what I need from you and our marriage.""  He had earlier agreed that this was from his wife's phone.  The prosecutor submitted that the reference to the battery being dead was that of the phone having the ending in 330 which was the phone used for the earlier messages.  The prosecutor took the appellant to a message from a Nigerian phone number on 21 February 2010 at 11.58pm which said, ""The contact; Surname: Martine, first name: John..."" and pointed out that the receipt for the Western Union Money transfer from Melody Chime (the appellant's wife) which detailed the appellant's address and his wife's telephone number, to John Martine was dated 23 February 2010.  He agreed that the money was sent by his wife but said he did not do so, adding ""My cousin asked her sometimes"".  The appellant said that the contact for the message, in the receiving phone's contact list, (""ik, ik Bros"") was his brother.  He did not know who John Martine was.  He was shown another Western Union transfer receipt dated 3 March 2010 showing the sender as his wife, Melody, to another person whom the appellant did not know.  In the section with a question and answer for identification, the name is ""Uche"".  The appellant denied this was a reference to him.  The receipt contained a money transfer control number, 741968913.  He was shown a message received 3 March 2010 from the contact ""Honey"" using the phone with the number ending in 330, which stated, ""Mtcn 7419168913 US100 who Uche Melody Chime"".  He denied this message was sent to him or knowing the recipient.   
14So far as the proceeds of crime offence is concerned, the prosecution alleged the applicant was involved in a number of overseas money transfers, totalling just over $524,000, between 19 November 2009 and 31 August 2010.  Each transfer was for less than $10,000 to avoid, the prosecution contended, reporting requirements attaching to amounts exceeding that figure.  In order to make these transfers, the sender must produce some form of original government photographic identification, such as a driver's licence.
15There were 125 money transfers through Western Union, totalling just over $390,000 of which more than 100 (totalling about $362,000) were in the name Stanley Nartey.  In all of these transactions, the false Stanley Nartey driver's licence, which the prosecution contended contained the appellant's image (a copy had been found at the appellant's house) was used as identification.  In 88 of the Stanley Nartey transactions, the phone number of the sender was that of the appellant's phone (4).  In eight transactions, the phone number of the sender was phone 1 (registered to ""Victor Agu"") which contained, amongst other links to him, the appellant's bank account number.  In 12 transactions, the ""Sender phone"" was phone 6 (registered to ""Tran Chan) having the number of a loose SIM card found in a wallet in jeans in the appellant's bedroom.  In nine of the transactions, the recipient of the funds (in Nigeria) was the appellant's brother (Ikechukwu Chime).  
16The SIM card found in the wallet in the jeans contained significant text messages.  The first was received on 28 May 2010 and read ""dumebi samuel daniel"".  Western Union's records showed that, between 1 May and 22 June 2010, money totalling about $42,670 had been sent to ""Samuel Dumebi"" or to ""Samuel Daniel Dumebi"" in the name ""Stanley Nartey"".  The second was received on 5 June 2010 reading, ""Names of new I.D. : Emmanuel Ezeh"".  Western Union records showed that between 7 June & 15 June 2010, ""Stanley Nartey"" sent about $19,000 to ""Emmanuel Ezeh"".  The third was received on 14 June 2010 and read ""Michael Chukwudebelu"".  Western Union records showed that, on that day  ""Stanley Nartey"" sent about $12,000 to ""Michael Chukwudebelu""  (Another amount was sent the same day to ""Michael Chukwudebelu"" in which the number of phone 4 was used.)  The fourth text message, received on 15 June 2010 contained the name ""Chibueze Ibeagwa"". Western Union records showed that between 17 May and 23 June 2010, ""Stanley Nartey"" sent about $64,000 to ""Chibueze Ibeagwa"".  The fifth message was received on 18 June 2010 containing the name ""SOWAH DANIEL"".  Western Union records showed that on 17 June 2010, ""Stanley Nartey"" sent about $10,000 to ""Daniel Sowah"".  Sixth was a message received on 18 June 2010 which contained the name ""RILEY JOHNATTAN"".  Western Union records showed that on 19, 20, 21 and 22 June 2010, and on 1 July 2010 ""Stanley Nartey"" sent various amounts to ""Johnattan Riley"" in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
17There were six transfers via Western Union in the name Chidere Udo (totalling $9,442.05).  In each case, the ""Sender ID number"" was the number of the false driver's licence in the name Chidere Udo, (item 5 seized by police).  In two of the transactions, the sender phone number was that of phone 4 and in one transaction the number used was the same, except for the last digit (551 rather than 552).  In the remaining three Udo transactions, the phone number used that of phone 1, which had been phone found in the appellant's residence which contained (among other links to him) the appellant's bank account number.  Furthermore, on 28 September 2010 and 7 November 2010 (when the appellant was in prison) he telephoned ""UZOEZIE EBERE"", the Western Union records showing that on 19 August 2010 ""Chidere Udo"" had sent USD4322.81 to ""EBERE UZOEZIE"".
18Lastly, so far as the Western Union transfers were concerned, between 19 November 2009 and 1 April 2010, the appellant transferred money in his own name to his brother amounting to $18,635.92.  In all but one of these (the number of his wife's phone) the appellant's phone number was quoted as the ""Sender phone"".  These transactions occurred at various outlets including Lansvale, Narellan, Campbelltown, Ambarvale and North Parramatta where, also, a large number of the ""Stanley Nartey"" transactions occurred. 
19""Stanley Nartey"" also used Moneygram to make 17 transfers, totalling $84,247.25.  The identification used on each occasion was the false driver's licence in the name Stanley Nartey (item 5).  In respect of 15 of these transactions, the ""Sender occupation"" was recorded as ""welder"" (an occupation in which the appellant agreed he had worked).  In 14 transactions, the recipient of the money (in Nigeria) was the appellant's brother (Ikechukwu Chime).  In seven, the ""Sender phone"" number was that of phone 4, and in six transfers, the ""Sender phone"" number was that of phone 6 (registered to ""Tran Chan""), the number of the loose SIM card found in the wallet in the jeans in the appellant's bedroom.  The ""Sender phone"" number used in the remaining four transfers was that of phone 1 (registered to ""Victor Agu""), also found on the appellant's premises, which contained (among other links to him) the appellant's bank account number.
20Six Moneygram transfers were made by ""Chidere Udo"", totalling $49,822. The identification used in each of these transactions was the false driver's licence in the name of Chidere Udo, on the prosecution case depicting the appellant.  In all these transfers, the ""Sender occupation"" was recorded as ""welder"" and the recipient of the money (in Nigeria) was the appellant's brother (Ikechukwu Chime).  In four of the transfers, the number of the ""Sender phone"" was that of phone 1, in one the number was that of phone 4 except that the last digit had been changed to 3 rather than 2 and in respect of the remaining transaction, the number was that of phone 2 (registered in the name ""John Sand"") which was another phone found at the appellant's house, and which contained links to him such as his wife's phone number.
21To summarise, the money transfers were made in the names of Stanley Nartey, Chidere Udo, and the appellant and used Western Union or Moneygram.  The prosecution relied in the main on the items seized from the appellant's residence which connected him with the identities ""Stanley Nartey"" and ""Chidere Udo"", and the imported packages containing drugs. It could be inferred from the evidence of the appellant's income at the relevant time that he could not have come by the transferred funds by his employment or by working at a market three days a week with his wife, the only sources of income he claimed to have.  The cross-linking of text messages, fingerprints on key items, names, phone numbers, phone memories, use of the false driver's licences depicting the appellant to obtain post office boxes and for money transfers, his association with the residential addresses to which drugs were posted together with some evidence of movement of the appellant's motor vehicle by information stored on the satellite navigation device provided the basic material establishing, as the prosecution contended, the appellant's use of Nartey's and Udo's identities to commit the offences.  There was also negative evidence as to the failure of wide-ranging inquiries to identify any persons of those names.
The defence case 22The appellant gave evidence, but called no other witnesses.  What follows is a summary of his evidence, touching only on the main points.  
23The appellant came to Australia in May 2008, and spent approximately one year in detention at Villawood, marrying his wife in May 2009 while still detained.  In May 2009 the appellant returned to Nigeria and obtained a visa permitting him to return to Australia in September 2009.  He lived with his wife (and her children) at Mt Annan (near Campbelltown) and, shortly after, they moved to 36 Morton Terrace, Harrington Park.  
24The appellant said that his cousin ""Stanley Nartey"" also lived with the family, although he ""freely moved out, freely came in"".  They then moved into 118 Englorie Park Drive, Glen Alpine.  He said that Stanley Nartey also moved there and continued to live with them downstairs in a room called by the police a ""storage room"".  Stanley told him on 30 August 2010 that he was going to Dubbo and last saw him on that day.  Stanley's friend Chidere Udo also lived in Dubbo.  He had spent time in the appellant's residence with Nartey.
25He said that Stanley had two friends (""Felix"" and ""Udo"") who used to visit him at the house, and that Stanley and his friends would sometimes use the computers that were upstairs.
26The appellant said he lived upstairs in the main bedroom with his wife and that no-one else lived in that room, but that others used the ensuite, including his cousin.  He and Stanley shared their clothes and the wallet found in the pair of jeans in his bedroom was not his. The jeans were either ""not his"" or he could not see clearly (on the video that was shown in Court).  Nor had he noticed the knives (which had traces of heroin on them) upstairs in the en suite bathroom and could not explain how traces of heroin had been on them.  They were normally kept in his kitchen.  He could not explain how the post office box application in the name of Chidere Udo came to be in the bedside dresser in his bedroom.  He agreed that a Western Union receipt in the name Stanley Nartey had been found in a locked suitcase under his bed (that he opened with a code) but said that Stanley and Chidere used to borrow that suitcase.
27He said he had never before seen the brown box addressed to Stanley Nartey (which was found in his house).   He could not explain why his fingerprints were on a Moneygram document in the name of Stanley Nartey, as he had not touched it.  
28The appellant said the facial images on the copies of the (false) driver's licenses (in the names Stanley Nartey and Chidere Udo) were not him.  Ten passport photos were found in the wallet.  The appellant said three did not depict him, but the rest did. He denied these matched the photos in either of the false driver's licences.  
29The appellant said that ""Felix"" once used his photo to create a ""profile"" on a website for meeting women.  In relation to the various phones found at his house, he said did not know any Victor Agu, John Sand, or Tan Chan.  He said Stanley had bought those phones, but that he had sometimes used them as he used to exchange phones with Stanley.  He denied that he was the ""Uche"" whose name appeared on the Moneygram transfer on 30 August 2010 to the appellant's brother, purporting to have been transferred by Chidere Udo and other transfers made by his wife.  In phone 2 there was a message from ""Chuck VG"" which said, ""uche please call me ok take care god bles you""   The appellant said he was not the ""Uche"" in this message.  
30The appellant said he had been to Lansdowne Road two or three times, but only to the block of units next door to 138, with Nartey, to visit his friends Felix and Ugo, who lived on the ground floor. 
31The appellant denied any knowledge of the ""to whom it may concer"" [sic] letter which included his name and the name Stanley Nartey.
32The appellant agreed that he had sent the money transfers that were in his own name but denied sending the others in the names Stanley Nartey and Chidere Udo.  ""Ikechukwu""   was his brother.  He said that it was not him that transferred money out of Australia in the names Stanley Nartey and Chidere Udo, and that it might be just a coincidence that he used the same Western Union outlet on a number of occasions as they did.  He denied ever using fake identification to send money overseas and said that he had never dealt with money that he knew to be proceeds of crime.  
33The appellant agreed that phone 4 was registered in his name but said that Nartey also used that phone.  He denied creating mobile phone accounts in names other than his own, but agreed that the address for 3 of those phones (Birmingham Ave Villawood) was the same street as the Villawood Detention Centre where he had resided for 12 months.  In dealing with the prosecution case, I have already mentioned a number of the appellant's denials of knowledge of other matters that were put to him by counsel.
34He could not explain why various documents in his own name and his wife's name had been found in a plastic bag in the storage room along with documents in the name Stanley Nartey.
35The defence tendered the appellant's resume but this does not seem material to any of the issues in the appeal.  The defence also tendered subscriber details and call charge records for 0432 232552 which the appellant said was his ""old Optus number"" and which showed that that phone was ""inactive"" between 1 April 2010 and 18 October 2010.
The grounds of appeal
36These were set out in a written submission made to the Court, some aspects of which being also the subject of oral submissions by the appellant.  The oral submissions did not take the written submissions further.  For simplicity, this judgment takes the course of dealing with each ground seriatim.  I have not corrected the appellant's language or spelling.  The grounds are clear enough.
Ground 1: On arrival to my home with a warrant, there was no questions on whom lived or continues to live in my home with my wife and I. This was cross examined and the Fed officer admitted to not asking and did not (ask) whom lived in the home at 118 Englorie Park Drive, Glen Alpine. The (p)residing Judge R Tupman did question her and still did not do anything about this.
37As I have already mentioned, the appellant attributed the offences to his cousin Nartey, whom he said had resided with his family until the day before his arrest, and Nartey's friend Chidere Udo.  It is correct, as far as it goes, that the officer simply asked who was present and did not ask who lived at the house although the warrant named a number of persons other than the appellant.  This was established by cross-examination of the officer by Mr English of counsel for the appellant, who made submissions on the point in his address to the jury.  The possibility of other suspects, whose fingerprints might have been those found on the items in the bins and not identified, was (as I understand the submission) not adequately investigated by police.  The prosecution case was not that the appellant had acted alone: he was charged with aiding and abetting the importations, which necessarily assumed others were involved in one way or another.  It was never suggested by the defence that others than Nartey and Chidere Udo had any relevant contact with the appellant.
38It is not clear what the appellant means by complaining that the trial judge ""did nothing about this"".  It was no part of the judge's role to do something about this apparent shortcoming in this aspect of the investigation.  It is true that the issue was not directly mentioned in the summing up, but her Honour made it clear to the jury that the question was whether or not the appellant had committed the relevant incriminating acts.  Ground 2 - The Judge R Tupman made a closing statement that and even went to state that she suggested to the jury to conclude that the picture of the photocopies of the fake licences was a blackman and they should regard that the blackman on trial here has the same similarities if they took into consideration that the shading and the nose and head is similar to him and that the picture is MINE. Then she made a suggestion that the photocopy is the same face as a blackman that appears to be him and that even though the photocopy was not clear Judge Tupman suggestion worked against me during the conclusion of the trial by the jury. This capitalised on the jury and throughout the trial and even the ones that were outside after i was arrested. The main thing i see here is that i was marked because of my race and colour and even though the id was not found and was still being used outside i was found guilty of all charges. 
39This ground of appeal does not fairly accurately represent what the learned trial Judge said to the jury.  Her Honour at no point referred to the appellant as being a black man or, indeed, to his skin colour at all.  The following is an extract of the relevant passages - 
""The Crown says that you would accept, without any doubt, that the photos on the licences are photos of the accused and that you can be certain of that by comparing them with photos found in his possession when the search warrant was executed on 31 August which he, in fact, agrees were photos of him. 
Now, for this particular area of circumstances, that is where there is a dispute and I will come to the argument and the evidence called on behalf of the accused in relation to this circumstance in a moment, but in the Crown's argument, so far as it relates to the Stanley Nartey licence, is this -  that there was a group of photographs found in a plastic bag in a wallet inside the pocket of jeans in the accused's bedroom which contained ten passport photos of three different types.  Two types - these are tendered, of course, you know that is evidence - and, of course, the absence of lots of bits of paper on the bar this morning makes it clear that I sent all the exhibits to you this morning so that you have now got them in the jury room for the rest of the time, but you know that there are three different types of photos.  Two of them were multiple copies of the same photo and one was one photo alone of a person on a white background.  
The accused agreed that the photo of the person on a white background was him.  He also agreed that the photo on the American visa, which you see as part of exhibit AAAAA, the documents taken from the computer hard drive found during the search, was that photo, that is, the photo on a white background found in the wallet in the jeans in his bedroom.
The Crown argues that you would accept that the photo on the fake licence in the name of Stanley Nartey is that photo and is, therefore, a photo of the accused.
The accused denied that the photo on the Stanley Nartey licence was, in fact, a photo of him.  He agreed that the photo in the wallet was him.  He agreed that the photo on the US visa was him and he agreed that the photo on the US visa was the photo that was in the wallet, but he denied that the photo on the Nartey licence was him. 
... [Other parts of the appellant's evidence on this matter were then summarised.] 
... The Crown relies on the finding of that photo and what it says is that clear comparison between the photo on the licence and the photos which the accused agrees are him for you to conclude that, at least, at some stage in the past he allowed that photo to be used to create a licence and they rely on that then as part of the link between the accused, the licence, the setting up of post office boxes and the transferring of money out.
The Crown puts to you that ultimately you would be satisfied, contrary to the evidence of the accused, that that photo on the Stanley Nartey licence is of him ... 
So you are asked to infer then that a person ... opening up a post office box, or transferring money out, has to, in the colloquial - in the vernacular - front the counter, show the identification and, in those circumstances, if you accept that the picture is of him on the licence, he is fronting the counter, showing the identification, the identification is of him, which the Crown relies on by inference to have you accept that, in fact, it was him who used the licence on those occasions to do what he did, that is, set up the post office boxes or transfer the money.
Similarly for Chidere Udo, the Crown relies on the fact that in a white plastic bag in the storage room were found five passport photos.  They were all the same identical photos, and the accused agreed that they were photos of him.  They have been tendered as well.
He was asked to compare them with the photo on the Chidere Udo licence.  He denied that it was him but the Crown puts to you, for the same reason as it does for Stanley Nartey, that you would not accept that evidence and you would, in fact, accept that it was him and for both of the photos this is put to you, that you are not going to need to go to the jury room and try and remember what the accused looked like, when looking at the photos, to see whether you accept it is him or not because you have comparison photos to work from.  You have the photos that the accused agrees are of him, either the ones found in the storage room, or the one found in the wallet in the bedroom. In any event, in both cases, he agrees they are of him, and you are asked by the Crown to compare those with the photos on the two relevant licences, and it is put to you that when you compare such things as the shape of the ears, the shape of the face, the indent above the ear on one side of the head, in particular, and in relation to both photos what is said to be a sort of photographic artefact like over exposure, the way in which the light is, whether it is lighter on one side than the other.
In relation to the Chidere Udo photo, the shadowing on the face, and particularly in relation to the Chidere Udo photo, the shape of the T-shirt, the top of the T-shirt around the neck.  For all of those reasons, the Crown puts this to you as a primary submission, that when you compare them yourselves, the overall pictorial representation will lead you to the view that it is the same person, but even if you are not satisfied on just looking at them, that when you make those comparisons of various aspects of those photographs, which are admittedly of the accused, that you would accept that, in fact, the photos on the relevant licences are, in fact, those same photographs and, in fact, therefore are the accused.
As I have said the accused denied that they were of him and said he had never seen them before ...
The most significant aspect of that evidence overall, from the Crown's perspective, is the assertion that you would accept that those photos are of the accused.  It is a very important part of the Crown case in relation to each of the ten counts in the indictment.  If you are not satisfied about that and if, in fact, that falls away, and unless you are satisfied that Stanley Nartey and Chidere Udo are, in fact, the accused as depicted on those licences, then you would not be able to convict the accused.  It is a very important part of the Crown case and you would have to be satisfied about that, beyond reasonable doubt, in the way in which the Crown has brought this trial before you could convict the accused of any of these ten offences.""
40There was no dispute in the trial that the ""original"" fake licences had not been found.  This was referred to many times during the trial, and was common ground.  The suggestion that ""the id was ... still being used outside"", presumably after the appellant's arrest, was not the subject of any evidence and is to be disregarded. 
41This ground should be rejected. 
Ground 3 - whilst I was being on trial the older white caucasian old fellow amongst the jury members keep falling asleep and i was sitting on stand watching him sleep and wondering why the judge did not pick this up.
42There is no reference in the trial transcript about a juror ""falling asleep"".  I would accept the submission of the Crown prosecutor in this Court that it is most unlikely that this would have gone unnoticed.  The trial judge referred to some ""stifled yawning"" during the prosecutor's closing address and, as was submitted here, showed concern on several occasions that the jury be given proper breaks to ensure their continued attention.  Moreover, the issue was not raised by Mr English, from which it safe to infer both that he had not noticed any problem and the appellant had not told him about it.  The prosecutor did not mention the matter.  I would also infer that none of the legal representatives for either side saw a juror asleep.  I would reject this ground.
Ground 4 - During and following the first week of trial the members on jury came up with several complaints that the rooms which were provided for them was not convenient to them because there were no air conditioning and windows and was too small and they made a expression in writing that if this was not changed then they would result in not having a good result and that resulted in making a bad judgement in 24 hours to finish the trial against me. 
43The issue of the jury's accommodation was raised by the trial judge on the morning of day 12 of the trial, towards the end of the prosecutor's closing address.  Her Honour said - 
""HER HONOUR:  There was also a reason why I couldn't start immediately and the reason is something that I ought to bring to your attention.  The jury in this trial haven't been in a jury room on this floor during the last three weeks ... Yesterday the jury started to tell the court officer about difficulties that they are experiencing in the room that they are in on another floor because it's small and it's claustrophobic, it has no windows, external light, certainly no ability to get outside.  
... The jury representative has told the court officer either this morning or yesterday that the nature of the room is starting to have an impact on their ability to function as a jury.  It's claustrophobic and apart from anything else at the moment the air-conditioning has stopped working.  And he has actually said to the court officer that he fears they will not be able to reach, I think the words - well, the court officer used to me were ""a healthy verdict"" but that it would impact on their ability to deliberate once they're asked to do so particularly in circumstances where they're going out with 150 exhibits if they're told to stay in that room.""
44The judge then adjourned to make enquiries and, on resuming, informed counsel - 
""I have found an alternate room which is not the one I wanted but it's a better option with air conditioning and a window. So what I'm going to do is I'll get the jury back in, we can continue with the address, the court officer will change the rooms and they'll go back to the new room. And if there's a problem, then they'll let him know.""
After discussing another matter with counsel, her Honour instructed the court officer to move the jury to the new room.  Soon after, the jury returned to the court and the foreperson was asked about the adequacy of the room.  The foreperson said, ""I think so"" and, although it was the same size, ""it has a big window and the air conditioning works ...""  There was a question, however, whether the room would be able to accommodate the exhibits once the jury retired.  The judge assured the jury that another room would be available by that time. 
45On the following morning the judge received a note from the jury - 
""Have you spoken to [the court officer] this morning about the layout and dimensions of our new jury room, we have decided that it would be best if we move back to our original room on Monday when the exhibits are brought down from the court room. There are tables in our original room that could be used to display the exhibits and the layout is slightly more flexible. Thanks for your consideration and for your efforts in securing a better room for us. Foreman.""
Her Honour told the jury that arrangements were being made for a better room.  Mr English continued his closing address, concluding before the luncheon adjournment and the jury were sent away until 2 pm but sent home about 2.15pm, the judge commenting (in their absence) that a better room had indeed been found.  46At the start of proceedings the next day a note was received from the jury. 
""The jury wish to let you know that the new room we have been moved into today is more than satisfactory.  There is a window and a balcony, the air conditioning works, and there is plenty of room to display the exhibits. Thank you for your efforts.""  
Shortly after this, Mr English made a short supplementary address, and the judge commenced summing up.  The jury were sent home before lunch that day for the weekend and directed to return at 11am on Monday 20 February 2012.  On Monday the summing up was completed and the jury retired at 1.40pm.  Before sending the jury out, her Honour told them - 
""...what I will do at 4 is if we have not heard anything from you I will ask [the court officer] to come and knock on the door and see how you are going and see whether if we wait around a bit longer today it is likely that you can deliver verdict in the trial or if you want to go home or even if you cannot deliver verdicts whether you want to wait a bit longer anyway and I will be guided by what you say at that stage and if you have not reached your verdicts by close of play this afternoon whatever time that happens to be then we will resume tomorrow and take it from there and I will hear from you when you need to contact me. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.""
47The jury were recalled at 1.47pm for a few minutes for a character direction.  At 4pm the jury were permitted to disperse until the next day. On 21 February 2012, the jury continued deliberating from 10am.  At ""about 3 o'clock"" a note had been received from the jury to the effect that they had reached verdicts on all counts.  At 3.33pm the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all 10 counts.
48This ground of appeal can be shortly dealt with.  It is evident that, almost as soon as the judge became aware of the problem, she took steps to deal with it and it was satisfactorily resolved, as the jury itself indicated.  Nor was there the slightest pressure placed on the jury to take less time than was needed to consider their verdicts.  This ground should be rejected.
Ground 5 - During the first weeks of the trial the one jury member informed Judge Tupman she had to be gone by the weekend due to a booked holiday to the states and flew out on the friday. Judge Tupman explained this to the barrister and they did not see anything wrong with having one less member if need be. Then as the time went on there were more flimsy excuses to going to a wedding ceremony on the weekend and needed to know if it would finish. After listening to all these excuses the judge hurried the trial up and finished with her conclusion about the blackman has the same head, face and lips and nose to mine as the black and white picture of the fake id. And that the jury should take that into consideration and find me guilty of all cases. 
49On Tuesday, 14 February 2012, the judge received a note from the jury raising three issues - 
(a) Juror R has previously booked holiday commitments for Friday the 17th to Monday the 20th and requests that the jury be dismissed at 2pm on Friday and return 11am on Monday should the trial still be running.
(b) Juror X has previously booked travel commitments to the US for one month and will need to be fully dismissed by Thursday the 23rd.
(c) The university year commences on Monday the 27th and the juror will be going to Uni.
50After discussing the timetable with counsel, her Honour said to the jury - 
""Good morning, ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry about the disruption of yesterday, there were some matters that we needed to deal with of a legal nature before I could continue with the trial, that's now been dealt with and we are now in a position to proceed.  As I said the first thing will be the Crown will address you and then Mr English and then I will sum-up.  That will probably take us the next two or three days and in that context I have your note and everything will be fine.  As for the juror who has holidays from Friday to Monday, yes, there's no difficulty about us finishing at 2 o'clock on Friday and resuming no earlier than 11 on Monday.  I suspect that you will still be here on Friday at the very least.  You'll probably be considering your verdicts at that stage and it's possible that we will have just finished the addresses and summing-up but that's not a problem and as for the other two I don't see any reason why it won't be over by then so there's no problem in any event.""
51Issue (b) was referred to again (in the absence of the jury) on Wednesday 15 February 2012.  The judge stated that the jury should be able to retire ""at the latest Monday lunchtime, [and] that that will give them enough time to return the verdicts but I guess it's always possible that it won't ...""  The possibility of continuing (if necessary) with only 11 jurors was tentatively raised but no decision made.  On resumption the following day another jury note was received, which said -
""Juror X will be leaving for the United States on Friday 24 February for a month, I will be available until 4pm Thursday if required.' 
Her Honour responded, ""[thank] you for information about when that juror needs to leave, I've got that in mind.""  No further action was taken.  I agree with the submission made here by the Crown that none was required to be made at that stage.
52After the jury retired to deliberate, the following exchange occurred (I set this out as it appears in the transcript, but the language suggests that the exchange involved Mr English rather than the Crown Prosecutor, at least at the early stage.  I do not think that anything turns on this.) - 
""ENGLISH: Can I just clarify two things your Honour, first is that your Honour is content to let the US person deliberate until it's time for them to go. 
HER HONOUR:  Well yes, I've been trying to - well look I suppose, do you want me to go and stop them now so that we can have this debate because if I'm not going to -  
CROWN PROSECUTOR:   I'm in your Honour's hands, I'm not pressing it, I just want to -  
HER HONOUR:  If I'm not going to I should stop it now. 
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. I'm not pressing it your Honour. I just wanted to clarify that that's what your Honour - I suppose - 
HER HONOUR:  I had thought about it.  
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.  
HER HONOUR:  I'm hoping that they will have delivered their verdicts by then but of course from the accused's perspective or from the Crown too but particularly from the accused's perspective, we don't want jurors feeling under any form of stress or duress or time pressure. But it is now halfway through the day on Monday, they've got a half day plus all Tuesday plus all Wednesday. I think it's probably open to take the risk and then deal with the problem if it arises. I don't quite know how and again the only issue would be if the person who is no longer there has played such a pivotal role in the jury's deliberations that there would be a different scenario should that person not be there.  
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Which we'll never know.
HER HONOUR:  Which we'd never know and would be contrary to the directions I gave them anyway that they all had to play an equal role.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.
HER HONOUR:  I don't think there's any law is there that says that I can't discharge a juror once they've started deliberating.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  No.
HER HONOUR:  I think there's sort of a--
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  It's quite to the opposite, you can --
HER HONOUR:  I can discharge them whenever if necessary and of course, if you know god forbid, somebody should get sick or die or something like that then that wouldn't be, even though on verdict, that wouldn't be a reason to necessarily discharge the whole jury.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Thank you your Honour.
HER HONOUR:  Mr English you might have to give some thought to that if we get that far about--
ENGLISH:  I'll take it on notice, I'm with my friend, I'm in your Honour's hands at the moment but look if we reach a stage where it needs further thought and consultation I'll respond.
ENGLISH: I'll take it on notice, I'm with my friend, I'm in your Honour's hands at the moment but look if we reach a stage where it needs further thought and consultation I'll respond.""
53It is clear that Mr English agreed with the approach taken by the judge.  In particular, he did not submit that the juror should have been informed by the judge that, if the jury had not completed its deliberations by the time he needed to go, he would be forced to remain.  The assessment that the time available until the expiration of the period stipulated by the juror should be sufficient for the jury to reach its verdicts was plainly that of both judge and counsel, whose appreciation of the question was informed by the course of the trial.  Plainly enough, the jury was alive to the issue and it is reasonable to infer that, had they thought the juror's impending departure might create a problem, they would have brought the matter again to the attention of the judge.  In my view, although the judge might well have taken another course, it was reasonable and open to her Honour - especially in light of the approach of defence counsel - to take the course she in the end adopted. 
54Issue (c) was not raised again.  It was appropriately dealt with by the judge. 
55There is nothing in the transcript of evidence or the judge's directions that suggests that the judge said anything that may have pressured the jury to bring in its verdicts before it was ready or from which it might have gathered that it should hurry its consideration of the evidence.  As to the complaint that the judge directed the jury that the appellant was the man in the ""fake ID"" and the jury should ""find me guilty"", nothing said by her Honour could have been construed in this way.  Moreover, Mr English made no application for a re-direction in this regard. 
Ground 6 - During the trial the Judge had my facts and there were all the documents about western union and money gram and never did she add them, but she judged me on 500,000 aud dollors and she gave me a sentence of five times 100,000aud and the end result gave me 6 years for a figure that was incorrect. This shows the Judge was biased against me being a black man and nigerian that money laundering where there was no CCT to say it was me but the black and white photo copy which Judge Tupman says is me.  
56The appellant's sentences provide no basis for suggesting that the judge was biased against him.  Nor, as I have already explained, did her Honour express any opinion about the identity of the person depicted in the fake licences but simply summed up the arguments put to the jury by prosecution and defence counsel.  I deal with the complaints about sentence when addressing the sentence appeal. Ground 7 - During the trial the DPP gave me a interpreter that was speaking in english, and was employed by them to give my statements to and that the Judge could not even understand, so she made me speak for myself, This person fell asleep several times and was woken up at least three times during the day by the security court officers.
57The appellant commenced giving his evidence with the assistance of an interpreter but it is clear that he was answering many of the questions in English, which would then be repeated by the interpreter.  This problem often arises when a witness has a working knowledge of English and the interpreter is somewhat inexperienced.  The problem was first raised by the judge - 
""MR ENGLISH:  Where were you working?
A.  WITNESS:  I work in construction job I working.
HER HONOUR
Q.  You're actually answering this in English so perhaps you can just speak up and answer it in English.  I mean, the interpreter is not here to interpret your English into his English, he's here to interpret Ibo into English.  But if you can answer in English please do so and to speak so the jury can understand you?   
A.  INTERPRETER:  I worked so that--
Q.  I just heard an English word ""construction"" you're doing exactly what I told you not to do.
[The jury took the luncheon adjournment and her Honour raised the matter with counsel]   HER HONOUR:  Now, Mr English, I've noticed this about the last 10 or 15 minutes and I wasn't going to say anything about it but the interpreter is not here to say in English exactly what the witness has said in English but to say it more loudly in a different tone of voice.  The interpreter is here to interpret from a language other than English into English and back into that language if the witness doesn't understand.  The jury will be told to make an assessment of the witness in deciding whether or not to accept if he's a reliable witness.  
He can answer perfectly well that last question that you asked him which is, ""I go it from work.  Where were you working?""  And he said in perfectly understandable although soft in volume English, ""I worked in the construction industry.""  Now, I heard that.  He said it to the interpreter who would have then gone on to the jury and said in a louder voice, ""He says he worked in the construction industry.""  He's not here to repeat what he says, he's here to translate. 
And then when I made that point your client then said something in a lower voice including the word ""construction"" in English.  Now, it may be that he was using a combination of Ibo and English but I just think it's important that if he can answer in English then he do so because the jury has been asked to make an assessment of him as a witness, he has to let them do that and he can speak some English and he can understand some English.
ENGLISH:  I take your Honour's point and I think Mr Chime has heard that and I will have another word with him at lunchtime.
HER HONOUR:  And I'm sure that the last answer given more softly was a combination of other words and the English word, ""construction"" and that's not unusual for people whose first language isn't English to combine words from another language and English together and that's fine but it's time I think that if he's going to give his own evidence he gives his own evidence where he can.
ENGLISH:  Your Honour's point is noted.
HER HONOUR:  Mr Crown, you didn't make the point and take the point but I have been noticing that this has been happening for about the last 15 or 20 minutes and it just seemed to me it was time to bring it to an end.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I'm grateful to your Honour.'
58When the Appellant's evidence in chief re-commenced after lunch, Mr English said to him -  
""... If you feel confident enough to answer the question in English please do so to the microphone. If you need to speak in Ibo to the interpreter that's fine or if you need to speak in a combination perhaps in English and Ibo to the interpreter that's fine but please speak up so every time, even when you are speaking to the interpreter, we can still hear the words you say. Is that okay?
A. WITNESS: Yes.'
59The transcript then shows the evidence of the appellant was almost all given in English and the matter was not again raised.  In particular, there was no apparent difficulty on the part of the appellant in understanding or answering the questions.  Indeed, he does not claim in his submissions that he did have such a difficulty.  Nor did Mr English take any objection or make any submission about any language difficulty.  There is no merit in this ground of appeal.  Since the interpreter's services were not called upon, except on a few occasions (when no complaint was made), whether or not he slept at some times is immaterial.   
Ground 8 - My legal representative would not put any of my witness up as he took upon himself to say there was not enough evidence on me and that it was purely a circumstancial one. So i don't need anyone to verify someone lived at my house. The DPP were told several times by my wife she recognised the address and it was of a felix that i know and they never followed any of the leads. As they felt i was the one and that it was easy to sentence me as im in custody.
60At the end of the hearing on 6 February, whilst his client was still in cross-examination, Mr English indicated that he might call Mrs Chime but did not expect to call any other witnesses.  On the following day he said he had decided not to call Mrs Chime and, in effect, his case would close with the completion of the appellant's evidence.
61Although the appellant suggests that his wife would have been able to give evidence that the Canley Vale address was that of Felix, no other witness is suggested as having been available to verify his evidence about who lived at his house during the relevant period.  Of course, if Mrs Chime were called, it may be that her evidence about other matters might well not have supported the appellant's case.  This is impossible to assess, as the Court has not been provided by the appellant with any proof or other statement of the evidence that she may have been able to give.  Without knowing what the evidence of Mrs Chime (or, for that matter, the other unidentified witnesses) might have been the appellant is not in a position to show that their absence produced any miscarriage of justice, which is the essential character of a ground of appeal of this kind.   62A recent (and, with respect, helpful) iteration of the relevant principles is contained in the judgment of Hoeben JA (as his Honour then was, with whom RS Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreed) in Salmon v R [2012] NSWCCA 119 -   
""[127] Before dealing with specific submissions by the appellant, it is useful to set out the principles applicable to a ground of appeal raising incompetence of counsel. In Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113 Simpson J, with whom Hoeben and Price JJ agreed, said - 
'[155] The principles applicable to the determination of a ground of appeal raising alleged incompetence of counsel were settled in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Those principles include -
2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.
3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.' (p 685, per Gleeson CJ).  
[156] Earlier, Gleeson CJ had said - 
'As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case.' (p 683). 
[157] The Chief Justice cited, and plainly accepted, a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, Vol 3(1), par 518 at 420 which is in the following terms - 
'... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment.' (p 684).
[158] The decision in Birks was essentially endorsed by the High Court in TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. There, Gleeson CJ said - 
'16 It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks.'
[128] Hunt CJ at CL made observations to similar effect in Ignjatic v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 336 - 
'Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instructions or even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstance of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this court will interfere'."" 
63There is no basis to suspect that the decisions made by Mr English in deciding what witnesses to call were attended by any mistake or negligence.  Nor is there any ground for suspecting that the appellant's defence was compromised by those decisions, let alone that there was any miscarriage of justice.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal must fail. 
Ground 9 - Judge tupman and the DPP were purely stating that I was the one as it was my photo and they both had proof that there was someone else involved and change the details and charges and sentence to give me a result over the average sentencing as per the courts.
64The judge at no time expressed an opinion about the identification of the appellant.  The prosecution case, as summarised by the judge, was that the appellant did not act alone but that he had aided and abetted others in the importation of the drugs.  As to the particular acts alleged by the prosecution to have been committed by the appellant in furtherance of the importation, of course there was an issue as to whether they were done by him or someone else. This controversy was fairly summed up by her Honour and (rightly) no complaint or application for redirection was made by Mr English in this respect.
65In his oral submissions, the appellant contended that a delivery of drugs had been made whilst he was in custody following his arrest and this demonstrated that he was not guilty (at least in respect of those drugs).  Produced to this Court and tendered without objection are copies of police material concerning deliveries made after August 2010.  One of the deliveries referred to in the documents is that of an item ED00279620IN, which was the subject of evidence in the trial, delivered to Rosemeadow Post Office, and collected on 23 August 2010 by someone who signed ""Nartley"".  This is presently irrelevant.   An Evidence Transfer Form relating to ""white powder concealed in handbags testing positive for cocaine ..."" addressed to ""Stanley Nartery, PO Box 6159 Canley Vale NSW 2166"" was exhibited in the trial.  It too is presently irrelevant.  The only delivery to which the appellant's submission can refer was also the subject of evidence in the trial, elicited by Mr English in his cross-examination of Federal Agent Hardy - 
""Q.  You'll agree with me won't you that since he's been in custody more packages containing drugs have arrived in Australia addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road Canley Vale?A.  I would have to check the records on that.
Q.  You're not aware of another package that arrived in Australia containing drugs that was addressed to Simone Davies at 138 Lansdowne Road Canley Vale?A.  Yes I have heard that name, yes.
Q.  That arrived in Australia in the period after Mr Chime had been arrested?A.  I'd have to rely on -  
Q.  You'd accept it from me?A.  I'll accept that yes.""
66The prosecutor clarified the issue to some degree in re-examination -
""Q.  You were asked whether ... packages were addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road?A.  I know that there were packages addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road Canley Vale, yes. Q.  Were you aware whether they arrived in Australia past Mr Chime's arrest?A.  Again I would have to check the Customs dates of arrival, but I'm aware of at least one arriving after his arrest.
Q.  Is that the one that was addressed to Simone Davies?A.  Yes.
Q.  Did you know the basic information about Simone Davies?A.  Not really, no.
Q.  Do you know whether that person is a male or female person?A.  No.
Q.  You don't know?
A.  I'd assume it's female because it's the same name as my name, but again it's assumption.  I don't have any knowledge of a person named Simone Davies.""
67In his closing address, Mr English submitted that the matter was significant in the following way - 
""You might also recall me asking Federal Agent Hardy, during the cross examination, about her knowledge of other parcels containing drugs that were addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road, Canley Vale, which arrived into Australia after Mr Chime's arrest and detention in prison.  You may recall Federal Agent Hardy's evidence that she was aware of one such parcel: addressed to a Simone Davies at 138 Lansdowne Road.  But apart from that, you may recall that, when Federal Agent Hardy was re-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, she said that she did not know any basic information about Simone Davies.  Now, you might think that the police investigating the importation of further parcels carrying drugs addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road, Canley Vale would be relevant to determining the true suspect and whether the true suspect was arrested and detained on 31 August 2010.""
68It seems to me that Mr English made of this evidence the best that could be made, namely it perhaps pointed to some shortcoming in the extent of the police investigation (though he had not actually asked about this).  It certainly did not suggest that the appellant had not been involved in the charges of which he was convicted.  There is no merit in the appellant's contention.
69Also in oral submissions on the hearing of the appeal, the appellant sought to rely on evidence that had become available pursuant to subpoenas issued for the purposes of the appeal, relating to the existence of Felix.  The appellant, in substance, argued that his credit had been attacked on the basis, inter alia, that Felix did not exist and, furthermore, that proof of his existence gave substantive support to his case that others had created the false licences.  The appellant also submitted that his reason for going to Lansdowne Road was an innocent one, namely to visit his friend Felix.
70Tendered in the appeal (without objection) was a printout of Roads & Maritime Services Address Usage History which showed that the addresses recorded for Felix Ikechuga Ugomba included Unit 11, 136 Landsdowne Road, Canley Vale NSW 2166, effective from 24 April 2009 to 16 August 2011.  The photograph attached to the record shows a person of African appearance but it does not resemble the photos of the appellant or that in the copies of the fake licence.  Counsel for the Crown conceded that this showed the person Felix in fact existed and resided at some stage in Lansdowne Road.  Also tendered without objection on the appeal was a copy of the visitor's application forms for the Villawood Detention Centre.  Amongst these are applications from ""Felix Ugombe"" on 10 February and 8 March 2009, who gave as his address 19 Charles Street, Liverpool.  The question which follows, of course, is the significance, if any, of this evidence.
71The existence of Felix was disclosed first in the trial by the appellant in his evidence in chief.  As referred to above, the appellant said that Felix had used the computers upstairs in his residence with Nartey and Udo and had once used his passport photo to create a profile on a dating website.  There was evidence from the phone records of messages from Mrs Chime about this profile which, she believed, had been created by him.  He apparently explained that his picture had been used by another, as his wife messaged (on 9 February 2010, using a phone ending with 367 to phone 3) - 
""If not u I want to speak 2 who did it to find out y and I want all ur emails if u can't give me then I know it was u and I want a apology and respect I diserve [sic].""
72As well, the appellant said he and Nartey had visited Felix and Udo at their unit in a block of units next to 138 Lansdowne Road, on the last occasion his wife driving with Nartey.  In cross-examination he said that Nartey's friends, including Felix, would use the phones.  He was cross-examined about the use of his passport photo - 
""Q.  Mr Chime, you say in respect of Felix using your passport photo on the Tag website that the only thing about you that was there was the photograph, is that correct?A.  WITNESS:  Yes. Q.  Not your name?A.  WITNESS:  No.
Q.  Not your address?A.  WITNESS:  No.
Q.  Not an old address?A.  WITNESS:  There's no address--
Q.  Not an old address?A.  WITNESS:  No address in website.
Q.  No phone number?A.  WITNESS:  No.
Q.  Not your email?A.  WITNESS:  No.
Q.  Nothing about you at all except your picture?A.  WITNESS:  Yes.
Q.  You said your wife found out about it whilst she was in Melbourne?A.  WITNESS:  Yes.
Q.  How did she find out about it?A.  WITNESS:  Because the profile app add to mine, my own website, my profile add.  So when she - she call my email, when she opened my, and checked my, she find out I had another face there add to my own profile and she open it, and is my face.  She think maybe I open another one.
Q.  That's not true, is it, you're making all this up, aren't you?A.  WITNESS:  No.""
73In terms this appears to be an allegation that the appellant had fabricated his evidence about Felix's use of his passport photo.  However, the prosecutor put the wider question - 
""Q.  And you were the person who provided the address of 138 Lansdowne  Road, Canley Vale as a delivery address for one of those packages containing drugs?A.  WITNESS:  No.
Q.  And the evidence that you gave about your friends living next door was not true, was it?A.  WITNESS:  It is.
Q.  You made that up to explain why the GPS had been close to the premises at 138 Lansdowne Road?A.  WITNESS:  No.""
74The jury asked, at the close of the evidence - 
""The Crown suggested that Felix and Ugo did not actually live in the block of red brick units adjacent to 138 Lansdowne Road.  Is there any evidence that this is indeed the case or otherwise?""
The judge answered this question as follows - 
""Then the next question is, ""The Crown suggested that Felix and Ugo did not actually live in the block of red brick units adjacent to 138 Lansdowne Road.  Is there any evidence that this is indeed the case or otherwise?""  There is no evidence about that fact.  You might recall that I've just checked the transcript that what the Crown put to Mr Chime was that he made up the evidence that he gave that said that these two lived in a block of units next door to a 138 Lansdowne Road so that you could find an explanation as for why the GPS travelled to Lansdowne Road and that in fact it wasn't true.  He denied that and that's the state of the evidence.  The evidence is the accused's denial of that proposition.  Questions are not answers, I will probably repeat that to you in the formal directions that I give you.  You're not entitled to use as evidence propositions that are put in questions unless in fact either they're agreed with by the person to whom they're put or there is other evidence from which you accept the truth of the assertions that's put in the questions. So there is no other evidence and Mr Chime denied that he made it up.""
75Not surprisingly, the matter was taken up by the prosecutor in his address to the jury but in a somewhat qualified manner - 
""You have heard that the Crown case is that Mr Chime was the person who was responsible for the provision of the address, 138 Lansdowne Road, to whomever it was overseas, and you've heard evidence that a GPS that was seized from a car at 118 Englorie Park Road revealed that the GPS at least had been in the vicinity of 138 Lansdowne Road on two occasions that the Crown says are relevant to the deliveries that occurred there.  
Now, Mr Chime, in his evidence, didn't deny that he had been to 138 Lansdowne Road - I withdraw that - didn't deny that he had been to Lansdowne Road, but he denied that he had been to 138.  He said he had been to visit some friends next door, who he described as Felix and U G  O.  You might think it's quite extraordinary that his friends would live next door to the abandoned house where the package, or number of packages, had been addressed, but that was his evidence.
...  
... There was no need to send a consignment number in this case, because there was no-one living at 138 Lansdowne Road and all someone had to do was to go and retrieve what you would expect to find in the letter box, which would be an attempt to deliver notice, and then trot off down to the post office to pick it up.  
The GPS went to 138 Lansdowne Road on 4 June and on 13 July.  Now 4 June is about a month before the date of the first count.  There could be a number of reasons why he went there on that day, and it could have been to scope the place out, to see where it was, to try and find a location that was convenient to send it to.  It may have been selected because it was next door to where Felix and Ugo lived, much in the same way that 155 was across the road from 118.  It may have been selected because they had people who could keep an eye on it.  It may have just been random - the story about Felix and Ugo may be just a lie, but the fact is that those packages were addressed to 138 Lansdowne Road, and that address was sent to a mobile phone that was found in the home of Mr Chime."" [Emphasis added.]
76Even if the prosecutor resiled from the allegation that the appellant had fabricated the existence of Felix, he was certainly contending that the jury would not accept the appellant's evidence about it.  As a practical matter, whether Felix existed or not did not, of itself, matter to the Crown case.  Indeed, in some respects the fact (if it were the fact) that he lived at 136 Lansdowne Road strengthened the case, since it was another contact between the appellant and 138 Lansdowne Road and the appellant would have, when visiting Felix, been aware that it was vacant; the situation also, as the prosecutor pointed out, reflected the proximity between the appellant's residence and the drop-off address across the road.  That it was Felix, rather than some other person, who had used the appellant's passport photo on the dating website also mattered little.  From the text messages it seems clear that his photo was on the site and he had told his wife someone else had used it.  The real question was whether it was the appellant who had used his photo in that way.  The mere existence of Felix, even at his house, did not do more than give rise to the logical possibility that he had done it.  (The jury also might have found it curious that, if he had named him, Mrs Chime did not use the name Felix in her demand to speak to the person to whom he attributed the profile to her even though he was, on the appellant's case, a visitor to his home.)
77In the end, however, the appellant's evidence that Felix existed and lived at 136 Lansdowne Road was true.  The prosecutor invited the jury to disbelieve him.  The RMS record would have supported his credibility as to this issue and the credibility of the appellant lay at the centre of the case, since he had so much material he needed to explain.  In my view, the missing verification of Felix's existence and his residing in Lansdowne Road is of trivial significance in the face of the overwhelming evidence of the appellant's involvement in the importation of the drugs.  To take one crucial item of evidence - the images on the copies on the fake licences - to my eye they are indeed identical to the images on the passport photos in the sense that they are copies of those photographs, a fact made obvious by comparing in particular the way in which the placing of light and shade is identical and the position of the neckline of his tee-shirt.  The fact that the fake licences must have been produced when collecting mail from the post office boxes and making the money transfers strongly supports the inference that he collected the mail and made the transfers, although it may be that, on some occasions the employee may not have looked closely at the photos or made a mistake (but not for Felix, whose face is very different).  This necessity also strengthens the inference that the appellant created the licences rather than someone else without his knowledge.  Other powerful evidence of the appellant's involvement comprises: the heroin on the knives in the en-suite to his bedroom; the fingerprints on the material in the bin; his fingerprint on the Moneygram receipt; cross-links in the money transfer documents; possession of the mobile phones cross-linked in various ways with details of consignment numbers, addresses, box numbers and his personal information of different kinds; that ""Uche"" is plainly short for ""Uchenna""; and the proximity of the addresses to his home and the place where he visited Felix.  Nor is this a complete list.
78It is clear enough that the RMS records would have been available had any reasonable enquiry been made.  It is unknown whether the defence had this material and declined to use it (perhaps because of Felix's photo) or had not sought to obtain it.  However, it is not fresh, as distinct from new, evidence.  The appellant must demonstrate that, because the evidence was not available to the jury, there was a miscarriage of justice: see the summary of the relevant principles by Kirby J (Mason P and Levine J agreeing) in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63], which it is not necessary to repeat here.  It is obvious that the new evidence, though credible, is insufficient to give rise to a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt of any of the charges; nor is there reasonable possibility that, had the evidence been available to the jury, it might, acting reasonably, have acquitted the accused: Gallagher v The Queen, (1986) 160 CLR 392 per Mason and Deane JJ at 402; Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301-302.  
79Accordingly, there has been no miscarriage of justice arising out of the absence of the RMS records and it is unnecessary to consider whether acquittal or a new trial should be ordered.  This ground must be dismissed.
Conclusion as to conviction appeal
80In my view none of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant, whether in his written submissions or orally at the hearing, have any merit and I propose the appeal against conviction be dismissed.
Sentence appeal 
81Following the appellant's conviction on 21 February 2011, the sentence proceedings were set for hearing on 25 May 2012, but were adjourned on the appellant's application, as his barrister had recently withdrawn and because he wished to provide some information to police by way of ""assistance"".  The proceedings on sentence were heard on 13 July 2012 and, on 18 July 2012 the appellant was sentenced to a head term of 12 years commencing on 31 August 2010 with a non-parole period of 7 years.
82Each of the ""drug offences"" carried a maximum penalty of 25 years.  The judge indicated that, while the circumstances of each offence were ""more or less the same"" she intended to treat the offences as falling into 3 rough categories, (largely based, it appears, on the pure quantities of drug imported).  Thus sentences were imposed as follows -
2 years  Count 1 (42.3 grams heroin - 21 times marketable qty) from 31 August 2010Count 2 (64.7 grams cocaine - 32 times marketable qty) from 30 November 2011
3 years Count 3 (174 grams heroin - 87 times marketable qty) from 28 February 2011Count 4 (106 grams MAM - 53 times marketable qty) from 28 February 2011Count 5 (116.7 grams cocaine - 58 times marketable qty) from 31 August 2011Count 6 (estimated - more than 2 grams heroin) from 29 February 2012Count 7 (158.6 grams methamphetamine - 79 times marketable qty) from 31 August 2012Count 9 (159 grams cocaine - 79 times marketable qty) from 31 August 2014
4 years Count 8 (332.1 grams heroin - 166 times marketable qty) 31 August 2013
83The ""proceeds of crime"" charge, pursuant to s 400.1 of the Criminal Code attracted a maximum of 20 years and involved a large number of small transactions occurring over a lengthy period, and which ultimately totalled over $500,000.  A sentence of 6 years was imposed for this offence commencing 31 August 2016.  
84It appears that the judge made a mistake in respect of the sentence for count 6.  Her Honour had indicated an intention to impose a sentence of 2 years for Count 6 on the basis that it fell within the lower end of marketable quantities but, when formerly announcing the sentence for this count, a 3 year term (29/2/12 to 28/2/15) was imposed.  The Crown brought the error to our attention and conceded that it needed to be corrected.
Objective circumstances
85The facts of the offences are sufficiently set out above in dealing with the conviction appeal.  The judge summarised the appellant's involvement as at least that of ""an intermediary involving quite a degree of planning on his part"".  He obtained false identification documents and opened the post office boxes used to import the drugs.  He was a party to identifying the residential addresses.  He took steps to create authorities to take delivery from post offices in assumed names.  His role included involvement in the unpacking and ultimate delivery of the drugs, as demonstrated by the heroin found on the knives in the en suite in his bedroom and the packaging in his garbage bin.  He participated in transfers of very substantial sums which involved the proceeds of similar drug offences and enabled the drug importation business to be undertaken.  The trial judge considered (with respect, rightly) his role to be significantly more than that of a courier.  He would have continued with these offences had he not been arrested.  They were committed for financial gain.
Subjective features
86The following is taken from the judge's sentencing remarks.  The appellant was 36 years of age at the date of sentence.  He is a Nigerian citizen, coming from a poor family and with little formal education.  His employment ended because of difficulties which led to him being threatened.  As a result he left Nigeria in 2006 and went to live in China for two years on a working visa, where he ran a business supplying businesses in Nigeria with Chinese goods.  He met his wife there.  When his visa ran out in 2008 he came to Australia where his application for a protection visa was rejected and he was held for a period in immigration detention at Villawood.  He married his wife whilst in detention in 2009 and returned overseas to apply for a spouse visa which was successful.  He returned to Australia in September 2009 and lived here with his wife and her children helping her with her clothing import business and also undertaking some casual work as a welder in the construction industry.  From November 2009, however, the appellant commenced the offending for which he was convicted, when he started to send funds overseas which were the proceeds of crime. 
87A psychologist's (Dr John Jacmon) report was tendered giving the opinion that the appellant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the threats that were made to him before he left Nigeria in 2006, as disclosed in the history provided by the appellant.  The judge noted that the psychologist did not have available to him the evidence in the trial that the appellant's criminal activities involved a significant degree of planning, ""including the obtaining of and use of false identity documents, forwarding only the sums of money which would be below detection levels by financial institutions, forwarding sums of money therefore on more than one occasion on the same day but in different parts of Sydney, again to avoid detection, and similar evidence"".  Her Honour's view that this was ""not the behaviour of a person whose day to day functioning or memory and concentration or problem solving and decision making is impaired"" should be accepted.  At the same time, her Honour accepted that the appellant had some ongoing post-traumatic stress disorder and was suffering from anxiety and distress as a result of his situation.  Accordingly, she considered his prospects of rehabilitation would benefit if he received some treatment for these both whilst in custody and once his gaol term has finished.  There was no evidence that he suffered from poor health.  Her Honour took into account, in setting the non-parole period, that the appellant is Nigerian and did not speak English well, which would make his experience of prison more onerous and more isolating. 
88As the judge observed, there is little more known about the offender.  Although his prior good character entitled him to some leniency, her Honour regarded the ongoing nature of the offences over an extensive period meant that his prior good character was of limited significance.  The support of his wife and her children was a favourable factor in respect of the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation but, as her Honour noted, he was living with them at the time he committed the offences and much of the evidence on which he was convicted was found in the house in which they all lived.  There was no evidence of any particular hardship to his family as a result of any period of custody.  
89The judge then dealt with material which was put forward as evidence of the appellant's assistance.  This comprised a statement made by the appellant to the authorities.  Her Honour described it as ""a restatement of the evidence which the offender gave at trial in which he asserted that Stanley Nartey and Chidere Udo were, in fact, genuine people who were responsible for these offences"", an account which the jury clearly rejected, and known to the authorities from the trial itself, at least.  The judge (with respect, correctly) dismissed the statement both as assistance to authorities and as evidence of contrition or remorse.   
90As with the conviction appeal, I propose to deal with each ground seriatim.
Ground 1 - Comparative sentencing of both charges was not used, I believed the judged (sic) erred and went above and over the normal sentence of both charges.
91In substance, this appears to be a complaint that sentence was manifestly excessive, that is, unreasonably or unjustly severe, either when considered alone or when compared with ""normal sentences"" for these offences.  Of course, even if it were the case that members of this Court, may have imposed lower (or, for that matter, higher) sentences, this would not be sufficient to establish the discretion of the primary judge miscarried.  The same necessarily applies to sentences imposed by other judges in other, though similar cases, although they might well inform the fundamental question.
92The primary judge was provided with a table of ""comparative"" cases by the prosecutor.  Her Honour considered that, although the table was useful, the offences were not identical, nor were the quantities of drugs involved and the circumstances of the offending.  Moreover, the offenders in most cases had pleaded guilty.  I would respectfully agree with her Honour and likewise regard the cases of little assistance.  They certainly do not demonstrate that the sentences passed on the appellant were excessively severe either individually or as a totality.  Considering the sentences in isolation, I am not persuaded that they exceeded the discretionary range available to the primary judge.  Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal. Ground 2 - Her Honour did not consider the psychologist report done by the government appointed psychologist, stating that because it was done by video-link, that it wasn't thorough enough. If that is the case, then why did she not order a new one and make sure it was done in person. The psychologist had 25 years of experience and offered to speak on my behalf but the judge rejected that as well. I have been seeing psychologist in Villawood detention centre and also the prison up to date. I feel that she should be taking my medical condition into consideration in the sentencing.
93There was no report from any ""government appointed psychologist"".  Since his examination was conducted by video link, it can be inferred that the report is, in fact, that of Dr John Jacmon, who was engaged by the appellant's lawyers.  It is clear that, contrary to the appellant's submission, the judge did consider the report and discussed its significance in sentencing the appellant.  Her Honour's conclusion as to its limited significance, which was based on Dr Jacmon not having available and thus being unable to take into account the evidence of the appellant's criminal activities over the extensive period involved, was, with respect, entirely justified.  
94That the appellant's interview with Dr Jacmon was conducted by video link had been mentioned by her Honour during submissions, immediately after reading the report on the Bench after it was tendered -  
""HER HONOUR: ... One of the problems about these reports just handed up like this Mr El-Hanania [the appellant's solicitor] is that the verdicts of guilty and the evidence on which they were based suggest a degree of reasoning and thinking which is entirely inconsistent with the opinion that Dr Jacmon has offered in that report.  
The person who committed these offences was organised, clear thinking, able to arrange affairs so as to be an attempt to conceal his identity.  Able to transfer money in false names and to actually engage in a fairly complex system whereby these drugs came to Australia in a way were, because of the steps that he had taken, aiding and abetting their importation, it was very difficult to detect that they were being imported to Australia.  That is entirely inconsistent with an opinion that says that the post traumatic stress disorder that apparently he was still suffering from in 2010 as a result from events that occurred in 2006 appeared to diminish his ability to formulate reasoned judgements.  
The basis on which he was convicted, it seems to me would suggest quite the contrary.  
EL-HANANIA:  Well your Honour, if I can say this; attachment A at page 2 is the assessment and how John Jacmon arrives at his conclusions with regards to post traumatic stress disorder and it confirms whether it is indicated or not indicated with regards to the assessment.  But--
HER HONOUR:  Well that's only on the basis of a history given by him isn't it?  And for that matter, over a video link to the gaol.  
EL-HANANIA:  Mm.  Just one moment your Honour--
HER HONOUR:  I mean the only reason I raised it Mr El-Hanania was to say to you that I don't necessarily have to accept the opinion.  
EL-HANANIA:  Of course, no.
HER HONOUR:  If it doesn't actually, if it doesn't coincide with the evidence that was before the jury which must have been accepted by them.  It's not a matter for me even--
EL-HANANIA:  No.  With respect--
HER HONOUR:  --to make a finding of fact.  The facts are clear--
EL-HANANIA:  No that's right.  
HER HONOUR:  --that he did what the Crown alleged he did because otherwise he wouldn't have been convicted of all ten offences by the jury.
EL-HANANIA:  I understand that.  
HER HONOUR:  All right, okay--
EL-HANANIA:  The other issue is they weren't accepted by the jury and hence his convictions.  
HER HONOUR:  Yes. I mean, I must say, I find it a little bit unusual that apparently such a diagnosis has been arrived at as a result of a face to face meeting conducted over a video link in the gaol when a lot of the material that is necessary to reach a finding of post traumatic stress disorder, things like hyper vigilance, alertness, all of that sort of thing, you might think if you've only got history to go on, you might go looking at perhaps others with whom he was living at the time to see if the history can be supported.  Because the whole thing is based on history and the convictions would seem to be counter intuitive to a person if in fact he was living like that.  It's a pretty rough opinion in my view.""
[Emphasis added.]
95The reference to the video link was, it seems to me, an incidental description of the interview made in the course of making the point that Dr Jacmon had not obtained any histories from the persons with whom the appellant had been living before his arrest, namely his wife and one adult son.  In doing so, her Honour had overlooked the indication in the report that Dr Jacmon had interviewed Mrs Chime.  However, Dr Jacmon does not disclose what information, if any, had been supplied by her and does not suggest that he actually relied on what, if anything relevant, she told him.  In the judge's remarks on sentence dealing with the significance of Dr Jacmon's report the judge clearly articulated the matters which led her to regard it as having limited utility.  They did not include the fact that his interview was by way of video link.  Although her Honour referred to Dr Jacmon relying on the history provided by the appellant (making no reference to his wife), it seems to me that, so far the report actually went, this was a fair observation.  However, it was made in the context of emphasising the unavailability to Dr Jacmon of the evidence in the trial as to the applicant's activities.  In my view, there is no basis for concluding that the judge gave inadequate or inappropriately qualified weight to Dr Jacmon's report.  
96There was, of course, no power in the circumstances for the judge to have ordered a new psychological report.  Nor is there anything in the transcript that suggests the judge ""rejected"" an offer by Dr Jacmon to speak on behalf of the appellant.  Whether he was called was a matter for the appellant's solicitor or, if he was required for cross-examination, for the prosecutor.  Lastly, as I have set out above, the judge took into account the appellant's ""medical condition"", though necessarily only to a limited extent. 
97I would reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 3 - Being my first criminal offence in any country and it was all circumstantial evidence used to convict me but the actual evidence (sic) that she gave me was a very severe one and normally given to repeat offenders. I have not committed these crimes and I feel that she erred in her judgment to convict me. 
98As mentioned above, the judge took into account the appellant's prior good character.  Her Honour also noted that this was his first time in prison.  Of course, the appellant could only have been sentenced on the basis of the jury's verdicts, which bound the judge.  It is not the fact that the overall sentence imposed on him was ""normally given to repeat offenders"".  Thus, in Okeke v R [2010] NSWCCA 266, the offender, with no prior convictions, who had been convicted on his plea of guilty of three counts of attempting to possess a marketable quantity of cocaine and heroin, one count of possessing a marketable quantity of heroin and recklessly dealing with proceeds of crime ($61,500) and had significant health problems was sentenced to an overall term of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years and ten months.  He had used false names to take delivery of packages containing drugs from various addresses and collected some drugs from a courier.  His role was an intermediate one.  The JIRS statistics for first offenders for the offences on which the appellant was sentences show that the sentence was well within the statistical range.  As I have already stated, the sentence was within the judge's discretion to impose.   Ground 4 - Her Honour erred when she also did not take into consideration of my family here and my Villawood treatment here and my mental history into consideration and the history of what I and my family in Australia have been through with both mental health. 
99The judge referred to the appellant's incarceration in the Villawood Detention Centre.  There was no evidence about any treatment which had any adverse mental or other effect on the appellant although his incarceration was mentioned both in the Pre-sentence Report and that of Dr Jacmon.  Nor did his solicitor make any submission to this effect.  Nor is there any reference in the evidence (or his solicitor's submissions) of problems with the health of the appellant's family to which, however, the judge adverted in her remarks on sentence.  The sentencing remarks include specific reference to the appellant's family as helpful on his release in respect of rehabilitation.   Ground 5 - The judge took the word of DPP when asked how much the AUD dollar was money laundered and not by the actual amount on the documents and then she chose to times the amount by 5 times in sentencing as DPP quoted 500.000 and not the actual papers listed in court stated. 
100The amounts of the Western Union transfers were set out in exhibits tendered without objection in the trial and Moneygram transfers.  The total of the amounts transferred was just over $524,000.  This evidence provided the basis for the judge's statement, in her remarks on sentence, ""The amount sent out of Australia ... was... at least $500,000"".   The count on which the appellant was convicted was in the form - 
Further that he between about 19 November 2009 and 31 August 2010 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did deal with money that was, and that he did believe to be proceeds of crime and at that time of the dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more. [Emphasis added.]
101There is nothing in this ground.
Conclusion as to sentence appeal
102None of the grounds relied on by the appellant have any substance except, to a limited degree, that which concerns the sentence imposed on count 6.  The Crown submitted that the overall sentence and the non-parole period represented the primary judge's view of the appropriate punishment for the totality of the appellant's offences.  This result was stated before the sentence for count 6 was pronounced which was, with respect, a slip and not intended by her Honour.  In the result, therefore, I propose that the error by reducing the sentence to one of 2 years imprisonment but leaving the overall outcome unchanged. 
Orders
103I propose the following orders - 
(1)the appeal against conviction be dismissed; 
(2)leave to appeal against sentence be granted;
(3)the appeal against sentence be dismissed except as to the sentence imposed in respect of count 6.
(4)the sentence imposed in respect of count 6 be quashed and, in lieu thereof, a sentence of 2 years be imposed commencing on 29 February 2012 and ending on 28 February 2014.
104R A HULME J:  I agree with Adams J.

2765610,R v Chaker [2014] NSWDC 330,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mohamed Chaker appears today for sentence in relation to two offences both committed on 7 August 2013.
	
	
	The first offence in time is an offence of demanding property with menaces in company of Talat Taskin, who is yet to be sentenced, from victim Angelique Palinginis. The property in question is a Westpac bankcard. This offence contrary to s 99(2) Crimes Act carries the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The second offence in time is an offence contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 which carries the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and that offence is an offence alleged to have occurred obviously on 7 August 2013 of robbing Mitchell Links of certain property to wit $100 in cash whilst armed with an offensive instrument to wit a 15 centimetre metal pointy object.
	
	
	As I have earlier indicated the two offences were related in time. There is an agreed statement of facts which will suffice to be briefly summarised in my remarks. The victim of the first offence in time was a woman who was walking in William Street at about 4 am in the morning. She was approached by this prisoner and his co-accused, Mr Taskin, and they followed her as I understand it from one side of William Street to the other, eventually confronting her in the vicinity of the southern side of the intersection of William Street and Forbes Street in East Sydney.
	
	
	This prisoner demanded money from her but she replied she did not have any. The prisoner again demanded cash and when she showed him her empty purse she walked away. The prisoner and his co-accused continued to follow her and apparently demanded her bankcard which was a Westpac bankcard and her PIN number. The prisoner took the purse of the victim from her, removed her Westpac card and walked to a Westpac ATM which was nearby. The willingness of the victim to hand over the bankcard in part would have arisen from the fact that she knew that she had no money to lose because the account balance was zero.
	
	
	The prisoner returned to where the victim was standing with the co-accused. A request was made for her mobile phone. She said, “She didn’t have it” and no other cards so the prisoner gave her purse back to her and the prisoner and his co-accused walked away. Obviously the presence of the two offenders and the demands made would have been intimidating to the victim, can be no doubt of that, but there were no specific threats made. The victim was uninjured. The victim did not report the incident immediately to police after it occurred, although that of course does not reflect adversely upon the victim and there is no victim impact statement.
	
	
	Within a half an hour of the commission of that offence the prisoner along with Mr Taskin approached a man and a woman again near the corner of Forbes Street and William Street. On this occasion the prisoner had a metal spike protruding about 15 centimetres from underneath the sleeve of the upper garment he was wearing and this was seen by the victim. The prisoner demanded the male victim’s wallet. The victim told the prisoner and Mr Taskin he did not have any money but ultimately produced his wallet. The prisoner removed a Commonwealth bankcard from the victim’s wallet and gave the wallet to Mr Taskin. The prisoner then demanded the PIN number from the victim which was eventually provided. The prisoner suggested to the victim that he would be “in all sorts” ... of trouble it would seem if he did not give the correct PIN number.
	
	
	The co-accused remained with the victim and his friend holding onto the victim’s wallet. At the point the facts rather enigmatically suggests that the victim reacted towards the co-accused in some way intimidating him at that point. I mention in passing that Mr Taskin, who is part heard before me, is a man with a long history of mental illness and drug dependency. When the prisoner returned to where his co-accused was in company with the male victim and his female friend, he said he had been given the wrong PIN number and made a threat to stab the victim. The victim told the prisoner that he would take the prisoner himself to the ATM.
	
	
	During this period of time the female companion of the male victim rang triple-0 and it would appear that the female was seen using the phone at some point. The prisoner apparently told Mr Taskin on seeing the female with her phone in her possession to run away down Forbes Street but the prisoner himself remained with the victim at the ATM. Whilst the victim was endeavouring to withdraw some money the prisoner became impatient apparently, he completed the transaction, eventually pushing the victim away and taking $100 in cash from the machine.
	
	
	The two prisoners were identified on police investigation from CCTV footage, particularly Mr Taskin who was known to the police locally and the two men were later, on 8 August or 7 August it does not matter very much, were arrested at Mr Taskin’s premises in Forbes Street and apparently they were wearing the same clothing as they had been wearing at the time of the contact with the respective victims. They provided very little information when interviewed and were eventually arrested and charged, firstly, in respect of the robbery matter and then subsequently in relation to the demand money with menaces in company matter.
	
	
	This prisoner was born on 3 March 1993. He was thus at the time of the relevant offending as I understand it 20 years of age. His co-offender is almost 20 years older being born in 1972. His co-accused has a somewhat longer record but was not on parole as was this prisoner at the time of the offending. It is clear, notwithstanding what was put in the helpful submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, that this prisoner played a leading role in relation to each offence. The facts that I read had him specifically making particular demands and when necessary undertaking relevant actions or transactions in respect of cards that were either provided to him or taken from the respective victims.
	
	
	In relation to the robbery matter, it was this prisoner who was armed and it was this prisoner who made particular oral threats. There is little or no evidence in the facts available to me that this prisoner was directed by the co-accused. There is no specific reference to this prisoner being influenced by his co-accused beyond perhaps some hearsay representations by the prisoner about that matter. I accept of course this prisoner was considerably less mature than his co-accused and he has an intellectual disability which I will deal with in a moment which may make him “easily led” or prone to suggestion. But as the objective facts in the Crown case make clear it was the prisoner, as I said earlier, who took a leading role in perpetuating and executing the offences most of the time while the co-accused remained somewhat silently nearby or in company with one or other of the dramatis personae in the offences.
	
	
	As I said the prisoner was on parole at the time of these offences. When he came into custody as I understand it on 8 August 2013 he was in custody, first of all I assume, bail refused in relation to these matters but then his parole was revoked by order of the parole authority on 29 August and the revocation of the parole was backdated to the date he came into custody. The balance of parole expired in early October 2014. The reason he was on parole was because of a conviction for armed robbery and related offences largely taken into account on a form 1 of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception or attempting to do so. These various offences were committed in early January 2012 and he was sentenced in relation to these matters at Parramatta District Court on 14 December 2012. The total sentence imposed for the armed robbery, taking into account the various matters on a form 1 which were very much related to the principal offence, was two years six months with a non-parole period of one year imprisonment. The armed robbery was committed on a taxi driver. The prisoner took from the victim who the prisoner had hailed to pick him up, the wallet of the victim, some cash, the victim’s iPhone and various cards that belonged to the victim. The offences relating to either the attempt or the actual dishonest obtaining of financial advantage by deception concerned various negotiation by the prisoner with the use of one of the cards of the victim at particular places in the western suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	Prior to that conviction, which I note was recorded when the prisoner was only 18 years of age, the prisoner had a finding of guilt against him for armed robbery in the Children’s Court in April 2010. For that matter he was placed on probation and he had other findings of guilt including entering inclosed lands and having goods in custody suspected of being unlawfully obtained for which he was sentenced to one month imprisonment in the Local Court in November 2011 or January 2012.
	
	
	I have a letter from his mother which speaks of some aspects of his character, his slow mental development, his religious faith and offers of support to him on his release from custody as well as steps that his mother would endeavour to take to obtain employment for him on his release. She apologised to the Court for her inability to attend, she has a number of health issues and I understand her failure to attend is not through lack of interest in her son. I accept that she will continue to support the prisoner in the future.
	
	
	I have a presentence report from the Probation and Parole Service which provides a deal of information obtained from the mother which is in conflict with the history provided by the prisoner. This was a report I requested as I understand it or it was requested when the matter first came before me in October 2014. I also have material relating to the circumstances of the revocation of parole. One of those reports notes that the prisoner had been compliant under supervision and had endeavoured to undertake a Positive Lifestyle Program but had to be withdrawn from that program unfortunately due to his limited intellectual ability which affected his capacity to engage in the program. That report prepared in August 2013 noted that at that time he appeared “stable” on parole but it is clear, as I understand the matter, that his offending arose in circumstances where he had in fact broken away from his family it would seem in the weeks before the offending and had commenced using prohibited drugs. His parole was recommended to be revoked in the report of 13 August, obviously prepared after he came into custody, because he had allegedly committed offences of a similar nature.
	
	
	With regard to the presentence report there is not a need to go through it in detail, there is reference to his recent custodial performance and I will deal with that matter when I come to some submissions put on his behalf by his counsel. That report noted that whilst on parole he had been primarily living with his family who would continue to provide him with accommodation. His mother stated she had not noticed any indication of drug and alcohol use and attributed the prisoner’s actions to his associations with friends that she believed had a negative influence upon him. This is possibly so in the case of Mr Taskin, as I say he has a complex history of mental illness and drug abuse but I could not, on the limited material available at this stage in Mr Taskin’s case, conclude necessarily that he was the cause of the prisoner lapsing into drug usage.
	
	
	The prisoner had given some history of his employment which was not in accord with information provided by the mother. I accept that the prisoner is not a particularly reliable historian in some respects not out of dishonesty but probably and primarily because of his intellectual disability. There is some history in the report that I discussed with learned counsel for the prisoner about his claims of drug usage particularly in custody, there is some Justice Health records that confirm his use of drugs in custody but I cannot believe whilst in custody that he has been able to spend the amounts per day that he claims to have spent, it would be impossible for him to have access to those funds based upon the information available to me. He is however being maintained on methadone and I note he expressed the motivation to address his substance abuse by going to a residential rehabilitation facility, that will be a matter for the parole authority. He claimed a problematic gambling dependency or addiction whilst he was at large before coming back into custody.
	
	
	He told the Probation and Parole officer that his conduct was not planned which I accept. He said that he was endeavouring to obtain money to facilitate drug use. He acknowledged the level of fear his victims would have experienced but also sought to minimise his actions when he stated that one of his victims, I take it to be the first victim in time, was “just a sex worker”, not quoting his words but quoting the words in the presentence report.
	
	
	He is considered to be at medium risk of reoffending based upon the actuarial risk/needs assessment conducted by the Community Corrections Service but given the multitude of issues they identified one wonders whether this is entirely an accurate assessment. His needs are identified as being related to education, employment, his finances, his leisure and recreation, his alcohol drug problems, his emotional and personal problems, his attitude and his orientation. Given the fact that I am dealing with him now in relation to a third robbery style offence or offences in the period of four years, bearing in mind he committed these offences having only just been released to parole some months before the commission of these offence, one would have thought that the risks of reoffending, particularly if he began using drugs again, would be somewhat higher than “medium” but I respect the actuarial tool that was used.
	
	
	The report also reflects upon the intellectual disability of the prisoner and I will deal with that evidence from more direct sources. Justice Health records confirm the prisoner has been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome. He experiences periods of insomnia, he is quick to anger and he needs assistance in relation to anger management, this is confirmed by his mother. The prisoner’s incarceration has been a matter of some difficulty. It would be very difficult to accommodate him without compromising his safety. The assessment of the prisoner by the Corrective Services Community Corrections officer is that whilst he remained polite and cooperative he appeared to lose focus and was difficult to engage at particular times. The assessment noted the family support in the post release accommodation but his mother is concerned about his anger management and his poor choice of associates. It also noted his willingness to address substance abuse issues by way of residential rehabilitation to which I earlier referred and made recommendations in terms of future supervision in relation to particular matters.
	
	
	The prisoner himself gave oral evidence before me. He apologised for his conduct, he expressed sincere regret for what he had done. He said in effect that he was “all over the shop” at the time of the offending. He had been in some dispute with his family and his drug taking had escalated. He said he had been using cocaine and crystal methylamphetamine with his co-accused. He said that he had been working in a family business installing air conditioning and was making good money before he relapsed. He said that he would like to continue his relationship with Mr James, the psychologist who reported on his behalf in this Court, and spoke about his methadone usage, he has reduced his methadone intake in custody from 60 milligrams to 30 milligrams and it confirmed the need, in his view, to go to a residential program. He believed that he did not get sufficient direction from the Parole Authority. I am not here to make a judgment in relation to that matter, I do not have sufficient information but it certainly would appear through no fault of his that he was unable to complete programs that may have been of assistance.
	
	
	He was cross-examined about what he was spending on drugs whilst he was living with his parents but there seemed to be some conflict again as it emerged in the cross-examination between his activities and things that his mother had said in her reference.
	
	
	When the prisoner was sentenced in 2012, the Court had available to it a report from Duffy Robilliard Psychologists under the hand of Debbie Case, who has a Master in Psychology and wrote a very informative report. She identified him as an intellectually disadvantaged person and specifically administered the relevant tests, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence or (WASI) measure which identified him as being in the mild mental retardation range that is within a range of 50 to 55 to approximately 70. She said his intellectual incapacity would need to be taken into consideration as he was likely to be confused by lengthy complicated documents and the like and made recommendations about his treatment. The findings in relation to that report are specifically referred to in the Community Corrections report.
	
	
	A more up to date report is from Mr James who gave a detailed report setting out the details of the prisoner’s family background, education, use of alcohol and the like and notes the previous psychological assessment of Ms Case. He noted from her assessment that the prisoner’s intellectual functioning was lower than 98% of individuals in his range group. His assessment of the prisoner was that whilst there was no evidence of sensory perceptual impairment cognitive impairment was noted and his cognitive functioning was felt to be no higher than borderline range.
	
	
	Various risk assessments were undertaken and it was concluded that the prisoner was not “psychopathic”. He was at a low to moderate risk of re-offending. He was at a moderate risk of committing future violent offences, having regard to his history of past offending, his previous drug abuse history, his psychosocial skills in dealing with frustration, impulsivity and his exposure to destabilising influences.
	
	
	There are, however, a moderate range of proactive factors that may defend against committing future violent offences, including family support, the opportunity of regular work and, if taken up, a stable home environment.
	
	
	The opinion of the psychologist was that the prisoner’s difficulties arose in part because of a dispute he had with his family and his brother, that resulted in him leaving home without clothing or basic necessities and what emerged from his association with his co-accused.
	
	
	His ability to understand the consequences of the offences was affected by his lower than average intelligence. His ability to understand the seriousness of the offences was probably limited to some extent by his intellectual disability. There was also the issue of drug use and its effect upon him.
	
	
	He recommended a treatment program to address his clinical and identified risk management factors. His diagnosis was that the prisoner suffered from the following disorders: Intellectual disability of mild severity, amphetamine type substance use disorder and opioid use disorder of moderate severity and the recommendations he made included addressing stress management, drug rehabilitation, vocational education and social skills training, psychotherapy to address his impulsiveness and psycho-education to address a number of the other disorders.
	
	
	It was noted in a supplementary report or letter of 14 October 2014 that individuals suffering mild intellectual disability experienced disability across conceptual, social and practical domains. It was indicated that,
	


“Within social interaction, Mr Chaker may have limited understanding of risk and social situations. His social judgment may be immature for his age and he is at risk of being manipulated by others.”

I have taken into account all the evidence that has been presented to the court.


	
	If I might just deal with the submissions as they provide a focus for the issues I need to address, I will deal firstly with the oral submissions and then turn to the very detailed and helpful submissions of counsel for the prisoner.  It was submitted orally on behalf of the prisoner I should place no weight upon the matters reflecting infractions in custody. It was submitted that in fact this should be no surprise that he has developed what would appear to be something of a formidable record in this regard because of his difficulties of complying with the strictures of the custodial regime with his intellectual disability.
	
	
	With regard to the history he gave to the Probation and Parole Service, where it conflicts with his mother’s account of things, again this may be attributable to his intellectual disability. There were some elements of exaggeration and this was clearly so.
	
	
	It was submitted that his intellectual disability reflected his difficulty of functioning on a day-to-day basis. It was also submitted to the court that I should, in sentencing him for the current offences, be guided somewhat by the measure of the sentence previously imposed in relation to the armed robbery matter, when he was dealt with in late 2012.
	
	
	If I might deal with that last submission, the difficulty with it is that, firstly, that offence of armed robbery was not an offence committed whilst on parole, which is the case here. Secondly, the difficulty with that submission is in assessing an appropriate sentence. Whilst there are many common elements, of course, the intellectual disability remains with the prisoner as it did two years ago, I am sentencing the prisoner for two offences, not one offence, albeit linked in time, with the reality that he has a prior conviction as an adult for a similar offence, which of itself is a matter that ordinarily disentitles him to any particular leniency.
	
	
	Although the Crown submitted that there was not a great deal to “disagree with”, in the written submissions it noted a number of matters, particularly in its submission the need for some element of specific deterrence, having regard to the fact that the prisoner had committed similar offences to an offence for which he was on parole at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown took me to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Carrion v R [2007] NSWCCA 174, particularly the observations of Hislop J at [13]. There his Honour sought to briefly summarise matters relevant to the sentencing of an offender suffering from a “mental disorder or disability”, in the context of longstanding principles suggesting that ordinarily lesser weight may be given to general deterrence, particularly where there is a causal link between the mental disability or the disorder and the offending.
	
	
	I appreciate the Crown’s reference to that authority but I should point out, jumping ahead of myself somewhat, that the learned counsel for the prisoner assisted the court by taking it to the decision of Hemsley, a 2004 decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly in the judgment of Sperling J where his Honour sought to summarise the relevant principles in a somewhat more precise fashion than that set out by Hislop J. I think that as helpful as both those judgments are, the most helpful judgment in this regard, in so far as it encapsulates the relevant principles, is the decision of the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. There, at [177] his Honour pointed out, if I may quote,
	


“Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems, the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing ... They can be summarised in the following manner:

Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently, the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in sentence.

It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.

It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence would be more onerous for that person, the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced.

It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence.

Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of special deterrence may result in an increased sentence (citing particular authorities).”


	
	His Honour went on to make some observations in relation to the relevant “antisocial personality disorder” with which this prisoner has not been diagnosed.
	
	
	He went on to say at [178],
	


“I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity, it may, nevertheless, be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence.”


	
	Counsel for the Crown also very kindly and properly took my attention to the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, particularly the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, where at [162] his Honour set out what he described as the category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline and then therein after at [163]-[165] set out the “guideline”, which I take into account.
	
	
	I bear in mind, of course, as everyone understands, that his Honour, in fixing the guideline, as the majority of the Court in adopting the guideline pointed out, there still existed a residual sentencing discretion in fixing the appropriate sentence, not the least explained and justified by the observations of the Court through the judgment of the learned Chief Justice at [10], where his Honour cited with approval the observations of Acting Chief Justice Mahoney in the unreported judgment of Lattouf, which I have taken into account.
	
	
	I am also mindful of the factors, the Crown reminds me, of the matters identified at [169]-[170], where his Honour identified aggravating and mitigating factors that may justify a sentence below or above the range, particularly matters of increased intensity arriving from common features of armed robbery offences.
	
	
	There was also reference by learned counsel for the Crown to some observations of the Chief Justice relating to the matter of personal choice in drug use and abuse and dependency. I am mindful of the fact that there was some debate amongst the judges of the Court about the issue of personal choice in this regard but, as I understand the judgment, the majority of the Court certainly accepted what Wood J said in the same judgment at [273] concerning the relevant principles that related to consideration of “drug addiction” or drug “dependence” in sentencing offenders for armed robbery and I have taken those matters into account.
	
	
	Of course, the complexity of matters to which his Honour identified is to be seen in the context of the overlay of intellectual disability as it arises in this case.
	
	
	It was conceded in the written submissions of Mr Chaker’s counsel that the only appropriate sentence is one of fulltime custody and it was also submitted that relevant factors included the fact that the objective seriousness of each of the offences was in the lower range. The mental instability or disability of the prisoner may be not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence and reduced his moral culpability, a matter relevant to the consideration of the Henry guideline. 
	
	
	It was submitted there may be a need to place greater weight on specific deterrence but there should be a finding of special circumstances with minimal accumulation of the sentences for each of the offences with which I am concerned and partial accumulation or perhaps even no accumulation upon the balance of parole that the prisoner has served.
	
	
	With regard to the armed robbery matter, it was submitted the weapon used was not of lethal quality, such as a knife or a gun, which I accept. The use of a weapon was limited, which I accept. The amount of violence used in the robbery matter was limited to a push that was made when the prisoner was at the ATM with the victim, endeavouring to hurry him up to complete the transaction.
	
	
	There were some threats of violence but they were not of a high intensity. There was a negligible value of property stolen and what was described as a “relatively low level of fear and impact on victims”, noting the absence of victim impact statements. I appreciate, of course, in relation to both offences, that there would have been an impact upon the victims. They would have been confronted by two men, in an area of Sydney which, at the very least, is a dangerous area, notwithstanding the constant presence of sex workers in that area during the early hours of the morning. I make no criticism of the victims for their presence in this area at this time; they are fully entitled to go about their business and should be free from molestation from people, whether they have intellectual disabilities, drug dependency or not.
	
	
	There was a clear lack of planning and sophistication, it was submitted and with that I agree, although it must be said between one offence and the other the prisoner somehow became armed with the metal spike, as it is referred to.
	
	
	With regard to the demand property with menaces matter, it was noted there was no actual threat of violence, which is correct; no direct threat against the victim beyond that implicit from the presence of the two men; the period of contact with the victim was slightly longer than ordinarily would be the case in such circumstances, but the impact upon the victim was not substantial.
	
	
	It was conceded in submissions, in relation to both offences, that the aggravating factors that arise, particularly arising under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 were the commission of the offences whilst the subject of conditional liberty, particularly parole, for an offence of armed robbery which it must be said is a significant aggravating factor.
	
	
	The armed robbery matter was “committed in company”, although, as an aggravating factor, it was not particularly intense. The co-accused, as I have pointed out, played more of a wallet holding role at one point and at one point, apparently, was “intimidated” by those that he was supposed to be minding.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the armed robbery included “multiple victims”. The Crown did not make any comment about this but I could not conclude adverse to the prisoner than that is a relevant aggravating factor in this matter. There were two people present when the prisoner and his co-accused robbed the particular victim but the female companion seemed, on the facts available to me, to be incidental to the affair and she was not threatened or robbed at all as I understand it.
	
	
	Mitigating factors that arise include the fact that the offences were not planned in the way that that word or that expression has been understood by the superior courts and I accept that as a mitigating factor. The offences were not part of organised crime, which is self-evident.
	
	
	It was submitted that the prisoner was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions. I could not find that as a mitigating factor. I accept that he has a significant intellectual disability but it is clear by his own actions and words that he had a clear understanding of what he was doing.
	
	
	I accept, however, that there was not “substantial loss” and I accept that the prisoner has expressed remorse, taking responsibility for his conduct in the manner contemplated by section 21A(3).
	
	
	I also note the pleas of guilty as a relevant mitigating factor, although for that the prisoner receives the discreet discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. 
	
	
	In the written submissions references were made to the report of Mr Jones and the earlier report from 2012. Obviously, I accept those findings and references were made to Hemsley as I earlier noted.
	
	
	It is submitted in this particular matter that there should be lesser weight to general deterrence, denunciation and punishment.
	
	
	It is submitted and I accept that the intellectual disability does reduce his moral culpability and that there should be less weight given to general deterrence. He is not what is sometimes described as an “appropriate vehicle” for the message of general deterrence, to some extent.
	
	
	I accept too that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him. However, it was submitted that the level of danger which the prisoner presents to the community may sound in specific deterrence and there must be some element of specific deterrence in this matter, as the Crown correctly pointed out, because of this course of offending over some period of time in relation to like offences and the fact that the prisoner has committed this offence in circumstances where he had been released to parole in relation to a similar offence only some months before.
	
	
	I was taken to the High Court judgment in Muldrock [2011] HCA 39, which reflects upon the relevance of mental disability to moral culpability and I accept, of course, what the High Court has said about that matter and apply it in this matter.
	
	
	Whilst there was material in the information from the parole authorities concerning the prisoner’s gullibility, capacity for manipulation and the like, the submission made by the prisoner that he was in some way manipulated or encouraged by the co-accused, to my mind, is not sustained by the facts, although I accept that the use of drugs would have compounded the prisoner’s capacity for calmly assessing the nature and gravity of his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Reliance is also placed in the submissions of counsel for the accused on the observation in Muldrock at [54], that where the court is sentencing a “mentally retarded” offender, because of a capacity to reason as an ordinary person might, the issue of the “causal relationship between mental illness and the commission of the offence” is “less likely to arise” and I accept that analysis.
	
	
	References were made in the written submissions to the prisoner’s performance in custody and I have already commented upon that. This was not a matter of any particular specific comment by the Crown in any event.
	
	
	It was conceded that the sentences to be imposed should not be wholly concurrent, in the written submissions of counsel, but noting the very short time and physical distance between the commission of the offences and the underlying common motivation of the offending, the two offences could be seen as aspects of a single course or very closely related course of conduct. I accept that latter submission.
	
	
	With regard to the commencement date of any sentence to be imposed, noting the revocation of the prisoner’s parole, the balance of parole being required to commence on 8 August and expiring on 7 October, which apparently robbed the prisoner of one day, it was submitted that the court should be very careful not to indulge itself in the process of “double dipping”, discussed by Basten J in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66, particularly at [35].
	
	
	This matter was discussed in considerable detail as well in the judgment cited by counsel for the prisoner of R v Callaghan [2006] NSWCCA 58, in the judgment of Simpson J. I accept her Honour’s analysis, as that of Basten J, as I must. I must be very careful in noting the breach of parole as an aggravating factor not to double dip, so to speak, in consideration of the relevance of the balance of parole served by the prisoner to the commencement date of the sentencing exercise that I must undertake.
	
	
	I also note in relation to this matter that the prisoner previously had a finding of special circumstances but that is not extinguished by subsequent events, given some common features to this exercise and the previous matter, where the prisoner did receive a very lenient non-parole period.
	
	
	Although I do not propose to backdate the sentences I must impose upon the prisoner to the date of revocation of parole, in my view that would be absurd and reflect no recognition of the previous offending and no respect for the earlier sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge and the implications of that sentence, particularly bearing in mind the prisoner was released to parole and he was expected to be of good behaviour. He should have expected to return to custody to serve the balance of the sentence if he was involved in any separate offending during the time of parole, even with his intellectual disability.
	
	
	Having said that and in context of consideration of the double dipping issue, and taking all other relevant matters into account, including the matters that flow from the prisoner’s mental disability, I propose to date the effective sentences I impose from 8 February 2014, that is six months after the commencement date of the period served by way of revocation of parole.
	
	
	I accept the submission that the effective partial accumulation is to create a “special circumstance” pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I accept that the prisoner’s mental state is one that requires close monitoring and he definitely needs intensive professional assistance.
	
	
	I accept that because of his relative youth, he was still only 20 years of age at the time of the offending and was 18 years of age when he committed the offence for which he was on parole at the relevant time, are relevant matters to the issue of special circumstances. His use and abuse of drugs, the need for professional direction and assistance in that regard is also another relevant matter to the issue of “special circumstances”.
	
	
	I note some of the matters available to him, including family support, were available to him when he was previously released to parole but, as I said, the issues that are relevant to the finding of special circumstances are not necessarily “extinguished” by subsequent events.
	
	
	I have already pointed out the need for a discount to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. I appreciate counsel sought to provide some judgments which provided what he submitted were “illustrative sentences”. The illustrations he gave me, though, were not “comparative” cases. What they illustrated was that for more serious forms of armed robbery there were certain sentences imposed, in other cases confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that might suggest a range of sentencing beyond that appropriate in this particular case.
	
	
	Taking all these matters into account in determining the sentence for the demand property with menaces in company matter, having regard, of course, to what I would regard as the vulnerability of the victim, whatever her occupation, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed on this prisoner in relation to that matter should be a term of two years, six months imprisonment.
	
	
	The sentence to be imposed upon this prisoner in relation to the armed robbery matter should be four years imprisonment.
	
	
	The second sentence should be partially accumulative to the extent of six months upon the first, the first sentence, of course, being partially accumulative six months upon the period covered by the revocation of parole.
	
	
	I would propose to fix a non-parole period that would permit the prisoner to be considered for release to parole two years after 8 February 2014. The fixing of the non-parole period takes into account, as I have pointed out, the partial accumulation of these sentences upon the balance of parole.
	
	
	Thus, the sentences I will impose are as follows:
	
	
	In relation to offence of demand property with menaces in company, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of 12 months to date from 8 February 2014, to expire on 7 February 2015.
	
	
	The balance of sentence I fix is one year, six months. That balance of sentence will expire on 7 August 2016.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of armed robbery, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment to date from 8 August 2014 and expiring on 7 February 2016.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence, I fix a balance of sentence of two years, six months, which will expire, on my calculation, on 7 August 2018.
	
	
	The earliest date you will be eligible for release to parole will be 8 February 2016.
	
	
	In relation to the first sentence, although the sentence in total is less than three years and I fix a non-parole period, I do not direct that you be released to parole at the expiration of that non-parole period because of the effectively subsequent sentences.
	
	
	Mr Crown, any matters from you?
	
	
	MURREY: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any matters from you, Mr Chhabra?
	
	
	CHHABRA: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Chaker, the total sentence imposed upon you is four and a half years imprisonment. It is a non-parole period of two years. You will be eligible for release to parole, as I calculate it, on 7 February 2016. It will be a matter for the parole authority, of course, whether you are released to parole. That will depend upon your domestic circumstances and a range of other matters.  But, despite all the difficulties you have, it is very important when you are released to parole, if you are released to parole, that you understand that if you commit offences whilst on parole you automatically will go back into custody. Thank you.

		26 May 2015",2014-12-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765626,Clinton v R [2014] NSWCCA 320,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with McCallum J.
2McCALLUM J:  Mitchell Clinton was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing 8 counts.  He pleaded guilty to an offence of intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (maximum penalty 5 years); an offence of intentionally damaging property contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 5 years) and an offence of using an offensive weapon (a knife) with intent to commit the indictable offence of intimidation contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty 12 years).
3He pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty by a jury, of a charge of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty 2 years) and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty 5 years).  He was found not guilty of the remaining three charges but pleaded guilty to a backup charge of contravening an apprehended violence order contrary to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act which had been transferred to the District Court upon his committal for trial, as required by s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  The maximum penalty for the breach of the apprehended violence order was imprisonment for 2 years.
4After the jury returned its verdicts the Crown submitted (in response to a question from the judge as to whether a pre-sentence report should be ordered) that a custodial sentence was required.  Counsel for the offender accepted that was the case but sought an adjournment with bail for the purpose of obtaining a psychiatric report to address the applicant's accepted difficulty with anger management.  The judge granted bail for that purpose.  
5The report of the psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, recorded the applicant's description of injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident when he was 8 years of age, which Dr Furst thought were suggestive of a significant head injury.  When the proceedings came back before the court for the proceedings on sentence, counsel then appearing for the applicant sought an adjournment to investigate that issue further by having the applicant undergo an MRI to ascertain the extent of any neurological deficit.  The judge granted a further adjournment for that purpose.  The applicant was ultimately sentenced on 17 January 2014 after presenting further evidence and submissions that day.  
6The facts found by the sentencing judge may be summarised briefly (much of what follows is drawn verbatim from the remarks on sentence).  The offender and the victim had been in a domestic relationship which had been in difficulty for some time.  Following earlier acts of violence by the offender against her, the victim had on 20 December 2011 obtained an interim apprehended domestic violence order for her protection.  The terms of the order prohibited contact and prohibited the offender from approaching within 100 metres of her home and place of work.  There had nonetheless been some ongoing communication between them.
7In late March 2012 the offender arrived at the victim's home with the intention of staying overnight.  His purpose in coming to Sydney was to attend a concert.  The charge of intimidation with intent to cause a person to fear physical or mental harm (count 1) was based on an incident which occurred in the victim's bedroom very shortly after the offender arrived at her home.  He went into the bedroom, seized her around the neck, pushed her against the bedroom wall and told her that if she let any other man near her children he would kill her.
8The offence of assault of which the applicant was found guilty by the jury (count 2) was based on an incident which occurred after the offender returned from the concert later that night.  He went to the bedroom, woke the victim and told her that he was intending to move to Queensland.  Her response displeased him (she was insufficiently upset).  He became upset and head butted her. 
9The offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of which the jury convicted the offender (count 4) related to his conduct after the head butting.  He struck the victim several times in the arms, legs and body.  Her evidence was that he was punching her and kicking her and that she was sitting there crying while he kicked her and hit her all over.  She had widespread injuries to several areas of her body including her neck, the right side of her collarbone, her left upper arm, under her right arm and to her left leg and knee.
10The charge of damaging property (count 7) was based on the applicant's admission that he smashed a mirror door on the wardrobe in the victim's bedroom.  The charge of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit intimidation (count 8) was based on an admission made by the applicant in his record of interview relating to an argument in the victim's bedroom that same evening or the following morning.  She was seated on the bed.  The applicant grabbed a knife and stabbed it into the bed, telling her that he would kill another man he believed she was seeing at that time.  The charge of breaching an apprehended violent order was based on the fact that all of the offender's conduct that night (in being in contact with the victim) was in breach of the apprehended violence order.
11The offender was aged 18 at the time of commission of the offences and 20 at the time he was sentenced.  The judge noted the far greater emphasis to be placed on rehabilitation in the case of young offenders but found that concerns about rehabilitation were tempered in the present case by aspects of the applicant's history, to which I will return.  
12The judge noted the submission put on behalf of the applicant that an appropriate sentence would be a ""short, sharp sentence of imprisonment with a prolonged period of supervision in the community in order to address his difficulties with anger management"".  In considering that submission, his Honour observed that programs designed to address anger management are available in prison.
13The judge referred to Dr Furst's reports and had regard to his opinion that the offender probably did not have a frontal lobe syndrome or severe brain injury but that his propensity towards anger was at least partially explained by his mild acquired head injury and the long term effects of viral meningitis suffered during his childhood.
14The judge sentenced the offender as follows:
on count 1 (intimidation) a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 17 January 2014 and a balance of term of 9 months;on count 2 (assault) a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 17 January 2014;on count 4 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 17 April 2014 (that is, accumulated by 3 months) and a balance of term of 6 months;on count 7 (damage to property) a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 17 April 2014;on count 8 (using an offensive weapon for intimidation) a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months commencing on 17 October 2014 (that is, accumulated by a further 6 months) and a balance of term of 18 months;on the s 166 matter (the breach of the apprehended violence order) a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 17 January 2014 (that is, entirely concurrent with the other sentences).
15The applicant had already spent 3 months and 8 days in custody on remand.  The judge took that into account, indicating that the overall intention of the sentences imposed was that the applicant should serve a further 15 months in prison and then be on supervised parole for a further 18 months.  The first date on which the applicant is eligible for parole is 16 April 2015, 15 months from the date of commencement of the first sentence. 
16There are five grounds of appeal.  It is convenient to deal first with those alleging specific error.  Ground 4 is:
""The sentencing judge erred in rejecting the possibility of the charges being dealt with summarily as a circumstance for reducing sentences.""
17The premise of this ground was that counsel for the applicant at the proceedings on sentence had submitted that a relevant circumstance to be taken into account was that the charges of which the offender was convicted could have been dealt with summarily.  In his remarks on sentence, the judge said:
""There was rehearsed, briefly at least, in argument by [counsel for the applicant] the fact that some at least of these matters might have been disposed of in the Local Court and whilst there is no statutory requirement or obligation to take that matter into account, it should be borne in mind when there is a clear case for matters being dealt with in the Local Court when they could and should have been dealt with in the Local Court.""
18Curiously, the transcript of the proceedings on sentence does not bear out the proposition that counsel made any such submission, but in any event his Honour evidently proceeded on the premise that she had.
19The sentencing judge referred to the decision in this Court in Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44.  In that case Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed, undertook a careful analysis of the relevance of the fact that matters that might have been dealt with in the Local Court are disposed of in the District Court, according to the different circumstances in which that event can arise.  Johnson J said (at [103]):
""Circumstances in which a ground of appeal of this type will have real traction are best illustrated by R v El Masri. There, the applicant was committed for trial upon a charge of assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation. He stood trial upon that count, with an alternative count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was acquitted on the first count and pleaded guilty to the second count. The circumstances of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm involved a single punch to the side of the head of the victim, with relatively minor injury resulting. The applicant had no criminal record for offences of violence. This Court took the view that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was, in truth, a summary offence which was only being dealt with in the District Court on indictment, because of the purely indictable count of which the Applicant was acquitted. It was entirely clear that the offence would otherwise have been dealt with summarily, but for the existence of the more serious charge.""    
20In the present case, all of the offences for which the applicant was ultimately sentenced were capable of being dealt with summarily.  The only offences which were not capable of being dealt with summarily were two of the three offences of which he was acquitted by the jury.  As to the offences for which he was sentenced, they were all matters which could have been dealt with summarily but in which an election could be made to proceed to indictment under s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
21The sentencing judge clearly turned his mind to that circumstance.  His Honour made the following finding on that issue:
""The number of charges, their seriousness, the fact that he was on conditional liberty and the fact that he had a history of offending against this victim before all militate in my view against the suggestion that these matters could and should have been dealt with in the Local Court.""
22Before this Court, the applicant was critical of the judge's reliance on the remarks of Johnson J in Zreika, noting that those remarks were directed to the situation where no submission had originally been made to the sentencing Court.  As already noted, the transcript of the proceedings on sentence does not bear out the proposition that counsel made any such submission, but in any event it is clear, in my view, that the sentencing judge had proper regard to that issue in accordance with the principles stated in Zreika.
23On the day on which the applicant was sentenced, counsel repeated her concession that the threshold of s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act had been crossed, that is, that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate.  The basis for that concession was the multiplicity of offences in the face of an existing apprehended violence order (transcript 17 January 2014 at page 4, line 4).  In my view the judge's conclusion set out above was open and accordingly ground 4 must be rejected.
24In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the interesting question raised in the Crown's written submissions as to the significance in this context of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion: cf Elias v R; Issa v R [2013] HCA 31. 
25Ground 3 is:
""The sentencing judge erred in adopting an averaging approach to the reduction for plea.""
26The offender was charged with all matters on 28 March 2012.  The matters were committed to the District Court on 16 January 2013.  On committal, the offender indicated his intention to plead guilty to the charge of breaching the apprehended violence order (the matter on the s 166 certificate) and the offence of damaging property (count 7).  All other matters were committed to the District Court.  The offender was arraigned in the District Court on 7 March 2013, whereupon he entered pleas of guilty to counts 1, 7 and 8.  The other matters were defended and went to trial.  
27On the issue of discount for the pleas of guilty, the judge said:
""Without being mathematically precise about this, I have allowed in relation to the matters on which he is entitled to a discount something in order of one sixth of the sentences which would otherwise have been, in my view, appropriate.""
28The discount allowing ""something in the order of one sixth"" was, in percentage terms, about 16.6 per cent.  The sentencing judge evidently applied that discount to all of the matters to which the applicant ultimately pleaded guilty.  It may be accepted that, for pleas entered in the Local Court, a discount of 25 per cent would ordinarily be allowed.  The applicant submitted that this should have applied to the charges of assault, malicious damage and the breach of the apprehended violence order.  In fact, it was only the malicious damage and the breach of the apprehended violence order which were the subject of pleas entered in the Local Court.  If those two sentences had been discounted by 25 per cent instead of 16.6, it would have made a difference of about 18 days in the case of count 7 and about 37 days for the s 166 matter, but each of those sentences was entirely concurrent with other sentences.  Accordingly, the application of the full discount for those matters would have made no difference to the overall sentence imposed on the applicant.  
29It follows, in my view, that this Court is not required to re-sentence on the basis of the issue raised by ground 3: cf Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37 at [43].
30Ground 2 is:
""The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant showed an attitude of continuing disobedience warranting emphasis on specific deterrence.""
31This ground cannot succeed unless the applicant demonstrates that the judge's finding was not open on the material before him. The judge said:
""What his behaviour during the course of these offences and subsequently indicates is a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law.""
32In my view, that finding was well open on the material before the judge.  The relevant events were as follows.
33According to the applicant's criminal history, on 14 December 2011, while he was still aged 17, the applicant committed two offences of common assault, an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and an offence of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause the victim fear of physical or mental harm.  Those charges related to the same victim as in the case of the present matters. 
34On 20 December 2011 an interim apprehended violence order was made prohibiting contact between the applicant and the victim.
35The applicant was dealt with for the December offences on 21 February 2012.  He was placed on a six month good behaviour bond for each offence.  One of the offences for which he was dealt with at that time was a breach of an apprehended violence order recorded as having been committed on 14 December 2011, suggesting that the interim order made on 20 December 2011 was not the first domestic violence order against the applicant, or else that it was made earlier and breached almost immediately.
36It follows that, as at the date of these offences, the applicant had a prior conviction for breaching an apprehended violence order; remained subject to an apprehended violence order and was on a good behaviour bond, having been sentenced just over a month earlier.  
37Following the commission of the present offences, the applicant was arrested and refused bail.  He was granted bail on 6 July 2012.  On 27 May 2013 he committed a further offence of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause the victim to fear physical or mental harm, involving a different female victim.  Mr Ramage QC, who appears for the applicant, noted that he received a bond for that offence, suggesting that it was not serious.  It was.  The applicant sent a series of threatening and degrading messages to his new partner, demanding that she ring him or answer her phone, calling her a ""dog"" and a ""slut"" and making serious threats of violence to her and her family.  The messages reveal a sense of entitlement on the applicant's part to control his partners in the most threatening and offensive way.  The contact continued even after police answered the victim's phone and asked the applicant to stop calling her. 
38It was plainly open to the judge to conclude that the applicant was a person in respect of whom specific deterrence was an important consideration.  The applicant submitted that ""the fact that there had been one breach of an AVO order which was involved intimately with the commission of the instant offences and one later (dealt with by a bond) by an offender who was just beyond being regarded as a juvenile could not properly be regarded as showing an attitude of continuing disobedience to the law requiring an emphasis on specific deterrence"".  I disagree.  In my view, the submission misapprehends the seriousness of domestic violence and the difficulty of stopping it.  The applicant was exactly the kind of offender who needed to have the seriousness of his repeated offending brought home to him.  In my view, ground 2 must be rejected.
39Ground 1 is:
""The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account or sufficiently take into account the subjective matters.""
40It has frequently been noted that a ground which complains of the giving of insufficient weight to particular factors relevant to the sentencing exercise faces difficulty.  The weight to be given to individual factors is quintessentially a matter of discretionary judgment.  Appellate interference with the exercise of such judgment is narrowly constrained.
41The applicant identified three specific aspects of his subject circumstances said to have been given insufficient weight.  The first was his youth. The judge plainly had regard to the fact that the applicant was only aged 18 at the time of commission of the offences and had regard to the principles which have been stated by this Court on that issue.  It was submitted that no moderation in the emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than deterrence in the case of young offenders was warranted, since none of the features usually regarded as ""adult behaviour"" (such as the use of weapons, planning or premeditation) are present in this case.  In fact, the applicant's offending did involve the use of a weapon (a knife used to intimidate a woman).
42The second aspect of the subjective circumstances said to have been given insufficient weight is the prior good character of the applicant.  The judge specifically referred to a reference from the applicant's employer:
""Who describes him as ""a worthwhile and trustee employee"" and the support from referees who describe him as ""a polite and helpful young man"".  Clearly the offender has good qualities but he has this distressing inability, as [the victim] puts it, to deal with the emotional consequences of intimate relationships with young women.""
43The applicant complains that the judge made no reference to the work history set out in the report of Dr Furst.  It was submitted that the Court ""should have"" taken his good character into account in his favour justifying ""some leniency"".  In my view, that submission amounts to an open invitation to this Court to approach the appeal as if the task were to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh.  That is not the role of this Court.  
44The final factor in the subjective case said not to have been given sufficient weight by the sentencing judge was the applicant's disability.  The judge expressly referred to the relevant evidence, evidently accepting Dr Furst's opinion that the applicant's propensity towards anger was probably at least partially explained by his medical history.  The applicant submitted that the judges' remarks referring to that opinion were made in the context of a future treatment plan rather than as a matter going ""to minimising his culpability"".  I am not persuaded that error is established in the approach taken by the sentencing judge.  The remarks on sentence make plain that his Honour had regard to each of the factors identified by the applicant.  The applicant's submissions amount in effect to a complaint that the judge could have had greater regard to those factors.  It does not follow that he was wrong not to.  In my view, ground 1 must be dismissed.
45The final ground of appeal is ""the total sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe"".
46A ground framed in those terms cannot be upheld unless it is found that, notwithstanding the absence of specific error, the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
47An aspect of the submissions in support of this ground was the contention that the applicant's offending did not mandate a full-time custodial sentence.  That it did had been conceded by counsel for the offender who appeared at the proceedings on sentence.  As already noted, after the jury returned its verdicts, she said ""ultimately I'll be urging upon your Honour the custodial sentence that Madam Crown has asked for, but a custodial sentence with a non-parole period to reflect the time served and a very lengthy additional period subject to considerable supervision"".
48In my view, the submissions on this ground amounted in substance to the contention that a more lenient sentence could have been imposed.  It is not enough to establish that a sentence was stern or even ""harsh and severe"".  What must be established is that, notwithstanding the absence of specific error, the sentence is so excessive as to demonstrate in itself that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [26] to [28].  I am not persuaded that it did.  In my view, ground 5 must be dismissed.
49The orders I propose are:
(1)that leave to appeal be granted;
(2)that the appeal be dismissed.
50R A HULME J:   I agree with McCallum J.

		31 December 2014",2014-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765627,Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with the analysis of McCallum J and the error which she has identified.  Regrettably, I cannot agree with the extent of the discount found to be appropriate by her Honour and the sentence which she has proposed.  In my opinion, the appropriate discount should be 40 per cent.  I would adjust the indicative sentences as follows:
Count 3 - 2 years 5 months.Count 2 - 4 years 10 months.Count 1 - 6 years.
2On that basis, I would impose an aggregate sentence of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.
3McCALLUM J:  The applicant, to whom I will refer as 'Z', seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court in respect of three drug offences.  Two of the offences were defended and the applicant was found guilty by a jury after a trial.  The first (count 1) was an offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985.  Pursuant to s 33 of the Act, the maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for life.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
4The second matter defended by the applicant (count 2) was an offence of manufacturing a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
5The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty (count 3) was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely 9.869 kg of cannabis, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 10 years.  
6In sentencing the applicant on count 2, the judge took into account an offence on a form 1, being an offence of possessing a precursor (1.588 kg of 1-phenyl-2-propanone) intended for use in the manufacture of methylamphetamine contrary to s 24A(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 10 years.  
7A statement of the relevant facts was agreed for the purpose of the proceedings on sentence.  The charge relating to a large commercial quantity of MDMA (count 1) arose out of the execution of a search warrant by police at premises in a Sydney suburb.  Police found a number of items which, upon analysis, contained MDMA or traces of MDMA, including equipment used in the manufacture of that drug.  Chemical notes and literature located at different premises in rural New South Wales (where the methylamphetamine the subject of count 2 was manufactured) corresponded with the process of manufacture and pilling of the MDMA there.  Pill presses located at the Sydney premises were of a type that could perform the ""pilling"" stage of the manufacturing process at a rate consistent with there having been not less than 500 grams produced (approximately 1500 tablets).  Evidence of a fingerprint of the applicant on a measuring jug at the Sydney address established direct participation on his part in the manufacturing process.  
8The charge relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine (count 2) also arose from the execution of a search warrant by police, at the premises in rural New South Wales.  Police found methylamphetamine or traces of methylamphetamine on items associated with the manufacture of that drug.  
9The judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that the jury must have accepted that he had arranged for another person to be the cook and had contact with that person during the manufacturing process in telephone conversations which were intercepted by police.  The Crown case, evidently accepted by the jury, was that the equipment found supported the inference that a quantity of no less than 250 grams of methylamphetamine had been manufactured at those premises.
10The Crown submitted at the proceedings on sentence that, based on the content of the intercepted telephone conversations, it should be found that the applicant was at the top of the hierarchy and was the sole principal in the enterprise.  The judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that fact, finding that both the applicant and another co-offender were principals in the enterprise at either of the locations.
11The agreed facts in respect of count 3 were that on 4 July 2008, another co-offender went interstate to purchase cannabis on behalf of the applicant and himself.  The quality was not satisfactory, so that co-offender returned to Sydney.  Shortly thereafter, the applicant also went interstate and purchased a quantity of cannabis later found by police at the home of the other principal.  The quantity of cannabis found by police was 9.869 kg.  
12The applicant had prior convictions for drug offences but, as noted by the sentencing judge, the prior offences were not remotely as serious as the present charges.  In New South Wales, he has a conviction for possession of a prohibited drug for which he was fined in 2001.  He also has a conviction in Victoria in 2004 for trafficking a drug of dependence for which he received a sentence of imprisonment for 6 months partially suspended.  The sentencing judge found that the need for individual deterrence, while present, was not as great as it would have been had the prior offences been of a level of seriousness similar to the present matters.
13The judge gave careful consideration to issues of parity with a number of co-offenders, being the cook, the man who first travelled interstate to buy the cannabis and, most relevantly, the other principal.  No ground of appeal is raised in the present appeal as to the manner in which his Honour addressed those issues.
14There was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant had given assistance to authorities of the highest quality and usefulness. The judge accepted that the applicant was entitled to a substantial deduction from his sentences for that assistance.  After considering relevant authorities, his Honour concluded that a discount of 25 per cent should be allowed.  His Honour's conclusion on that issue is the principal ground of appeal.
15In respect of the charge of supplying cannabis (count 3), the judge indicated a starting point of 4 years.  His Honour allowed a combined discount of 37.5 per cent (25 per cent for assistance and 12.5 per cent for the plea entered on the first day of the trial).  His Honour stated that the application of those discounts produced a net sentence of 2 years and 4 months imprisonment.  In fact, the correct calculation is 2 years and 6 months.  In any event, his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 4 months commencing on the agreed starting date of 1 April 2011 and expiring on 31 July 2013.
16For the offence of manufacturing methylamphetamine (count 2), his Honour indicated a starting point of 8 years and 8 months, reduced to 6 years and 6 months after applying the discount of 25 per cent for assistance.  His Honour made a finding of special circumstances on the basis that it would be the applicant's first period of lengthy imprisonment and that he would need a lengthy period of supervision on parole to address his problems with substance abuse and gambling.  His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 4 years for that offence.  The sentence was fixed to commence on 1 October 2012, which meant that it was accumulated by 18 months upon the sentence imposed for count 3.  The sentence passed was a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 1 October 2012 and expiring on 31 September 2016 (as said) and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 1 April 2019 (as said).  
17For the offence of manufacturing MDMA in a large commercial quantity (count 1), the sentencing judge also indicated a starting point of 8 years and 8 months, reduced to 6 years and 6 months after applying the discount of 25 per cent for assistance.  For that offence, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 1 April 2014 and expiring on 31 March 2017 and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 30 September 2020.
18At the time of passing sentence, the judge accidentally identified the commencement date in respect of count 1 as being 1 April 2015.  His Honour had intended to identify 1 April 2014 as the starting date for that sentence.  The error was later corrected.
19The effect of the sentences was accordingly an overall sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and 6 months commencing on 1 April 2011 and expiring on 30 September 2020 with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 1 April 2011 and expiring on 31 March 2017.  
20The first ground of appeal is:
""The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant's sentence on the basis of his assistance to the authorities.""

21The applicant's assistance to authorities was evidenced by exhibits C, D and E.  For obvious reasons, the sentencing judge did not expose the contents of those documents except to record that police regarded the assistance to be ""of the highest quality and usefulness"".  The judge considered that the Crown had correctly conceded that to be the case. His Honour recorded the real prospect of considerable danger to the applicant's life and those of his loved ones which ""will never disappear"".  He noted that, in all probability, the applicant would have to be relocated overseas and that members of his family had already been relocated.  His Honour also noted that, as a result of his assistance, the applicant will spend his time in custody in isolation and that, as a result of the relocation of his family, he receives few visits and is extremely lonely.  
22On the strength of those findings, which the Crown does not dispute, it appears to have been incontestable that, subject to the requirement of proportionality recognised in s 23(3) of the Act, the applicant had established a basis for consideration to be given to allowing a discount at or close to the highest end of the appropriate range.  The question raised by ground 1 is whether the judge erred in his determination as to what the appropriate range is.  
23In his careful and lengthy remarks on sentence, the judge frankly noted his ""anxiety"" as to whether the reduction he had allowed for assistance to authorities was sufficient.  His Honour considered some of the authorities dealing with the case of an offender who is entitled to a combined discount for both assistance and a plea of guilty.  His Honour's anxiety appears to have stemmed from uncertainty (in the absence of any clear guidance on the issue in the authorities) as to the proper application of those statements of principle to the case of a person who has not pleaded guilty and who is entitled only to a discount for assistance.  That is the critical issue raised by the present appeal.   
24In determining that issue, it is appropriate to begin with the words of the statute.  Section 23 evinces a clear intention to encourage and reward the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities.  It achieves that object by conferring power on a sentencing judge to impose a lesser penalty than would otherwise be imposed.  The determination as to whether to impose a lesser penalty and the nature and extent of the penalty to be imposed is guided by the mandatory considerations listed in s 23(2).  Consideration of those matters in the present case pointed unequivocally to the imposition of a substantially lesser penalty than would otherwise be imposed.
25The power to reduce a penalty on that basis is subject to the important constraint stated in s 23(3) that a lesser penalty imposed under the section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  That provision implicitly acknowledges that a reduction for assistance may produce a penalty that does not wholly reflect the seriousness of the offending.  The sentence, if disproportionate, must not be ""unreasonably"" so.
26Separately, the Act requires the sentencing court to take into account, where appropriate, the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty.  That is also an occasion for imposing a lesser penalty than would otherwise have been imposed: see s 22 of the Act.  A guideline judgment of this Court has stated that the utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence: R v Thompson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.  Consideration of the enduring requirement of reasonable proportionality (recognised in s 23(3)) is complicated by the fact that some offenders attract the operation of both provisions.  In such a case, the risk of an unreasonably disproportionate sentence is more acute.
27The view has been expressed and endorsed in this Court that, in general, a single, combined discount should be given for both a plea of guilty and assistance and that such a discount should not normally exceed 50 per cent: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [3] per Howie J; Simpson J agreeing at [1]; at [53] per Buddin J.  Buddin J ventured the view that a combined discount exceeding 50 per cent should be reserved for an exceptional case (at [53]). 
28The decision in SZ was considered by this Court in C v R [2013] NSWCCA 81.  In that case, the sentencing judge had allowed a combined discount of 35 per cent.  Having regard to the timing of the plea, it was submitted on appeal that the discount for assistance must have been as low as 10 per cent (on the premise that the discount for the plea must have been 25 per cent).  A discount for assistance at that level was said to be inadequate in circumstances where the offender had assisted police to arrest two of the intended recipients of a quantity of imported cocaine, resulting in his being fearful both for himself and for his family.  The Court of Criminal Appeal did not accept that the discount for assistance must necessarily have been as low as 10 per cent but was nonetheless persuaded that the combined discount of 35 per cent was inadequate (at [44]).  In resentencing the applicant, the Court allowed a discount ""approaching 45 per cent"" (at [47]).
29The sentencing judge in the present case appears to have understood the decisions in SZ and C to be inconsistent with the allowance of a discount of up to 50 per cent for assistance alone.  While his Honour did not say so in terms, his reasoning appears to have been that, if a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should not normally exceed 50 per cent, it follows that a discount for assistance alone should not normally exceed 25 per cent.   
30That is implicit in his Honour's remarks concerning the authorities relied upon by the applicant.  His Honour noted that the decision in SZ holds that a combined discount should not ordinarily exceed 50 per cent.  His Honour then recorded the fact that, in C, it had been submitted that there should be a discount of 20-50 per cent for assistance alone and that the Court had allowed a discount of 45 per cent as a combined discount.
31Finally, his Honour referred to an unreported decision of Zahra DCJ where there was a discount for assistance of 40 per cent.  His Honour said:
""While I have the greatest of respect for the decision of my very experienced colleague, I do not see in [counsel for the applicant's] submissions any decision of a court binding upon me to the effect that a discount of 40-50 per cent, as I understood [counsel for the applicant] to be suggesting for assistance alone, is within an appropriate range.""
32Those remarks suggest that his Honour understood from the authorities cited by counsel that a discount for assistance alone in the order of 40-50 per cent would be impermissible or outside an appropriate range.  My conclusion that his Honour approached the issue on that basis is reinforced by his repeated references to the very high order of assistance offered by the applicant and the ""very great dangers incurred as a result"".
33The applicant's submissions have persuaded me that the sentencing judge acted upon a wrong principle in that respect.  His Honour was not constrained by the fact that the applicant had not pleaded guilty to stop at 25 per cent discount for assistance to authorities.  The only constraint was that imposed by s 23(3) which, as has been observed by this Court, will not generally be met by allowing a combined discount of more than 50 per cent.
34In reaching this conclusion I intend no criticism of the sentencing judge, whose careful and anxious attention to this issue is manifest from the remarks on sentence.  His Honour may have been concerned, as I have been, by the prospect of unequal justice.  On the authority of SZ, it may appear at first glance that an offender who pleads not guilty but provides assistance of the highest order is eligible to have his penalty reduced by the same amount as an offender who provides assistance of the same high order but also pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity.  That of course is an entirely hypothetical comparison.  To the extent that there is at least a theoretical possibility of unequal justice being occasioned on that account, it is resolved by s 23(3).  As explained by Howie J in SZ, that provision reflects the common law principle that there is ""a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set"".  It is recognised that the bottom line ordinarily sits at 50 per cent of the sentence that would have been imposed but for the discounts allowed by the statute.  But it does not follow that the Act must be construed with an implied algorithm (flowing from the premise established by Thompson and Houlton) that a discount for assistance cannot exceed 25 per cent.  To construe the Act with that level of mathematical rigidity would come close to punishing some offenders who offer assistance for not pleading guilty.
35Ground 2 is:
The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant in respect of the offence of supplying cannabis by sentencing the applicant against a maximum penalty of 15 years whereas the correct maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years.
36The Crown acknowledged the apparent error in his Honour's statement of the applicable maximum but submitted that it is not one which would attract the intervention of this Court, citing the judgment of Kirby J in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284.  Those submissions were written before the recent decision of the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37.  In Kentwell, the Court noted that the three members of the   the Court in Baxter took different views as to the proper construction of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (which governs the determination of appeals against sentence).  The plurality said (at [42]):
Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.   
37Notwithstanding the error identified in this ground, I regard the starting point of 4 years, in all the circumstances, to be the appropriate sentence for the offence.  As already noted, there was an error of calculation in the application of the discount (in favour of the applicant).  Having regard to my conclusion as to ground 1, it is necessary to revisit the discount in any event. 
38Ground 3 is:
The learned sentencing judge erred in structuring the sentences such that the degree of accumulation between the individual sentences is manifestly excessive leading to a total effective sentence which is manifestly excessive.
39Since I consider that the appeal should be allowed on the strength of ground 1, it is not strictly necessary to determine ground 3.  The appropriate degree of accumulation is inextricably linked with the discount for assistance.  It is enough to indicate that, in my view, it would be difficult both to increase the discount and to reduce the degree of accumulation without arriving at a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the seriousness of the applicant's offending.  
40In light of the success of ground 1, it is necessary to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh.  For reasons I will explain, I consider it appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence, as allowed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
41In Kentwell at [43], the High Court said:
After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal
42I have concluded that a lesser overall sentence is warranted.  In my view, in all the circumstances, the starting point nominated by the sentencing judge for count 3 was the appropriate sentence for that offence before the application of any discount.  For each of counts 1 and 2 the judge indicated a starting point of 8 years and 8 months.  However, count 1 was more serious than count 2, since it involved a large commercial quantity and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.  Further, I would not, in the independent exercise of my discretion, start at a point of the mathematical precision of the terms identified.  I consider the appropriate starting point for count 1 was in fact higher than that stated by the judge, namely, 10 years while the appropriate starting point for count 2 was 8 years.
43For the reasons already explained, I consider that the applicant is entitled to have those penalties reduced by 50 per cent for assistance unless the application of a discount of that order would produce a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the seriousness of the applicant's offending.  I propose to address that issue in the degree of accumulation reflected in the aggregate sentence.  On that basis, I indicate that the sentences that I would have proposed had separate sentences been proposed instead of an aggregate sentence are 2 years for count 3, 4 years for count 2 and 5 years for count 1.
44On that basis, I would impose an aggregate sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
45The orders I propose are:
(1)that leave to appeal be granted;
(2)that the appeal be allowed;
(3)that the sentences passed at first instance be quashed and in substitution therefor that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 1 April 2011 and expiring on 30 September 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 31 March 2018.
46GARLING J: I agree with McCallum J's proposed orders, and with her reasons for them.  It is important at all times, as her Honour's judgment shows, to keep firmly in mind two features.  First, that there is no algorithmic approach to the application of a discount for assistance.  Secondly, whatever sentence results is one which must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

		31 December 2014",2014-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765629,"R v Barbieri, Mitchell; R v Barbieri, Fiona [2014] NSWSC 1808","Judgment
1R A HULME J:  Mitchell Barbieri appears for sentence for the crime of murder.  On 6 December 2012 he murdered a police officer, Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson, who was performing his duty in trying to arrest him.  
2Mr Barbieri pleaded guilty to that crime.  He has asked that his guilt of four further offences listed on a Form 1 document be taken into account:  two of assault, one of resisting arrest, and one of possessing a prohibited weapon.
3Mr Barbieri's mother, Fiona Barbieri, also appears for sentence.  She has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Inspector Anderson and the Crown has accepted that plea in lieu of a charge of murder.  There is a dispute about the basis of manslaughter upon which she is to be sentenced but I will come back to that. Ms Barbieri has also pleaded guilty to the crime of using an offensive weapon with intent to hinder the lawful apprehension of her son.
4Ms Barbieri also asked when I sentence her for the second of those offences that her guilt in respect of two further offences be taken into account: assaulting another police officer, Detective Senior Constable Darren Caulfield causing him actual bodily harm, and possessing a prohibited weapon.
5Both offenders were due to be tried before a jury but they pleaded guilty on the day the trial was due to commence.
6The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life.  If certain conditions are established, a sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory.  There is also prescribed for certain cases involving the murder of a police officer a standard non-parole period of 25 years. 
7The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years.  The maximum penalty for using an offensive weapon with intent to hinder lawful apprehension is imprisonment for 12 years.
Victim impact statements
8Ten victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing.  I have taken them into account aside from a few sentences to which objection was taken on the basis of relevance.  (They concerned some personal expressions of feelings towards the offenders that are understandable but which I am not allowed to take into account.)
9I am grateful to Bryson Anderson's parents, wife, brothers and eldest son for providing statements about the impact that his death has had upon them.  They describe a man who was undoubtedly very special.  It is said that he was his wife's ""best friend"".  He was ""loyal"", ""caring"", ""humble"", ""ethical"", ""honest"", ""a devoted and supportive father"", and generally, ""a good man"".  I repeat that they have my sincere sympathy.
10Statements were also provided by four of the many police officers who were present at the scene. They provide graphic and moving descriptions of just what a horrific and traumatic experience it was to see a respected senior officer killed while leading his colleagues in the performance of their duty in upholding the law.  It needs no imagination to think that it must have been the same for all of the officers who were present.
11One of the purposes of sentencing is recognise the harm done to the community.  Harm to the community is always caused when an innocent life is taken but the way in which the harm is felt varies.  It is certainly the case that the community has been harmed by the taking of the life of Inspector Anderson.  The NSW Police Force is the poorer for not having him as a member, a leader, and a future holder of high rank.   The community has also been harmed by the psychological damage that has been caused to his fellow officers who were present at the scene, and to police officers generally who have lost a leader and respected colleague.  It has also been harmed by the profound and eternal grief and loss that has been caused to Inspector Anderson's family and friends. 
12The killing of a police officer in the performance of his or her duty is always regarded as a crime of extreme seriousness.  This case exemplifies why that is so. Thousands of police officers go to work each day not knowing what tasks may await them and what dangers might confront them.  But we should never forget that they do this willingly in the service of, and for the protection of, us all. 
13Much of what I have to deal with in giving my reasons for the sentences that I am going to impose will be concerned with the circumstances of the offences and of the offenders.  That is a legal necessity.  But it should not be thought that for one moment I have lost sight of the impact that these terrible crimes have had.
Facts
14There was disagreement as to certain facts relating to the commission of the offences but agreement as to some peripheral matters.  In those circumstances, it became necessary for me to make a number of findings of fact.  In doing so I have borne in mind that where matters are found that are adverse to the offenders they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
15In 2001 the Barbieri family moved to a 5-acre property at Oakville, a semi-rural area on the outskirts of Sydney.  Kevin Waters and his family moved into a similar sized property next door in about 2002.  Whilst the relationship between the two families was cordial, at least, it became antagonistic from about 2010.  The Barbieris came to believe that Mr Waters wanted to force them from their property so he could buy it cheaply.  They also came to believe that he was conspiring to have them killed.  I will say more about these beliefs later.
16On Monday 3 December 2012, a stick was thrown at the Waters' house with a note attached.  What was written on the note does not appear to make sense but the incident prompted Mr Waters to engage an electrician to install floodlighting along the boundary between the two properties.
17On Thursday 6 December 2012, the electrician, Mr Peter Yard was working on the Waters' property near the boundary fence using a ladder to install a floodlight in a tree.  At about 1pm, Fiona Barbieri approached Mr Yard and verbally challenged him.  She took a number of photographs of Mr Yard and his equipment.  Mitchell Barbieri joined his mother and they loudly protested Mr Yard's presence.  Mr Yard left the area to speak to Mr Waters. 18Mr Yard returned some time later with Keith West, a man who worked for Mr Waters.  Fiona and Mitchell Barbieri had gone away but also returned to the area.  Ms Barbieri was holding a small baseball bat and was swinging it.  They both continued to demand that Mr Yard leave.  Mitchell Barbieri was holding a compound bow and he fired two arrows, one in the general direction of Mr Yard and Mr West and, a short time later, the other in the general direction of Mr Waters and his son, Kurt.  In firing these arrows he intended to cause the men to fear immediate and unlawful violence.  These actions comprise the two offences of assault that Mitchell Barbieri asks to be taken into account.
19The verbal altercation continued.  Kevin Waters told Fiona and Mitchell Barbieri that he would be calling the police.  Eventually the Barbieris left the area and went inside their house.
Events after police arrive
20The first police arrived at the scene at about 2.25pm.  They went to the Waters' property first where they spoke to people and obtained statements.  Various other police arrived over the course of the next hour or so and were briefed with the situation.  It was apparent that the Barbieris had retreated into their home.  It was determined that an offence had been committed, at least by way of an assault by Mitchell Barbieri having fired arrows at people next door.  He was going to be arrested.  
21Three emails were sent between 2.41pm and 3.11pm by one or the other of the offenders, but with the awareness of both of them.  They were addressed to various federal politicians; made bizarre claims about Kevin Waters; said that ""corrupt police"" were attempting to break in; and asserted a right to defend themselves and their property.  A blind copy of each was sent to the president of Russia.
22Further police arrived and some of them gathered at the front gate, which was padlocked.  Mitchell Barbieri sent a text message at 3.12pm to his father, Angelo Barbieri, saying, ""Coppers at our gate clearly to ambush us to [sic] standing up for ourselves"". 
23Detective Senior Constable Chris Ornatowski, who was the designated negotiator, called out to Mitchell and Fiona Barbieri to come out for a chat.  Curtains on the front windows of the house were closed but one of the offenders was seen to point a camera between the curtains to take photographs of the officers.  Dogs could be heard barking from within the house.  At one stage, Fiona Barbieri opened the curtains.  Police continued to try and make verbal contact but there was no response.
24A decision was taken for officers to don ballistics vests and approach the house.  Some of the officers were allocated to various vantage points to keep watch whilst others went to the front of the house.
25Detective Ornatowski knocked on a front window and called out, ""It's the police.  Fiona and Mitchell we need to talk to you"".  Fiona Barbieri was heard to say to her son, ""They're right out the front"".  There followed a period of about 25 minutes of the police endeavouring to engage with the pair through the front windows.  The officers repeatedly made clear who they were and why they were there.  Fiona Barbieri responded with claims that all police were corrupt and mentioned that the situation was being dealt with ""on an international level"".  Most of the interaction was with Fiona Barbieri but occasionally Mitchell made a contribution along similar lines to that of his mother.   All the while there were two large dogs within the house who were barking aggressively.  On a couple of occasions the dogs were removed to somewhere else in the house but soon returned. 
26Inspector Bryson Anderson was one of the officers at the front of the house during this phase.  He announced who he was, by name and rank.  The offenders continued to reject attempts for rational discussion with claims that all of the police were corrupt.  They were told to go away.  Mitchell Barbieri suggested that if the officers had any questions they should put them in writing.  His mother added that if the officers had any questions they would be answered by email.
27Inspector Anderson (who was in uniform) obtained a shovel from somewhere and made a rudimentary attempt to jemmy open some French doors leading to the dining room.  Fiona Barbieri responded, ""You say you're not corrupt but look at him with his stars and stripes, what's he doing?""  Then, to Mitchell, she said, ""They're trying to break in"". Inspector Anderson gave up that attempt.
28At one point, Detective Caulfield put his arm around Inspector Anderson and said, ""He's a commissioned officer, this is Bryson Anderson"".  Fiona Barbieri responded to the effect that she did not care. 
29Inspector Anderson and Sergeant Adam Fitzgibbon moved to the rear of the house and proceeded onto a small raised veranda.  Other officers followed.  Two constables were already in position against the back wall of the house.  The back door of the house led from the kitchen to the veranda.  Beside that door was a window that overlooked the veranda.
30Inspector Anderson engaged Mitchell Barbieri in conversation through the kitchen window.  He again announced his name, rank and station.  He told Mitchell that he was wanted in connection with an offence and asked him to open the door immediately.  He used a tone that was described as assertive yet calm.  However, Mitchell rejected any notion of being under arrest for an offence and said he was not going anywhere.  He suggested that the police should go away (with an extensive use of expletives).
31There was some inconsistency in the recollections of the officers as to how clearly they could see through the window into the kitchen; some saying venetian blinds were almost closed whilst others saying they were open.  I conclude that there was vision but it was limited.  There was no lighting within the house and an officer who later went inside said it was dark because curtains were closed.  Nevertheless, I accept evidence to the effect that both Mitchell and Fiona Barbieri could be seen within the kitchen.  I do not accept that Fiona Barbieri was not there at all until the very end.
32There was continued verbal engagement with the offenders.  The officers, primarily Inspector Anderson, were trying to encourage them to open the door and allow the police to enter.  I am satisfied that this was done in a professional way; that is, it was not in a manner that would, ordinarily, have inflamed occupants of normal disposition. Nevertheless, the responses from within continued to assert that the officers should leave, again with a liberal use of expletives.  Mitchell Barbieri's tone of voice was described by one of the constables as ""highly agitated and aggressive"".  Fiona Barbieri was screaming out in the background.
33It is of relevance to note that all of the officers who were on the veranda and within sight of the occupants were in full police uniform.  Their ballistics vests had the word ""POLICE"" prominently displayed at the front. There can have been no doubt who they were.  There also can have been no doubt that Bryson Anderson was a senior officer; his rank as an inspector had been conveyed a number of times, both at the rear of the house and earlier at the front windows.  Fiona Barbieri had earlier commented on his ""stars and stripes"".
34Inspector Anderson directed officers to remove a locked flyscreen at the back door and they did so.  Fiona Barbieri warned her son that ""the cunts are coming in"".  Inspector Anderson continued his attempt to persuade Mitchell to open the door but he replied in no uncertain terms that the police were not coming in and should go away.
35Inspector Anderson turned to Sergeant Fitzgibbon and announced, ""We're going in"".  The sergeant forced the back door open with his boot.  There was continued yelling and swearing from inside.  Inspector Anderson was standing on the veranda somewhere adjacent to the kitchen window and the door.  Sergeant Fitzgibbon called out, ""Get back, he's got a gas cylinder"".  Mitchell Barbieri was holding a gas cylinder and the sergeant feared that he might be intending to set fire to the house or to throw the cylinder at police. 
36The two dogs then ran out onto the veranda.  They were large and fearsome looking beasts and caused several officers to deploy their capsicum spray devices.  Almost immediately, Mitchell Barbieri emerged from the door, lunged towards Inspector Anderson and delivered two blows in quick succession with a knife.  Officers quickly moved to disarm and restrain him.  There was quite a struggle to do so.
37Almost immediately, Fiona Barbieri emerged with a 1.8kg sledgehammer which she held in a threatening manner over her head.  There was a dispute about this but I accept the following evidence.  Constable Hannah Watson said she saw Ms Barbieri holding the hammer over her head and swinging it towards someone. Plainclothes Constable Mark Camilleri described her holding the hammer above her head in a threatening manner as if she was ready to strike.   Detective Caulfield said she moved towards the officers who were holding Mitchell Barbieri and was about to hit one of them when he intervened.  During his struggle to restrain her she unsuccessfully tried twice to hit him.  At least one of these attempts was directed at his head but missed and she struck his shin on the follow through.  Detective Senior Constable Matthew Clancy confirmed that she was swinging the object in an aggressive manner towards Detective Caulfield.  
38Ms Barbieri eventually dropped the sledgehammer and was restrained but not without a violent struggle during which she thrashed about and bit Detective Caulfield on his forearm and wrist. Even Mitchell Barbieri, who was arguing with the officers who were trying to restrain him, had to call out to her to comply with the officers' demands.
39It quickly emerged that Inspector Anderson had been critically injured.  Yet, according to Constable James Ghata, he motioned to assist the officers who were attempting to apprehend Mitchell Barbieri.  His instinct to help fellow officers in trouble prevailed for a moment over the injuries he had sustained.  However, officers sensed the gravity of the situation and moved him a short distance away from the melee.  They summoned help and began to attend to him as best they could.  
40A barrage of expletive laden abuse of the officers continued to emanate from both of the Barbieris until they were removed to the front of the house and placed into police vehicles. Fiona Barbieri was heard by Constable Ryan Mitchell to say, ""It's his own fucking fault, he fucking deserved it"", before she was placed into a truck.  Two ambulance officers arrived at about this time (about 4.25pm).  They each claim to have heard Ms Barbieri say, ""Let the dog cunt die, he deserves to fucking die"".  This was disputed.
41The ambulance officers commenced their attempts to revive and treat Inspector Anderson.  Whilst they were doing so they heard a male on the veranda, which must have been Mitchell Barbieri before he had been removed to the front of the house, say, ""Let the copper cunt die, fuck him"".  This also was disputed.
42The ambulance officers were required to attend the sentence hearing for cross-examination.  They were each impressive witnesses who were steadfast in maintaining that they had heard the offenders say these things.  Counsel identified a number of reasons to doubt the accuracy and reliability of the evidence and I have considered them all.  In terms of the sentencing outcome of the case, this issue is very minor and so it is not worth spending time giving expansive reasons.  I simply record that I am not persuaded that it is a reasonable possibility that the officers were mistaken, dishonest, or had colluded with each other.  I am satisfied that the statements were made by the offenders as the officers claimed.
43When out the front of the property, Mitchell Barbieri was cautioned and asked why he had stabbed Inspector Anderson.  He replied, ""That will happen when you guys do home invasions"".  He was searched and a folding knife was found in his pocket.
Subsequent events
44Inspector Anderson was taken to Hawkesbury Hospital.  Death was pronounced just after 5.00pm.  An autopsy revealed that he had sustained a full-thickness wound to the left side of the face that resulted in minor soft tissue injury and injury to the upper jawbone.  The fatal wound was one that penetrated between the 1st and 2nd rib on the right side and penetrated 14cm down into the right lung.
45Mitchell Barbieri was taken to Windsor police station and later to Penrith police station.  He engaged in a recorded discussion with police in which he exercised his right to silence in respect of answering questions about what had occurred that day.  He said he wanted assistance from the Russian consular office.  He was seeking to revoke his Australian citizenship and to obtain political asylum because of persecution for having reported and stood up against human rights abuse, corruption and terrorism.  He denied having any problem with his mental health.
46Fiona Barbieri was also taken to Penrith police station and also engaged in a recorded discussion with police in which she asserted her right to silence in respect of the events of the day.  However, at one point she indicated that she did not know anything about the murder of Bryson Anderson and said what had occurred was that she and her son were ambushed by an army of police officers and that it was self-defence.  
47Ms Barbieri indicated a preference to speak with the Russian President or one of his representatives, as she did not trust anybody in ""the Australian bureaucratic system"".  She said something about ""it"" being bigger than the corrupt police department and the corrupt federal parliament; it was ""an international matter"".  She said that she and her son were seeking asylum in Russia.  At her insistence, she was permitted to speak by telephone with the Russian Embassy in Canberra.  She tried to persuade the person she spoke with to make urgent contact with Mr Putin to inform him of her and her son's plight.  It would appear that she was not satisfied with the response she received. She told the interviewing officers that she did not have any problem with her mental health.
48Police remained at the scene at Oakville for a number of days.  They collected a number of weapons and other items from the house as exhibits.  These included a number of Molotov cocktails (glass bottles containing petrol and wicks) found in the freezer compartment of a fridge in a granny flat and a slingshot found in a kitchen cupboard.  Those items are the basis of the offence of Possess prohibited weapon without permit that each offender asks be taken into account. 
49Booby-traps in the form of upturned nails protruding from pieces of carpet were found concealed in leaf litter near the fence to Mr Waters' property.  Items found within the house included a sword, a barbed wire garrotte, a metal hook with a wooden handle, a rope flail, and a cattle prod in the dining room; a 4.5kg sledgehammer inside the front door; a homemade spear with 4 barbs, and 2 baseball bats in the hallway; a folding knife in the kitchen; and bows and arrows in a bedroom and the lounge room. 
50The knife used by Mitchell Barbieri to stab Inspector Anderson was about 27cm long with a blade about 15cm long and was quite heavy.  It was not the type of item that would be found in a kitchen but is more in the nature of a hunting knife.  Its leather sheath was found on a cabinet in the hallway adjacent to the kitchen.
Personal circumstances of Fiona Barbieri
51Ms Barbieri did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.  I received reports by forensic psychiatrists, Dr Michael Diamond and Dr Jonathon Adams which comprise the major source of information about her. 
52She was born in Parramatta in 1967 and grew up in Dundas. There does not appear to be anything of present significance about the circumstances of her upbringing.  She left school after Year 10.  She then completed a secretarial course for six months and then took on work as an office junior and then as a secretary.  She commenced work with American Express in 1989 and worked her way up to become a program manager.  She was appointed to a position in Arizona in 1998 but returned to Australia after a year when one of her sisters to whom she was particularly close was diagnosed with a serious illness.  That sister passed away in 2005. 
53Fiona married Angelo Barbieri in 1990 and their son, Mitchell, was born three years later.  They moved to the Oakville home in 2001.  The marriage ended in divorce in 2004 and she retained custody of the child.  She commenced a relationship with another man soon after.  They became engaged but the relationship came to an end two months later.
54Ms Barbieri told Dr Adams that her mental health began to deteriorate from November 2008.  She was in frequent verbal confrontation with her partner and he was physically abusive towards her.  She told Dr Adams, ""I was constantly in fear of my life"".  Her general practitioner prescribed antidepressant medication.  
55She gave Dr Adams a history of becoming more anxious and depressed through 2009.  In May she took an overdose of Diazepam tablets.  Her neighbour, Mr Waters, was supportive of her in this period.  Her condition was affecting her ability to work and around the end of 2009 she took a redundancy and had not worked since. 
56Through 2010 her mood continued to deteriorate.  She was in dispute with American Express and WorkCover.  Her doctor increased her dose of antidepressant medication and she came to find her mood changed.  She felt more energised; she had a decreased need for sleep; she spent money more freely; and she took on projects such as writing books and planning to set up businesses.  
57A psychiatrist assessing her in connection with her workers' compensation claim in March 2010 diagnosed her with bipolar disorder in the hypomania phase. 
58Her attitude towards her neighbour, Mr Waters, changed. She began to perceive that he was involved in the criminal underworld and she became fixated on the possibility that he was persecuting her and her son.  She explained to Dr Adams that Mr Waters ""wanted to buy my property at a bargain price and so he was intimidating us out of our property"".  She thought that he was watching and stalking them.  She complained to politicians and the police but nothing was done.  She began to think that this was because of the political influence of American Express.
59There was an incident in about September 2010 when some youths came to her home and threatened her and her son with machetes.  The evidence before me contains a number of references to such an incident but the details are not completely consistent.  At around this time she ceased taking the antidepressant medication because she thought it was becoming harmful.  She remained unmedicated until after her arrest.
60Ms Barbieri became concerned for her and her son's safety so they went away for some months, returning in January 2011. The house and surrounds had been ransacked whilst they were away.  The police did nothing to assist.  She became increasingly concerned about Mr Waters.  
61The police finally agreed to speak to her about Mr Waters in April 2011 but this eventuated in her being detained as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) and kept in a mental health facility for five days.  She said that she was diagnosed with hypomania.  No medication was prescribed but follow-up counselling was offered.  Dr Adams noted that the discharge summary noted a diagnosis of ""1st manic episode (?)  (induced by antidepressants)"". 
62Ms Barbieri became burdened with financial difficulties.  Her former husband was making a modest contribution but it was insufficient for her and her son's needs.  She had no income and was, apparently, ineligible for Centrelink benefits.  The electricity supply and telephone service were cut off because bills were not paid.  For about a year leading up to December 2012 they were living without power; the house was illuminated at night by candles; they were having the occasional hot shower elsewhere; and the house and grounds became neglected.  Social contact with others became almost non-existent, including for her son who used to have a healthy circle of friends.   They only left the home if it was essential to do so and then only for the minimum time necessary.  Mother and son became dependent upon each other as their sole source of social support.
63Ms Barbieri's fixation on the idea that she was being persecuted became more entrenched.  She told Dr Adams that she had lost all faith in humanity.  She said, ""it got to the point that we felt so abandoned, we had no support, that we ended up seeking asylum"".  They approached the Italian embassy and when they got no response, they sought asylum in Russia.  Emails were sent to Vladimir Putin.  She said she chose Russia ""because it's a beautiful country"" and she ""wanted to go to a country where American Express would not have any influence"". 
64Dr Natasha Rae carried out a comprehensive psychiatric assessment of Ms Barbieri after she went into custody.  Dr Diamond noted that the history obtained was consistent with his own extensive review.  She was found to be preoccupied with conspiracy theories and persecutory delusions and was considered to have a psychotic illness.  She was transferred to the Long Bay Psychiatric Hospital on 31 January 2013.  She commenced to receive an antipsychotic medication and showed improvement in the ensuing months, with such improvement continuing in to 2014.
65Dr Adams offered the following opinion:
""With regards diagnostic considerations, given the chronology of Ms Barbieri's clinical presentation, progressing from prominent depressive symptomatology, through to classical features of mania, and subsequently a persistent delusional belief system with perhaps less prominent mood symptomatology, in my opinion the most likely diagnosis is one of a schizoaffective disorder.  This is a psychotic illness characterised by the presence of both psychotic symptoms and mood symptoms.  In my view the differential diagnosis includes a bipolar affective disorder and a schizophrenic illness.""
66As to her mental state at the time of the offence, Dr Adams said there were reasonable grounds to conclude that Ms Barbieri was suffering from ongoing symptoms of psychosis.  It was reasonable to conclude that her symptoms of psychosis would have impacted upon her cognitive functioning and capacity for rational decision-making at the material time. 
67Dr Diamond made a diagnosis that Ms Barbieri was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident on 6 December 2012. 
68Ms Barbieri's prospects of rehabilitation were discussed in Dr Adams' supplementary report of 20 November 2014.  A negative indicator was her longstanding psychotic illness.  On the other hand he noted her high level of functioning prior to the onset of illness; her response to medication; her relatively intact cognitive functioning (although this required testing); and her current level of insight and expressed willingness to comply with psychiatric management. 
69Dr Adams said that the prognosis depended upon several factors, including the psychiatric management available to her and her willingness to comply with it. Various measures that he thought would assist her were noted, including a need for ongoing assertive treatment and monitoring when she is released on parole.
70Two testimonials were tendered.  A prison chaplain spoke in positive terms about her attitude and behaviour and the assistance she offers to other more troubled inmates.  The author considered that Ms Barbieri was ""remorseful for events that have happened in the past"".  I note the plural; this probably includes the death of Inspector Anderson but it is not clear.  The other testimonial is by a woman who had known Ms Barbieri since the early 1980's when they were work colleagues. They had remained friends since that time, although personal contact in more recent years had been limited.  However, the author was aware in at least a broad sense of the difficulties Ms Barbieri experienced in the period preceding her arrest.  She had visited her in gaol a number of times and considered her to ""have her 'old self' back, aside from the devastation and total remorse for what has happened"". 
71A letter apparently written by Ms Barbieri was tendered.  It was unsigned and undated.  The Crown Prosecutor objected to its receipt into evidence but I allowed it on the basis that it was for me to assess the weight it should be given.  On its face, it is an expression of remorse including empathy for those affected by the death of Inspector Anderson.
72Dr Diamond asked Ms Barbieri about the events of 6 December 2012.  Included in what she told him was that she considered that if the police had behaved in a civilised way and knocked on the door, she would have responded calmly.  She described their manner as intimidating.  She said they were not wearing uniforms.  There is, of course, overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  Blaming the police for what occurred, at least in part, is the antithesis of accepting responsibility for her actions.  
73Similarly, the account Ms Barbieri gave to Dr Adams of what happened included matters that were patently wrong.  For example, she told him that she had picked up a hammer to try and wedge the back door closed but she then heard her son being handcuffed, so she walked out, fell over and was then assaulted by the police who kneed her in the back whilst they exclaimed ""die die"". 
74I am prepared to accept that Ms Barbieri might now regret what happened and is probably sorry for the harm that was caused on 6 December 2012.  But to establish remorse as a mitigating factor, one of the requirements is to provide satisfactory evidence that the offender has accepted responsibility for his or her actions.  She has not done that.
75Ms Barbieri's prospects of rehabilitation are no more than reasonable.  They are contingent upon her complying with a strict regime of medication and therapy in relation to her mental health.  Dr Adams agreed in cross-examination that, subject to what therapy she was engaged with, she could be at risk of becoming psychotic and paranoid and of causing harm within the community if she ever went off her medication. 
76Ms Barbieri has no previous convictions.  This, and her otherwise good character, is a matter that must be taken into account in her favour. 
77Conventional sentencing practice is to acknowledge the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system that results from an offender pleading guilty.  Ms Barbieri required six witnesses to be cross-examined at the committal proceedings and a further two at the sentence hearing.  In a relatively small way, this tends to dilute the utilitarian value of her plea which came at a very late stage.  I propose to reduce her sentence by about 10 per cent.
The basis upon which Ms Barbieri is to be sentenced for manslaughter
78It is common ground that Ms Barbieri and her son were parties to an unspoken agreement between themselves to resist the entry of the police to their home and to resist the arrest of Mitchell Barbieri.  The Crown contends that Ms Barbieri foresaw the possibility of grievous bodily harm being intentionally inflicted upon one of the police officers.  If that was established beyond reasonable doubt, then she would be guilty of murder, but her liability would be reduced to manslaughter on account of her acknowledged (that is, by the Crown) substantial impairment because of an abnormality of mind. 
79Ms Barbieri's case is that foresight of the infliction of grievous bodily harm has not been established.  Her counsel, Mr Brady, contends that she should be sentenced on the basis that she merely foresaw the infliction of some harm, short of grievous bodily harm.  In other words, she would never have been liable for conviction for murder.  
80Mr Brady submitted that I should have a doubt about whether Ms Barbieri foresaw the possibility of her son using a weapon.  If there was a doubt about that, then there would be a doubt about her foresight of the possibility of grievous bodily harm being inflicted.  Mr Brady made carefully crafted and detailed submissions on the subject.  I do not mean to do them any injustice by not spelling out the detail; but I confirm that I have given them most earnest consideration.  
81The starting point is to recognise that Ms Barbieri accepts that she foresaw the possibility of her son inflicting some harm.  How did she foresee he was going to do that?  He is not a very big person and was clearly outnumbered. 
82The house was replete with weapons that were in readiness for use to repel an intruder.  Ms Barbieri was strident, aggressive, animated and abusive in her attitude towards the police on this particular day.  It must have been obvious that her son shared her attitude.  I accept the evidence of Sergeant Fitzgibbon that after the flyscreen backdoor was removed she called out to Mitchell, ""The cunts are coming in"".  I infer that this was a signal to her son to put into action their plan to repel intruders with force, undoubtedly with the weaponry that was at hand.  She admits that she herself took up a sledgehammer and sought to attack the officers who were endeavouring to arrest her son.  The nature of that object, particularly its weight and what she tried to do with it, supports the inference that the pair had an understanding that any intruder, on this occasion the police, would be resisted with armed force. 
83I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Barbieri was aware of the possible infliction of grievous bodily harm upon at least one of the officers.  In reaching this conclusion I place little weight on her statements after the event.  Given her mental condition, I am doubtful that they are a reliable indicator of her state of mind before the event.
Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence for Ms Barbieri
84The victims of Ms Barbieri's crimes were police officers and she well knew that to be the case.  The Crown submitted that her offences are substantially aggravated by this feature.  I accept that it is an aggravating feature of the manslaughter offence.  It cannot be regarded as aggravating the offence of using an offensive weapon to hinder lawful apprehension.  Lawful apprehension is almost always something that is done by police officers.  Something that is inherent in an offence cannot be counted again as serving to aggravate it.
85The Crown submitted that in a moral sense, Ms Barbieri was more blameworthy for the death of Inspector Anderson than her son.  This was said to be on the basis of her being the dominant partner in the relationship and because she created and fostered the atmosphere of paranoia and hostility to police.  She exacerbated the tension and supported her son's actions aimed at resisting the entry of the police and the arrest of her son. She was instrumental in planning for a violent defence of the home in the event of an unwanted intruder. In that sense, there was said to be premeditation, an unusual feature in a manslaughter case.   The problem with this submission is that these are matters that were directly related to Ms Barbieri's mental illness. 
86The Crown also submitted that I should accept the evidence of Dr Diamond in preference to that of Dr Adams and conclude that Ms Barbieri had the capacity to exercise reasoned judgment.  I accept that she did do some things on the day that could be described as rational; for example, withdrawing from the argument over the side fence with the neighbours and tradesmen.  But one simply cannot ignore the fact that she was largely driven by her delusional thought processes, for example, that she thought she was being persecuted and that all police were corrupt. 
87It must be remembered as well that the Crown submits that I should find that Ms Barbieri is guilty of manslaughter on the basis of the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind being made out.  That carries with it an acceptance that her capacity to understand events, to judge whether her actions were right or wrong, or to control herself, was substantially impaired to such an extent that it warranted her liability being reduced from murder to manslaughter.  Whilst Dr Diamond took a different view to Dr Adams about Ms Barbieri's capacity to exercise reasoned judgment, he agreed that she was impaired in the manner just described. 88The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the manslaughter offence was ""in the highest range"".  I do not accept that, but insofar as a case of manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment is concerned, this is a serious example.  The offence had all of the attributes of murder aside from Ms Barbieri's mental condition.  I accept that it was not a planned killing but it cannot be ignored that it was the product of planning to inflict serious harm upon any unwanted intruder.  The fact that the victim was a police officer performing his duty is a feature that significantly elevates the seriousness of the offence.  On the other hand, Ms Barbieri was not the principal offender. Further, her mental condition was more than just enough to establish the partial defence.  It operates in further mitigation of penalty by reducing her moral culpability from the high level it otherwise would be at.  It also warrants moderation of the weight given to retribution, denunciation and deterrence.
89The offence of using an offensive weapon to hinder the lawful apprehension of Mitchell Barbieri is also a serious matter.  Minor injury was occasioned to Detective Caulfield but there was clearly a potential for substantial harm to be caused by swinging the sledgehammer, particularly in the direction of his head. It was only because of the ability of the officer to defend himself and eventually restrain Ms Barbieri that terrible consequences were avoided.  Mental illness is relevant to the assessment of sentence for this offence in the same way as it is in relation to the manslaughter.
90The Form 1 offence of assaulting Detective Caulfield and causing him actual bodily harm is really part and parcel of the primary offence and does not warrant any increase in the sentence.  The other offence to be taken into account involves the possession of the explosive devices in the granny flat and the slingshot in the house.  It is a significant offence of itself but in the context of the overall case does not warrant any increase in the sentence either. 91The fact that Ms Barbieri is to be sentenced for two offences requires an assessment of the totality of her criminality.  I have come to the view that there should be a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the fact that there were two victims of her criminal conduct.  I intend to order that the sentence for using an offensive weapon to hinder the lawful apprehension of Mitchell Barbieri commence first.  As a result, there is no utility in setting a non-parole period.  The fixed term I set will represent what would be the total term of the sentence (that is, not just the non-parole component).  92Ms Barbieri has been held in custody since her arrest and so her sentence must be backdated. 93It was submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole component.  This was said to arise primarily because of the need to monitor her performance in the community for a lengthy period to ensure compliance with the need to take medication and engage in therapy.  There is much force in this.  However I have concluded that the circumstances are not sufficiently special to warrant the imposition of a lesser non-parole period which must, of course, appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offences.  The parole period that will be allowed should be adequate to serve the purposes identified.
Personal circumstances of Mitchell Barbieri
94Mitchell Barbieri did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings either.  The major source of information that I have about him are reports by forensic psychiatrists, Dr Diamond, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Bruce Westmore. Some aspects of his background are apparent from my earlier review of his mother's but some repetition is unavoidable.
95Mr Barbieri was born in 1993 and so in December 2012 he was aged 19. Like his mother, he has no previous convictions.  That fact, together with his implicit prior good character, are to be taken into account in his favour.
96Mr Barbieri was an only child and his parents separated when he was aged 9 or 10.  He reported that his childhood was happy and he was not exposed to violence or other abuses. He remained in contact with his father and saw him regularly. 
97His mother formed a relationship with another man when he was about 11 or 12.  He told Dr Westmore that this man used to hit his mother. 
98He was educated to Year 10 level and left school in 2009.  He commenced a plumbing apprenticeship but did not complete it.  He then worked with a glazier installing shower screens and in property maintenance.  He had little contact with friends in the year or two leading up to the offence and he was mostly in the company of his mother.
99Mr Barbieri told Dr Nielssen that he had no problems with alcohol.  He said that he occasionally smoked cannabis; had tried ecstasy; but otherwise had no problems with illegal drugs.  He gave a similar account to Dr Westmore. Dr Diamond's extensive documentary review included that in about 2010 there were regular parties held at the home at which large numbers of teenage guests would consume alcohol and cannabis.  Mr Barbieri told Dr Diamond that after he had suffered a broken jaw in a football incident he lost motivation for fitness and sports and was more intent on partying, drinking and smoking cannabis.  He conceded that he had ""lost direction"" at this time.
100Mr Barbieri also told Dr Diamond that the machete incident occurred on 30 September 2010 and described it as a turning point in his life.  It resulted in he and his mother going away for some time.  They returned to find that the house had been ransacked.  Their financial position declined.  They were unable to maintain the house and grounds which deteriorated steadily.  Eventually, he and his mother ended up living in squalor for the 12 months prior to their arrest.  He said that he became socially isolated and increasingly dependent upon his mother. 
101He came to agree with his mother's beliefs and her view of the world in this period. He told Dr Diamond that he now questioned the extent of these beliefs; he was unable to understand what he had been thinking. He laughed about the subject of seeking political asylum in Russia.  He agreed that it was bizarre now to look at their attempts to involve the Russian president. 
102I'll divert at this point to mention a statement by Ms Renee Moorley that was tendered in the defence case.  It adds support to the history provided to the psychiatrists.  Ms Moorley worked at Southern Cross Stock Feeds at Richmond and in about 2006 she came to know Fiona and Mitchell Barbieri as regular customers. (They had horses.) In about February 2008, Mitchell Barbieri became a casual employee working on weekends.  Ms Moorley spoke positively of him in that context.  He ceased this work at the end of 2008.
103Ms Moorley did not see so much of them in the years that followed.  When she drove past their home it looked run down.  She next saw them in about mid-2011 and noticed that they had changed.  Fiona Barbieri had lost a lot of weight.  They spoke of people being after them.  In subsequent conversations there was mention of trouble with a neighbour in which a variety of paranoid and delusional beliefs were expressed.  She last saw them in mid-2012.  She described her observations of how Mitchell Barbieri related to his mother in this way:
""Since their return they only talked about the dramas happening in their life.  They kept bringing the same things up whereas before you could have a normal day to day conversation.  While Fiona did most of the talking Mitch would butt in and support what his mother said.  They were always together and wouldn't go anywhere without one another.  It came across to me that Mitch saw himself as his mother's little body guard.  We offered him some more work and he refused saying he had to 'look after' his mum.  Mitch always seemed on edge and was always on the lookout and seemed really fidgety.  It was like they didn't trust anyone ... I had the impression that they were both extremely paranoid.""
104Mr Sutherland, senior counsel for Mitchell Barbieri, referred to evidence from other sources that was consistent with Ms Moorley's observation of the protective and supportive role his client adopted in relation to his mother. 
105Mr Barbieri told Dr Diamond that when he first came to gaol he found it hard to accept that he might be psychiatrically impaired but was more able to accept it as time went on. 
106He told Dr Westmore that he had been held in a mental health unit for four or five months after going into custody.  He was then on protection for six months but then in the main section of the gaol.  He said that he got along well with officers and other inmates. 
107Dr Diamond's review of the Justice Health files indicated that Mr Barbieri had progressed well from a psychiatric point of view to the point that on 18 February 2013 he was considered to be free of persecutory ideation and delusional thoughts and beliefs.  He had not been treated with any medication.  In other words, as I understand it, his psychiatric illness had resolved naturally. 
108Dr Nielssen made the diagnoses of ""delusional disorder"" and ""substance use disorder (cannabis)"".  He clarified the former as a ""shared delusional disorder"", namely one that was shared with his mother, the primary person who was affected.  Mr Barbieri had adopted his mother's persecutory beliefs and Dr Nielssen said that at the time when he first interviewed him in June 2013 he ""continued to hold those beliefs with delusional intensity"".  I note that this is contrary to what Dr Diamond saw in the Justice Health files, they being files that Dr Nielssen had not had access to at the time of his first report.
109Dr Nielssen offered the opinion in his first report that Mr Barbieri would be able to raise his mental illness as a defence and would also be able to raise the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.
110Dr Nielssen provided a further report last month.  By this time he had seen medical records in relation to Mr Barbieri.  He said they confirmed the opinions he had earlier expressed.
111Dr Nielssen was also asked to comment upon whether Mr Barbieri had a ""significant cognitive impairment"" within the meaning of s 19B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  (This is an issue to which I shall return.)  The doctor said:
""The delusional disorder that affected Mr Barbieri at the time of the offence is a significant cognitive impairment, both in the way it affected the content of his thoughts, and also in the way it affected his capacity for calm and logical thinking.  At the time of the offence his interpretation of events was affected by the delusional belief that he and his mother were in immediate danger.  That perception is likely to have resulted in a high level of fear, and the emotional arousal arising from his fearful state is likely to have significantly affected his ability to consider the wrongfulness and the potential consequences of his actions in a calm and rational way.""
112Having regard to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in relation to his mother, Dr Nielssen said there was a possibility of Mr Barbieri having an inherited vulnerability to developing a psychotic illness independent of her. This is a risk that would decline over time.  Abstinence from cannabis might further reduce the risk.  
113Dr Nielssen considered that Mr Barbieri's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he had a low risk of reoffending.  There was little in the way of antisocial behaviour in his past aside from the use of cannabis and the behaviour towards the neighbours. He was of normal intelligence; had a history of employment; was a polite and engaging person; and would be able to make the most of vocational training and other rehabilitation opportunities.  I accept Dr Nielssen's assessment on this subject.
114Dr Westmore's diagnoses were essentially the same as those of Dr Nielssen. He also considered that the mental illness defence could be raised.  He noted that the intensity of Mr Barbieri's delusional beliefs had lessened and he expected that they would be completely resolved, which he said was the usual course a shared delusional disorder takes in the person who is the secondary sufferer. 
115Dr Diamond agreed with the diagnosis of delusional disorder but doubted the relevance of other diagnosed conditions to Mr Barbieri's state of mind at the time of the offence.  He explained the effect of the delusional disorder:
""It affected his ability to differentiate reality from his delusional belief system in focal and specific ways. It meant that his perception of persecution and being a subject of multiple conspiracies influenced his day to day thinking and subjective experiences.  The pervasiveness and extent of his mental illness existed in a chronic form over a long time period both before and after the alleged act.  There was no acute exacerbation of illness at the time of the alleged act.""
116He did not, however, consider that a mental illness defence was available.  He referred to various acts of Mr Barbieri on the afternoon of 6 December 2012 and concluded that they ""demonstrated considered reasoning and decision-making to the extent that it does not lead me to support a view that [Mr Barbieri] was labouring under such a defect of reasoning from disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or that he did not know what he was doing was wrong"".
117Dr Diamond did, however, agree that the partial defence of substantial impairment was available in that Mr Barbieri ""was suffering from an underlying condition such that his capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or his ability to control himself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind"". 
118I have mentioned the opinions about the possibility of Mitchell Barbieri being able to raise a mental illness defence or the partial defence of substantial impairment only to indicate the significance with which the doctors regarded his mental condition.  By his plea of guilty to murder, of course, Mr Barbieri has abandoned any reliance upon such defences.  The existence of his mental condition, and its relative seriousness, is relevant to sentence generally but also to the question of whether a mandatory life sentence must be imposed.  I will come to that question shortly. 
119A handwritten letter annexed to an affidavit sworn by Mr Barbieri's solicitor was received over the objection of the Crown Prosecutor.  I received it on the same basis as I did the letter from Ms Barbieri.  The letter is dated 26 May 2013 and is addressed to family, friends and colleagues of Inspector Anderson. It purports to express a profound apology and genuine remorse.  A copy had only recently been provided to the Crown but in the event that someone questioned the veracity of the date of the letter, the solicitor's affidavit includes that he saw it sometime in mid-2013. 
120Supporting the proposition that Mitchell Barbieri is remorseful is the first report of Dr Nielssen.  It includes:
""Mr Barbieri expressed his sadness and remorse for what he had done. He said 'in a place like this [gaol] you try not to show emotion ... I wonder how on earth something like this has happened ... I get reoccurring dreams of it and I keep reliving it ... it breaks my heart'.""
121Dr Westmore asked him what his thoughts were about what he had done:
""He said 'heartbroken mate, I'm still in shock.  I wake up every morning hoping it's a dream and I'm not here.  (I acted) in that split second. I thought I was protecting my family and I have taken somebody away from theirs.  I am confused and full of sorrow'.""
122Mitchell Barbieri's account of what happened is at odds with overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  He told Dr Nielssen last year that police were coming through the back door and he intended ""to push the person out and I picked up the knife ... it was an instant reflex ... a single push ... I don't know how there happened to be two wounds"".  He said, ""I pushed the officer out the door and the other police came in and grabbed me with the knife in my hand and asked me to drop it"". 
123He added to this account in what he told Dr Westmore in February this year.  Dr Westmore wrote:
""He said he then heard a 'massive bang on the outside of the house'.  He said he grabbed 'something' at that particular point and he turned and saw someone had come into the house.  He said 'all I could see was dark clothing but, in hindsight, it was (a police officer)'.  He acknowledged that the man who entered his mother's house had been wearing a police uniform, but he stated he only realised that later. 
He continued and said 'all I could see was this firearm'.  He said he ran towards the man, who had entered his mother's house and he tried to push him out the door.  He said he then stopped pushing the man and the man stumbled backwards.  Mr Barbieri said he could see at that particular time that the man was a police officer and that he appeared to be 'hurt'.  Mr Barbieri said he then took a few steps back into the house and he 'froze' and he saw that he was holding a knife.
Following the incident, he said other police gained entry into the house and he and his mother were arrested.""
124In October 2014 he told Dr Diamond that after some conversation with the officers at the front of the house he thought that the police had left.  Some 30 minutes or more later, when he was in the hallway, half way between the front and back doors, he heard a ""big bang that shook the house"".   This was ""completely out of the blue""; ""he had not expected police to return because there was no ongoing problem"".  Dr Diamond reported:
""His next recall was that he says he saw a man in dark clothing with an unholstered firearm in his hand.  He could see the firearm from the light where the door was breached.  He said he didn't hear the man say anything.  He said it happened so fast.  He said all he could remember was trying to throw this man out of his house.  I asked him why he thought it was necessary to do that.  He said it was because he saw a man with a firearm pointed at him.  He said it was instinct.  He said he was scared and he panicked. 
I asked him why he had a knife in his hand.  He indicated that he was not aware of holding the knife in his hand. ...
He said he lunged at the man and there was a brief struggle for only a second. He implied that he was unaware that he had the knife in his hand at the time. He said he realised then that the man was a police officer. He said he looked down and he was shocked to realise he was holding the knife.  He said he froze. 
He said two police ran in and took hold of him and dragged him out of the house.""
125The letter Mr Barbieri wrote in mid-2013 conveys his apology and regret for the harm caused.  But it does not convey any credible acceptance of responsibility.  Indeed, it includes ""I never wished for anybody to get hurt""; whereas he now admits by his plea that he intended to inflict really serious bodily harm upon Inspector Anderson.  Perhaps he meant by that claim that he did not have such an intention in advance of the events.  But in the absence of him giving evidence to explain himself I am not prepared to divine some benevolent interpretation for him. 126It was submitted that the plea of guilty was the ""most powerful of objective indicators of remorse"".  But the plea was only forthcoming after the Crown indicated that it would be conceding that the mandatory life sentence provision did not apply.  This does not support a finding of remorse.
127In the end, I am not persuaded that Mr Barbieri has accepted responsibility for his actions.  As in the case of his mother, I am prepared to accept that he might now regret what happened and is probably sorry for the harm that was caused on 6 December 2012 but I am not persuaded that he is genuinely remorseful. 128Mitchell Barbieri entered his plea of guilty on the day his trial was due to commence.  It was submitted that this was ""the effective earliest practical opportunity"".  However, what is required is an objective assessment of the utilitarian value of the plea.  Three eye-witnesses were required to be cross-examined during committal proceedings and the two ambulance officers were cross-examined at the sentence hearing.  The lateness of the plea and the slight dilution of the utilitarian benefit leads me to conclude that the reduction of sentence on account of the plea should be about 10 per cent.
Did Mitchell Barbieri have an intention to kill?
129The Crown contends that Mitchell Barbieri intended to kill Inspector Anderson.  Generally speaking, having an intention to kill renders a crime of murder more serious than when an offender intends to inflict grievous bodily harm, or acts with a reckless indifference to the probability of death occurring.  On the other hand, Mitchell Barbieri contends that I should find that his intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
130Mr Sutherland's submissions included that the offender's mental condition impaired or reduced his ability to form a specific intention.  But if he had the capacity to form an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, he would just as well have had the capacity to form an intention to kill. 
131It was also submitted that the incident happened quickly and the stabbing was random, haphazard and reckless as to the location of the wounds and not consistent with a purposeful and intentional selection of target.
132I am satisfied that the intention of Mitchell Barbieri was to kill Inspector Anderson.  Of all the weapons he could have taken up, he chose the one most capable of inflicting lethal injury.  Anyone who had held that knife, as Mr Barbieri had done, would readily appreciate the harm it could cause. The fatal stab must have been inflicted with significant force.  And both of the stabs were to obviously vulnerable areas of the body.  It is beyond belief that the stabbing could have been carried out with some lesser intention.  No recourse is needed to the interpretation of statements made by the offender after the event.
Is Mitchell Barbieri liable to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment?
133Section 19B of the Crimes Act provides, relevantly, as follows:
19B   Mandatory life sentences for murder of police officers
(1)  A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life for the murder of a police officer if the murder was committed:
(a)  while the police officer was executing his or her duty, or
(b)  as a consequence of, or in retaliation for, actions undertaken by that or any other police officer in the execution of his or her duty,
and if the person convicted of the murder:
(c)  knew or ought reasonably to have known that the person killed was a police officer, and
(d)  intended to kill the police officer or was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers. ...
(3)  This section does not apply to a person convicted of murder:
(a)  if the person was under the age of 18 years at the time the murder was committed, or
(b)  if the person had a significant cognitive impairment at that time (not being a temporary self-induced impairment). ...

134The Crown concedes that the section is not engaged because Mitchell Barbieri ""had a significant cognitive impairment"" at the time of the offence: s 19B(3)(b).  Unsurprisingly, Mitchell Barbieri endorses that concession.  However, Parliament has dictated that such a sentence must be imposed if the conditions mentioned in s 19(1) are established and the matters in s 19(3) do not apply.  That is a matter that I must decide, not the parties.
135In R v Jacobs (No 9) [2013] NSWSC 1470, it was said by Button J (at [49]) that the matters in s 19B(3), which he described as disengaging the application of the section, needed to be established on the balance of probabilities by the offender.  I do not understand the issue to have been contentious in that case.  I have heard submissions on the subject; in effect, counsel agree with a tentative view I expressed during the sentence hearing.  With respect to Button J, having regard to the ramifications of the section being applied, I think the better view is that it is for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the matters in s 19B(1) apply and the matters in s 19B(3) do not apply.
136The precise meaning of ""significant cognitive impairment"" is not entirely clear.  Parliament did not provide any explanation of what it meant by the term. When the Crimes Amendment (Murder of Police Officers) Bill 2011 was introduced, the then Minister for Police simply indicated that ""the decision on whether a cognitive impairment is significant would be a matter for the courts to determine"".  
137A dictionary definition of the word ""significant"" is that the subject matter must be ""important"" or ""of consequence"".  In s 61H of the Crimes Act the term ""cognitive impairment"" is defined.  If that definition was to be applied to s 19B, I would have to conclude that Mitchell Barbieri was not cognitively impaired.  However, that definition is for a particular purpose and is inapplicable to s 19B. 
138Given this issue was not contentious as between the parties, it is unnecessary for me to provide reasons beyond saying that I am persuaded by the Crown's submissions (namely, paragraphs [11]-[16], particularly [15], of the written submissions, a copy of which will be held on the Court file) that there is a reasonable possibility that Mitchell Barbieri had a significant cognitive impairment at the time he killed Inspector Anderson. 
139What that means is that Mr Barbieri's mental condition has been taken into account in deciding that he should not receive the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  Can his mental condition have any further mitigating value in the assessment of sentence?  Counsel for both the offender and the Crown contended that it can.  It was their position that the removal of the requirement to impose a life sentence simply meant that I should proceed to exercise the sentencing discretion in the usual way, including taking into account the offender's mental condition.
140As a matter of statutory construction I have come to the view that the position of the parties should be accepted.  Parliament has indicated in s 19B that if certain conditions are met, the sentencing discretion is completely abrogated in the case of the murder of a police officer.  It did not indicate, either expressly or by necessary implication, that if the section does not apply there is any constraint upon the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the usual manner.
141Often when an offender is suffering from mental ill-health a court will find that his or her moral culpability is reduced where the condition contributes to the commission of the offence. Less weight might be given to the need for general deterrence because they are inappropriate people to make an example of to others.  A custodial sentence might weigh more heavily upon such a person.  There may be a reduced need for personal deterrence. 
142I am prepared to accept that Mr Barbieri's moral culpability is less than it otherwise would be on account of his mental condition but not to any substantial degree.  Because the nature of his condition was one that was secondary to that of his mother and he seems to have overcome it with the enforced separation from her, I cannot see any need to lessen the weight I give to general deterrence which is such an important feature of sentencing in a case like this.  Personal deterrence is not a matter that looms large.  Finally, there is no evidence that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him.  I will, however, take into account that he did endure a period of restrictive custody on protection in the early stage of his period on remand. 143There is a further aspect relating to Mr Barbieri's mental condition that should be taken into account in mitigation.  He was a young man of 19 years of age at the time of the offence.  He was aged around 17 when he started to adopt the delusional beliefs of his mother. The reason he did so was obviously because of their close relationship and increasing social isolation.  But I accept that it was also partly due to his relative immaturity which made him less equipped to recognise his mother's condition and deal with it in an appropriate way.  I do not find that the immaturity of youth was a material factor in the events of 6 December 2012; but I accept that the offender's significant cognitive impairment was.  The fact that it arose in the circumstances I have just mentioned calls for some measure of understanding in his favour.
Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence for the offence of murder
144Twelve years ago, Spigelman CJ wrote about the seriousness of crimes involving assaults upon police officers: 
""Offences involving assault of police officers in the execution of their duty are serious offences requiring a significant element of deterrence in the sentences to be imposed. The community is dependent to a substantial extent upon the courage of police officers for protection of lives, personal security and property. The Courts must support the police in the proper execution of their duties and must be seen to be supporting the police, and their authority in maintaining law and order, by the imposition of appropriate sentences in cases where assaults are committed against police. ... [S]ignificant risks are run by police officers throughout the State in the normal execution of their duties. The authority of the police, in the performance of their duties, must be supported by the courts. In cases involving assaults against police there is a need to give full weight to the objective of general deterrence and, accordingly, sentences at the high end of the scale, pertinent in the light of all the circumstances, are generally appropriate in such cases.""  (Attorney General's Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 2 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 515; 137 A Crim R 196 at [22],[26])
145Those observations are equally apt in cases involving the killing of a police officer.  Two years later, his Honour said in relation to that category of case:  
""The courts will, and do, give great weight to the protection of members of the police force by reason of the fact that in the course of their duties, they are called upon to place themselves in danger and do so for the benefit of the community at large. That is why the courts have always accepted that the fact that the victim was a police officer is a substantially aggravating factor."" (R v Penisini [2004] NSWCCA 339 at [20]). 
146Despite my acceptance of the Crown's concession that the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment does not apply in this case, there remains s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to be considered.  It provides:
""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.""
147On the basis that this case does not display features such as premeditation and planning, multiple victims, contract killing, or torture and gratuitous violence that tend to characterise cases that do attract life sentences, the Crown conceded that a life sentence was not warranted under s 61 either.  That is a significant concession.  Having regard to the fact that it was made by the State's most senior Crown Prosecutor it carries important weight.  I have carefully considered this issue.  In the end, I am persuaded that I should act upon the concession.  However, I am also persuaded that even taking into account Mr Barbieri's reduced moral culpability, a lengthy sentence is required.  That is particularly so because of the requirements of retribution, denunciation and punishment, to recognise the harm caused, and the need to send a clear message of general deterrence. 148The Crown submitted that Mitchell Barbieri's offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the murder of a police officer and so the standard non-parole period of 25 years prescribed for such an offence provided an important guidepost.  However, there is no such offence as ""murder of a police officer"".  The offence is murder and its objective seriousness should be determined as such.
149There is no doubt that Mr Barbieri knew that Inspector Anderson was a police officer endeavouring to perform his duty.  He plunged a hunting knife deep into the officer's chest causing virtually immediate death.  In doing so, he acted with an intention to kill him.  Whilst there was no premeditation, a violent response was something the offender was certainly prepared for. I consider that the offence is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
150The important guideposts provided by Parliament of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 25 years have to be taken into account along with all of the other relevant facts and circumstances.  Neither have such significance that they alone determine the sentence.  Aside from the objective seriousness of the offence, I have earlier mentioned other matters that are relevant, such as the offender's reduced moral culpability on account of his mental condition.
151The four offences listed on the Form 1 document are to be taken into account when Mr Barbieri is sentenced.  Normally this calls for greater emphasis to be given to retribution and personal deterrence.  However, they are relatively minor matters and the sentence I will impose will already factor in an appropriate recognition of those matters.
152I propose to backdate the sentence in order to take into account that Mr Barbieri has been in custody since his arrest. 
153Mr Sutherland submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances. However, the features he identified were all matters relevant to the assessment of the overall sentence and I am conscious of the need avoid double counting.
SENTENCE
Fiona Barbieri
154Convicted
155For the offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to hinder the lawful apprehension of Mitchell Barbieri, and taking into account two other offences, sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months.  I decline to set a non-parole period.  The sentence will date from 6 December 2012.  The sentence will expire on 5 June 2017.
156That 4 year 6 month sentence would have been one of 5 years if not for the plea of guilty.
157For the manslaughter of Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months with the balance of the term of the sentence being 2 years 6 months.  The sentence will date from 6 December 2013.  The non-parole period will expire on 5 June 2020 and the total term will expire on 5 December 2022.
158That is a sentence of 9 years.  If not for the plea of guilty, it would have been a sentence of 10 years.
159The overall sentence then is one of 10 years with a minimum custodial component of 7 years 6 months.
Mitchell Barbieri
160Convicted.
161For the offence of murdering Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson, and taking into account four other offences, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 26 years with the balance of the term of the sentence being 9 years.  The sentence will date from 6 December 2012.  The non-parole period will expire on 5 December 2038 and the total term will expire on 5 December 2047.
162That is a total sentence of 35 years.  If not for the plea of guilty, it would have been a sentence of 38 years.

2765635,"Toole, Kurt v R; Toole, Joshua v R [2014] NSWCCA 318","Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with RS Hulme AJ that there should be a grant of leave to appeal in these matters, but that the appeals be dismissed. Subject to one point of clarification, I also agree with the reasons he gives for those orders.

2Counsel for Joshua Toole contended that the sentencing judge had failed to give proper weight to the evidence of his mental health problems. That raised questions, as Hulme AJ has noted, with respect to the strength of the evidence, the manner in which it was taken into account on sentencing and, objectively, its relevance as a factor in mitigation. I agree with that analysis. However, some caution must be exercised in dismissing the evidence as to the applicant's use of anabolic steroids and the consequences as being, in a lay person's terms, a drug addiction and therefore not a factor in mitigation.

3A mental illness which is not ""self-induced"" is treated as a disability or, in morally neutral terms, a misfortune, which may be a material mitigating factor in sentencing. However, to treat a drug addiction as a self-inflicted condition for which the offender must bear full moral responsibility is a less nuanced approach than the law requires. To qualify the absolute position by reference to an exception based on ""unusual circumstances"" certainly reflects the possibility of consideration, although the circumstances are not identified. 

4In Henry, Spigelman CJ dismissed ""a need for funds to feed a drug addiction, as being lower in the scale of moral culpability than other perceived requirements for money"": R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [202]. The case law and matters of principle relevant to that conclusion were discussed at length by other members of the Court whose conclusions, though not necessarily in conflict with those of the Chief Justice, were identified with a degree of flexibility: see Wood CJ at CL at [271]-[273], with the agreement of Newman J at [278], RS Hulme J at [331] and, after further careful consideration, by Simpson J at [348] and [356]. The principles need not be restated: they do not assist the applicant in the present case.

5BUTTON J: I agree with the orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ. I also agree with the reasons his Honour has given, subject to the point of clarification raised by Basten JA, with which I agree.

6RS HULME AJ: On 12 September 2012 the above named Applicants for leave to appeal were sentenced by Wells SC DCJ in respect of a number of offences. In the case of Joshua Toole the charges were:

(1)That on 3 September 2010 he knowingly took part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of cannabis. The amount the subject of the charge was 95.398 kilograms.

(2)That between 26 July and 23 September 2010 he supplied not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, viz 6,048.8 grams.

(3)That between 22 September and 3 November 2010 he dealt with proceeds of crime, viz $200,000, knowing that it was the proceeds of crime and intending to conceal that fact.

7The statutory provisions against which Joshua offended, the maximum penalties of imprisonment prescribed and the sentences imposed were:

(i) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) s 25(2) - 15 years imprisonment - a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 22 March 2010;

(ii) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act s 25(2) - life imprisonment - imprisonment for 13 years including a non-parole period of 8 years, both periods commencing on 22 September 2011;

(iii) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 193B(1) - 20 years imprisonment - a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 22 September 2010.

8The effective sentence was thus of 14 years, including a non-parole period of 9 years. The effective sentence imposed for each of the proceeds of crime and cannabis offences was six months before the next sentence commenced.

9In arriving at the sentence imposed for the methylamphetamine offence, a charge under s 303GN(2) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) of possessing a non-native illegally imported specimen, recorded on a Form 1 was taken into account. The Crown conceded that this offence should have little or no weight in the sentencing process.

10For an offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment has been prescribed - Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 54A et seq.

11In the case of Kurt Toole the charges were:

(1)Between 5 July and 7 September 2010, supplying 17.2 kg of cannabis leaf;

(2)Between 5 June and 7 September 2010, supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, viz 1,005.5g.

(3)On 20 August 2010, entering land with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit intimidation of Matthew Leslie.

12The statutory provisions against which Kurt offended, the maximum penalties of imprisonment prescribed and the sentences imposed were:

(i) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act s 25(1) - 10 years imprisonment - a fixed term of 2 years and 9 months imprisonment commencing on 22 March 2011;

(ii) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act s 25(2) - life imprisonment - imprisonment for 9 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 6 years, both periods commencing on 22 September 2011;

(iii) Crimes Act s 114(1)(d) - 7 years imprisonment - a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 22 September 2010.

13The effective sentence imposed was thus of imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 7 years. The effective sentence imposed for each of the cannabis and entering land offences were six months before the next sentence commenced.

14In arriving at the sentence imposed for the methylamphetamine offence, a charge on a Form 1 of damaging property by fire, was taken into account. It was of far more significance than the offence on Joshua's Form 1. 

15The grounds of appeal relied on by Joshua are:

(1) The Applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing Judge failed to warn those appearing for him that her Honour proposed to accumulate the sentences, contrary to the written submission of the Crown on sentence.

(2) The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the disparity and lack of proper proportion between his sentence and the sentence imposed on the co-offender, Kurt Toole.

(3) The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the evidence of the Applicant's mental health problems.

(4) The sentence is manifestly excessive.

(5) The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity and lack of proper proportion between the sentences imposed on him and sentence(s) imposed on other offenders including co-offenders.

16The grounds of appeal relied on by Kurt are:

(1) The sentencing Judge erred in her treatment of the Applicant's psychiatric case on sentence. In particular:

(a) the sentencing Judge failed to find that a motivation for the offences was to support the Applicant's drug abuse and gambling problem; and

(b) the sentencing Judge failed to adequately evaluate the Applicant's psychiatric case when considering the subjective circumstances.

(2) The sentence imposed on count 2 is manifestly excessive.

(3) The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity and lack of proper proportion between the sentences imposed on him and sentence(s) imposed on other offenders including co-offenders.

17The last ground of appeal of each Applicant was added by leave during the hearing.

18Before turning to the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to provide further details of the Applicants' offending, her Honour's remarks and some other matters. The details of most of these matters are taken from the remarks on sentence of Wells DCJ which, in these respects, were not challenged.

19Her Honour observed that the Applicants were engaged in significant drug trafficking and had had a number of other persons working for them. Her Honour was supplied with particulars of the sentences previously imposed on about eight of these other persons.

20Her Honour recorded that in the case of both offenders the charges of supply were rolled up charges, in that they involved a number of individual acts of obtaining drugs for supply or actually supplying drugs to others. In the case of Joshua, there were 9 separate transactions reflected in the quantity of 95.398 kg of cannabis and 5 separate transactions reflected in the 6,048.8g of methylamphetamine. This supply occurred over a 2 month period during which he was subject to police surveillance.

21The $200,000, the subject of the third charge against Joshua, was cash found in a safe security box held in Joshua's name at a bank.

22In the case of Kurt, there were 12 separate transactions reflected in the quantity of 17.2 kg of cannabis and 26 reflected in the 1,005.5g of methylamphetamine. Again, the quantities were supplied over a 2 month period and those involved in the individual occasions of supply, indicate that both offenders were supplying to dealers lower in the chain of supply.

23Her Honour found that the drug offences were premeditated and reasonably sophisticated, that both Applicants were directly involved in transactions themselves and also in directing the activities of others. Her Honour concluded that Joshua had a role higher than that of Kurt relying in this connection on the fact that Joshua had handled larger and wholesale quantities, he had had the cash in the bank and his activities involved less leg-work than Kurt's. Her Honour concluded that Joshua seemed to be operating more in the capacity of an overall supervisor of Kurt and others. She observed that some of the text messages in evidence revealed that Joshua was directing Kurt more than the other way around.

24She observed that the quantity of methylamphetamine, the subject of one of the charges against Kurt, ""just scrapes into the large commercial quantity range and that, of course, is highly relevant to his culpability in terms of the sentence to be imposed.""

25That said, her Honour observed that the distance between the brothers' respective roles and the amounts handled by each, was ameliorated by a number of factors. One was what her Honour referred to as some double counting in the quantity charged against Joshua. Her Honour remarked that ""some (of the 6 kilograms) involves the same quantity he handled twice when he obtained it for supply and when he supplied it to others."" 

26(There was no attempt during the hearing of the appeal to quantify the amount double counted and the Court did not query her Honour's remarks.) In fact, it would seem that there was no double counting, the 6 kg being made up from the following transactions detailed in the Agreed Facts:





17/8/2010

85.2 

grams supplied


26/8/2011

27.2 

grams supplied


27/8/2010

1,817.6 

grams received


14/9/2010

1,817.6 

grams received


22/9/2010

2,301.2 

grams received



6,048.8 

grams

27A second factor was that Kurt was involved in a far greater number of transactions, her Honour observing that Kurt had showed ""what might be fairly described as unbounded enthusiasm for the task of supplying drugs on an almost daily basis to other people."" She described Kurt's role as acting as the right hand man of Joshua and having a close involvement in the operation, but reiterated her view ""that Joshua Toole had a more significant and more superior role"". 

28Her Honour observed that Kurt had a somewhat more significant criminal history and was on conditional liberty, having been placed on a bond only shortly before the commission of the subject offences. She remarked that his conduct ""shows a disregard for the authority of the law and for the opportunity that he had been given on that occasion."" 

29The circumstances of Kurt's entering land offence were that, not long before his arrest, he had been involved in an argument and small street fight with a Mr Leslie and took offence at some insults made by the latter. He went to the relevant land accompanied by a number of friends and smashed the glass panelling in the front door and several windows. Mr Leslie alleged he had been hit with a bat when he opened the front door to the invaders but, together with the other occupants of the house, declined to make a formal complaint.

30Kurt was involved in the exchange in a number of text messages relating to the matter. The messages by Kurt display a shocking preference for violence and intimidation over decent behaviour. They included an assertion that Mr Leslie and another person had said they were going to take over running the drugs, that he had hit someone on the head when the door was open. Later Kurt sent another message thanking persons for being ""soldiers"" indicating ""thats wat we are all about striking and standing our ground and showing people who we all are we are served to survive soldiers and brothers ..."". (sic) In referring to this offence, her Honour remarked: ""Not only did it involve threatening people in their own home, it involved the use of weapons and was motivated by standover tactics on the part of the offender.""

31The offence taken into account was of destruction by setting alight a car of someone whom Kurt believed was a ""dog"" and had informed police about the Applicants' involvement in drug supply.

32Both offenders were arrested on 22 September 2010 and remained in custody thereafter. Both pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and her Honour indicated she allowed a 25% discount for their doing so. Both offenders had an excellent upbringing with a loving and supportive family, a very good education and good opportunities. Joshua Toole had been abusing steroids and Kurt some other drugs. Kurt also had a significant problem with gambling. Her Honour observed that ""[n]either of them, in terms of expressions of remorse, have said anything other than through their pleas of guilty"" but that such indications were weakened by the fact that the Crown case was strong. Her Honour seems to have also thought that their statements to Dr Nielssen, a psychiatrist whose reports, one in respect of each Applicant, came into evidence militated against remorse. 

33Furthermore, her Honour said that she did not accept most of the matters Joshua had told Dr Nielssen which she described as ""a transparent attempt to minimise his role in the offences"". She indicated also that she rejected some of what Kurt had told Dr Nielssen.

34That said, her Honour opined that the Applicants' prospects of rehabilitation were quite high relying, inter alia, on the conduct of the Applicants while on remand, ""the lack of significant ongoing drug and alcohol addictions [and] that there are no significant or chronic mental problems in evidence"".

35Kurt was born in July 1990 and Joshua in October 1983. 

Joshua - Ground 1
The Applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing Judge failed to warn those appearing for him that her Honour proposed to accumulate the sentences, contrary to the written submission of the Crown on sentence.

36The foundation for this ground lies in written submissions made by the Crown prosecutor below. The relevant passage was:

""Concurrency of sentences for drug trafficking:
Provided the totality of the offender's conduct is recognised, concurrent sentences could be imposed for the two roll-up drug trafficking offences given their intertwined nature and timing.

Ditto re the sentence for the deal with proceeds of crime offence given it too is intertwined with the drug trafficking.""

37Appearing for the Applicants at first instance, Mr Peter Hastings QC made oral submissions which included:

""I don't take any real issue with what the Crown had put forward in the submissions certainly as to the applicable law and principles. I don't disagree with anything which is contained in the documents.""

38Her Honour read the written submissions while on the bench and reserved her decision. No one said anything further on the topic of concurrency and accumulation.

39 In support of this ground the Court was referred to a number of prior decisions - Fairbairn v R [2006] NSWCCA 337; 165 A Crim R 434, Baroudi v R [2007] NSWCCA 48, Nair v R [2013] NSWCCA 79 - which have held, or in which it has been said, that there had been a denial of procedural fairness when a judge had, without notice, departed from an intimation he or she had made during the course of sentencing proceedings. 

40Reference was also made to remarks of Kirby P, with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed, in Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 296. His Honour said:

""It used to be said that 'silence' in a judge was 'a counsel of perfection': see, eg, R v Watson; ex parte Armstrong (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 294. However, at least in the case of a trial judge sitting without a jury, that view has now been disapproved by the High Court of Australia: see Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 571. Respectfully, I strongly endorse the view there expressed. Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view.""

41The remarks of the High Court in Vakauta v Kelly to which Kirby P referred were made in an appeal in a personal injury case and in the following context:

""In the course of an eloquent passage in his judgment in Reg v Watson; ex parte Armstrong, Jacobs J expressed the view that judicial 'silence' is 'counsel of perfection'. We respectfully disagree with the application of that observation to a trial judge sitting without a jury. It seems to us that a trial judge who made necessary rulings but otherwise sat completely silent throughout a non-jury trial with the result that his or her views about the issues, problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remained unknown until they emerged as final conclusions in his or her judgment would not represent a model to be emulated.""

42Parker v DPP was a case where, in the course of an offender's appeal from a deferral of sentence and fine imposed in the Local Court, a District Court judge, without notice of what he contemplated (which would have given the offender an opportunity to withdraw his appeal) imposed a custodial sentence. It was a situation where time honoured practice meant that a judge would not increase a sentence without notice.

43The circumstances in both cases are radically different from those in sentencing proceedings in the District Court. Not uncommonly a judge will have a number of cases before him, hopefully some or all of which will be disposed of during the day. The circumstances of each may be simple or complex. The Crown will often hand up written submissions which may deal with a few or, on the other hand, a myriad of issues and which may or may not contain concessions. Generally defence counsel, but not the judge, will have had those submissions in advance. The Crown may make concessions in the course of oral submissions.

44For a judge, who may wish to reserve because of the difficulties of a particular case, or so that he or she can deal with other cases in their list, in those circumstances to be obliged to read or listen to those submissions with a fine tooth comb, so that he or she can comprehensively identify any concessions and bring any with which he or she does or may disagree, to the attention of defence counsel, is to place a burden on the judge that the system cannot, and in my view should not, have to bear. The judge is there to read or listen to what is put before him or her and to decide, in light of the relevant statutory provisions and other law, the sentence appropriate to impose. The representatives of the parties have the obligation to raise matters that argue in favour of their respective clients, they can fairly be assumed to know them (or they should not be practising in the jurisdiction), and in sentencing proceedings I do not believe ""fair procedure requires ... that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties or their representatives"". 

45I do accept that if a judge gives a positive indication that he or she is disposed to adopt a particular argument or approach, and a party or legal representative in reliance on that indication, also adopts a particular course, then the judge will, because of his or her or own conduct, come under an obligation to warn of the possibility of any change of view. To maintain silence when the judge's view has changed is to mislead and is in character no different from representations that are or become misleading in other fields of activity. Thus, I have no difficulty in accepting the law as laid down in Fairbairn v R; Baroudi v R; and Nair v R.

46For these reasons I do not regard there having been a denial of procedural fairness. But there is another reason why this ground cannot succeed. The concession by the Crown was qualified. It used the expressions, ""could be imposed"" and ""provided the totality of the offender's conduct is recognised"". The first of these expressed a possibility. It did not say ""should be imposed"" or that no other course was open.

47In, to some extent, accumulating the sentences for the drug offences, her Honour was clearly demonstrating that she did not regard one of those sentences as properly reflecting the totality of Joshua's conduct. In those circumstances, what is now relied on as a concession by the Crown, accepted that her Honour was entitled to impose sentences not, or not wholly, concurrent.

48In these circumstances, I need not pursue the question whether there was any conceivable possibility that entirely concurrent sentences would not have been erroneous. As presently advised, I do not see how Joshua's criminality in supplying 95 kg of cannabis, often in transactions quite separate from those involving methylamphetamines, could possibly have been encompassed within a proper sentence for the methylamphetamine supply count.

Joshua - Ground 2
The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the disparity and lack of proper proportion between his sentence and the sentence imposed on the co-offender, Kurt Toole.

49As has been said, the sentences for the methylamphetamine charges were, for Joshua, 13 years including a non-parole period of 8 years, and for Kurt, 9¾ years including a non-parole period of 6 years. The effective total sentences and non-parole periods were each 1 year longer.

50In the argument made in support of this ground, no challenge was made to her Honour's findings summarised above. Rather was emphasis placed on the fact that Kurt had a more significant record, including offences of threatened or actual violence and that he had committed the subject offences whilst on conditional liberty. The gravity of the offence on his Form 1 was emphasised. These matters may be conceded. 

51However, operating with considerable force in the other direction, is the difference in roles of the Applicants as found by her Honour and the difference in quantities in the methylamphetamine charges. In support of the contention that quantity is not the principal determinant in fixing an appropriate sentence, counsel for Joshua relied on R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at [102] and Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 at [42]. I have no difficulty in accepting what is said in those paragraphs. The whole of them is important. In R v Stanbouli I said:

""And although a majority of the High Court has said that weight is not the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence - see Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [67], their Honours also made it clear that weight is material. Given the terms of the legislation and the fact that the extent of the illegal profit and the degree of harm arising from an importation is liable to be roughly proportional to weight, it could hardly be otherwise.""

52The passage from Melikian v R reads:

""It is well established that the quantity of the drugs is not the sole or even the principal determinant for sentencing in relation to drug offences. As was pointed out by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v MacDonnell (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [33]: 

'What is more important is the role of the offender, and the level of his or her participation in the offence; subject of course to the fact that, in relation to supply offences under State law, there is a gradation of seriousness reflected by an increase in penalty as the quantity of drug involved moves into those levels which answer the descriptions of a commercial quantity, or of a large commercial quantity.'""

53Joshua was running a commercial operation. No doubt an increase in quantity increased his profit as it undoubtedly increased the extent of the harm, or prospect of the harm, that has led to the unlicensed methylamphetamine trade being rendered illegal. Dealing as Joshua did in roughly six times the quantity that was the subject of the charge against Kurt, required a substantially higher sentence. Given the differences in quantities and in the roles of the Applicants as found by her Honour, I see no error in the disparity between the sentences imposed. A fortiori is this so when her Honour provided detailed findings and reasons for the difference, findings and reasons which have not been challenged - see R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]. 

Joshua Ground 3
The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the evidence of the Applicant's mental health problems.

54Originally, the foundations of this ground were a challenge to her Honour's finding that ""there are no significant or chronic mental problems in evidence"" and reference to a report of Dr Nielssen concerning Joshua: judgment on sentence, p 14. In oral submissions, Mr Game SC who appeared for Joshua, added a further contention, viz that her Honour had not dealt adequately with the psychiatric material.

55In his report on Joshua, Dr Nielssen records a diagnosis of:

""Substance abuse disorder (anabolic steroids)
Substance induced psychotic illness, in remission.""

56Dr Nielssen went on to provide reasons for these diagnoses, saying:

""The diagnosis of substance dependence disorder is made on the basis of Mr Toole's account of heavy use of a range of potent anabolic steroids and the psychological complications of anabolic steroid use, which included irritability, increased impulsivity, the role of the drugs in triggering psychotic illness and the role of his abuse of anabolic steroids in these offences. Mr Toole reported that his involvement [in] the offences was the direct result of his attempts to source a supply of steroids.

Mr Toole reported symptoms of what was probably a steroid induced psychotic illness triggered by the very high doses of steroids and the emotional changes brought about by his use of anabolic steroids. The disorder was described as being in remission as a result of cessation of those drugs and treatment with a low dose of an antipsychotic medication under the supervision of a psychiatrist. He did not have features of a chronic mental illness such as schizophrenia, and may be able to withdraw from the medication in due course.

... Mr Toole is assessed to have good prospects of rehabilitation."" 

57Earlier, Dr Nielssen had recorded that Joshua had described his main problem as the use of large doses of anabolic steroids, that he had reported ""a strong family history of psychiatric disorder, as he understands his father had periods of depression ..."". Joshua had said that in the year before his arrest, his general practitioner diagnosed a psychotic illness thought to be secondary to steroid use and prescribed psychotic medication. The features of the disorder were irrational anger and irritability and abnormal preoccupation with his partner's infidelity. On his reception into prison, Joshua had been assessed by another psychiatrist who prescribed another antipsychotic medication.

58When Dr Nielssen asked about the presence of other symptoms of psychosis, Joshua said he had severe mood swings, from anger to sadness and occasioned periods of elevated mood within a short period. Joshua had also described having strong impulses to do things he would find embarrassing. He reported hearing conversations inside his head but denied experiencing typical hallucinations of voices or the belief that he could communicate by thoughts. Joshua told Dr Nielssen that his health had gradually improved since he stopped using anabolic steroids.

59A significant omission from the criticism of what her Honour said was any attention to her Honour's use of the terms ""significant"" and ""chronic"". Dr Nielssen's diagnoses of a disorder and illness were that both were in remission and had been due in any event to Joshua's use of anabolic steroids, a use that had stopped. There was no evidence that there was any likelihood of them recurring and thus these problems were not chronic or, so far as the future was concerned, significant. 

60So far as the past was concerned, while in psychiatric language Joshua might have been said to have a disorder and an illness, in layman's terms, he had a drug addiction and this Court has made it clear that, except in unusual circumstances, a drug addiction is not to be regarded as a matter in mitigation - R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [202]. It would be illogical to treat differently the irrationality or psychoses that commonly are consequences of such drug taking. 

61In fact such evidence as there is does not indicate that Joshua's drug taking or anabolic steroid use contributed in any way to his offending beyond creating a need for funds which he sought to satisfy, by undertaking what seems to have been an efficient commercial operation. To treat his drug taking or any psychiatric conditions that flowed as therefore entitling him to any of the consideration normally extended to those with mental illnesses would distort the sentencing process.

62There are other matters relevant to the complaint that her Honour did not deal adequately with the psychiatric material. Joshua's account of his offending given to Dr Nielssen differed significantly from the Agreed Facts and her Honour regarded what Joshua had said to the doctor as ""a transparent attempt to minimise his role in the offences"". Joshua's report to Dr Nielssen of ""a strong family history of psychiatric disorder"" was not confirmed by the Applicant's father during the sentencing hearing. Joshua was proved to be a liar and, given it was largely based on what Joshua had said, Dr Nielssen's opinion could be little or no more reliable than the information on which it was based. Furthermore, counsel appearing for the Applicants addressed not one word about the psychiatric evidence in the course of his address, one suspects because of its weaknesses to which I have referred. In the circumstances prevailing, her Honour dealt adequately with that evidence.

Kurt Ground 1
The sentencing Judge erred in her treatment of the applicant's psychiatric case on sentence. In particular:

(a) The sentencing Judge failed to find that a motivation for the offences was to support the applicant's drug abuse and gambling problem; and

(b) The sentencing Judge failed to adequately evaluate the applicant's psychiatric case when considering the subjective circumstances.

63The latter complaint faces similar difficulties to the complaint made on Joshua's behalf just dealt with. Given counsel who appeared for the Applicants did not mention the topic in his address and the circumstances which may well have explained that stance, arguably Kurt had no ""psychiatric case"". 

64Certainly, there was the diagnosis of Dr Nielssen that Kurt suffered from:

(1) Substance abuse disorder

(2) Substance induced psychotic illness, in remission, and

(3) Obsessive compulsive disorder, in remission.

65Dr Nielssen stated the bases for these opinions as follows:

""The diagnosis of substance abuse disorder is made on the basis of Mr Toole's account of abuse of a range of drugs known to have harmful psychological effects, and the history of complications of substance abuse, including the triggering of symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and psychotic illness, the contribution of drug use to the unrealistic thinking of compulsive gambling and the role of substance abuse in these offences.

The diagnosis of substance induced psychotic illness is made on the basis of the history of abnormal beliefs and other symptoms triggered by use of drugs, which had abated since withdrawing from drugs and had not returned after the withdrawal from treatment with psychotropic medications. There is a family history of psychiatric disorder and behavioural problems during his upbringing, which suggests some vulnerability to develop psychosis. 

The diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of the disorder, including intrusive unwanted thoughts alleviated by anxiety reducing rituals, and the magical belief that members of his family might come to some harm if he did not perform those rituals. The disorder is described as being in remission as Mr Toole reported that the symptoms had abated since receiving treatment, and have not returned since stopping medication.

At the time of the recent interview Mr Toole appeared to be free of symptoms of mental illness. However, he carries a risk of further episodes of mental illness because of the pattern of symptoms he reported and what appears to be an inherited vulnerability to mental illness. He would be strongly advised to abstain from drugs known to trigger mental illness, including all forms of stimulant drugs and anabolic steroids.

Mr Toole is assessed to have good prospects for rehabilitation ...""

66The doctor had earlier remarked:

""Mr Toole reported the onset of symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder soon after leaving school, in the form of intrusive and distressing thoughts alleviated by anxiety reducing checking rituals. He ... described loud thoughts in the form of conversations inside his head ... He described being irrationally angry and abnormally concerned about the fidelity of his girlfriend in Bathurst.
... 

Mr Toole said that he was assessed by a psychiatrist on his reception to prison and was prescribed another antipsychotic medication ... He said that he had withdrawn from all the medication at about the beginning of the year, with no return of voices in his head or paranoid thoughts.
...

He reported the use of methamphetamine (ice) from the age of sixteen or seventeen. He said that the pattern of drug use was to binge over several days intermittently, and said his use increased in frequency over time ... He said that he also went through a period of heavy cocaine use, paid for by the sale of other drugs.""

67Dr Nielssen had also recorded that Kurt had withdrawn from all relevant medications seven months earlier, with no return of voices in his head or paranoid thoughts and that his health had improved whilst in prison. Dr Nielssen's reason for the view that there was a risk that Kurt might have further episodes of mental illness in the future, that there appeared to be ""an inherited vulnerability to mental illness"", suffered from the disadvantage, that while both Joshua and Kurt had given Dr Nielssen a history to that effect, their father gave evidence denying it. Neither Joshua nor Kurt gave evidence. Her Honour also rejected as untruthful Kurt's accounts to Dr Nielssen of his brother's involvement in the offences and, in these circumstances, it could not be said that there was any firm foundation for Dr Nielssen's opinion of a risk in the future. 

68Furthermore, apart from some problems with anger at school, the history of psychiatric symptoms Kurt gave Dr Nielssen all post-dated (or were at least consistent with post-dating) Kurt's commencement of drug taking. In these circumstances, there was no basis for concluding that any psychiatric condition Dr Nielssen found, was not due to that cause.

69The matters to which I have just referred might well have been the reason why counsel for Kurt did not rely on the matter in submissions. Her Honour's remarks to the effect that ""there are no significant or chronic mental problems in evidence"", indicates that she directed attention to the issue and in the circumstances to which I have referred, there was no obligation on her Honour to deal with Kurt's ""psychiatric case"" further.

70Turning to paragraph (a) of this ground, what her Honour said on the question of motive was:

""The operation was premeditated and reasonably sophisticated. They deal in large quantities of the cannabis leaf and the methylamphetamine. They were motivated by profit. Neither relied on a problem of drug dependence of the sort that is usually claimed in matters of this kind as motivating involvement in the supply and sale of various drugs.""

And later,

""In terms of their upbringing, though, they had an excellent upbringing... [c]onsequently, it is mystifying no doubt to them and this court in the light of their backgrounds, how it was they came to be involved in these offences. I can only conclude that it was a desire for fast money and, as has been suggested, to some extent, coming within a circle of bad influences. 

I note that each of them have had slight problems of a different kind in relation to drug abuse, with Joshua Toole abusing steroids and his brother abusing other drugs. Kurt Toole, in addition, has indicated that he has a significant problem with gambling. None of these matters explain or excuse the offences, but are relevant matters to take into account in considering their subjective circumstances.""

71Neither offender gave evidence but there was, in the pre-sentence report and Dr Nielssen's report relating to Kurt, substantial reference to Kurt having been motivated by gambling and drug issues. For example, in the pre-sentence report it is recorded, ""Mr Toole ... stated that his offending behaviour was motivated by gambling, drug and alcohol issues and stated that... at the time of his offending, he was living a 'high life'.""

72Dr Nielssen recorded that Kurt told him he had been diagnosed at a particular medical centre as suffering from drug induced psychosis and that he had access to some of the progress notes from that centre. Dr Nielssen's report indicated no reservations concerning Kurt's reported drug use. 

73In these circumstances and in light of her Honour's remarks, it seems to me that there is no room for doubting that Kurt had a significant gambling and drug problem. I agree with her Honour that these matters do not excuse Kurt's offending, but her Honour was in error in saying that they did not ""explain"" his offending. I also see no basis for her Honour's description of Kurt's drug problems as ""slight"". 

74The question arises, however, as to the effect these errors might have had on her Honour's sentencing. I have already adverted to R v Henry at [202] where this Court rejected drug addiction and addiction to gambling, with its attendant need for money, as mitigating factors (except in exceptional circumstances - see at [194]). 

75The need to disregard these matters was a fortiori in Kurt's case. The pre-sentence report records that he had failed to complete some gambling intervention program with the Probation and Parole Service and Dr Nielssen's report records that, having been diagnosed by his general practitioner with a drug induced psychoses several months before his arrest, he did not take up a referral with the local mental health team.

76In these circumstance, I am not persuaded that the errors to which I have referred, had or might have had any effect on the sentencing of Kurt and though I do not need to rely on it, I am reinforced in that view by her Honours' findings of Kurt's ""unbounded enthusiasm for the task of supplying drugs on an almost daily basis to other people"" and her description of the entering enclosed lands offence as involving ""threatening people in their own home"", by the use of weapons and standover tactics on the part of the offender.

77Again, it is noteworthy that counsel appearing for Joshua and Kurt made no reference in his submissions to any problem with gambling Kurt may have had or either offender's drug use. 

Joshua Ground 4 and Kurt Ground 2
(Joshua) The sentence is manifestly excessive.
(Kurt) The sentence imposed on count 2 is manifestly excessive.

78In support of these grounds, reference was made to the Judicial Commission statistics and a number of prior cases. The point (which I accept) was made that a number of the cases in this area were decided before the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. Accordingly the cases, and the statistics, should be approached with caution.

79Before I turn to the matters relied on behalf of the Applicants, it is appropriate to refer again to the statutory provisions for they constitute guideposts to which regard must be had - Muldrock v The Queen at [27]. Joshua's offence of supplying the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine involved just over 6 kg. That is six times the amount of the bottom of the large commercial range, though it must also be recognised that there is no upper limit to that range. The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is, as has been said, life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years prescribed for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

80Joshua's sentence, for the offence involving a large commercial quantity, was imprisonment for 13 years, including a non-parole period of 8 years. Thus, even when allowance is made for the 25% discount for his plea, the non-parole period imposed is significantly shorter than the prescribed standard. Obviously the 13 years, even grossed up with the plea discount added back, is a long way below the statutory maximum. And in this connection, it must not be forgotten that sentences are not linear - see R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [16]; R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 at [69]. 

81Of course, the 6 kg which Joshua supplied was vastly less that the indeterminate maximum quantity, the supply of which would constitute an offence under the section though it was, of course, six times the maximum commercial quantity, which renders an offender liable to imprisonment for 20 years and for which a standard non-parole period of 10 years has been prescribed. Given the overall scheme of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, which, albeit by steps, provides for higher and higher penalties as the quantity involved in offences increases, this seems to me a proper factor to take into account. 

82Of course as many cases, including R v Stanbouli and Melikian v R referred to above, make clear, quantity, while important, is only one factor and regard must also be had to other matters. An offender's role has been regarded as a major factor in the determination of penalty. Indeed in the passage from Melikian v R, Woods CJ at CL is quoted as regarding it as more important than quantity. Running as he was a commercial operation for his own profit, Joshua's role rated very highly in the hierarchy of offenders. 

83Joshua's role also leads to the conclusion that he scored highly on any scale of other factors identified by the High Court in Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [68], [69] as material to the determination of any sentence - knowledge of quantity and purity, and the kind and size of reward. To these factors, one should add Wells SC DCJ's findings that Joshua was as an overall supervisor of Kurt and directing others in an operation she described as ""reasonably sophisticated"". 

84Joshua was a principal (even if his supplier in Sydney might have had a more extensive range of customers). His offences were premeditated and his offending had occurred over a period of months and he dealt in a quantity appreciably above the maximum commercial and minimum large commercial quantity. Except for quantity, I would rank Joshua's criminality as at or very close to the top of that contemplated by the statutory provisions applicable to the supply of a large commercial quantity. If one is permitted to make the comparison, his criminality was a long way above the mid-range for an offence involving a commercial quantity.

85The Judicial Commission statistics for the supply of large commercial quantities covering the period October 2006 to September 2013 show that of 35 offenders who pleaded guilty and were sentenced to non-consecutive terms, six had sentences of over 10 years and four had sentences of 12 years. The highest non-parole period was 10 years and only five offenders had non-parole periods of 8 years or more. Of 28 offenders who were sentenced to consecutive terms, only four received over 10 years as their longest sentence. The limited usefulness of this information has been indicated in numerous cases and a comparison with some prior cases is more useful although, again, it is important to recognise differences and that each sentence is the result of a separate exercise of discretion - see generally Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]. 

86In R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; 219 A Crim R 415 the offender pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, viz 1.615 kg in the course of nine separate supplies during a 3 month period. 

87The offender, aged 35 at the time of the offence, was involved in a large scale drug syndicate and his role was ""at least a principal"" although the objective seriousness of his offence was assessed as ""in the middle of the range... but very much towards the bottom of the middle of that range"": at [20]. He had an appreciable work history but became addicted to drugs, he had a prior record, including for drug supply, but his prospects of rehabilitation were assessed as reasonably good.

88This Court dismissed a Crown appeal on the grounds of manifest inadequacy against a sentence of imprisonment for 6½ years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months, that sentence reflected discounts totalling 35% and thus a starting point of 10 years including a non-parole period of 7½ years. Johnson J, who dissented, thought that the starting point before discounts should have been 14 years. The report contains a review of a number of prior cases. 

89In Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 this Court dismissed an appeal against a number of sentences, only one of which needs to be referred to here. It was a sentence of 12 years including a non-parole period of 7 years for the supply (an offer to supply) 3.36 kg of ecstasy tablets, i.e. a little over 6.7 times the minimum large commercial quantity. Based on a sample that had been supplied, the drug would have had what was described as a quite low purity of 9%.

90The offender was 27 at the time of his offending. He had a reasonable work history but had become addicted to drugs. He was regarded as having no significant record although the instant offence was committed in the course of drug trafficking at a wholesale level to a substantial degree. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and although the report does not mention the discount given on that account, it may be inferred it was 25%.

91In Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; (2011) 219 A Crim R 104 the offender pleaded guilty to a number of serious drug offences, only one of which need be referred to here, viz. the supply of 2.314 kg of methylamphetamine by a number of transactions over two months. The offender was engaged in the supply of a number of drugs on a substantial scale, although not regarded as a principal. His offending was regarded as not higher than moderately above mid-range. Taken into account with the methylamphetamine offence were two offences of supplying something over 2.6 and 3 kg of cannabis. He was aged about 33 at the time of offending with a limited criminal history not including offences of drug supply. After allowing a 20% discount, the sentence imposed by this Court for the offence mentioned was imprisonment for 16 years including a non-parole period of 12 years

92In R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 the offender faced a number of charges including the deemed supply of 1.78 kg of methylamphetamine of a purity ranging between 2 and 2.5% found in his residence. He was regarded as a warehouse-keeper, a convenient repository for someone else's drugs for a modest return and the objective gravity of his offence as substantially below mid-range. Taken into account were some firearm offences but it was said that in the circumstances of the case the increase on their account would not have been large.

93The offender was aged in his mid-20s, he had had a disruptive childhood, had some work history until he became addicted to drugs and a minor criminal record for offences other than drugs.

94This Court allowed a Crown appeal and, holding that an appropriate starting point was 11 years, and after allowing a discount of 17.5%, imposed a sentence of 9 years including a non-parole period for 6½ years for the methylamphetamine offence. The Court drew attention to R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and other cases that made it clear that those who assist at a low level in the illegal drug trade must expect heavy sentences.

95In Efstathiadis v R [2009] NSWCCA 317 this Court dismissed an appeal by an offender who pleaded guilty to one instance of the supply of 1.9 kg of methylamphetamine and who had been sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years including a non-parole period of 10 years. His criminality was assessed as ""only very slightly below"" the mid-range. He had been sentenced some years previously for an offence of on-going supply. The sentencing judge had found that the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation but he had received a discount for his plea of only 10%. It may be that the pre-Muldrock view of the standard non-parole period affected the sentence. 

96In Wang v R [2009] NSWCCA 223 the offender who pleaded not guilty had taken delivery of ecstasy pills weighing about 1,464g. This was a large commercial quantity, the lower limit for that drug being 0.5 kg. The offender's precise role in any hierarchy was not determined although it was conceded he was not a mere courier. He had a minor criminal record. Holding that the objective gravity of the offence fell somewhat below the mid-range this Court imposed a sentence of 16 years including a non-parole period of 12 years. 

97In Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 an appeal against a sentence of 12 years including a non-parole period of 8 years imposed for an offence of (deemed) supply of 1,101.22g of methylamphetamine was dismissed. Three offences of goods in custody being cash totalling some $330,000 were taken into account. The offender had received a discount of 25% for his plea. While recognising that the quantity was not far above the bottom of the large commercial range the sentencing judge assessed the offence as falling within the mid-range of seriousness. Large amounts of money in the bank and, together with other indicia of drug dealing, at the offender's home contributed to this conclusion. Hislop J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, observed that the sentence was in conformity with other decisions to which the Court was referred.

98Reference may also be made to the summary of other cases appearing in the report of Tan v R [2010] NSWCCA 207, recognising of course that they concerned ecstasy where the minimum large commercial quantity is 0.5kg.

99Recognising the limitations a summary table imposes - for example the table that follows does not record the presence or significance of a Form 1, or prior convictions, or findings as to objective seriousness - it is nevertheless useful to compare the sentences imposed on the Applicants with the results in the cases just referred to and a deduced or stated undiscounted starting point:

100While the decision in R v Ehrlich argues in Joshua's favour (if one ignores the difference in quantity) and that in R v Mahmud may do so (if one ignores the purity) when regard is had to quantity, Joshua's role, and the other features referred to in Wong and Leung, the other cases to which I have referred make it clear that the sentence imposed on Joshua was not manifestly excessive. Indeed, by comparison with some, it is low. 

101In the case of Kurt, whose sentence was of imprisonment for 9 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 6 years, again the maximum penalty prescribed was life imprisonment and there was a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Given that the quantity of methylamphetamine with which he was involved was only just above the bottom of the large commercial range, it is probably also relevant to have regard to the statutory provisions relevant to a commercial quantity. For such an amount the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period (for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness) of 10 years. 

102Recognising that Kurt was not a principal and the periods of his sentence must be grossed up by reference to the plea discount he was given, nevertheless those periods do not appear to be excessive when compared with any of the legislative provisions. Grossed up, his head sentence was about 13½ years - well below the 20 years and life periods and his non-parole period (similarly adjusted) of 8 years is appreciably short of the 10 or 15 year periods. A fortiori when one recognises that his sentence had to take account also of his offence on the Form 1.

103The Judicial Commission statistics for commercial quantities for the period October 2006 to September 2013 suggest that the sentence imposed on Kurt was heavy. They show that of 73 offenders who pleaded guilty and were sentenced to non-consecutive terms for the supply of a commercial quantity of amphetamines, only three offenders (not including Kurt) were sentenced to imprisonment of 9 years and only one had a longer sentence, of 12 years. Of those 73, five had a non-parole periods of 6 years and only one had a longer non-parole period, viz. 7 years. Of the 55 offenders who were sentenced to consecutive terms, only nine received a sentence over 8 years and only one received a sentence over 9 years as their longest sentence. It must be recognised that many of these sentences may have reflected a view of the standard non-parole period legislation held in Muldrock v R, but if anything that error probably had the effect of increasing the sentences where it occurred. Of course the statistics do not detail quantities or role.

104Reference should also be made to specific decisions. In R v Paredes [2012] NSWCCA 4 this Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 7½ years including a non-parole period of 4½ years for knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The quantity was approximately, but less than, 1 kg. The offender had pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. The only ground of appeal was lack of parity. The offender was described as ""intimately involved"" although because the offenders were arrested before the supply occurred, his offending was for participation in an agreement to, or arranging a, supply.

105In Lawson v R [2012] NSWCCA 56 this Court dismissed an appeal from a sentence of 9 years including a non-parole period of 5½ years for the (deemed) supply of 907.5g of methylamphetamine. Two offences on a Form 1 were taken into account, but are unlikely to have had much effect on the sentence. A sentence of 5 years including a non-parole period of 3½ years for the supply of 128g of ecstasy was made concurrent. The offender was regarded as a mid-level drug dealer supplying drugs in portions significantly larger than street deals. At the time of offending the offender was serving a sentence by way of home detention and was not regarded as having good prospects of rehabilitation. He had pleaded guilty but the discount was not stated in the report.

106In Radi v R [2010] NSWCCA 265 an offender, in whose vehicle a bag containing 991g of methylamphetamine was found, was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years including a non-parole period of 7 years. The appeal was only against conviction but the report suggests - I put it no more strongly - that there was little or no other evidence indicating the offender's role. The bag would seem to have been placed in the car by another person with whom the offender had had numerous phone calls.

107In R v Sciberras [2006] NSWCCA 268; (2006) 165 A Crim R 532 this Court allowed a Crown appeal and imposed sentences for, inter alia, supplying some 474g of methylamphetamine and some 175.49g of ecstasy. The sentences imposed were imprisonment of 8 years including a non-parole period of 6 years and imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 5 years. In respect of the second of these offences, a number of offences on a Form 1 were taken into account and could be expected to have led to some increase in sentence. The sentences had different starting dates and the effective sentence imposed in respect for the offences mentioned was of 10 years including a non-parole period of 7 years. 

108The offender had been, for about 5½ months, trafficking to a substantial degree in more than one drug to fund his and his partner's drug addiction. Most sales were to ultimate users. The offending was regarded as not below the mid-point of objective seriousness. It may well be that the standard non-parole was given more weight than it would have received after the decision in Muldrock. However, operating in the other direction, and in recognition of the proceedings being a Crown appeal, the Court said that the sentences imposed were less than should have been imposed at first instance.

109The offender was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikely to re-offend. He was given a discount of, or of the order of, 25% for his plea. 

110In R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; (2005) 152 A Crim R 462, this Court imposed a sentence of 7 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months on an offender who had been convicted of an offence of the (deemed) supply of 371.3g of methylamphetamine found in a freezer at his home. He was treated as a courier and storeman who assisted some other unidentified person. There was no evidence of personal gain to the offender. On account of the quantity and the offender's role, his offence was not regarded as falling in the mid-range of objective seriousness. The offender had health problems and it is clear that this operated to reduce his sentence. He had some criminal record but not including drugs. Although the Court also took into account the sentences passed prior to the introduction of the standard non-parole period, it appears that the standard non-parole period may have had an effect greater than it would now. 

111In R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32, the offender had been charged with a number of offences. Three are of present relevance, viz.

(i) On 26 July 2002 supplying 10 grams of methylamphetamine;
(ii) On 28 June 2002 supplying 28 grams of crystalline-methylamphetamine (ice); and
(iii) On 25 July knowingly taking part in the supply of 137.3 grams of methylamphetamine.

112Each offence arose under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and rendered the offender liable to imprisonment for 15 years. There was no standard non-parole period. Taken into account in connection with the third of these offences was an offence of having custody of $3,050 reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained.

113The offender had no prior record. He was held entitled to a discount of 30% for his plea and assistance. His motivation was money. He was regarded as well up and having some authority in a well organised criminal enterprise. 

114In respect of the 3 offences mentioned, and after a review of the statistics for large commercial quantities, commercial quantities and quantities less than commercial, this Court sentenced the offender to imprisonment for periods of respectively a fixed term of 15 months, a fixed term of 2 years, and a term of 5½ years including a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. The starting dates of the sentences were 1 year apart, resulting in an effective sentence for the 3 offences (involving a total of 175.3g of methylamphetamine) of 7½ years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months.

116Looking only at the raw figures, by comparison Kurt's sentence was high. However once account is taken of the quantity with which Kurt was involved, the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the time, and of the offence on his Form 1, it is not. It is certainly not manifestly excessive or unreasonable or plainly unjust - Hili at [75]. 

117In what I have said in respect of these grounds, I have concentrated on the methylamphetamine offences with which the Applicants were charged. Their overall sentences were, of course, increased in consequence of the other charges against them. However, given that the increase was only of 1 year for each Applicant, if the sentences for the methylamphetamine offences were not manifestly excessive, then the overall sentences certainly were not.

118There is one further matter to which I should advert. The courts cannot be unconscious of the increase in frequency of offences involving trafficking in amphetamines. Statistics published by the Bureau of Crime Statistics confirm that that is the case, the rate of offences per 100,000 of the population having roughly doubled over the last 10 years. Clearly the weight to be given by the courts to deterrence should also markedly increase and result in a commensurate increase in sentences. However, I have not found it necessary in considering this ground to place weight on this factor. 

Joshua Ground 5 and Kurt Ground 3
[Each] Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity and lack of proper proportion between the sentences imposed on him and sentence(s) imposed on other offenders including co-offenders.

119These grounds were added, by leave, during the hearing of the appeal. They arise out of sentences imposed by Maiden DCJ on 5 December 2012 on an offender GB and by Tupman DCJ on 6 September 2013 on an offender McGann. They were not adequately addressed by Counsel who appeared for the Crown during the hearing and the Court subsequently invited further submissions, observing that the sentence imposed on GB might answer one or other of the descriptions of ""manifestly inadequate"", ""grossly manifestly inadequate"" or ""an affront to the administration of justice"". The Crown provided further submissions on 22 August last and Mr Game SC on behalf of the Applicants responded on 25 August 2014.

120The Applicant noted that the Crown did not contend that the sentence imposed on GB answered one of the descriptions just quoted, contenting itself with describing the sentence imposed on GB as ""arguably erroneously lenient"". In fact, the Crown had earlier described GB's sentence as ""undoubtedly low"".

121The Applicants' submissions went on to contend that, as the Crown had not submitted that the sentence imposed on GB was manifestly inadequate, it would not be appropriate for the Court to embark on its own consideration of whether GB's sentence answered that description or one of the other epithets referred to above. It was submitted that if the Court concluded there was disparity, it should at least reduce the Applicant's sentences to the bottom of the appropriate sentencing range.

122Given that the invitation from the Court to make further submissions expressly raised the possibility that the sentence imposed on GB might answer one or other of the descriptions quoted, the Applicants were on notice that the Court was concerned that that such a characterisation might be appropriate. Given that the Applicants had an opportunity to make submissions on the issue, the Court is not precluded by the attitude of the Crown from so finding. Providing that to depart therefrom is not a denial of natural justice, a sentencing Court is not bound by the attitude of the Crown to a particular issue or sentence - GAS v The Queen [2004] HCA 22; (2004) 217 CLR 198 at [30] et seq. Accordingly, I propose to consider the sentence imposed on GB free of any restrictions such as contended for on behalf of the Applicants. It should be noted however, that the Crown's submissions did include the contention that any reduction in the Applicant's sentences would lead to a sentence which was ""an affront to the administration of justice"". 

Parity - GB
123GB was sentenced in respect of three charges:

(i) Supplying a large commercial quantity viz. 5.936 kg of methylamphetamine;
(ii) Supplying a commercial quantity viz. 74.976 kg of cannabis leaf;
(iii) Dealing with the proceeds of crime viz. a sum of $142,095.

124GB was a courier transporting drugs on at least six occasions between 12 August 2010 and 23 September 2010 from Sydney to Newcastle and returning with the cash. He received for each round trip $500. The subject of the charges were drugs and cash found in GB's vehicle at the time of his arrest. It is apparent from all the material before the Court, that he was arrested just after supplying Joshua for the last time and the quantity of methylamphetamine with which he was charged equals that contained in the deliveries to Joshua detailed above. GB provided assistance to the authorities for which he was given a discount of 25% in addition to a similar discount for his plea. He had a conviction in 1980 for the importation of heroin, receiving for that offence, a sentence of imprisonment for 15½ years. He had significant health problems being ""serious depressive and anxiety disorders"", serious orthopaedic injuries and heart problems. There was a likelihood that his general health would continue to deteriorate while incarcerated. Maiden DCJ regarded GB as unlikely to re-offend.

125His Honour also said that if GB was discharged from the prison hospital, where he apparently was at the time of sentence, and possibly in any event, it was most likely that GB would go into protective custody. (I might add that the authorities indicate that the possibility of such custody is encompassed within the discount for assistance.)

126Maiden DCJ's remarks on sentence indicate he was aware of the sentences imposed on the Applicants. The sentences he imposed were:

(i) On the methylamphetamine charge, imprisonment for a fixed term of 24 months commencing on 22 September 2010;
(ii) On the cannabis charge, imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 22 September 2011;
(iii) On the proceeds of crime charge, imprisonment for 18 months, including a non-parole period of 12 months, both such periods commencing on 22 September 2012.

127The effective sentence was thus of 3½ years including a non-parole of fixed term of 3 years. At least at first blush, as the following table demonstrates, there is thus a substantial difference between the sentence imposed on GB and the Applicants:

128Given that, because of the choice of starting dates, the sentences imposed on the Applicants for their cannabis offences were effectively for only 6 months, the Applicants have no legitimate cause for complaint despite the differences in quantities and the nominal length of the sentences for the offences involving that drug. For similar reasons and because of its relative insignificance in the overall sentences, I take the same view in respect of the sentences for the third offences. 

129The situation in relation to the methylamphetamine offences is different. Compared against the statutory criteria, and even adding back the 50% discount GB received, the sentence imposed on him for that offence was extraordinarily light. Certainly he was a courier on a per trip rate but, as was said in R v Muanchukingkan (1990) 52 A Crim R 354 at 356, the law is that:

""No reason existed for extending particular leniency because of the fact that the applicant was a courier, for the reasons outlined in Regina v Le Cerf.... As was there stated, couriers and intermediaries must expect substantial sentences because without them the trade in narcotics would collapse"". 

130The decision in R v Mahmud referred to above provides further confirmation of that view. So does the extensive review of authorities I carried out in the context of drug importation in R v Spiteri [1999] NSWCCA 3. 

131There can also be no doubt that Maiden DCJ's sentence on GB was much influenced by his particular subjective considerations. Furthermore, given that he was a courier, his offence was arguably not in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However, the repetitive and premeditated nature of GB's offending, effectively assisting in the distribution of almost 6 kg of methylamphetamine, means that his sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

132Should Joshua's and/or Kurt's sentence be reduced to accord more with that imposed on GB?

133Adding back the 50% discount GB received, his sentence was nominally a fixed term of 4 years. With his plea discount added back, the non-parole element of Kurt's sentence equates to 8 years and the head sentence to about 13½ years - figures which, as I have said, are well below the 10 or 15 year standard non-parole periods and the 20 years and life periods referred to in the applicable legislation. Account needs to be taken also of the fact that Kurt's sentence reflects a very serious offence on a Form 1 and which required a significant increase in the sentence beyond that appropriate for the drug offence itself.

134The 8 and 13½ year figures of course reflect that Kurt was on conditional liberty and his Form 1 offence. In accordance with sentencing practice, those factors were never quantified but they could well account for half of the difference between the notional 4 and 8 year periods. Once that circumstance is recognised, there becomes limited scope to reduce Kurt's sentence if it is not of itself, manifestly inadequate. Similar considerations apply in any comparison of the grossed up full terms.

135When disparity in sentences exists on account of a manifestly inadequate sentence, this Court has a discretion whether to reduce the higher sentence - R v Diamond (unreported NSWCCA, 18 February 1993); R v Steele (unreported NSWCCA, 17 April 1997). Having regard to the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding two paragraphs and the extent of the inadequacy in the sentence imposed on GB, that discretion should be exercised against interfering in Kurt's sentences.

136Of course there is a much greater difference between the sentence imposed on GB and that imposed on Joshua, the grossed up fixed term and non-parole periods being 4 years and 10.7 years. There was of course the difference in roles of GB and Joshua - courier on a per-trip rate and an entrepreneur whose earnings presumably reflected supply and demand and profit - and GB's particular subjective considerations, but these matters cannot sensibly account for the difference in sentences.

137Again the question arises, should this Court interfere? Although I do not go so far as to conclude that any lower sentence on Joshua would be ""an affront to the administration of justice"" or manifestly inadequate, when regard is had to the statutory provisions and his situation, the Court should not in the exercise of its discretion, reduce Joshua's sentence in an attempt to reflect, even partly, the manifestly inadequate sentence imposed on GB. The inadequacy of the sentence imposed on GB means that Joshua has no legitimate sense of grievance arising from the disparity between the sentences. Furthermore, and though I do not need to rely on this, the enormous damage that methylamphetamines are doing to the community - and which judges cannot but be conscious of - is such, that the perfectly proper sentence imposed on Joshua for his deliberate criminality, should not be reduced. 

Parity - McGann
138Mark McGann was sentenced by Tupman DCJ in respect of one count of supplying 1.64 kg of ecstasy and one count of supplying 250.1g of methylamphetamine. Both supplies were said to have occurred on 22 September 2010. The sentences imposed were:

(i) For the supply ecstasy charge - imprisonment of 7½ years including a non-parole period of 4½ years both such terms commencing on 1 October 2011;
(ii) For the supply methylamphetamine charge - imprisonment for 4 years including a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 October 2011.

139However, before proceeding further on the question of what should be the impact on the Applicants of these sentences, the question arises whether McGann was a co-offender with either or both of the Applicants. There were two pieces of evidence suggesting that McGann was such a co-offender. One was contained in an affidavit of the solicitor for the Applicants which, after referring to receipt of the remarks on sentence of Tupman DCJ, continues:

""14. On perusal of the Remarks there is no indication of an association between Mark McGann and the Applicants. On the advice of counsel, I investigated the connection between Mark McGann and the Applicants. I made contact with the Officer in Charge of the police investigation and the ODPP and I perused the original police brief. 

15. The original Fact Sheet in the case states inter alia:

'Investigators established that Joshua TOOLE sourced amphetamines and cannabis from a source in Sydney. This source is believed to be Mark McGANN utilising telecommunications number [XXXXXXXXX]. Once a week, Joshua TOOLE would organise a delivery of cannabis and amphetamines. Co-accused [GB] would then drive from Sydney to Newcastle.'

16. The statement of agreed facts on sentence referred to [GB] ...but does not refer to Mark McGann. I am not aware why his name was removed from the statement of facts. However, where the agreed facts refer to the Applicant's 'supplier in Sydney' I believe that this is a reference to Mark McGann.""

140There was nothing to confirm that McGann's name was ""removed"" from the statement of facts. 

141The second piece of evidence lies in a transcript of the sentencing proceedings of GB which occurred on 30 November 2012 and where he indicated that he was involved as a driver in an enterprise involving Joshua Toole and McGann. 

142The statements of Agreed Facts tendered in the proceedings against the Applicants referred to GB delivering some of the methylamphetamine, the subject of the charges, to Joshua following requests by Joshua to his ""supplier"" at about 5.21 pm on 21 September 2010. On prior occasions he had delivered methylamphetamine and/or cannabis. Maiden DCJ's remarks, when sentencing GB, refer to him transporting drugs from Sydney to Newcastle and, it may be inferred from those remarks, to the Applicants. In those remarks, the supplier is referred to as ""M"" but there is no other description.

143The last delivery to the Applicants occurred at about 8.55am on 22 September 2010, at about which time Joshua and GB were arrested.

144In Judge Tupman's remarks when sentencing McGann, her Honour describes the circumstances of the offences with which she was concerned. They were, that at about 12.40 pm on 22 September 2010, McGann and a co-offender Steven Cox drove vehicles into a carpark, spoke to one another and then separately drove out. Soon afterwards, both vehicles were stopped by police and searched. Found in McGann's vehicle was money totalling $82,150. Found in Cox's vehicle was 1.64 kg of ecstasy and the 250.1g of methylamphetamine. It was accepted that Cox was a courier.

145Judge Tupman also referred to the sentence imposed on Cox. Her Honour's references in that regard, make it clear that Cox was not GB.

146There is no evidence that the Applicants dealt in ecstasy. Both the difference in name and the timing of the arrest of GB make it clear that he was not Cox and was not involved in the offences for which McGann was sentenced by Tupman DCJ. It may be that M, referred to by Maiden DCJ, was the Sydney supplier to the Applicants, but none of the remarks on sentence made in the case of the Applicants, GB or McGann provide evidence of that fact. It is also clear that the offences for which McGann was sentenced did not involve the Applicants.

147In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that McGann and the Applicants were co-offenders in any of the offences for which McGann was sentenced by Tupman DCJ. It may be that McGann was sentenced on another occasion also, but if so, there is no evidence of that before this Court. Such similarities as there were in their offending - one a supplier of drugs and the other a customer of such a supplier - does not persuade me that considerations of parity between them arise any more than they do between unrelated offenders who are charged with similar offences and this, notwithstanding the remarks in Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [30].

148Accordingly, I regard the sentences imposed on McGann as of no higher significance than those imposed on other offenders who have committed relevantly comparable offences. I have referred to a number of these above. 

Conclusions
149I propose the following orders in the case of each Applicant:

(1) Grant leave to appeal.
(2) Dismiss the appeal.

2765637,R v Jennar [2014] NSWCCA 331,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2McCALLUM J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against a sentence imposed in the District Court at Parramatta on 1 May 2014 by his Honour Judge Hanley.
4Ryker Scott Jennar (the respondent) was sentenced for five very serious offences, all contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Their details appear below.  Hanley DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years with effect from 21 November 2011.
5The Crown has also appealed against the asserted inadequacy of sentence(s) imposed upon a co-offender, Joel Douglas Barton.  He was sentenced by the same judge four days after the Registrar fixed the hearing date for the present appeal.  The Court was told that the Crown had not taken steps to have the hearings of both matters joined because Mr Barton is pursuing an appeal against conviction.  It is obviously desirable that the Crown's assertion of inadequate sentencing in both matters be heard and considered at the same time by the same judges.  It would be unfair, however, to delay the present respondent's matter until the other matter was ready to be listed for hearing.
Offences, facts and indicative sentences
Robbery whilst armed - Carrington Post Office on 11 June 2010 (s 97(1) - maximum penalty 20 years) 
6At about 1.00pm the respondent and another male went to the Carrington Post Office in a car that had been stolen the previous day.  The car had different number plates on the front and rear, both being also stolen.  The respondent was disguised by heavy clothing, a balaclava and gloves.  He was armed with a semi-automatic pistol.  
7He entered the post office where the victim was serving an elderly customer.  He walked straight up to the victim, pointed the pistol at his head, threw a shopping bag at him and said, ""Fill it"".  
8The victim placed notes from the cash drawer into the bag.  The respondent pointed to a second cash drawer and said, ""Now this"".  The victim complied by putting more money from the second drawer into the bag.  
9The respondent fled with about $1,500 to the getaway car that was driven away at high speed.  It was abandoned about 2 km away where the robbers were then driven away by a third male to Maryville where the respondent was then living.  He went to his bedroom and removed the heavy clothing and other items.  Shortly thereafter, the men were standing on the street when they were spotted by a patrolling police officer.  The respondent fled. 
 Plea of guilty - 15% discount Indicative sentence:  4 years 6 months
Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon - Criterion Hotel, Carrington on 22 May 2011 (s 97(2) - maximum penalty 25 years)
10At about 5.55pm the respondent with Joel Barton and Dylan Williams drove to the vicinity of the Criterion Hotel at Carrington.  The car was parked directly outside the hotel, the headlights were extinguished and the engine was left running.
11The respondent and Joel Barton, who was carrying a Ruger .223 mini-14 assault rifle fitted with a large ammunition magazine, entered the hotel.  The respondent was wearing a hooded jacket, a balaclava and tracksuit pants and he was carrying a cloth bag.
12Upon entering the hotel, Barton walked up to the bar and pointed the rifle at the head of the female attendant.  The respondent went behind the bar and said to her, ""Get all your fuckin' money out"".  As she began putting the cash in the bag he was carrying she said, ""Please don't kill me"".  He replied, ""You're right, love, I won't kill you"".
13Whilst the respondent collected cash, Barton maintained control of the hotel patrons by saying, ""Fucking sit down"" and by brandishing the rifle.
14After the cash register was emptied, the respondent instructed the attendant to open a second cash drawer and the hotel safe.  She told him she could not open the latter.  She continued to plead with him not to shoot her.  The respondent then told her to open the Keno and Tab cash registers, which she did.
15The respondent and Barton fled the hotel with $10,050.  They were driven away by Williams to a nearby street where all three entered a car used by the respondent, a silver BMW.  They then went to the house occupied by the respondent in Shortland.
Convicted after trialIndicative sentence:  6 years
Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon - Water Board Bowling Club, North Lambton on 19 June 2011 (s 97(2) - maximum penalty 25 years)
Shoot with intent to murder - North Lambton on 19 June 2011 (s 29 - maximum penalty 25 years - standard non-parole period 10 years)
16At about 5.45pm the respondent, Joel Barton and Dylan Williams drove to the vicinity of the Water Board Bowling Club at North Lambton in a stolen car.  Williams parked it directly outside the main entry doors to the club.  Inside were approximately 50 patrons participating in raffle draws.
17The respondent wore a hooded jacket and had a cloth tied around his face.  He was carrying a cloth bag and a screwdriver.  Barton was similarly attired and was carrying the same rifle he had used in the Criterion Hotel robbery, a Ruger .223 mini-assault rifle with a large magazine attached.  Both men entered the club.
18Barton lifted the rifle to his shoulder and began to shout at and menace the patrons.  The respondent ushered a 13-year-old girl and a 4-year-old girl from near the front entrance into the foyer telling them not to move.
19Barton walked up to the bar and pointed the rifle directly at the female attendant's head. The respondent made his way behind the bar and said to her, ""Give us the money"".  She began to take cash from the register and placed it into the carry bag he held.  He then directed her to empty the poker machine register, which she did.
20He then said, ""Where is the safe""?  She opened a safe and put the money in his bag and he demanded, ""Where is the bigger safe""?  She was terrified and tried to explain that she did not have access to the main safe.  The respondent demanded, ""Where's more money""?  The attendant placed gold coins in the bag.  
21While this was happening, Barton was moving about the club with the rifle raised to his shoulder threatening patrons with it.  One patron, Richard McGuigan, approached the respondent and said, ""I know you, I recognise you.  What the bloody hell are you doing this shit for?  Wake up to your bloody self"".  The respondent replied, ""Fuck off, idiot"".
22Barton approached Mr McGuigan and whilst pointing the rifle at his head said, ""Get back, cunt"".  Both the robbers began to leave the club.  Mr McGuigan began to follow them and in the foyer the respondent said to Barton, ""Put one in him"".  Barton lifted the rifle to his shoulder and from a distance of approximately 4 metres fired at Mr McGuigan, hitting him in the abdomen. 
23Both men departed from the club with the respondent carrying the bag that contained $5,236.  Dylan Williams drove them to Jesmond where they were seen to abandon the stolen car and enter a silver BMW which was driven to the respondent's home.
24Mr McGuigan was taken by ambulance to John Hunter Hospital in a critical condition.  He underwent multiple surgical procedures over many weeks.  
Convicted of both offences after trialIndicative sentences:  7 years (Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon) and 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years (Shoot with intent to murder)
Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon - Newcastle Permanent Building Society, New Lambton on 15 July 2011 (s 97(2) - maximum penalty 25 years)Form 1:  Possess proceeds of crime
25A car was stolen at Islington on 13-14 July 2011 by a co-offender, Matthew Hollebone. 
26At about 2.40pm on 15 July 2011 the respondent, Hollebone and another man travelled in the stolen car to the Newcastle Permanent Building Society, New Lambton.  The respondent and the other male entered the Building Society where approximately 10 staff and customers were present.  The respondent wore a hooded jacket and had a cloth tied around his face.  He carried a sawn-off shotgun and a backpack.  The other male was similarly dressed and carried a large-handled sledgehammer.  
27The other male used the sledgehammer repeatedly to hit a security door to the right of the main entrance in an attempt to gain access to a staff/teller area.  The respondent went to the teller windows pointing the sawn-off shotgun at the tellers and shouted, ""Give me the money"". The staff began to put cash on the counter and the respondent moved along putting the cash into his backpack and demanding the tellers to open their time-delay drop safes shouting, ""Hurry up"". An elderly female customer became distressed by what she saw and the respondent said, ""It's all right, love, I won't hurt you.  Just sit down"".  
28A total of $44,620 was taken.
29The men returned to the stolen car.  Hollebone drove them to a nearby location where they transferred to another car and then drove to the respondent's home.  The cash was divided.  
30On 30 July 2011 the respondent's residence was searched pursuant to a lawfully obtained search warrant.  Police found a fully loaded Webley handgun, ammunition and cash.  They also found the sledgehammer that had been used in the robbery.  Inside a punching bag in the garage police located $10,000 in cash in bundles secured by rubber bands in various denominations consistent with the money stolen from the Building Society (the Form 1 offence).
Plea of guilty - 15% discountIndicative sentence:  5 years
The judge's remarks concerning the seriousness of the robbery offences
31The learned sentencing judge made a number of remarks directed to the seriousness of the offences.  He referred to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 but immediately noted that there were a number of features of the present offences that distinguished them from the typical case there described for which it was said that a sentence in the range of 4 to 5 years imprisonment would be appropriate.  Later, his Honour said that each offence was objectively more serious than that typical case.
32Other matters relevant to the seriousness of the robbery offences that the judge noted were:
""The robberies were not sophisticated but clearly planned"".  
There was a joint criminal enterprise such that each participant was responsible for the acts of the other participants.
In each case a motor vehicle was stolen for use as a getaway car.  In the Carrington Post Office robbery there were two stolen number plates used.  In that, and the Criterion Hotel robbery, a second car was procured to be used after the initial getaway car was abandoned.
The robbers wore disguises.
A firearm was used in each robbery.  In the Building Society robbery, a sledgehammer was used as well.  (I note also that in the Water Board robbery the respondent was carrying a screwdriver.)
The amounts of money stolen varied but were significant.
A firearm was pointed directly at an employee in order to gain compliance.  That is, there was actual threatened use of a weapon to vulnerable employees and customers.  His Honour specifically noted the grave fear engendered in the bar attendants at the Criterion Hotel and the Water Board Bowling Club and the tellers at the Building Society.  (I infer that the Post Office clerk in the first robbery would have been in grave fear as well by having had a pistol pointed at his head; as would the patrons at the Criterion Hotel and the Water Board Bowling Club by having the co-offender threatening them with a rifle.)
33The judge accepted that the motivation for the offending was the respondent's drug habit as outlined in a report by Mr Sam Borenstein, psychologist, and in the evidence given by the respondent in the sentence proceedings.  He said that he took this into account in assessing the respondent's capacity to exercise judgment, citing R v Henry at [273](b) principle.  It did not excuse the respondent's behaviour ""but does explain it"". 
The judge's remarks concerning the seriousness of the shoot with intent to murder offence
34In relation to the offence of shoot with intent to murder, the judge held that the respondent was equally liable as the co-offender Barton, noting that it was the respondent who had directed Barton to ""put one in him"".  He had regard to the particularly destructive nature of the type of ammunition used and that the shooting involved ""a grave risk of death"".  He accepted a submission that the respondent's moral culpability was high. 
35The judge also had specific regard to the fact that the shooting was unnecessary to achieve the object of the robbery and that it was gratuitously cruel. 
36His Honour found that this offence was above the mid-range level of seriousness.
Personal circumstances of the respondent
37The respondent was born and raised in Newcastle by parents who were both heroin addicts.  He had little memory of his father who died in 2002 after having been in and out of gaol.  His mother had also been imprisoned.  He was cared for by an aunt during a period in which they were both in gaol at the same time. 
38The judge noted that the respondent had a childhood deprived of parental guidance and suffered emotional neglect.  He was largely left to his own devices from a very early age because of his parents' preoccupation with heroin.  He left school and home at the age of 15.  At about that time he commenced a relationship with his partner and they have a son who, at the time of sentencing, was aged 13.
39The respondent commenced taking drugs at the age of 18, coinciding with his father's death.  He soon progressed to using heroin.  He had some employment from the age of 16 to 18 but none since.  He told Mr Borenstein that he spent upwards of $1000 per day on heroin and that the stolen money was used for that purpose.  He was receiving methadone as well.  Mr Borenstein described the respondent as having lived the ""life script"" he had been given, namely drug addiction and criminal activities to fund it. 
40The judge observed that the respondent ""has an extensive criminal history almost exclusively relating to drug dependency"".  He said that it denied a significant element of leniency that could otherwise have been extended to the respondent and dictated that the sentence to be imposed required an element of personal deterrence.  
41At the age of 20 the respondent committed an offence of supplying a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced in 2007 to 2 years 6 months imprisonment.  
42Five days before the Carrington Post Office robbery he was charged with the possession of ammunition and knives for which he later received a total sentence of 3 months imprisonment.  A month after that robbery he committed offences of break, enter and steal and possess housebreaking implements and received an 8 month sentence.  
43On 11 April 2011 he received a sentence of imprisonment which was suspended upon him entering into a Drug Court program.  He was subject to that program at the time of the second to fourth robberies.  The suspension of that sentence was revoked on 11 October 2011 and he received a term of 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months 14 days with effect from 2 April 2011.
44It appears to be the case that the first offence was committed whilst the respondent was on bail and the other offences were committed when he was the subject of the Drug Court program.  The Crown did not contend below, or in this Court, that these were aggravating features.
45The judge specified that the sentence commence on 21 November 2011 on the basis that he thought that was when the respondent had been in custody solely referrable to the present matter.  He was, in fact, subject to the sentence I have just referred to, the non-parole period of which did not expire until 15 February 2013.  Understandably, the Crown does not complain about this because it was the product of the judge having been misled (no doubt inadvertently) by the senior counsel for the Crown.
46A 15 per cent discount was allowed to acknowledge the utilitarian benefit of the respondent's pleas of guilty in respect of the Carrington Post Office and Newcastle Permanent Building Society robberies. 
47Another matter in the respondent's favour was a finding that he was genuinely remorseful.  He had given evidence in which he had demonstrated empathy for the victims of his offences.
48On the subject of rehabilitation, the judge noted the respondent's stated positive intentions in that respect as well as his conversion to the Islamic faith and the positive changes it had brought.  His Honour said that he was ""prepared to make a very cautious but favourable assessment of his capacity to rehabilitate himself and not reoffend in the future"". 
49The judge made reference to Mr Borenstein's opinion that the respondent's ""life path was largely predetermined, raised in a household where both parents were heroin-dependent"".   It was the psychologist's opinion that the respondent required assistance in order to understand the impact of his history, in particular his poor attachments and difficulties regulating emotion and mood in respect of which he relied almost exclusively upon heroin.  He considered that the respondent required long-term and intensive psychological treatment to learn life skills and strategies to ensure he does not return to the patterns learned early in life that led to heroin addiction.
50His Honour referred to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571.  He accepted that the respondent's moral culpability was less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years had not been marred by having been raised in a household in which both parents were heroin dependent and, for significant periods, incarcerated as a result.  He accepted that this could be characterised as a background of ""profound depravation"" and compromised the respondent's capacity to mature and learn from experience.
Other matters taken into account
51In saying that he was imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the judge expressly referred to the principle of totality:  see, for example, Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1;  168 A Crim R 41 and R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38.  He indicated that the indicative sentences for the two offences committed in the course of the Water Board Bowling Club robbery would be substantially concurrent.  (The Crown Prosecutor had conceded that they could be completely concurrent.)
52His Honour also indicated that apart from the first offence in 2010, the other offences in 2011 were committed ""within a relatively discrete period of time and criminality"".  He expressly took into account a need not to impose a ""crushing sentence"". 
Ground - the aggregate sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate
53The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences for the Water Board Bowling Club and Newcastle Permanent Building Society robberies and for the Shoot with intent to murder offence, whilst not directly the subject of appeal, were inadequate in reflecting the objective gravity of those offences.  It was submitted that this, in part, explains what it asserts is the manifest inadequacy of the aggregate sentence.   The other basis suggested for that conclusion was that there must have been an inadequate accumulation of the indicative sentences. 
54In seeking to make good the submission about the asserted inadequacy of three of the indicative sentences, counsel for the Crown set out various features of the offences; in effect reciting matters the primary judge had specifically mentioned.
55The Court was invited to view the CCTV footage from the Water Board Bowling Club robbery because of ""the Crown's view that you will appreciate even more the serious nature of that offending and the inadequacy of the sentence"".  The members of the Court did so in chambers on the day of the hearing.  I did not glean anything from it about the seriousness or any other aspect of the offence that was not otherwise apparent from the description provided in the statement of agreed facts and the judge's sentencing remarks.  Those offences, including the shooting of Mr McGuigan, were clearly offences of very substantial seriousness.
56Upon the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown contended that the judge was wrong to find that the respondent was genuinely remorseful:  ""anyone can get into the witness box and say 'I'm sorry for what had happened' and Mr Jennar did that"" (T9.17).  The problem with that submission is that the respondent gave evidence of his remorse; it included acceptance of what he had done and an understanding of the harm caused to the victims.  The judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the evidence and was entitled to accept it, particularly when it was not challenged by the Crown Prosecutor.  It ill behoves the Crown to complain now.
57It was submitted orally that the judge should not have relied so much on the report of Mr Borenstein because it was dependent upon what the respondent had told him.  The respondent's evidence specifically included that what he had told the psychologist was the truth.  Again, there was no challenge to that by the Crown. 
58Counsel for the Crown also submitted that the respondent chose the times at which the offences were committed so as to coincide with many people being on the premises: ""they are doing it at these times because of the part of the thrill of robbing when a lot of people are there"" (T7.12).  I take that to be a submission that the offences were more serious because of this.  That the robberies were committed, in part, for a ""thrill"" was not a contention the Crown raised in the District Court and should be disregarded as well. 
59The written submissions for the Crown were critical of the judge for having considered that the offending was impulsive when quite clearly there was planning.  This arose from a misunderstanding by counsel for the Crown of his Honour's reference to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry at [273] (see above at [33]).  The Crown suggested he was referring to (b)(i) in that paragraph, but he was obviously referring to (b)(iii).  Wood CJ at CL stated at [273] in part:
""In my view the relevant principles are as follows:
(a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation;
(b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as:
(i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it; ...;
(iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, eg if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act; ...""
60All his Honour did by this reference was to conclude that the respondent was not motivated principally by greed.  There was no error in this respect.
61In submissions concerned with the second basis for the Crown's contention of manifest inadequacy (inadequate implicit accumulation), it was accepted that no precise analysis is available given that the judge was not required to specify commencement dates for individual sentences: see JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40]. At point 12 within that paragraph I said:
""Even if the indicative sentences are assessed as being excessive, that does not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence is excessive: PD v R at [44],[82]; BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 at [252]-[254].""
62The same can be said about a question of an aggregate sentence being inadequate.  I continued:
""13. A principle focus of determination of a ground alleging manifest inadequacy or excess will be whether the aggregate sentence reflects the totality of the criminality involved: R v Brown, supra, at [37]; R v Rae, supra, at [42]-[46], [62], [69]. This Court is not in a position to analyse issues of concurrence and accumulation in the same way that it can analyse traditional sentencing structures: Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen, supra, at [231]; Martin v R, supra, at [33]-[41].""
63The Crown accepted that there could be (implicit) concurrency of sentences in relation to the Water Board Bowling Club robbery and the shooting of Mr McGuigan.  The Crown was left with little choice about that because of the concession made by senior counsel for the Crown before the primary judge (see above at [51]). 
64The Crown's ultimate submission was that the aggregate sentence failed to reflect the totality of criminality ""having regard to the seriousness and increasingly dangerous nature of the offences"".
65The written submissions concluded with a contention that even if 10 years was an appropriate non-parole period for the shooting offence (which was not conceded), ""then two years non-parole for the remaining offences is unreasonable and plainly unjust"".
Consideration
66The last mentioned of the Crown's submissions may be despatched immediately.  In assessing whether a sentence for multiple offences (whether it be an aggregate sentence or otherwise) is excessive or inadequate, it is quite arbitrary to identify one of the components and then regard the balance as being referrable to all of the other components.  It is as illegitimate as arguing that the indicative sentences for the Water Board Bowling Club robbery offence and the shooting offence add up to more than the aggregate sentence and so the respondent must not have received anything for the three other offences.  Indeed, counsel for the Crown almost conceded the futility of such an approach four paragraphs earlier in her written submissions.
67I have earlier referred to some of the authorities relating to totality and questions of concurrency and accumulation: see, particularly, the summary of principles provided by Hall J in R v XX at [52].   The sentencing judge, as observed earlier, stated that he had regard to such principles.  The question is whether the final result reflects that he correctly applied them.
68I accept that some of the indicative sentences are lenient, particularly by comparison with the R v Henry guideline and the judge's assessment that these offences were objectively more serious than the typical case mentioned there.  Some of them (the latter two in particular) were significantly more serious.
69In the end, it seems to me that this was a difficult exercise of a judge's sentencing discretion.  On the one hand, there were multiple offences of significant seriousness committed by an offender with a poor criminal history who had not been dissuaded from offending by past experiences of imprisonment.  One of the offences involved very serious injuries caused to the respondent's victim.  All of them must have caused significant psychological harm.  
70On the other hand, however, there was found to be genuine remorse and (at last) a demonstration of emerging insight by the respondent into the connection between his drug abuse and serious criminal behaviour.  The judge was right (with respect) to take into account in an understanding way the circumstances of the respondent's upbringing.  No criticism is made by the Crown of his Honour's assessment that this operated to reduce the level of his moral culpability.
71The question is not whether the sentence is lenient; reasonable minds may legitimately vary as to this.  The question is whether the result is unreasonable and plainly unjust.  A sentence of 16 years is a stern measure of criminal punishment but such a measure was called for in all the circumstances.   I am not persuaded that it can be said to be manifestly inadequate.
Conclusion
72I propose the following order:
 Crown appeal dismissed.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765641,R v McLean [2014] NSWDC 248,"Judgment
Introduction
1On 19 March 2012 Mr Laurie Waters left his home at about 11.00 am.  He left behind a friend of his, Mr Brian Nimmo, who was going to spend some time in Mr Waters' unit while the carpets in his own unit were cleaned.  On his way out Mr Waters passed Ms Angela McLean, who is the accused in these proceedings.  She was going into his unit, where Mr Nimmo was.  Mr Waters visited the doctor and did some shopping before returning to his home around 3.00pm.  When he got there he saw that Ms McLean had gone and that Mr Nimmo was lying in two large pools of blood.  He contacted police who came quickly and who then called an ambulance.  Mr Nimmo was taken to hospital where his injuries were treated.  
2From a very early time Mr Nimmo nominated Ms McLean as being the person responsible for his injuries.  That is what he told Mr Waters.  That is what he told the first police officers to arrive on the scene.  He continues to say that Ms McLean was responsible, giving evidence to that effect before me.
3Ms McLean has been charged with two offences in the alternative: recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Brian Nimmo and assaulting Brian Nimmo, thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm.
4She has pleaded not guilty to both charges. It is I who will determine whether she is guilty or not, an election for trial by judge alone having been made by Ms McLean and consented to by the prosecution.
General Matters of Law
5The primary issue in this trial concerns whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nimmo's evidence is reliable when he says that Ms McLean caused his injuries.  An issue of relevance to the first count alone concerns whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nimmo's injuries amount to grievous bodily harm.
6Before I discuss the evidence called in the trial, and the conclusions which I draw from it, I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury were this a trial where a jury decided the guilt or otherwise of the accused.
7I will determine all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in Court and the exhibits which have been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. 
8I have decided this case coldly and unemotionally. Were there a jury I would instruct them to ignore any feelings of sympathy or any other emotion that they might feel in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the two charges she faces. Judges are not immune tfrom feelings of sympathy.  I have recognised those feelings, recognised their effect upon me and then put those feelings to one side. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. 
9The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from the position that she is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that she is guilty.  
10Although there was some dispute as to whether this was a Crown case which relied largely or exclusively on the evidence of a single witness, I am prepared to acknowledge the importance of me examining the evidence of Mr Nimmo with great care, and to be very cautious before I convict the accused, because of the high standard of proof placed upon the Crown.  Mr Nimmo is the only person who is capable of giving direct evidence as to what led to him being injured.  
11It is a significant component of the case for Ms McLean that she could not have caused the injuries because they occurred at a time after she left Mr Waters' home.  Further, she says that it is possible that the injuries to Mr Nimmo were caused by a fall.  She has called evidence on these issues from a forensic pathologist.  I emphasise a number of matters which arise from this circumstance.  
12Firstly, by calling evidence the accused did not assume a burden of proof.  She does not have to prove that she is not guilty.  She does not have to prove that she is innocent.  The burden of proof is firmly on the Crown.
13Secondly, the Crown must do more than simply persuade me that the evidence called by the accused should not be accepted.  Rejection of that evidence is not the same as acceptance of the Crown case.  This is a particularly important matter in this case, as hearing and analysing the medical evidence has occupied a great proportion of trial time.  There may be a subconscious tendency to leap from a conclusion that the injuries could have occurred when Ms McLean was alone in the unit with Mr Nimmo, to a conclusion that that is when they did occur.  I recognise and acknowledge that this is not the proper way of addressing the issues in this trial. I specifically state that I have not done that which I recognise is improper.
14What the Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt, are the ingredients or essentials facts contained in the charges arising from the indictment. The Crown does not need to prove that every word spoken by everyone of its witnesses is true. Nor, to give an obvious example, does the Crown need to prove the precise manner in which Mr Nimmo was injured.  The Crown does not have to prove that the accused struck Mr Nimmo with any specific object, be it a walking stick, or ashtray, or something else.  
15The accused did not give evidence. I have not used that in any way against her.  The accused was entitled to say nothing in Court and make the Crown prove her guilt if it could. The fact that the accused did not give evidence does not effect the fundamental proposition which I must apply - that is that the Crown must prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  So the silence of the accused in Court is not evidence against her. Her election not to give evidence was not an admission made by her. Her decision not to give evidence must not be used by me to fill gaps in the Crown case or make up any deficiencies or defects in the Crown's case that might exist.
A Brief Summary of some of the Evidence
Brian Nimmo
16Mr Nimmo said that at the time he was giving evidence he was 70 years old. He was actually 67 and seemed pleasantly surprised when this was pointed out to him.  He could not remember being admitted to hospital on some earlier occasions, even for injuries which must have been quite painful, such as a fractured sternum.  And he denied drinking more than a sip of alcohol on 19 March 2012 despite a lot of other evidence to the contrary.
17On the other hand there were matters about which Mr Nimmo had a very good recollection.  He recounted what a specialist had told him about benign positional vertigo, that being a condition from which he suffered, and his recounting was described by one of the doctors called by the Crown as a perfect description of the pathology behind that condition.  His manner of giving evidence was impressive.  He had little trouble understanding questions put to him and his answers were responsive.
18He impressed as a man who gave his evidence openly and who had nothing to hide.  He did not shirk from answering some very uncomfortable questions concerning bowel and urinary incontinence.  He displayed no antipathy to Ms McLean.  He made concessions where appropriate.  To me, he was a witness doing his honest best to tell the truth as he saw it.  Of course I immediately recognise that honesty is not the same as reliability.
19Mr Nimmo gave evidence as follows.  He went to the unit of his friend Laurie Waters because the carpet in his own unit was being cleaned.  Mr Waters told him that he had to go out for a medical appointment but that he was welcome to stay there.  Shortly after Mr Waters left, the accused walked in.  He had known her for some years.  
20Mr Nimmo tried to get her to leave but she poured herself a drink.  Eventually she grabbed her bag and left the lounge room where the two of them had been sitting.  Mr Nimmo assumed that she had just gone to the toilet, but, after she had been gone for some time, he got up to have a look where she was.  He found her curled up on Mr Waters' bed.  He nudged her on the shoulder and said that she couldn't sleep there at which she got off the bed and began punching him and kicking him.  He put up his hands to block those punches.  His glasses fell on to the floor and, afraid that they would be trodden on, he bent down to pick them up.  As he was putting his glasses back on he felt a blow to his forehead and that was the last thing he remembered until Mr Waters came home and roused him from unconsciousness. 
21Sometime after his release from hospital he noticed that there was a kink in one of his walking sticks.  Mr Waters suggested that that may have been what the accused hit him with.  Eventually someone mentioned the kink in the walking stick to the officer in charge and a walking stick with an obvious bend in it which belonged to Mr Nimmo was tendered in the trial.  
22Mr Nimmo said that because he was hung over from a lengthy drinking session the day before he only had a sip of alcohol whilst in Mr Waters' unit.  He did say that when he was drinking he would often drink three to four litres of wine.  
23He was cross-examined about his medical history.  Ms Cook, who appears for Ms McLean had the benefit of a summary of that history, at least insofar as it concerned treatment at St Vincent's Hospital.  Mr Nimmo was able to recall some aspects of that history but not others.  In particular he gave evidence that he had broken his leg, shattered his cheek bone and fractured his jaw in separate incidents.  He was intoxicated when those things happened.  He did not agree that he had a history of falling over but did agree that he suffered from positional vertigo which puts him off balance on occasions.  
Laurie Waters
24Mr Waters also gave evidence.  He confirmed the circumstances in which Mr Nimmo was in his apartment and in which the accused arrived there.  He could recall Mr Nimmo drinking a glass of wine before he left to go to the doctor.  When he got back he saw Mr Nimmo lying on the floor of his bedroom in a semi-conscious state.  There were two ""massive"" puddles of blood, one at his head and shoulders and one at his legs and feet.  He asked Mr Nimmo ""what happened?"" and Mr Nimmo told him ""Andrea bashed me"" before falling into unconsciousness.  
25He was shown a photograph of his bedroom taken by police after Mr Nimmo had been taken to hospital.  He explained that, being an old paratrooper, he had been trained to make his bed as soon as he got up in the morning.  He would straighten the doona cover and put the pillows one by one on top of each other making sure they were level.  The photograph of the bedroom shown to him revealed a wrinkled doona cover.  Mr Waters said ""I wouldn't leave my bed like that, no way"".  He was not cross examined on this assertion.
Other evidence
26A lot of other evidence, which would usually have required the calling of a number of witnesses, was tendered through the officer in charge.  This was done with the consent of Ms Cook of course.  
27A piece of evidence which became important in a number of respects was a video recording made by the first police officer to arrive at the unit in response to Mr Waters' telephone call.  Commendably, he used his initiative, and his personal iPhone to make a video recording of a brief conversation he had with Mr Nimmo.  
28Other evidence tendered through the officer in charge demonstrated clearly that Mr Waters was absent from the unit from about 11.00 am on the 19th of March 2012 until about 3.00 pm that afternoon.  
29Mr Waters' phone records show that whilst she was in the unit, almost an hour after she arrived, Ms McLean made two telephone calls, one at 11.52 and one at 11.53 am.  The evidence demonstrated that she left the unit shortly before 1.17 pm.   She was shown to have made a purchase at a butcher's shop at 2.14 pm and withdrawn some money from an ATM at 3.01 pm.    
30In her interview with police the accused described her movements after leaving Mr Waters' unit in a way which was consistent with the objectively verifiable evidence.  In particular her claim that after going to the butcher, and on her way back to her own home, she pressed the buzzer of Mr Waters' unit but did not receive a response was confirmed by CCTV footage which revealed this to have taken place at about 2.48 pm.
31It is a significant component of the case for Ms McLean that she could not have caused the injuries to Mr Nimmo because, based largely on the evidence of a forensic pathologist called by her, they occurred at a time after she left Mr Waters' home to go shopping.  She was photographed at a bus stop at 1.17 pm.  That bus stop was about 100 metres from Mr Waters' home and so it is an essential part of the Crown case that the injuries occasioned to Mr Nimmo occurred, at the latest, shortly before 1.17 pm.  Ms McLean suggests that the Crown has not excluded the reasonable possibility that the injuries were caused after she left the unit.
The Medical Evidence
32Dr Dan is a neurosurgeon.  He was called by the Crown, and gave evidence, mainly in response to a number of matters raised in the evidence of an expert called on behalf of the accused, Professor Duflou.  Dr Dan's evidence dealt with the mechanism of Mr Nimmo's injuries and the timing of them.  As far as that latter aspect is concerned he said ""I do not believe it is possible to specify how long he had been unconscious when he was discovered about 3pm"".
33Professor Duflou is a forensic pathologist.  He provided a report, which was tendered on behalf of Ms McLean, and gave oral evidence.  He gave his opinion about a number of relevant issues.
34One immediate observation to be made about Professor Duflou's evidence is this.  He at no stage has suggested that the case mounted against the accused by the Crown was based on a scenario which was impossible.  Certain aspects of that case were described by him as ""most unlikely"" and of course his opinion about such matters, and in particular the level of unlikelihood expressed by Professor Duflou, affects my assessment as to whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
35A significant challenge to the Crown case from Professor Duflou's evidence related to the timing of the injury.  It was his opinion that ""it is most unlikely"" that he sustained his injuries more than two hours prior to being found.  As far at the mechanism of injury is concerned Professor Duflou was of the opinion that the type of fracture which Mr Nimmo suffered to his neck could come from low energy falls (such as when a person fell from a standing position) and he couldn't recall a case of that sort of fracture occurring as a result of a blow to the top of the head.
The timing of the injuries
36The first opinion expressed in Professor Duflou's written report concerned when Mr Nimmo suffered his injuries.  As I have just mentioned this was a significant component of the defence case because an acceptance of Professor Duflou's opinion made it most unlikely that Mr Nimmo suffered his injuries whilst Ms McLean was with him in Mr Waters' unit.  And as I have already noted, Dr Dan disagreed with Professor Duflou, saying that he did not believe it was possible to say how long Mr Nimmo had been unconscious.
37In his written report Professor Duflou regarded three circumstances as particularly important in forming his opinion.  They were:
The two pools of blood indicated that Mr Nimmo's scalp wound was still bleeding when he was moved by ambulance officers.
The lack of damage to muscle from lying in a position for a prolonged period of time and
Any period of unconsciousness due to the head injury would have been of short duration.
38I will return to these matters when I discuss his oral evidence.
The Mechanism of Injury
39Professor Duflou was also asked about the mechanism of injuries.  In contrast to the opinion of Dr Dan, referred to below, in his written report Professor Duflou was of the opinion that a Jefferson fracture ""is typically sustained in motor vehicle collisions and falls"".  He said that they are not commonly seen in assaults.  
40The injuries to the scalp, said Professor Duflou, could have been caused by an assault or a fall.  He said that a fracture of the knee cap is typical of a heavy fall onto the knee and described the injuries to Mr Nimmo's left hand as being known as ""Boxer's fractures"" and they are ""often indicative of a force being applied in the form of a punch or similar by the person who has the fracture"".  The injuries to Mr Nimmo's right hand could, according to Professor Duflou ""also be caused by such a mechanism"".
41Thus Professor Duflou concluded in his written report:
""it is my view that the spinal injury and knee injury were probably the result of a fall, the injuries to scalp could be the result of either a fall or a blow to the head, and the injury to the hand suggests a forceful punching or similar type motion by Mr Nimmo"".
The oral evidence of Professor Duflou
42Professor Duflou's oral evidence differed from his written report in a number of respects, especially as regards the timing of the injury.
The absence of ""long lie"" pathology
43In Professor Duflou's report of 24 March 2014 he spent some time addressing the question of when Mr Nimmo was likely to have sustained his injuries.  As I mentioned above he referred to three separate matters, namely the circumstance that the scalp wound was still bleeding when he was moved by ambulance officers, secondly the lack of any evidence of a ""long lie"" at the scene and thirdly that any period of unconsciousness due to the head injury would have been of short duration.  
44Professor Duflou expressed his opinion about timing this way
""in my opinion it is most unlikely that Mr Nimmo sustained his injuries more than two hours prior to being found given the lack of pathology associated with a ""long lie"" and the lack of significant acute brain damage"".  
45In forming this opinion Professor Duflou assumed that Mr Nimmo had been moved by ambulance officers as part of their treatment of him.  It is beyond question that that did not happen.  Professor Duflou had assumed that the two pools of blood showed that Mr Nimmo had been moved by the ambulance officers but the unchallenged evidence of Mr Waters was that when he first came across Mr Nimmo there were two large pools of blood .  This of course occurred well before ambulance officers arrived.  
46In his oral evidence, Professor Duflou accepted that movement ""resets the clock"" as far as the pathology of long lie is concerned and thus one of the strong pillars of his opinion regarding the time of the injuries had to be removed.  Nevertheless Professor Duflou remained of the opinion that it was most unlikely that Mr Nimmo sustained his injuries more than two hours before Mr Waters found him.  
47In maintaining his opinion as to the timing of the injuries despite the falsity of one of his assumptions being demonstrated, Professor Duflou referred to some new factors which, he said, justified the opinion he expressed in his report.
Hypothermia
48So, not mentioned in the written report but referred to in oral evidence is this circumstance which Professor Duflou said indicated something about the timing of the injuries: there was no evidence that Mr Nimmo's body temperature was lower than normal.  Professor Duflou said that those who suffer injuries and are not treated for some time will have a lower body temperature than normal.  He was unable to describe the mechanism for this happening but said that it was something that had been observed.  
49When Professor Duflou was asked why this factor was not mentioned in his original report he said that it was something that had not occurred to him at the time he prepared it.  Thus in those circumstances the Crown was not in a position to ask Dr Dan whether he agreed with the absence of a low body temperature being indicative of when Mr Nimmo sustained his injury, nor, more fundamentally to ask the treating doctor, Dr Sellors, whether Mr Nimmo's body temperature was lower than normal when he arrived at hospital. 
50Two separate extracts from St Vincent's hospital progress notes were tendered, Exhibit 15 and Exhibit D.  As far as I can tell it does not even appear that Mr Nimmo's  temperature was taken.  There is no record of his body temperature despite there being a reference to his respirations, blood pressure, pulse and Glasgow Coma Score.  In these circumstances the foundation for Professor Duflou's assumption that Mr Nimmo was not suffering from a lower than normal body temperature upon arrival at the hospital is unclear.
51I would certainly have been in a position to put more weight on Professor Duflou's opinion regarding the timing of the injuries had one of the important assumptions on which he initially formed that view not been shown to be inaccurate and had his opinion concerning the relevance of hypothermia not been a belated one with an unclear basis for the assumption on which it was based. 
Change in level of confusion
52There is a further matter raised in Professor Duflou's oral evidence which was not the subject of specific mention in his report.  This concerned what Professor Duflou said was a comparison between the signs of confusion displayed by Mr Nimmo on the video taken by the first police officer to arrive and his presentation at hospital.  Coupled with this was Professor Duflou's opinion as to the cause of Mr Nimmo's confusion on that video.
53Professor Duflou said that it looked to him when viewing the video that the cause of Mr Nimmo's confusion at the scene was more likely to be a head injury than intoxication.  He based his opinion on his experience, not necessarily as a forensic pathologist who probably doesn't often chat to the people he is examining, but as a medical practioner who had worked in emergency wards in the past and as a person who had himself suffered a concussion.  
54He said that the change in presentation between Mr Nimmo on the police officer's iPhone video and at hospital indicated that whatever was causing Mr Nimmo's confusion at the scene resolved itself fairly quickly, this being more suggestive of head injury which would resolve much quicker than a person would metabolise alcohol and thus sober up.
55Unfortunately, once again, such opinions were not mentioned, at least specifically, in his initial report and once again I simply do not know what Dr Dan would have said about them.  Nor do I know what Dr Sellors, the treating doctor would have said about the level of Mr Nimmo's confusion at the hospital beyond noting that in one of her statements she refers to it as slight.  
56These matters of course affect the weight that I must give to Professor Duflou's opinions as to the timing of the injury.  I would have given his opinions more weight had these matters, now apparently quite important, been mentioned in his initial report, and based on assumptions which were shown to be accurate.
57Further, I am satisfied that any confusion displayed by Mr Nimmo on the police officer's iPhone video, for reasons I explain immediately below, could well be described as ""slight"".  If this is the case then another basis for Professor Duflou's opinion about the timing of the injuries falls away.  
58Of course the exchange between the police officer and Mr Nimmo is very brief, and I have to ignore his nomination of the accused as being the person responsible for his injuries in assessing what he has got right and wrong, but even so: 
Mr Nimmo gives his name as Brian and spells his surname,He knows that he is in Mr Waters' unit, indeed in his bedroom,He tells the officer, accurately from what else we know, ""Andrea came around here after Laurie left.""  He is able to give Ms McLean's name,He tells the police officer that at one stage Ms McLean was ""sleeping on Laurie's bed"", a matter likely to be accurate given the state of the bed (as to which, see below).
59Certainly he is clearly not functioning normally.  He speaks slowly and takes some time to answer, but everything he says which is independently verifiable turns out to be accurate. 
60Then, given that Professor Duflou relies on an improvement in his mental functioning it is instructive to note that there are matters which suggest problems with his mental functioning at hospital - in particular that he refers to a walking stick as a possible weapon but apparently does not remember this on discharge, and he remembers his pants being pulled down despite his clothes having already been removed from him by ambulance officers.
61Thus a consideration of the appearance of Mr Nimmo on the police officer's iPhone video and a consideration of what evidence there is about Mr Nimmo's mental functioning whilst at hospital leads me to the conclusion that it is entirely possible, if not likely, that there has been no significant change in the level of confusion displayed by Mr Nimmo on the iPhone video and that displayed at the hospital.  
62I trust I will be forgiven for repeating the significance of that finding.  Professor Duflou relied on an asserted improvement in Mr Nimmo's mental functioning as demonstrating that his confusion was more likely to have been caused by a head injury than any intoxication, which in turn demonstrates that the head injury occurred only shortly before the iPhone video was taken.  But I find that there is little or no evidence of any improvement in Mr Nimmo's mental functioning between the iPhone video being taken and Mr Nimmo being assessed at hospital.
63Unlike Professor Duflou I have never been a doctor treating people in an emergency ward.  I fully appreciate that his expertise in such matters is greater than mine, but I do take into account, as I must, that my observations do not match his as regards the level of confusion displayed by Mr Nimmo on the iPhone video. The weight I give to Professor Duflou's opinions, especially as regards the timing of the injuries, is thus affected.
64I suppose I should mention the obvious - the fact that everything Mr Nimmo says on the iPhone video which is independently verifiable turns out to be accurate, also supports the accuracy of the most crucial thing he says, namely that the accused ""bashed into"" him.
Length of unconsciousness due to head injury
65As already mentioned, another circumstance relied on by Professor Duflou in support of his opinion as to the timing of the injuries was that any period of unconsciousness due to the head injury would have been of short duration.  The expert called by the Crown, Dr Dan, agreed with Professor Duflou's assessment.  Both doctors said that the lack of any injury to Mr Nimmo's brain demonstrated that the loss of consciousness from the blow to his head would not account for him lying on the ground for a lengthy period of time.  If that was the only thing that caused Mr Nimmo to fall into unconsciousness then Dr Dan thought that Mr Nimmo would have regained consciousness within three minutes.  
66However Professor Duflou's opinion, at least in his written report, Exhibit A, ignores, or at least does not give sufficient weight to, the effects of alcohol.  When Mr Nimmo's blood was tested at hospital he was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.24%.  Whether this was because he had drunk at Mr Waters' unit or not (I am inclined to think that he did) the fact remains that at the time he received his injury to his head Mr Nimmo was significantly intoxicated and would have remained that way for the entirety of the time he was lying on the floor.  As Dr Dan said ""the alcohol is likely to be the reason for the prolonged loss of consciousness, rather than the head injury"".  
67Dr Dan didn't mean to suggest that the concussive episode played no part in Mr Nimmo remaining unconscious for more than three minutes or so.  As he explained ""the concussive episode involves loss of consciousness but it's very typical that there will be a period of drowsiness, confusion, lack of adequate cerebral functioning"" and it was that which Dr Dan thought was ""the mechanism for the period of loss of consciousness"".
68As I interpret what Dr Dan is there saying, whilst the head injury may not have alone caused a loss of consciousness to extend beyond three minutes, it cannot be said that it played no part in any further effects on Mr Nimmo's mental function.  In his oral evidence Professor Duflou agreed with what Dr Dan said.  
Consideration
69Two primary issues arise for determination.  Firstly has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries from which Mr Nimmo suffered were occasioned by means of an assault and secondly, if the Crown proves the first matter, was it the accused who assaulted Mr Nimmo?
70In breaking up the issues this way I recognise that the defence case is that it doesn't matter whether he was assaulted or suffered the injuries accidentally if whatever happened to him occurred after Ms McLean left the unit.
71In this context, before looking at the two questions posed above, I should discuss one aspect of Ms Cook's submissions upon which she placed considerable reliance.  I will then discuss some other matters which were the subject of discrete submissions by the parties, and return to answer the questions posed above.
The suggestion that Mr Nimmo has changed his clothes during the day
72It is a significant component of the defence case that Mr Nimmo has changed his clothes between when he arrived at Mr Waters' unit and when Mr Waters found him lying on the floor.
73Mr Waters recalled that when Mr Nimmo arrived in the morning, he was wearing shorts, a T shirt and a cap, but did not have his walking stick with him.  The police officer's iPhone video shows that Mr Nimmo was wearing something that looks like a T shirt with a white collared shirt on top and some other sort of garment, perhaps a jacket, over the top of that.  When Mr Nimmo was shown photographs of the clothing lying on the bedroom floor, it having been cut off him by the ambulance officers, he could not remember owning, and did not recognise, at least some of what was depicted.  
74Thus, says Ms Cook, it is the case that sometime during the day Mr Nimmo has changed his clothing.  She says that there is therefore a significant component of the day unaccounted for.  Mr Nimmo has apparently gone somewhere and changed into clothes which were not his.  
75Her submission is that the fact that Mr Nimmo has changed his clothing leaves a large unexplained gap in the course of which anything might have happened which led to Mr Nimmo being found unconscious on Mr Waters' lounge room floor.  
76There are a number of things to say about this submission:  
Firstly Mr Nimmo's failure to recognise the items depicted on the bedroom floor has to be looked at in the context of what those items now look like.  They are not identifiable, or at least easily identifiable, as clothes.  Secondly Mr Nimmo did say that he owned clothes which fitted the description of some of the garments he was shown to be wearing in the iPhone video.  Thirdly Mr Nimmo would apparently have had no reason to change his clothes and denies doing so.  Fourthly, it would not be at all surprising for Mr Waters to be wrong when he said that his friend was wearing shorts and a T shirt when he arrived that morning.  He only saw his friend for a relatively short time before he left to go to the doctors.  What his friend was actually wearing would have been of very little importance to him and thus unlikely to have been imprinted on his memory.  
77That is of course not to say that I have disregarded completely Ms Cook's submission on this issue and the evidence behind it.  It is however to say that I do not give it the weight which Ms Cook says I should give it.
The Crown says the accused has lied
78Shortly after police were notified by Mr Waters, Constable Luke Bishop went to the accused's premises.  As he arrived he saw her opening the front door of her residence to go inside.  She was carrying some shopping.  Constable Bishop asked the accused, ""Andrea have you been to Laurie's place to day?""  The accused replied ""I just went there to see if they wanted some meat.  I rang the bell but no one answered so I left and come home"".  Whilst it may well be true that the accused did go to Mr Waters' unit and ring the bell after she had been to the butcher's, the Crown says that it is significant that her answer leaves out any reference to her having been inside the premises for a number of hours earlier that day.
79The Crown also relies on the fact that Ms McLean told police that she was drinking a glass of wine in Mr Waters' unit for ""maybe 15 minutes"".  The Crown said that this was ""a version drastically reducing the time she says she was present in unit 2A"".
80The Crown submission is that what Ms McLean said in the ERISP and what she said to Constable Bishop amounted to lies which would affect my assessment of the credibility of Ms McLean's denials that she was responsible for the injuries to Mr Nimmo.
81On the other hand Ms Cook says these were not lies at all.  She points out that immediately before Constable Bishop asked ""Andrea have you been to Laurie's place today?"" he had had a short conversation with her ""in ... relation to where she had been that afternoon"" (emphasis added).  Thus, says Ms Cook, Ms McLean may have understood the next question asked of her by Constable Bishop as referring to the afternoon.
82Further, in relation to the contended lie in the ERISP, Ms Cook points out that the question related to how long it took the accused to drink the wine, not how long she was in the unit for, and that she told police elsewhere in the ERISP about her having made two telephone calls from Mr Waters' home phone.  Thus, says Ms Cook, the inference that the Crown wishes me to draw, that Ms McLean's reference to ""15 minutes"" was an attempt to minimise the time she had been in the unit, is not a conclusion that I can safely draw.
83When I consider the submissions of Ms Cook, I do not consider that the Crown has demonstrated that Ms McLean has lied in either respect relied on by the Crown.
Motive 
84Although it is perhaps a small point there is evidence of disharmony between the accused and Mr Nimmo.   When he ran into Ms McLean as he was leaving his unit Mr Waters said to her ""you can go in, but as long as there's no trouble"".  When she arrived at the unit itself Mr Nimmo said to her ""you're not supposed to be here"" and he told her ""look just go home"".  Ms McLean herself had a large number of complaints about Mr Nimmo and his behaviour which she made to police during her electronically recorded interview.  She presented as somewhat voluble and excitable and explained that she ""saw red"" over things Mr Nimmo had said and the lack of gratitude he had shown her for help she had provided to him.  
85This, the Crown says, establishes a motive for Ms McLean to have assaulted Mr Nimmo when he told her to get off Mr Waters' bed.  It is certainly not a major point in the Crown case, or at least not a point to which I give great weight, but I do note that this is not a case where the Crown has no explanation as to why Ms McLean would assault Mr Nimmo.  
The suggestion that Mr Nimmo was going to lie on the bed
86In her interview with police the accused says that ""Brian said he was going to lie down but I don't know if that happened because I left"".  Given Mr Waters' meticulous nature, and given Mr Nimmo's understanding of that aspect of Mr Waters' character, I find it unlikely that Mr Nimmo would have used Mr Waters' bed to lie down, but in any case her suggestion that he would have moved from the sofa on which he was sitting is inconsistent with other things she said about Mr Nimmo, things such as ""he is so drunk he couldn't get up"", ""he was trashed when I got there"", and that he was ""almost incoherent"".  
87Of course it is likely that Nr Nimmo was in fact not as drunk as Ms McLean told police that he was, at least when he arrived because of Mr Waters' evidence that Mr Nimmo was in a good state on arrival being ""happy and friendly"".  I do however remain of the opinion that Mr Waters was unlikely to have told Ms McLean that he was planning to lie down on Mr Water's bed.
88I do not take this into account as a lie told by the accused, but I do take it onto account in determining why the bed showed signs of having been lied upon.
Observations of the accused inconsistent with guilt
89There is no suggestion that after leaving the apartment Ms McLean changed her clothes or washed herself.  No blood was seen on her or her clothing.  There were no marks seen by police officers to indicate that she had been involved in any act of violence.  
90Further, it is on one view inconsistent with Ms McLean's guilt that she would return to the block of units where Mr Waters lived and, by pressing the security buzzer at the front gate, attempt to gain entry.  
91Whilst these matters are clearly in Ms McLean's favour, they have to be looked at in the overall context of all the evidence in this trial.  Although I will obviously take them into account, they are not of such significance that they of themselves would prevent me from making a finding, based on all the evidence in the trial, that she is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  
Has the Crown excluded the reasonable possibility that the injuries were occasioned accidentally.
92I return now to the questions foreshadowed earlier, the first of which concerned whether the Crown has excluded the reasonable possibility that the injuries were occasioned accidentally. Another way of looking at this first question is to consider whether it is reasonably possible that the injuries occasioned to Mr Nimmo happened as a result of an accident such as Mr Nimmo falling over whilst in Mr Waters' unit.  
93Mr Nimmo is a person who has a number of conditions which increase the risk of him falling.  He required a stick for mobility, suffered from positional vertigo and cardiac arrhythmia, and was significantly intoxicated at the time he was in Mr Waters' unit.  Thus it would not be surprising to learn that he fell.  The presence of osteoporosis would increase the risk of bone fractures from a fall.
94On the other hand there is a great deal of medical evidence to suggest that a simple fall would not explain all, or perhaps even most, of the injuries observed when he was treated at St Vincent's Hospital.  Indeed Dr Dan said that he had never seen a pattern of injuries similar to that suffered by Mr Nimmo as a result of a low level fall and Professor Duflou said that he would not accept that the injuries were the result of a simple low level fall.
95I will start with the most serious injury, at least in terms of its possible consequences, from which Mr Nimmo suffered.  That was an unstable fracture of his C1 vertebrae.  It is described as a ""Jefferson fracture"" after Sir Geoffrey Jefferson, an English neurosurgeon. Importantly, this fracture tends to occur when force is applied from above.  The evidence of Dr Noel Dan, a neurosurgeon for about 45 years, was that ""the Jefferson fracture tends to occur most commonly when people have a force applied to the top of the head"".  Dr Dan gave as classic examples of this force, people diving into shallow pools or having falls from a substantial height.  
96He said that a blow to the top of the head from a walking stick or heavy glass ashtray, if forceful enough, could cause a Jefferson fracture, particularly in a person with osteoporosis such as Mr Nimmo.  Such a mechanism of injury was more likely if Mr Nimmo was actually bending down at the time of the blow because the object being swung would have a greater velocity at the time of impact with Mr Nimmo's head.
97Dr Dan was of the opinion that Jefferson fractures were typically sustained in falls but not motor vehicle collisions and are not commonly seen in assaults.  This is important of course because the Crown case is that Mr Nimmo's Jefferson fracture was sustained in an assault and not an accidental fall.  In his evidence Professor Duflou referred to a South Australian study of 30 people who had sustained Jefferson fractures, which revealed that 2/3 of such injuries were sustained in a motor vehicle or motor cycle accident while high-energy falls accounted for 4 of the 30 and low-energy falls such as a fall from a standing position a further 2.
98The major difference between the two doctors on this aspect was their differing opinions as to the prevalence of motor vehicle accidents as a cause of a Jefferson fracture, a matter not of high significance in the present case.
99Professor Dufluo could also not recall a case of a Jefferson fracture from a blow to the top of the head, although he candidly accepted, in a slightly different context, that Dr Dan's 
""bread and butter would include Jefferson fractures.  They do not for me.  I've seen the occasional one and I don't profess specific expertise."" 
On the other hand Professor Duflou, probably quite accurately, claimed greater expertise that Dr Dan in terms of the mechanisms of injury.
100In a situation where Professor Duflou has only seen the ""occasional"" Jefferson fracture, and where presumably most of his experience would have been with people who have died, I prefer Dr Dan's evidence that a blow top the top of the head could cause a Jefferson fracture, particularly in a person with osteoporosis such as Mr Nimmo, and particularly if the person was bending down at the time the blow was delivered.  
101Reference should also be made to the photographs of Mr Waters' unit.  Whilst there are a number of hard objects in it, many of which would presumably be capable of causing a laceration to Mr Nimmo's head if he fell against them, there was no evidence of anything being out of place in Mr Water's unit, and no trail of blood (although I accept that the scalp wound would not necessarily be such that blood would drop onto the floor immediately).  And in any case it is difficult to imagine a mechanism of injury whereby a person would fall in such a way that force was exerted to the top of that person's head leaving no objective signs on the object with which Mr Nimmo would have collided.
102Although Jefferson fractures are not commonly seen in assaults, this may be because of heavy blows from above are not typical of assaults.  Certainly neither expert said that they were never seen in assaults and, in a situation where it is force applied top the top of a person's head which usually causes such a fracture, an assault which involved a blow of that type could well, I am satisfied, lead to the Jefferson fracture suffered by Mr Nimmo.  
103In any case, it is important to look at the entirety of the injuries suffered by Mr Nimmo, not just those to his neck.
104Mr Nimmo was found to suffer from other injuries apart from the Jefferson fracture.  He had a laceration to his head with accompanying haematoma.  This was said to be on the right side parietal scalp region of Mr Nimmo's head.  In addition he had an undisplaced right patella fracture, left fourth and fifth metacarpal fractures, and right second and third metacarpal fractures.  As I have already said, Dr Dan was of the opinion that he had never seen a pattern of injuries similar to that suffered by Mr Nimmo which occurred as a result of a low level fall, and Professor Duflou said that he would not accept that the injuries were the result of a simple low level fall.
105The existence of the injuries to Mr Nimmo's hands and knee have to be considered.  Whilst the medical evidence would suggest the distinct possibility that the injuries to Mr Nimmo's knee and hands occurred as he fell to the floor, both Dr Dan and Professor Duflou say that the injuries to Mr Nimmo's hands are consistent with him holding his hands up to protect his face whilst punches are being thrown at him - a version of events which Mr Nimmo said occurred after he told the accused to get off Mr Waters' bed.  
106And finally the evidence of Mr Nimmo can't be ignored.  Thus far I have concentrated on the medical evidence in assessing whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries which Mr Nimmo suffered were the result of an assault.  But Mr Nimmo's evidence is relevant to this issue as well.  For reasons I note later, I must use caution before I accept his evidence but even after I do that, it is notable that when Mr Waters asked Mr Nimmo what had happened he replied ""Andrea bashed me"".  When the first police officer on the scene made a similar enquiry of Mr Nimmo he told the officer that the accused ""bashed into me"".  Mr Nimmo gave sworn evidence that this is how he received his injuries.  
107Of course I take into account the accused's denial of having caused the injures made to police in her electronically recorded interview as well as her suggestion that Mr Nimmo ""has got the shits and he's had a fall and he's blamed me"".  
108Whilst it is easy to accept that Mr Nimmo is the sort of person who might be prone to falling, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries he suffered on the 19th of March 2012 were not the result of a fall (or even falls) but were the result of an assault.   Particularly important in making this finding are: 
the evidence of Dr Dan that the Jefferson fracture usually occurs as a result of a blow from above.  Dr Dan's evidence that in 45 years of neurosurgery he had never seen the combination of injuries suffered by Mr Nimmo being caused by a low level fall. Professor DuFlou's evidence that a simple single low level fall would not account for all the injuries suffered by Mr Nimmo.The absence from the unit of any damage or disturbance or mark consistent with Mr Nimmo having sustained his scalp injuries by falling.The injuries which Mr Nimmo suffered being well explained by his evidence that he was assaulted.The very fact that Mr Nimmo gave evidence that the last thing he remembered before being roused by Mr Waters was him being assaulted, in particular receiving a blow to his head as he bent down to pick up his glasses, a mechanism of injury that Dr Dan said was entirely possible.
The timing of the injuries
109Dr Dan did not believe it was possible to specify how long Mr Nimmo had been unconscious at the time he was discovered.  This was because he did not believe that the head injury alone was the contributor to the period of loss of consciousness because of the interaction between the blow to the head and the significant level of intoxication.
110Thus there is nothing in Dr Dan's evidence of relevance to the question as to whether Mr Nimmo could or could not have suffered his injury at a time when Ms McLean was with him in Mr Waters' unit.
111I have discussed Professor Duflou's evidence, both written and oral, at length already and so I need only summarise why it is that I am satisfied that it was entirely possible that Mr Nimmo suffered his injuries whilst Ms McLean was still in the unit:
At no stage has Professor Duflou ever suggested that it was impossible that Mr Nimmo was injured at a time period when Ms McLean was still in the unit.One of the significant pillars of Professor Duflou's opinion as originally expressed was shown to be inaccurate.One of the new circumstances relied on by Professor Duflou (a lack of evidence of hypothermia) was not something mentioned in his written report, and hospital notes do not record whether Mr Nimmo was hypothermic or not. Another new circumstance relied on by Professor Duflou (a suggestion of significant improvement in cerebral functioning over a short period of time) was also not mentioned in his written report, and I do not accept Professor Duflou's description of the level of confusion displayed by Mr Nimmo on the video taken of him by the first police officer on the scene.In his oral evidence Professor Duflou did not disagree with Dr Dan's opinion that the cause of Mr Nimmo's unconsciousness was related to both the concussive episode and intoxication.
112I conclude that the medical evidence says very little about when Mr Nimmo was injured.  It is entirely possible that he was injured before Ms McLean left Mr Water's unit.
A circumstantial case is made out
113From my assessment of the medical evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury was not caused accidentally, and that it could have easily occurred at a time when Ms McLean was in the unit.  Given the security arrangements at Mr Water's unit, the lack of any signs of a struggle, and the absence of anything missing from the unit, the circumstantial case against Ms McLean is very strong.  
114The circumstantial evidence is such that even in the absence of Mr Nimmo I would have found the case against the accused proved beyond reasonable doubt.  In my view, even ignoring what Mr Nimmo said about the matter, there is no reasonably possible version of events which does not involve the accused causing Mr Nimmo's injuries.
115I repeat for emphasis, even in the absence of evidence from Mr Nimmo I would have concluded that there is no explanation for the circumstances revealed in the evidence which is consistent with Ms McLean not being responsible for Mr Nimmo's injuries.  
116However this conclusion is bolstered by direct evidence arising from what Mr Nimmo says about how he was injured and the evidence regarding the state of the bed.   It is to those matters that I will now turn. 
Mr Nimmo's mental functioning
117I have already mentioned the need for me to examine the evidence of Mr Nimmo with great care because he is the only witness who has given direct evidence of what led to him being injured.  But there are other aspects of this case which require me to use caution before I accept his evidence.
118Quite clearly there are a number of circumstances regarding Mr Nimmo's evidence which I must examine with care.  His evidence may be unreliable and I should exercise caution before I accept it.  He was significantly intoxicated at the time he first told anyone that the accused was responsible for his injuries.  He had suffered a head injury as well.  
119Memory is a fragile thing and there is a tendency for the human brain to create false memories in order to explain how things have come to be.  The circumstance that Mr Nimmo, whilst intoxicated and having suffered a head injury, nominated the accused as the person responsible for his injuries may therefore be unreliable.  
120I have to consider the possibility that in truth Mr Nimmo had no recollection of how he came to be injured and merely nominated the accused as being responsible as a way of, as Professor Duflou put it, trying ""to 'join the dots' in an attempt to reconstruct what happened"".
121Despite that, and having exercised caution, I still regard Mr Nimmo's nomination of the accused as being the person responsible as evidence which alone would establish the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt.  
122Although he clearly got some things wrong, most notably his claim that he did not drink more than a sip of wine that day, Mr Nimmo's evidence matches a number of independently verifiable circumstances: he said that the accused arrived shortly after Mr Waters left and that is what Mr Waters said too, he said that he was assaulted in the bedroom and that is where he was found; he said that his glasses fell on the floor and that is where they were found; he said he felt a blow to his forehead and a diagram from hospital shows a laceration extending to the front part of his scalp; he remembers two periods of unconsciousness and that is consistent with the two pools of blood; he remembers Mr Waters rousing him and that is what Mr Waters said too; and he says that what prompted the attack upon him was him telling Ms McLean to get off Mr Waters' bed and the bed showed signs of someone having been on it (I address this matter below),
123Also noteworthy is that Mr Nimmo's evidence is entirely consistent with what he told Mr Waters, and then the police, when he was found lying on the bedroom floor.  As I said earlier: the fact that everything he says on the iPhone video which can be independently verified turns out to be accurate, also supports the accuracy of the most crucial thing he says, namely that the accused ""bashed into"" him.
The state of the bed
124As I have said before, Mr Waters was described as a person who was meticulous about the state of his home unit.  He readily accepted that description.  He was shown photographs of the state of his bed after he returned home from the doctor's and was able to say that the bed was not in the same state it was when he left in the morning to go to the doctor's.  
125Even without that evidence I would have concluded that the photographs of the bed showed that someone has been sitting or lying on it after it was made.  That is important because of Mr Nimmo's evidence that he found the accused curled up on Mr Waters' bed, this in turn leading to the argument which ended up with Ms McLean throwing punches at him and ultimately hitting him on the head with something.  
Conclusion regarding whether the accused struck Mr Nimmo
126The Crown case has two strands - a circumstantial case which I have found to be made out, and direct evidence from Mr Nimmo that the person responsible for his injuries was the accused, which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt is reliable.
127I therefore find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused all of Mr Nimmo's injuries by striking him, probably with an object, which in turn caused him to fall to the floor.
Did the injuries amount to grievous bodily harm
128In order to prove count one the Crown has to prove, amongst other matters, that Mr Nimmo suffered grievous bodily harm.  I have earlier described the injuries he suffered but I need to say a bit more about them in order to determine this issue.
129Although Mr Nimmo was unconscious for a considerable period of time the evidence was that the period of unconsciousness due to being struck was likely to have only been a few minutes at most.  
130He suffered a significant loss of blood.  
131The fracture to Mr Nimmo's C1 vertebrae was unstable.  Although there was  a risk that his spinal cord could be damaged and if it was, being at such a high level, death or quadriplegia would likely result, I have ignored this risk for the purposes of the resolving the issue with which I am now dealing.  This particular injury required that Mr Nimmo wear a cervical collar for six weeks.  
132The injuries to his hands were treated by the application of what were described as thermoplastic splints for four weeks.  One of the photographs in exhibit nine, taken whilst Mr Nimmo was at a rehabilitation hospital shows the nature of those splints.  133Mr Nimmo's knee injury was treated by him being placed in a ""zimmer splint"" for six weeks.  Dr Sellors said that a zimmer splint is ""a fabric splint that's rigid to prevent movement of the knee"". That same photograph from exhibit nine shows Mr Nimmo wearing the zimmer splint.  
134The laceration to Mr Nimmo's scalp required suturing and in addition he received a tetanus booster, morphine, a dose of antibiotics and intravenous fluids.  
135Minds may differ as to whether any particular injury or injuries amount to really serious bodily injury (see R v Haoui [2008] NSWCCA 209 where two judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a fracture of a cheek bone which required surgery and a short period of recuperation could amount to really serious injury but the third held that it could not).  
136It may be that no one injury that Mr Nimmo suffered would be capable of satisfying the description of ""really serious injury"" but in combination I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they did.  Mr Nimmo suffered a laceration of such significance that a considerable amount of blood was lost.  He suffered a fracture of one of his vertebrae which required that he wear a cervical collar for six weeks, he suffered fractures to both of his hands which required that he wear splints on them for four weeks and he suffered an injury to his right knee that required he wear a splint for six weeks.  In combination I am satisfied that those injuries are really serious and amount to grievous bodily harm.
The Elements of Count 1
137Having made those findings let me turn to the elements of Count 1.
138The Crown must satisfy me reasonable doubt of each of the following matters:
(1)The accused struck Mr Nimmo.
(2)This caused grievous bodily harm
(3)The accused either:
Intended to cause him actual bodily harm, orRealised the possibility that her actions would cause him actual bodily harm, but went ahead anyway.
139What I have said so far demonstrates that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused struck Mr Nimmo and that this caused him injuries which satisfy the description of grievous bodily harm.
140As far as the third element is concerned, the nature of the force required to injure Mr Nimmo, and his description of the attack upon him by the accused amply demonstrate in my view that, at the very least, when Ms McLean struck Mr Nimmo she realised the possibility that her actions would cause him actual bodily harm, but went ahead anyway.
Verdict
141It follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of Count 1 and I find the accused guilty on that count.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765650,White v R [2014] NSWCCA 329,"Judgment
1HIDDEN J:  The applicant, Jamie Hoby White, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, on an ongoing basis, an offence under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.  The proceedings in this court began as an application for leave to appeal against sentence.  However, at the hearing of the matter leave was sought to appeal against the conviction.  A summary of the facts will explain why that application was made.  
Facts
2There was an agreed statement of facts, disclosing that in June 2013 two undercover operatives were investigating the supply of methylamphetamine in the Telopea area.  On 5 June, one of those operatives telephoned a friend of the applicant, Ms Kristy Alderton, to enquire whether she knew anyone who could sell him some of the drug.  Ms Alderton put him in touch with the applicant.  They met, and the officer supplied the applicant with $150 to purchase a quantity of the drug.  Put shortly, the applicant purchased the drug from a supplier recently known to him, Rabee El Samad, using that money, met with the officer and handed the drug to him.  Upon analysis, there was found to be .25 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 82.5%.  
3Later the same day, another undercover officer met with the applicant.  Again put shortly, the officer supplied the applicant with $100, the applicant used it to purchase some of the drug from Mr El Samad, and gave it to the officer.  On this occasion there was .05 grams of methylamphetamine.  
4On 27 June, that second officer initiated a similar transaction.  On this occasion he gave the applicant $150 and the applicant used it to buy more of the drug from Mr El Samad, which he passed on to the officer.  This proved to be .16 of a gram of methylamphetamine with a purity of 83%.
5The applicant was arrested on 19 July 2013.  In an electronically recorded interview he declined to comment about the allegations.  
6This is the effect of the agreed facts.  In the sentence proceedings two handwritten letters by the applicant were tendered, and he gave evidence.  From this material it emerged that on the second occasion on 5 June, when the applicant bought $100 worth of the drug for the undercover operative, he also purchased some for himself.  More importantly, on 27 June he and Ms Alderton decided to ""pool"" the undercover operative's money with some of theirs to obtain some of the drug for themselves.  He obtained $100 worth of the drug for their use by paying $50 and being allowed credit for the balance.  
7In his examination-in-chief by the solicitor then appearing for him, the applicant gave this evidence:
""Q.  What benefit, if any, did you get out of what you were doing?A.  Well none the first two times and on the third time I ended up, yeah, pooling his money with me own and being able to afford to get a little bit more than, you know.
Q.  So the first two times you simply took his money and used that money to get the drugs to give to him?A.  Yes.
Q.  And you made nothing from it yourself?A.  No I didn't make nothing from it.  I thought I was doing a friend a courtesy, a favour you know.  She asked me if I would.
Q.  And the last time the benefit that you received was the ability to pool his money with yours?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Do I take it from that, that that meant that you were able to buy a greater quantity because it becomes cheaper as the quantity increases?A.  Yes.
Q.  Are you able to say by how much?A.  Yeah, I just got a 100 for meself, I had $50 in, so yeah, I ended up getting the other 50 on ticker, as they call it, on credit, which I had to pay them money.
HIS HONOUR
Q.  So you went to purchase what, how much did you have in your pocket when you went to purchase the drugs?A.  I had $50 in my pocket.
Q.  And you had a $150 from the undercover operative?A.  Yes.
Q.  And with the $200 you got some sort of a discount for buying in bulk, is that right?A.  No, actually I just - I got his and I have him my $50 with a promise to owe him $50.
[SOLICITOR]
Q.  So in fact the only benefit you got from it was being able to buy drugs on credit?A.  Yes.
The applicant was not cross-examined about this issue.  
8In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge described briefly the two transactions of 5 June and the third of 27 June.  Speaking of that third occasion, his Honour said:
""On this occasion and on this occasion only, the offender obtained some benefit albeit of a notional kind, in that he added his own $50 to the sum he had been given in order that he might be able to purchase drugs on credit.""
His Honour continued:
""Otherwise it may be fairly said and characterised as a series of transactions in which although whilst a supply at law, the real role of the offender was to be a conduit between the putative purchaser and the supplier.""
9The appeal against conviction is out of time.  The ground sought to be argued is as follows:
""There has been a miscarriage of justice in that there is no evidence that on each of the three occasions the appellant supplied methylamphetamine he received a 'financial or material reward'.""
The issue was argued on its merits and, as I am satisfied that the ground is established, I would grant the necessary extension of time.
10Counsel for the applicant in this court, Mr Bruce SC, referred to the terms of s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and the decision of this court in Regina v Jackson [2004] NSWCCA 110.  
11Section 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act provides:
25A  Offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis
(1)  Offence provisionA person who, on 3 or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days, supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence.
Maximum penalty: 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both.
12In Jackson the appellant had pleaded guilty to a charge of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine, but this court allowed him to go behind that plea, quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial.  The leading judgment was given by Sully J, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed.
13This also was a case arising from an undercover officer's investigation of the supply of drugs in a particular region.  The two statements of that officer were in evidence.  It appears that an electronic interview with the appellant was also in evidence, but it added nothing to the issue which the court was called upon to decide: at [18].  Sully J summarised the statements of the undercover officer at [7]-[16].  
14There were four transactions in which methylamphetamine was supplied over two days.  In the first of them the appellant himself supplied the drug to the officer for money, clearly obtaining a financial reward within the meaning of s 25A.  On the second and third occasions the appellant supplied the drug to an accomplice, in the presence of the undercover officer.  The accomplice gave him the money, he purchased the drug from a supplier, and gave it to the accomplice.  The fourth transaction appears to have been between the accomplice and the undercover officer, and the officer's statement contained no admissible evidence of the appellant's involvement in it.  
15Sully J held that for the offence under s 25A to be established, the appellant must have supplied a prohibited drug on at least three separate occasions for financial or material reward to himself.  His Honour concluded that it was only on the first occasion that the appellant received such a reward.  At [28] he rejected a Crown submission that provided it was ""clear that the supplies are commercial supplies, it does not matter how any financial or material reward which represents the valuable consideration for such a crime was actually received, or by whom it is ultimately received.""  His Honour saw the terms of the section as unambiguous but, in any event, referred to a passage from the relevant second reading speech introducing s 25A of the Act:
""The new offence plugs a potential loop-hole under the existing law. It targets dealers who have organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.Presently, it could be argued that dealers who carry small quantities of prohibited drugs can avoid serious penalties under the Act as the penalty structure is largely based on quantity. The amount of drugs which are supplied is immaterial to an offence under section 25A, either within each individual offence or in total. Furthermore, the offence is constituted by the supply of any prohibited drug - other than cannabis - within a 30-day period. In other words, it is immaterial whether the same drug is supplied on the three separate occasions. Once again, the provision is framed in a way which will prevent dealers from evading the ambit of the provision on technical grounds. The other elements of the new offence - including the element of 'for financial or material reward' - will need to be proven in the usual way; that is, proven beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.The Bill ...... provides a new weapon in the armoury of police against those who persistently engage in the commercial supply of hard drugs, without restrictive emphasis upon the quantity supplied on each occasion. It steps up the campaign against dealers where it matters - on the streets - and facilitates the apprehension, arrest and incarceration of such dealers."" [Legislative Assembly of NSW: Hansard: 7 May 1998 at 4689, 4690]
16His Honour continued at [33]:
""It seems to me that a fair reading of that material suggests clearly that at every stage of the legislative consideration of the proposed new section the intended target was not commercial drug dealing as an abstract generality, but rather the individual who was making a profit out of indulging, to the prescribed statutory extent, in specifically identified and demonstrated instances of commercial drug supply. It seems to me that if that view is correct, then it must follow that the reference in section 25A to ""financial or material reward"" is to be understood as referring to a financial or material reward to the person who is shown to have carried out the three or more supplies as defined in the section.""
17In determining that the appellant should be allowed to go behind his plea of guilty, and the conviction based upon it, his Honour said at [25]:
""The foundational jurisdiction and powers of this Court are in their entirety statutory, deriving from the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). It is the positive duty of the Court, pursuant to section 6(1) of that Act, to set aside a conviction if the Court is of the opinion ""......that on any ......ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice"". It seems to me that if an appellant can demonstrate that he stands convicted of an offence of which, as a matter of law, he cannot properly be convicted, then it must follow that there has been a miscarriage of justice in proceeding to that conviction. I think that such an approach is supported by the reasoning in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120: see per Kirby P, (Grove and Newman JJ concurring), at 121, 122; and Caruso (1988) 37 A Crim R 1: per Von Doussa J at 26.""
18The judgment does not reveal whether there was any evidence before the court to explain how the plea of guilty came to be entered.  Sully J observed at [28], ""It is to be noted that no consideration was given in the Court below to this important question: not by the Crown, not by the solicitors assigned to represent the appellant, and not by the appellant himself.""  Whether that observation was based upon evidence which the court received, or was an inference drawn from the record of the proceedings in the District Court, is not clear.  
19In the present case an affidavit of Ms Catherine Ridge, a solicitor employed by Legal Aid NSW, was read.  Ms Ridge had not appeared in the District Court.  The affidavit does no more than annexe the written instructions provided by the applicant to his solicitor in the District Court to enter the plea of guilty.  Those instructions recite that another Legal Aid solicitor had explained to him the elements of the offence - ""that is - I supplied a prohibited drug on three separate occasions within a period of 30 days.""  They added that he did not dispute ""the fact that I supplied the undercover officer with small quantities of methylamphetamine in exchange for $150 on three occasions in June 2013.""  Attached to the instructions was a copy of the agreed facts, which he acknowledged as ""a true and accurate summary.""  Those facts, of course, disclose no more than that the applicant acted as a conduit between the undercover officer and his supplier.
20Those facts alone could not establish the offence in question, for the reasons given by Sully J in Jackson.  The focus of the argument in this court was whether the additional evidence to which I have referred establishes a material benefit to the applicant within the meaning of the section.  In my view, it does not.  It establishes no more than that the transaction on the third occasion might have earned him the benefit of the supply of some drug for his own use on credit.  That, I accept, could be a relevant material benefit.  However, it does not appear to me that the first and second transactions earned him any benefit, financial or material.  
21The Crown prosecutor in this court submitted that, if the matter had gone to trial, it would have been open to the jury to find that the three transactions together established the applicant's rapport with the supplier such that he was able to obtain some of the drug on credit in the course of the third of them.  In that event, it was argued, there was a material benefit arising from each transaction.  Whether the agreed statement of facts summarises the whole of the evidence available to the Crown I cannot say.  It may be that evidence at a trial could have given rise to that inference.  However, it cannot be said that the plea of guilty was entered on that basis and the matter was not approached in that way in the District Court.  Nor is it a conclusion necessarily available from the limited material which was before the sentencing judge.
22The applicant himself has provided no evidence to this court of what he understood was the factual basis of his plea of guilty, particularly with reference to the issue now raised.  However, it seems clear enough that he pleaded guilty simply on the basis that on three occasions he had supplied the prohibited drug within the broad definition of the word ""supply"" in s 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (or had been knowingly concerned in such a supply).  The written instructions convey that the question of financial material reward was not addressed.  Indeed, it appears to me that, as Sully J observed in Jackson at [28], neither party gave consideration to the need to establish such a reward on the occasion of each supply.
23I am mindful of the judgment of Kirby P in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120, in which his Honour said at 122:
""For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection.  This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all of the relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence ... .""
Nevertheless, in Liberti it was found that a plea of guilty had been entered under a misapprehension as to the relevant law and the conviction was set aside.  I am satisfied that the same is true in the present case, that there has been a miscarriage of justice and that, accordingly, it is the court's duty to set aside the conviction.
24The question then arises whether a new trial should be ordered.  Mr Bruce argued that the court should exercise its discretion not to do so because the applicant has served the lion's share of the non-parole period imposed upon him.  The sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months was directed to commence on 19 July 2013, and that non-parole period expires on 19 January 2015, a month from today.  That the court has a discretion to enter a verdict of acquittal for that reason is not in doubt.  However, there are countervailing considerations which lead me to the conclusion that a new trial should be ordered.
25Plainly enough, the material before the sentencing judge is capable of establishing admissions by the applicant of involvement in the supply of methylamphetamine on three occasions.  By s 25A(4) of the Act, a jury in a trial for ongoing supply of a prohibited drug may bring in an alternative verdict of guilty of a supply offence in respect of any of the occasions relied upon for the offence charged.  These considerations were relevant to the court's decision in Jackson to order a new trial: per Sully J at [38]-[40].  It may be that the applicant would be deserving of no further punishment if he were convicted at a new trial of the offence charged or any alternative offence, and the Director of Public Prosecutions may elect to proceed no further for that reason.  That, however, is a matter properly left for the decision of the Director: Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45, 210 CLR 285, per Gaudron J at [23] (297).
26I would grant leave to appeal against conviction, allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.
27PRICE J:  I agree with Hidden J.
28SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hidden J.

		23 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765651,R v Li [2014] NSWCCA 327,"Judgment
1FULLERTON J:  On 12 June 2014, the respondent was sentenced in the District Court after pleading guilty to one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 24.9782 kilograms of methylamphetamine, being not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug (""the supply count"") contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.
2He was also sentenced on a further count of conspiring with an unknown person to supply a prohibited drug, also methylamphetamine, in an amount of 5 kilograms, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug (""the conspiracy count"") contrary to s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The sentencing judge mistakenly assumed that the conspiracy count also attracted a standard non-parole period of 15 years (R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; 221 A Crim R 63 at [38]).  Since the respondent does not bring the appeal, this error may be ignored. 
3Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act provides that a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 1 kilogram.
4A charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""the proceeds offence""), was placed on a Form 1 to be taken into account in the sentence imposed on the supply count.  The proceeds offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. 
5After allowing for a 15 per cent discount for the plea of guilty (entered after the trial judge indicated his intention to admit the respondent's record of interview into evidence at his trial), and after taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the respondent was sentenced on the supply count to a term of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  A wholly concurrent term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years was imposed on the conspiracy count. 
6The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals the sentences imposed pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
7Two grounds of appeal are relied upon.(1)The sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate.
(2)The non-parole periods set are manifestly inadequate.
The facts
8The Crown tendered an agreed set of facts with regard to both counts which appears to have been based exclusively on the respondent's record of interview (or some parts of it) and police surveillance.  The record of interview was not tendered.
9The following facts are derived from the agreed facts, including the further facts found by his Honour for sentencing purposes by inference from the agreed facts.
10The respondent is a Hong Kong national.  He was recruited in Hong Kong to come to Australia to work for a criminal organisation.  His role was to travel to Sydney where he was to await instructions from his ""controller"" in Hong Kong via a mobile phone that he was to purchase in Australia with money supplied to him for that purpose. 
11He told the interviewing police that his role was to collect prohibited drugs and deliver them on behalf of the criminal organisation.  However, the sentencing judge found that the respondent did not know that he was to supply prohibited drugs (or their quantity or type) until some time after his arrival in Sydney.  It is unclear from the facts or his Honour's findings what the respondent understood to be the role he was to perform in Australia when he left Hong Kong or what criminal activity he believed he was to carry out. 
12The respondent was to be paid HK$80,000 a month (approximately AU$11,400) for his work.  The sentencing judge found that this was to be the limit of his financial gain.
13Upon the respondent's arrival in Sydney on 13 October 2012, police commenced an investigation into his activities.
14On 14 October 2012, he purchased an iPhone. 
15On 18 October 2012, he purchased a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone. 
16On 19 October 2012, he leased a residential unit in Arncliffe in his own name. 
17On 25 October 2012, he hired a car and travelled to Sydney International Airport where he collected the vehicle.
18On 26 October 2012, he drove the hire car from the Arncliffe apartment to Ikea on the Princes Highway at Tempe where he met with an unknown male in the carpark who was driving a blue Ford Falcon.  The man handed the respondent a Honda car key.  (There was nothing in the agreed facts to explain the significance of the key.) 
19The respondent told police that he had received a phone call on 26 October 2012 from his controller in China, who told him to drive to the Bondi area and collect 5 kilograms of what was referred to in the facts as an ""unknown prohibited drug"" to supply to ""an unknown male"".  He agreed and was told to wait for further instructions.  He told police that he drove to Bondi when he received another phone call from his controller who told him to leave Bondi because the man in the blue Ford was ""missing"".  The controller told him to go to an address in Wolli Creek to look for the man.  The respondent told police that he drove to the address specified by his controller and he looked for the man but could not find him.  This conduct formed the basis of the conspiracy count.
20On 29 October 2012, the respondent checked into the Ibis Hotel in Darling Harbour with his luggage. 
21On 30 October 2012, he checked out of the hotel and travelled to Haymarket where he parked in a public carpark.  He then attended a Westpac Bank and deposited $200,000 into a bank account in his name.  The facts do not reveal whether the account had been opened prior to this date or the information the respondent supplied to the bank in opening the account as a foreign national.  The facts reveal nothing as to the source of the funds deposited.  The respondent then attended a Western Union agency and remitted $13,000 to Hong Kong.  The facts are silent as to the identity of the recipient of the funds. The respondent then attended another Westpac Bank and deposited $225,000 into two separate bank accounts, also in his name.  Again, the facts reveal nothing as to the source of those funds or the circumstances in which the accounts were opened.  
22Later that night, the respondent travelled to Sydney International Airport where he was arrested.  Upon being searched, police located $7,295 in Australian currency in his possession.  The sentencing judge was satisfied that, by that time, the respondent was carrying through a decision to withdraw from any further involvement in the criminal syndicate after having learned of the quantities of drugs he was to supply. 
23The facts are silent as to how police came to learn the respondent was en route to the airport. 
24A search warrant was executed over the apartment in Arncliffe.  Police located the following items in a wardrobe:
(1)a blue hand held cooler bag containing six snap-lock bags containing approximately 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine in each bag; 
(2)a medium sized grey suitcase containing nine snap-lock bags containing approximately 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine in each bag; and
(3)a black and white patterned suitcase containing ten snap-lock bags containing approximately 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine in each bag.
25The combined weight of the methylamphetamine was 24.97282 kilograms, with an estimated street value of $5,000,000.  These drugs are the subject of the supply count.  There is no evidence as to the purity of the drugs seized. 
26The respondent was interviewed by police.  He made what the sentencing judge described as ""full and frank admissions in relation to his role in ... the supply of drugs"".  The basis upon which his Honour made that finding is unclear since the record of interview was not tendered. 
27What the agreed facts do reveal is that, in the course of the interview, and at the request of the police, the respondent drew a diagram representing the structure of the drug syndicate into which he told police he had been recruited.  The sketch was annexed to the statement of facts.  It showed four tiers.  ""Big Boss"" was at the apex, ""Boss"" was beneath him with the ""Controller"" beneath the Boss and ""Us"" beneath the Controller.  He told the police he did not know the identity of the people in the organisation.  He said that he only ever communicated with them by telephone and that the only person he met associated with the criminal syndicate in Australia was the man at the Ikea carpark.
28In relation to ""the cash"" the subject of the proceeds offence (again, the word used in the statement of facts), the respondent told police he won it playing poker in an illegal gaming house.  He did not to provide any further information.
29The respondent's bank accounts were frozen. 
30In the statement of facts, the respondent's role in the enterprise was said to be confined to the delivering of drugs in accordance with instructions that he was given by mobile phone from his controller in Hong Kong and that this was equivalent to that of a ""mule"" or ""courier"". 
31The Crown also tendered the respondent's criminal history and a pre-sentence sentence report.  Certain passages in the pre-sentence report, where the respondent sought to innocently account for the money the subject of the proceeds count and where he suggested that the 25 kilograms of methamphetamine the subject of the supply count were not his and must have been placed in the apartment by someone else after he left, were expressly disavowed by senior counsel who appeared for the respondent on sentence.  The Crown did not seek to rely upon this material as reflecting an absence of contrition or as qualifying the submissions by the respondent's counsel that he was fully co-operative with investigating police. 
32There was no evidence from either the Crown or the respondent as to when, or in what circumstances, the drugs were stored in the apartment; whether the respondent was found with a key to the apartment on his arrest; or how the fact of drugs being left in what may be assumed to be a locked apartment squared with the respondent's claim that he was voluntarily withdrawing from the criminal organisation and en route to the airport when he was arrested.  The basis upon which the search warrant was obtained by police to enable a search of the apartment was not revealed.
The respondent's subjective circumstances
33The respondent did not give evidence on sentence. He relied upon a character reference from his mother and a report from the Manager of Industries at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre attesting to the fact that he is employed in the laundry. 
34The following is drawn from the available documentary material.
35The respondent was 32 at the time of offence.  He has no prior convictions.  He is the eldest of four children.  He is married and has two young children.  The sentencing judge found that he was the ""bread winner in the family"".  His mother and grandmother reside in Hong Kong. 
36He was educated in a boarding school in England.  He attempted a business and computer degree which he did not complete.  In 2004, he returned to Hong Kong and worked in an office environment.
37In 2006, he commenced his own business with an associate.  The sentencing judge found that the business appeared to be doing well until the associate began stealing funds, which resulted in the business folding in about 2009.  He subsequently worked for his parents.
38Several years prior to the offences, he had established a small trading company.  That business has since ceased trading as a result of his incarceration. 
39He has been employed in the laundry of the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre since 26 November 2012.  The pre-sentence report read: 
""... Correctional Centre staff members have nothing but praise for [the respondent], describing him as someone who is proactive, trustworthy, polite, reliable, works with minimal supervision, is helpful to fellow inmates and staff members and staff utilise him as an informal interpreter in the correctional centre.""
40The sentencing judge found that the respondent evinced ""some contrition"" which manifested in the interview with the police, his guilty plea and the letter from his mother.  His Honour concluded:
""In my view, [the respondent], who I am told has a previous unblemished character, and a person who has made good use of his time in prison and with his close family support, I am of the view that [the respondent] has excellent prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend.""
The sentencing judge's reasoning 
41The sentencing judge described the supply of illegal drugs in commercial quantities as objectively seriousness and that, while the quantity of the drug supplied is not a determining factor, it remains a factor of significance in that assessment.  He considered the quantity of drugs the subject of the supply count in the indictment as ""high"", being 25 times the large commercial quantity on the conspiracy count and 5 times the large commercial quantity.  He also acknowledged that, in assessing the objective seriousness of drug supply offences generally, the potential for harm generated from that conduct, both directly by the proliferation of illicit drugs in the community and indirectly by the criminal culture that it engenders, should be taken into account in the imposition of sentence.
42In determining whether the offences were part of planned or organised activity (an aggravating factor under s 21A(1)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and a factor which the Crown submitted was established on the evidence), the sentencing judge said:
""So far as this offender is concerned, although the planning may have involved him leasing premises in his own name and obtaining a motor vehicle, in my view I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning so far as the offender is concerned exceeded what one might normally expect in relation to offences of this kind."" [Emphasis added]
43This finding appears to be in conflict with a related finding where his Honour was satisfied that the respondent came to Australia knowing that he was to work for a criminal organisation into which he was recruited in Hong Kong, despite the fact that he went on to say:
""... I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when [the respondent] came to Australia he knew that his involvement would be in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs.  It seems likely to me that he found that out some time after his arrival in Sydney.  
He told the police that the fact that drugs were involved made him quite fearful and he told the police that he decided he was not going to work for the syndicate any more and he was returning to Hong Kong when he was arrested at the airport.""
44The Crown also submitted that the offending was aggravated by the respondent's financial motivations, being prepared to accept a monthly salary on his recruitment.  His Honour said:
""[The respondent's] involvement in these offences is difficult to understand.  His involvement was for only, in my view, a modest reward, where he was to be paid HK$80,000 or AU$11,400 a month.  Bearing in mind the value of the drugs, that was a very small reward.
I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that [the respondent] was to or expected to receive any other money other than the amount of HK$80,000 or AU$11,400 a month.""
45In assessing the weight to be afforded to the respondent's claim to have voluntarily withdrawn from the criminal organisation which recruited him, a finding which the sentencing judge was satisfied should be made in the respondent's favour and which he regarded as of significant weight, his Honour said:
""On the material before me it is clear, in my view, that [the respondent] voluntarily ceased being involved in the offending in the sense that on 30 October or probably on 29 October he left the material in the unit and on 30 October he was planning to leave Australia when he was in fact arrested at the airport.""
46In determining the sentence to be imposed on the supply count and after taking into account the proceeds offence on the Form 1, the sentencing judge said:
""Having availed himself of that arrangement, that is the Form 1, [the respondent] has the benefit of not facing a sentence of imprisonment for that additional offence.  However, by clearing the slate in this way as it is described, he is provided considerable utility which must be brought to account to [the respondent].
I do not overlook, though, that it could not be said that [the respondent] would not have been inculpated in that additional offence but for his acknowledgement that he committed it ... 
The additional offence should impinge upon the sentence for the principal offence to a significant or marginal extent requiring the appropriate increase in the sentence that would have otherwise been applied for the principal offence standing alone ...
...
So far as the money is concerned in relation to the Form 1, there is no evidence which indicates that the money is the proceeds of drug sales by [the respondent].  Importantly, in my view, the money was deposited into accounts in [the respondent's] personal name and so far as the unit premises are concerned, he leased those premises in his own name.  In my view, that supports the submission made by senior counsel on his behalf in relation to his naivety concerning the offences.""
47In departing from the statutory ratio in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the sentencing judge said:
""I find there are special circumstances which warrant an adjustment in the normal ratio between the non-parole periods and the head sentence.  These include the fact that [the respondent] has not previously served a sentence of imprisonment; the fact that [the respondent] will be serving a sentence of imprisonment in a gaol a great distance from his family; and the fact that he will require assistance to reintegrate into the community when he is released after his sentence.""
48In relation to the order for total concurrency, at first instance the Crown submitted that were his Honour satisfied that the criminality on the supply count comprehended the criminality on the conspiracy count, an order for total concurrency was available and that his Honour would not fall into appealable error were he to take that approach.  This was a generous concession. 
The Crown submission on the sentence appeal 
49The grounds of appeal and the written submissions were settled by a Crown prosecutor who did not appear at the hearing. 
50The written submissions were brief in the extreme.  In seeking to persuade the Court that the individual sentences and the non-parole periods were manifestly inadequate, it was not submitted that any of the factual findings made by the sentencing judge favourable to the respondent were either unsupported by the evidence or findings not open to him.  In addition, there was no separate challenge to his Honour's finding of special circumstances, and no submission from the Crown that an alteration of the statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, based upon what his Honour found to be the respondent's need for assistance to ensure his reintegration into the community, was inappropriate when the respondent is a foreign national in Australia on a criminal justice visa.  Neither did the Crown challenge the finding of special circumstances on the basis of a finding that the distance from his family, and that he has not previously served a jail sentence, could properly support an alteration in the statutory ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period. 
51In the Crown's written submissions, the sentences were said to show manifest error by the disproportionate weight given to the respondent's subjective circumstances relative to the objective gravity of his offending and that, although the sentencing judge referred to the approach mandated by Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, insufficient regard was paid to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment on both the supply and conspiracy counts and, in respect of the former, that a standard non-parole period of 15 years applied. 
52The senior Crown prosecutor who appeared on the hearing regarded himself as bound by the approach the Crown had articulated in the written submissions.  For that reason, he did not seek to be heard on what appeared to me to be a number of questionable factual findings made in the respondent's favour concerning both the actual extent of his knowing involvement in the criminal organisation of which he admitted he was a member, evidenced by his conduct in Australia, and the circumstances of his arrest.  I have already noted that his Honour's failure to find that the offending was part of a planned and organised criminal activity is contradicted by the agreed facts.  In other respects, it seems to me his Honour failed to interrogate the agreed facts, and the inferences which might have been drawn from those facts, in assessing the respondent's role as a drug supplier and his account of himself to police, for example, the inferences which might have been drawn from the respondent's apparent familiarity with the Australian banking system and his trusted position in dealing with large quantities of cash. 
53I accept that the facts were silent on a number of issues that might have better informed the respondent's role and the extent of his autonomy generally whilst active as a syndicate member in and around the city whether through design or oversight.  I also accept that it is not for the sentencing judge to invite the Crown to tender evidence in support of its case on sentence, or to gainsay concessions made in the agreed facts, including, in this case, that the respondent's role was equivalent to that of a ""mule"" or ""courier"".  On the other hand, where those findings are not challenged, the success of the Crown appeal against what are said to be manifestly inadequate sentences is necessarily limited to making good the argument that the sentences are so patently disproportionate to the gravity of the offending that the only conclusion open is that the sentencing discretion miscarried. 
54In oral argument, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the concession at the sentencing hearing that an order for full concurrency was open, did not relieve the sentencing judge of ensuring that the effective sentence ultimately imposed adequately comprehended the full extent of the respondent's admitted criminal offending.  The Crown submitted that, despite the range of factors that his Honour considered operated to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending, including the positive findings he made on the respondent's subjective case, an effective sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months fell so egregiously short of a proportionate sentence that this Court would find that the sentencing discretion miscarried.
55I accept that submission.  I also accept that the position the Crown adopted at first instance on the question of accumulation or concurrency is a matter which might, in other circumstances, have resulted in the exercise of the residual discretion in the respondent's favour (see R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12 at [57] - [63]).  However, I am unable to come to the affirmative view that it should result in the Crown appeal being dismissed.  In my view, the only conclusion open is that the sentencing discretion miscarried, resulting in sentences that were well below sentences that could be properly imposed for agreeing to supply or being knowingly concerned in the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs.  The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the supply offence was not a mere formality, but a yardstick created by the legislature to guide sentencing courts.  Against a standard non-parole period of 15 years, a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months cannot be justified even on the most favourable view of the respondent's criminal offending and his subjective case (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; 249 CLR 571 at [24]; R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103 at [48], R v Booth [2014] NSWCCA 156 at [54]).
56That said, and not without some reluctance, I propose to preserve the order for concurrency.  I also consider that I have no option but to move to re-sentence referable to the appointment of the respondent's role in the agreed facts as a ""courier"" in the criminal organisation despite that being what I regard as a demonstrably erroneous assessment of what the respondent was recruited to do, and what he agreed to do as a drug supplier, and what I have no doubt was his trusted role in dealing in the proceeds of that criminal activity. 
57In light of the approach of the Crown on the hearing of the appeal, I am also prepared to preserve his Honour's favourable finding that the respondent had determined to withdraw from the criminal syndicate before he was arrested and that he had a subjective case that entitled him to some leniency.  I am not, however, satisfied that there is any basis for a finding of special circumstances.
58After taking into account the proceeds offence in the imposition of the sentence on the supply count, I consider that a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period 7 years and 6 months should be imposed for that count, and that a sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months should be imposed for the conspiracy count, to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence on the supply count. 
59The orders I propose are:
(1)Appeal allowed.
(2)The sentences imposed in the District Court on 12 June 2014 are quashed.(3)In lieu thereof, the following sentences are imposed:
(a)For the supply count:  Imprisonment for 10 years comprising a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 30 October 2012 and expiring on 29 April 2020 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 29 October 2022.
(b)For the conspiracy count:  Imprisonment for 7 years comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months commencing on 30 October 2012 and expiring on 29 February 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years and 8 months expiring on 29 October 2019.
60R A HULME J:  I have no hesitation in agreeing with Fullerton J that the sentences imposed by Jeffreys DCJ are manifestly inadequate. 
61The proposed new total term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months is a modest result in resentencing but I agree with Fullerton J of the need to adopt such an approach for the reasons she has indicated.  
62GARLING J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J and with her Honour's reasons.

2765653,Landsman v R [2014] NSWCCA 328,"Stated Case

Court/Tribunal: District Court

Before: Blanch J, Chief Judge of the District Court

Court File Number(s): 2011/347713





			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  This matter concerns a question submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Chief Judge of the District Court, Justice Blanch, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5B.  Section 5B provides, relevantly:
""5B Case stated from District Court
(1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.""
2The question submitted to the Court was as follows:
""1. Factual Background
1A. On 18 October 2012, at the Downing Centre Local Court the Applicant was found guilty, after a summary hearing, of two counts of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm. The Applicant neither gave nor called evidence at the Local court hearing but contended that the identification evidence called by the prosecution was not capable of satisfying Her Honour beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the assailant in relation to either offence.
1B. Having found the Applicant guilty of each offence Her Honour ordered that, prior to being sentenced, the Applicant undergo an assessment by an officer employed by the Department of Corrective Services to determine his suitability to serve any sentence imposed by way of an intensive correction order.
1C. For the purposes of conducting the assessment, the officer interviewed the Applicant on 8 November 2012. The Applicant was counselled by the Corrective Services Officer to tell the truth during the assessment. The officer has subsequently made a statement, dated 29 March 2013, in which he states that he asked the Applicant, 'In your own words tell me what happened on the night of the offence'. The Applicant replied, 'I was at a dress up party. I bumped into two other guys. There was a verbal altercation with these two other guys which became physical, I hit each of the males once'.
1d. The Applicant was subsequently sentenced in the Local Court to serve an intensive correction order and lodged an appeal against his convictions to the District Court.
2. Determination
2A. On 2 May 2013, the Respondent sought leave, pursuant to section 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, to call in the District Court Appeal proceedings fresh evidence from the Corrective Services officer as to the contents of the statement set out above. I determined that it was in the interests of justice to allow the Respondent to adduce that fresh evidence at the appeal and made such an order. At the same time I also granted leave to the Applicant to call fresh evidence, should he wish to raise self-defence in his appeal proceedings.
3. Questions of Law for Determination
3A. On the hearing of an appeal against conviction under s. 18 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, is it capable of being in the interests of justice to grant the prosecution leave to adduce as fresh evidence an admission made by [the applicant] to a Corrective Services Officer, after a finding of guilt in the Local Court, the admission being made in the course of the preparation of an 'ICO' assessment report for the purpose of sentencing [the applicant]?""
3The applicant submits that the answer to this question is ""no"".  The primary submission of the Crown is that the Court should decline to answer the question because the question as posed is a question of fact.  If the Court considers that it has jurisdiction, the Crown submits that the question for determination should be answered in the affirmative. 
Relevant legislation
4The applicant appealed against his conviction in the Local Court pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the Act), s 11.  Section 11 relevantly provides:
""11 Appeals as of right
(1) Any person who has been convicted ... by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction ...""
5Section 18 of the Act provides:
""18 Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence
(1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings ...
(2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.
(3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence.""
6""Fresh evidence"" is defined in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 3 as meaning, in relation to appeal proceedings, ""evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence given in the proceedings from which the appeal proceedings have arisen"".  In a conviction appeal pursuant to s 18, the District Court ""may exercise any function that the Local Court could have exercised in the original Local Court proceedings"":  Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 28. 
Submissions of the applicant
7The applicant submitted that the question posed by Blanch J was suitable for a stated case under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5B because it had been posed in a way such that there can only be one answer to it.  The applicant contended that the question should be answered in the negative because it was not capable of being in the interests of justice to grant the prosecution leave to adduce as fresh evidence the applicant's admission in the circumstances of this case.  He submitted that this was because it cannot be in the interests of justice for the Crown to be in a position to supplement its case in circumstances where it failed to adduce sufficient evidence at first instance.  
8The applicant was not able to find any authority for this submission in relation to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 18(2) but submitted that an analogy could be drawn with appeals on indictment.  The applicant placed emphasis on the proposition that if a conviction appeal is successful where the evidence at first instance was insufficient, an acquittal, rather than a retrial should be ordered:  Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; 126 CLR 198 at 211;  Gerakiteys v R [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at 322 per Gibbs CJ, 331 per Deane J;  King v the Queen [1986] HCA 59; 161 CLR 423 at 433 per Dawson J;  R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [52] per Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ.  
9The applicant submitted that this principle is grounded not only on notions of fairness to the accused person, but on the principle of double jeopardy.  This principle, he contended, was dictated by the interests of justice which was the basis for determining whether a re-trial or an acquittal should be ordered:  see Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler [1984] HCA 48; 154 CLR 627 at 630, where the High Court observed:
""The power to grant a new trial is a discretionary one and in deciding whether to exercise it the court which has quashed the conviction must decide whether the interests of justice require a new trial to be had. In so deciding, the court should first consider whether the admissible evidence given at the original trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction, for if it was not it would be wrong by making an order for a new trial to give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement a defective case.""  (emphasis added)
10The applicant submitted that where a person successfully appealed against conviction on the basis of the insufficiency of the prosecution evidence, the interests of justice did not permit a balancing of other factors so as to permit the Crown to proceed against the person a second time:  see Reid v The Queen [1980] AC 343 at 347-348.
11The applicant contended that the same reasoning applied by analogy to the application to adduce fresh evidence in this case.  The applicant submitted that on the conviction appeal, he will contend that the evidence before the magistrate was insufficient to convict him.  In those circumstances, the applicant submitted that the prosecution should not have the benefit of an opportunity to supplement its case and remedy any defect that the Crown case had at first instance, by adducing the evidence of the appellant's post-conviction statement.  It should be noted that the question of the admissibility of the evidence has not been determined.  
12As the applicant recognised, there is no limitation in s 18 which prevented the Crown from seeking to adduce further evidence on a conviction appeal.  The applicant submitted, however, that to the extent that the Crown could seek to adduce fresh evidence, it must never be permitted to do so if its purpose was to supplement its case against the accused at first instance.  The applicant submitted that his argument derived support from the proposition that post-conviction admissions were not material to the question whether the proviso in the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6 should be applied:  R v De-Cressac [1985] 1 NSWLR 381.  
13The applicant also placed emphasis upon the particular circumstances of this case which, he submitted, meant that the interests of justice would not be served by the evidence of his post-conviction statement to the Corrective Services Officer being allowed to be adduced in evidence against him.  The applicant's post-conviction statement was made during the preparation of a report assessing his suitability to serve a sentence of imprisonment in the community by way of an intensive corrections order.  Such an order may only be made where the court has determined to impose a custodial sentence:  Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 7.  If the court has made that determination, it may refer the person for an assessment as to suitability for an intensive corrections order:  Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 69(1).  The applicant pointed out that the magistrate, at the time of referring him to the Commissioner of Corrective Services, must have already determined that the applicant was to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment:  R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17.  
14In those circumstances, the applicant submitted that he had a very real incentive to accept responsibility for the actions the subject of the charges as part of the assessment process and that there was a very real question whether the statement was voluntary or, even if voluntary, was the product of a powerful inducement.  In this regard, the applicant placed emphasis on the fact that the Corrective Services Officer conducting the assessment instructed him ""to tell the truth during the assessment"".  The applicant submitted that it cannot be in the interests of justice to encourage an offender to admit his guilt of an offence for the purposes of assessing the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, while at the same time depriving the offender of the possibility of challenging a conviction on the basis of a lack of evidence.
15The applicant also contended that if fresh evidence could be adduced in circumstances such as those that arose here, an anomalous position would arise whereby evidence of a post-conviction statement could be adduced on an appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 11, but that such evidence could not be given on an appeal under s 53 of that Act.  Pursuant to s 53(1)(b), a person convicted of an offence in the Local Court may seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on a ground that involves a question of mixed fact and law.  On such an application, there is no provision analogous to s 18(2), which means that an applicant would not be exposed to the risk that a post-conviction admission might be led in evidence against him. 
Crown submissions
16The Crown's primary submission was that the question as framed by Blanch J was not a question of law.  The Crown recognised that if on the facts found only one conclusion is open, a question of law would arise:  Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16; 144 CLR 1 at 9;  Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR NSW 126.  However, the Crown pointed out that the phrase ""interests of justice"", which is not defined in the Act, are words of the widest import.  As Kirby J, in a different context, observed in Herron v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1987) 8 NSWLR 601 at 613:
""Those words 'in the interests of justice' are plainly words of the widest possible reference. Indeed, there could scarcely be a wider judicial remit. They enliven a discretionary judgment ...""
17The Crown submitted, therefore, that the breadth of the phrase was such that it would be difficult for a court, determining whether a particular matter was in the interests of justice, to find that only one conclusion was open.  Accordingly, it contended that the case stated pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5B did not submit a question of law.  Rather, Blanch J's determination was a discretionary ruling in respect of fresh evidence on a conviction appeal.  It pointed out that a discretionary ruling on the admission of evidence could not be a question of law.  Nor could the exercise of a discretion raise a question of law, where the question is its exercise in relation to the facts of the particular case:  Williams v R [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278 at 302.
18The Crown also submitted that the question as formulated required consideration of the facts in the exercise of judicial discretion in determining whether it was in ""the interests of justice"" to permit fresh evidence.  Indeed, the Crown doubted whether the question of what is in the interests of justice could ever solely be a question of law.  In this regard, the Crown referred to authority in which emphasis was placed on the particular facts of a case in the interpretation of that phrase:  Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57; 177 CLR 292 per Dawson J at 349 and per Toohey J at 360.  The Crown submitted that to determine whether the Court is satisfied that it would or would not be in the interests of justice for the fresh evidence to be given requires a consideration of the facts of each case where the question arises.  The Crown submitted that it can only be a question of fact. 
19If the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that it should answer the question in the stated case, the Crown submitted that the question should be answered in the negative.
20The Crown submitted that the Court should reject the applicant's submission that the Crown should not be allowed to supplement its case at trial by relying on the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 18(2).  The Crown submitted that the applicant's argument ignores the fact that an appeal from the Local Court to the District Court is by way of rehearing and that fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the question of whether it is in the interests of justice:  see ss 18(1) and 18(2).  In this regard, the Crown drew the Court's attention to Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; 164 A Crim R 39.  In Charara, Mason P, with whom Kirby J and Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) agreed, explained, at [17]:
""The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (s 18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (s 18(2).""
21In the course of his reasons, Mason P observed, at [26], that:
""... receiving any 'fresh evidence' is exceptional (under s 18(2)) ... s 18(2) is not available for the blanket trumping of s 18(1). Subsection (2) is the exception rather than the rule, and the judge must turn his or her mind to the particular 'fresh evidence' whose nature attracts the exceptional grant of leave.""
22The Crown submitted that there is no barrier to the Crown to applying to lead fresh evidence on an appeal by a convicted person.
23The Crown emphasised that whether it is in the interests of justice for the evidence at trial to be supplemented on the appeal is a question for the judge to answer in all the surrounding circumstances and in the exercise of their judicial discretion.  In this regard, the Crown referred to the remarks of Blanch J in granting leave to the Crown for fresh evidence to be given in this matter.  His Honour stated:
""It appears to me that what has occurred is that the appellant has simply been honest and made a confession that he was the person who committed the assault. I have no doubt that he did that on the basis of cooperating with the probation officer bearing in mind that what was in contemplation was either a gaol sentence or a non full-time custodial sentence and it would have been very much in his interests to try to avoid going to gaol....One thing that does need to be looked at is the circumstances in which it arose, and that is whether there is any unfairness or impropriety in what occurred between him and the probation officer. I see nothing in what occurred to lead to any conclusion about impropriety, it is not a case where the law requires a probation officer to give a warning, the confession seems to have been one that was volunteered in the course of an overall assessment by the probation officer and in my view it is in the interests of justice that the prosecution be allowed to call the material.""
His Honour also stated that the applicant would be given leave to call evidence in rebuttal.
24The Crown submitted that in granting leave, Blanch J had had regard to the fact that to the extent that the admission is in the nature of a confession, its admissibility is dependent on whether it was made voluntarily:  The Queen v Lee [1950] HCA 25; 82 CLR 133 at 149, 150, of which a relevant consideration is whether it was made in consequence to an inducement by a person in authority.  The Crown accepted that the Corrective Services Officer may be considered to be a person in authority: McDermott v The Queen [1948] HCA 23; 76 CLR 501.  The Crown submitted, however, that there was no impropriety associated with the interview.  The Corrective Services Officer was not required by law to give the applicant a warning and the Crown submitted that the confession was seemingly volunteered in the course of the overall assessment of his suitability for an intensive corrections orders.  The Crown also submitted that that there is nothing to suggest that there was an inducement by any suggestion of a reduced sentence in the circumstances of this case, in which the applicant knew he was either facing gaol or a non-full time custodial sentence:  R v Laird (1893) (1893) 14 LR (NSW) 354 at 358.
25The Crown also rejected the analogy drawn by the applicant between this case and those cases considering the relevance of post-conviction admissions in the application of the proviso in the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1).  The Crown submitted that those cases, considering offences prosecuted on indictment, are not relevant to appeals under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act arising from summary convictions.  The Crown also referred the Court to the observations of Johnson J in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at [52] ff and TDP v R; R v TDP [2013] NSWCCA 303 at [128].
26The Crown also seeks the costs of the appeal before this Court:  Clyne v Wrigley [1980] 1 NSWLR 599.
Consideration
Should the Court decline to answer the stated case because no question of law is stated?
27On an appeal to the District Court under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 18, the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5B provides one of the only means to challenge the determination of Blanch J to grant the Crown leave to adduce the fresh evidence.  As Basten JA has explained in Lavorato v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 61; 82 NSWLR 568 at [5]:
""There is no appeal from a decision of the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction determining an appeal from a judgment in the Local Court. Apart from judicial review pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, the only step available to an aggrieved party in the District Court is to invite the judge to submit for determination by this Court a question of law arising on the appeal to the District Court. That procedure is available under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act.""
See also Talay v R [2010] NSWCCA 308 [16] per Simpson J (with whom Schmidt J agreed).  
28The avenue of challenge provided by s 5B is limited.  As Basten JA observed in Lavorato, at [6]:
""The absence of any appeal from the District Court in such cases is long standing and deliberate: a case stated is not to be converted into a general right of appeal, or even one limited to error of law. Rather, the subject matter of the proceedings in this Court is identified by the questions submitted by the judge of the District Court.""
29Once a relevant question of law has been identified, a District Court judge is under a duty to exercise the power under s 5B to submit a question of law unless ""the question is so obviously frivolous and baseless that its submission would be an abuse of process"":  Ex parte McGavin; Re Berne (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 58; 63 WN (NSW) 45;  Elias v The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2012] NSWCA 302 at [8].
30The jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is limited by the terms of the stated case.  In Talay, Simpson J (Schmidt J agreeing) stated, at [17]:
""Strictly speaking, this Court may not have regard to matters outside the stated case: Madden; Thomas v The King [1937] HCA 83; 59 CLR 279. That is one reason that explains the importance of the formulation of the stated case, including, explicitly, the facts found (relevant to the questions of law posed) and the questions of law to be submitted."" 
See also Lavorato per Schmidt J at [71].
31In this matter, the Crown contends that the Court should decline to answer the stated case.  That contention should be rejected.
32In Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12; 202 CLR 439 at [24], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ, a majority of the High Court, observed that:
""Whether facts as found answer a statutory description or satisfy statutory criteria will very frequently be exclusively a question of law. To put the matter another way ... whether the facts found by the trial court can support the legal description given to them by the trial court is a question of law. However, not all questions involving mixed questions of law and fact are, or need to be susceptible of one correct answer only."" (citations omitted)
33Their Honours observed that this is why the test is often expressed in the formulation of Jordan CJ in Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General at 138 where his Honour observed that:
""[I]f the facts inferred ... from the evidence ... are necessarily within the description of a word or phrase in a statute or necessarily outside that description, a contrary decision is wrong in law.""
34In Vetter, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ commented that the law on this issue had been stated by Mason J, with whom Gibbs, Stephen, Murphy and Aickin JJ agreed, in Hope v Bathurst City Council at 7.  Their Honours observed of that case:
""... Mason J pointed out that when it is necessary to engage in a process of construction of the meaning of a word (or phrase) in a statute a question of law will be involved, but that the question may be a mixed one of fact and law. His Honour's reasons make it clear that a question exclusively of law arises, as the respondent sought to argue was the position in this case, if, on the facts found only one conclusion is open."" (citations omitted)
35There are numerous examples where the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal have accepted that a question whether the facts found are necessarily within or necessarily outside a statutory description founds jurisdiction pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5B:  see, for example, Lavorato v Regina at [13];  Hammond v R [2013] NSWCCA 93 at [24] per Slattery J, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed;  Elias v The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW).
36In this case, the question posed by Blanch J is whether, under s 18, it is ""capable of being in the interests of justice to grant the prosecution leave to adduce as fresh evidence"" evidence of a post-conviction admission made during the course of the accused's assessment for an Intensive Corrections Order.  
37Blanch J initially refused to state a case pursuant to s 5B on the basis that the applicant had not identified a question of law.  The applicant successfully sought relief pursuant to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 69 quashing Blanch J's refusal and ordering that the matter be remitted to the District Court to be heard and determined according to law:  Landsman v DPP [2013] NSWCA 369.  
38Macfarlan JA, with whom Simpson J agreed, held, at [22], that during the applicant's stated case application before Blanch J, when he sought to have the question for referral reformulated in the terms now contained in the question submitted to the Court, the applicant raised a:
""... material question of law, that is, whether the uncontested facts before the judge were capable of supporting the judge's view that it was in the interests of justice that the leave sought be given or, to put it as the applicant's counsel did, whether the judge was bound to conclude that it was not in the interests of justice for leave to be given.""
39Macfarlan JA held, at [25], that this reformulated question was arguable and not futile and enlivened Blanch J's duty to submit the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal's determination.  
40Leeming JA agreed with Macfarlan JA's orders and expressed substantial agreement with the reasons.  His Honour's reasons, although expressing some doubt about the ""ultimate question"" whether Blanch J was ""bound"" to conclude that it was not in the interests of justice for leave to the Crown be given (see at [35]-[36]), were consistent with the question as framed being a question of law in accordance with s 5B.  
41There may, therefore, be a real question as to whether it was open for the Crown to contend before the Court of Criminal Appeal that no question of law had been stated.  Although it is accepted doctrine that issue estoppels do not bind in criminal law:  see Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42; 181 CLR 251, it would appear incongruous that the Crown is entitled in this Court to contradict a proposition that was necessarily decided by the Court of Appeal.  
42But in any event, for the reasons given by their Honours, I agree that the question in the stated case raises a question of law.  There may be some circumstances where the exercise of a discretion does not give rise to a question of law.  Thus, in Williams, Mason and Brennan JJ observed, at 301-302, that:
""An appeal on the ground of the wrongful rejection of evidence by a trial judge in the exercise of a discretion is not an appeal on a question of law alone.  The manner in which a discretion is exercised depends upon the judge's appreciation of all the facts of the case, so that an error of law which leads the judge wrongly to hold that he has a discretion is not the only factor which contributes to his decision to reject the evidence ..."" (citation omitted)
43However, the mere fact that a question a court is required to determine involves a discretion or an evaluation of relevant circumstances does not automatically mean that no question of law is thereby raised.  This is apparent not only from the authorities referred to above, but also from the Privy Council's decision in Reid.  The Privy Council was there concerned, relevantly, with the question whether the Court of Appeal could properly order a new trial where the only evidence implicating the defendant had been discredited or was manifestly unreliable.  This required a determination as to whether ""the interests of justice"" required a new trial rather than an acquittal. 
44Their Lordships observed, at 346, that ""the interests of justice"" required the balancing of various interests which were not only confined to the interests of the applicant and which pointed in different directions, some of which favoured a new trial and some of which did not.  Notwithstanding that there were different interests to be considered, their Lordships concluded that it would be an error of principle to order a new trial in circumstances where the evidence at the original trial was insufficient to convict the accused person.  In other words, there was only one answer to the question posed as to whether it was in the interests of justice to order a new trial. 
Was it capable of being in the interests of justice to grant the prosecution leave to adduce the fresh evidence?
45The use that a prosecutor may make of post-conviction admissions has been the subject of judicial comment in a number of cases, although no determinative principle has emerged and none of the cases involved the question in issue here.  Nonetheless, it is instructive to consider those decisions to see if any useful guidance can be found.  It is convenient to consider the cases chronologically.  
46In R v De-Cressac, the question for the court was whether the proviso under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1) should be applied where the convicted applicant had made an apparent admission of guilt to a probation and parole officer and which was recorded in a post-trial pre-sentence report.  To that extent, the facts are similar to those that apply here.  The proviso contained in s 6(1) provides:
""... that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""
47Street CJ, with whom O'Brien CJ of Cr D agreed, considered that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial judge's directions to the jury on the evidence of identification of the accused.  Street CJ, at 390, observed that the apparent post-conviction confessional statement of the accused raised a dilemma for the Court in determining whether to apply the proviso.  The competing considerations, in his Honour's assessment, were the use of ""the resources of the court system by putting up a guilty man for re-trial"" on the one hand and the maintenance of the integrity of the substantive and procedural principles governing criminal trials on the other.  His Honour, having observed that the deficiency in the trial was not minor, asked:
""Is it, then, open to this Court, where there has been a substantial miscarriage in the established requirements governing a criminal trial to hold, on the basis of later evidence establishing guilt, that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.""
48His Honour considered that the post-conviction statement ought not be taken into account in determining whether there had been a miscarriage of justice.  His Honour paid regard to the principles stated in Mraz v R (No 1) [1955] HCA 59; 93 CLR 493 at 514, that where, because of some failure in the trial process the applicant had lost a chance of acquittal which was otherwise open, there is, in the eye of the law, a miscarriage of justice.  Street CJ concluded, therefore, that the proviso should not apply and there should be a new trial.  His Honour left open the question of the admissibility of the statement made by the applicant to the probation and parole officer in any retrial.  
49Hodgson J considered that regard could be had to a post-conviction statement in determining whether there had been a miscarriage of justice.  However, his Honour determined not to act upon the statement for a number of reasons, including that there was a question as to whether the statement to the probation and parole officer was voluntary in the sense of whether it have been made in the exercise of a free choice to speak or to be silent.  As his Honour was not satisfied that a jury would necessarily have convicted, even had they been properly instructed, he held that the proviso in s 6(1) did not apply.  
50In R v McCarthy; R v Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395 the applicant Ryan gave evidence on sentence in an attempt to reduce the extent of her culpability for the offence of which she had been convicted.  Hunt CJ at CL (Wood J agreeing, Smart J dissenting on this point) considered that, for that reason, the matter was distinguishable from De-Cressac.  His Honour concluded that the proviso did not apply because the applicant's evidence did not necessarily constitute a clear admission.  Hunt CJ at CL was also inclined to prefer the approach of Hodgson J in De-Cressac rather than the ""blanket approach"" taken by Street CJ.  
51In R v Gudgeon (1995) 83 A Crim R 228 the applicant, who was not legally represented, had given evidence at his trial during which he admitted to having committed the conspiracy with which he was charged.  MacPherson JA and Thomas J held that the absence of legal representation did not result in a miscarriage of justice such that there should be a new trial.  Their Honours observed, at 246:
""In the face of the prosecution evidence against him, he had no realistic chance of acquittal. His testimony at the trial serves to confirm that conclusion. It also shows that the appellant cannot now look towards a further chance of acquittal at a fresh trial in the future. It would be pointless to order such a trial if the only consequence would be that his guilt would be established yet again with the assistance of the evidence he gave at the trial from which the appeal is now brought.""
52Their Honours observed that there were rules governing the admissibility of evidence of confessions or admissions made out of court relied upon to prove guilt.  The fact that a warning had not been given or understood might be a circumstance where a confession or admission of guilt is rejected on grounds of unfairness.  However, the case with which their Honours were concerned involved evidence given by the applicant in court during the course of his trial.  Their Honours considered, therefore, that the ""reception of such evidence at any future trial could ... not be characterised as improper or unfair"".  Their Honours also commented that if the court was not entitled to act upon evidence given in cross-examination at trial, the effect of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld), s 15(1) would be nullified.  Section 15 provided that an accused person who gave evidence at trial was not entitled to refuse to answer a question put to him or her in cross-examination on the ground that to do so would tend to prove the commission by him or her of the offence of which he or she was charged.
53Fitzgerald P, although agreeing with the majority that there had been no miscarriage of justice, did not agree with their Honours' approach to the use of the applicant's evidence at trial.  His Honour's concern was that much of the prosecution case was based upon the apparently unlawful or improper activities of the police who had possibly facilitated the drug importation which was the basis of the conspiracy with which the applicant was charged.  His Honour considered that in any event, the strength of the prosecution evidence did not affect a person's entitlement to a fair trial.  
54In R v Bikic [2001] NSWCCA 537, the Court was concerned with the question whether there had been a miscarriage of justice in the applicant's trial by the failure of his counsel to call certain witnesses.  The applicant sought to place before the Court new evidence, the effect of which was intended to prove that he was not present and did not participate in certain events when the shootings with which he had been charged occurred.  One witness called on the application to adduce new evidence was Mr Mackic.  
55Mr Mackic objected to answering questions in cross-examination pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995, s 128, which protects a person against giving evidence that may incriminate the person in other proceedings.  The objection was taken on the basis that his answers might prejudice any appeal he might bring in relation to his convictions for manslaughter in connection with the same offences for which Mr Bikic was charged.  Relying on Street CJ's judgment in De-Cressac, the Court held that a post-conviction confession of guilt could not be taken into account in determining whether the proviso under s 6(1) should apply.  Accordingly, the Court held Mr Mackic had not demonstrated that there were ""reasonable grounds for the objection"" to giving the evidence in Mr Bikic's trial.  
56In Raumakita, it was not necessary to determine whether a post-conviction admission made to a psychiatrist, who was interviewing the appellant for the purposes of the preparation of a report on sentence, could be used in determining whether to apply the proviso in s 6(1).  Johnson J, however, observed, at [54], that having regard to the comments of this Court in De-Cressac, any submission suggesting such an approach would be viewed with considerable caution.  His Honour also referred to the remarks of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, with whom Heydon J agreed, in Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 at [131], that no weight could be attached to what was said in a letter to the sentencing judge in determining whether there was no substantial miscarriage of justice for the purposes of the proviso in s 6(1). 
57The issue also arose in TDP.  In that matter, the Crown submitted that if the applicant succeeded on any of his grounds of appeal, certain post-conviction admissions were relevant to the application of the proviso and the Court of Criminal Appeal's determination whether to order a new trial under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 8 rather than direct an acquittal under s 6(2).  The relevant admissions in that case were made by the applicant to a psychologist who was preparing a report for the sentence proceedings.  That report, which was tendered by the applicant's counsel in the sentence proceedings, recorded that the applicant was advised that the purpose of the assessment was to provide a report to the Court, that he was advised that what he disclosed would not remain confidential and that he had provided written consent for the information given to be used in the report.
58As none of the applicant's grounds of appeal had been successful, it was not necessary for the Court to determine the Crown's contention.  Hoeben CJ at CL, with whom Blanch J and R A Hulme J agreed, however, noted, at [125], a number of preliminary difficulties with the submission, including whether in fact an admission had been made, whether the admissions in fact covered all of the counts and the fact that the ""wording of the s 6(1) proviso directs attention to the evidence that was before the jury at trial (Cesan v The Queen at [123]-[129])"".  Hoeben CJ at CL then went on to observe that the Crown would also have to overcome the observation by Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, with whom Heydon J agreed, in Cesan at [131], where their Honours observed:
""Finally, some weight was given by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal to a letter written by Mr Cesan to the trial judge after the jury had returned a guilty verdict and before sentence was passed. The majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that, in the letter, he admitted his guilt of the offence charged. The letter was written for the evident purpose of mitigating the sentence that was then to be passed upon Mr Cesan. To do other than accept the jury's verdict would have aggravated the sentence. No weight can be attached to what was said in the letter in deciding whether there was no substantial miscarriage of justice"" (citations omitted).
59Hoeben CJ at CL concluded, at [128], that he had:
""... considerable doubts as to whether an 'admission' such as occurred in this case could influence the application of the proviso in s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It may, however, have become significant if there were a real issue as to whether the appropriate order was one for acquittal or for a retrial. That issue, however, does not arise for decision in this case.""
60Two English cases have considered the use of post-conviction confessions in determining whether to retry a person acquitted of a serious offence pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (UK).  Part 10 of that Act makes provision in specified circumstances for the quashing of an acquittal and the retrial of a defendant. 
61In R v Dunlop [2007] 1 WLR 1657 the Crown, on the applicant's second retrial for murder, offered no evidence and a not guilty verdict was entered.  Subsequently, whilst serving a sentence in prison for an unrelated matter, the applicant admitted to a prison officer on a number of occasions that he had been responsible for the murder of which he had been acquitted.  The Crown made application for the applicant to be retried under the provisions of Pt 10 of the Criminal Justice Act.  The Court was of the opinion that there was no injustice in allowing a retrial.  The Court concluded that the public:
""... would be rightly outraged were the exception to the double jeopardy rule not to be applied in the present case simply on the basis that Dunlop would not have made the confessions had he appreciated that they might lead to his retrial.""
62In R v Miell [2008] 1 WLR 627 the Court rejected an application that there be a new trial following Mr Miell's acquittal of the murder charge in circumstances in which he had given evidence at the trial.  Whilst in prison in respect of other offences, Mr Miell made a number of statements confessing to the murder and subsequently pleaded guilty to perjury in respect of the evidence he had given at his murder trial.  The confessions were made prior to the introduction of Pt 10 of the Criminal Justice Act.  The background to the making of the confessions, including one made in a formal interview in which he had been cautioned, was that Mr Miell was studying to become a Jehovah's Witness and needed to clear his conscience before he could be baptised.
63Following the introduction of Pt 10, the Crown brought an application for retrial.  The Court was not persuaded that the new evidence, being the confessional statements, was reliable and thus refused the application for a retrial.  The Court added, relevant to the matter in issue in the case before this Court, that had they not been required to form their own view of the reliability of the confession, they would have held it contrary to ""the interests of justice"" to require Mr Miell to stand trial again.  One reason for that view related to the application of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (UK), s 74.  The Court considered that the effect of that section was that on any retrial for murder, the conviction for perjury would establish that Mr Miell had committed perjury unless he proved to the contrary.  The perjury conviction would thus stand as reliable, substantial and highly probative evidence of the fact that he had committed perjury when he denied committing the murder and thus compelling evidence of the fact that he was the murderer.  The Court considered that the effect of the perjury convictions in respect of the evidence he gave at his earlier murder trial would, on any new trial, be to shift the burden of proof to Mr Miell.  This would offend the basic principle that the Crown bore the onus of proving that a person was guilty of the offence charged. 
Some further observations
64In the present case, although the matter before the District Court is an appeal, it is an appeal by way of a rehearing in respect of which ""fresh evidence"" may be given if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be given:  see the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, s 18(1).  Accordingly, the authorities discussed above do not apply directly to the issue presently before this Court.  However, these cases do demonstrate that there has been a resistance by courts in both Australia and England to using post-conviction statements for the purposes of determining whether the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act applies and whether there should be a new trial or an acquittal.  However, as in the decision in Dunlop, much will depend upon the circumstances in which a post-conviction statement is made.  The decision in Miell indicates that if to allow the post-conviction statement would compromise some basic aspect of the criminal justice system, such as the requirement that the Crown bears the onus of proof of the charge, the ""interests of justice"" would dictate that the post-conviction statement not be admitted.
65This resistance to the use of post-conviction confessional statements in the authorities to which I have referred has been based upon some infringement of legal principle or upon a recognised aspect of the interests of justice.  Thus, in De-Cressac, Street CJ pointed out that the principles governing the determination as to whether there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice in a particular case were sometimes conflicting.  In that case, the competing principles were the use of the Court system for the re-trial of a person who had, post-conviction, admitted guilt, and the integrity of the substantive and procedural principles governing criminal trials.  His Honour found the answer in the principle that a person should not be denied a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him.  That was the language used in Mraz.  Whilst that language has fallen out of favour:  see Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300, the point is that his Honour found the answer in the principles then understood to govern the operation of the proviso in the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1).  His Honour found those principles of greater importance than the competing aspect of the public interest that court resources ought not be used for the retrial of a guilty person.  Although Hodgson J considered that the post-conviction statement could, as a matter of principle, be taken into account, a reason for not doing so was because there was a question as to the voluntariness of the statement.  His Honour thus also found the answer by reference to relevant legal principle.
66Statements made in Gudgeon were to like effect.  The majority determined the matter by reference to the Evidence Act (Qld), s 15 which, they observed, would be set at nought if the evidence given at trial was not admissible.  Their Honours also noted that the rules of evidence governed the admissibility of involuntary statements at trial.  Fitzgerald P in his approach considered that evidence obtained through the unlawful or improper conduct of police officers ought not to be a basis for the consideration whether the proviso should apply.  
67Although the weight of authority reviewed above is that a post-conviction statement should not be taken into account in determining whether the proviso in s 6(1) applied, none of the authorities have commented in any definitive way as to whether such evidence would be admissible in a subsequent trial.  That is understandable, as any such comment would not only be obiter, but the court would unlikely to have been in a position to know all the considerations relevant to the admissibility of such evidence.
This case
68It is necessary at this point to return to the terms of s 18.  The section provides that fresh evidence may only be given with leave if the court determines it is in ""the interests of justice"" to do so.  Either party may seek leave to give fresh evidence.  The applicant's submission that the section does not apply to the prosecutorial authorities must be rejected.  The section is not so limited either by its express terms or by any necessary implication.  Thus, it is necessary to determine whether it is in the interests of justice that the Crown be granted leave to give the further evidence.
69It is apparent from the various contexts in which the phrase ""interests of justice"" is found that it will involve the balancing of various interests that are in play in the particular context in which the phrase is used.  Although the ""interests of justice"" will include the interests of the parties, the concept will invariably be wider than that and include larger questions of legal principle, the public interest and policy considerations:  see BHP Billiton v Schultz [2004] HCA 61; 221 CLR 400.  
70In some cases, ""the interests of justice"" will override other recognised legal principles or matters of public policy.  Thus, in Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 at [35], Deane J observed that there were circumstances in which ""the interests of justice may override the public policy that there should be an end to litigation"".  That statement was made in the context where the applicant had been convicted on false evidence.  The present case does not involve the same circumstances with which the Court was concerned in Mickelberg.  However, his Honour's remarks demonstrate that there are occasions when the interests of justice may predominate over other competing legal principles such as the finality of litigation, which is now recognised as a fundamental tenet of our legal system:  D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; 223 CLR 1.  
71Subject to any legislative provision to the contrary, a person is entitled to refuse to answer questions asked by a person in authority.  This has been described as being ""the whole basis of the common law"":  Rice v Connolly [1966] 2 QB 414 per Lord Parker CJ.  In Stafford (1976) 13 SASR 392 at 399 Bray CJ observed, in relation to questioning by police, that: 
""[The] law confers the right of silence upon suspected persons except in so far as any statute takes it away.  That right must be respected by the police and enforced by the courts. 
72The requirement, usually found in statute:  see for example, the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 139, that a person be cautioned before answering questions, serves the purpose of making the right to silence more effective:  Ryan v Marshall [1965] Tas SR 1 at 13;  Hall (1970) 55 Crim App R 108 at 112;  Banner [1970] VR 240 at 252;  R v Pitts (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 1652; 229 A Crim R 387 at [24];  R v FE [2013] NSWSC 1692 at [64].  The privilege against self-incrimination fulfils a similar purpose. 
73As the observations of Bray CJ in Stafford indicate, fundamental aspects of the criminal law, such as the right to silence, are such an essential feature of the system of criminal justice that the courts have recognised those rights will not be abrogated except by express statutory provision.  In Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) said, at 437:
""The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights ...""  (citation omitted)
74The same point was made in Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 656 (Lee [2014]) the High Court observed, at [32], that the system of criminal justice:
""... reflects a balance struck between the power of the State to prosecute and the position of an individual who stands accused.""  
75The High Court identified the relevant principles as being the requirement that the prosecution prove the guilt of an accused person and its ""companion rule"", as the Court described it, at [33], ""that an accused person cannot be required to testify"".  In its earlier decision, Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 (Lee [2013]) French CJ and Crennan J identified this rule as an aspect of the immunity conferred by the ""right to silence"".  The Court in Lee [2014], at [33], continued that ""[t]he prosecution cannot compel a person charged with a crime to assist in the discharge of its onus of proof"".  This has been described as ""a cardinal principle"":  Sorby v Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 at 294;  Lee [2013] at [175].  See also X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 at [102], [104] and [159]. 
76These statements were made in the context of the principle of legality, explained in X7, at [86], by Hayne and Bell JJ as a principle of statutory construction.  See also Lee [2013] at [29] per French CJ;  see also [126] per Crennan J;  [307]-[314] per Gageler and Keane JJ.  
77This case is not concerned with the principle of legality.  However, that principle, in common with the observations of Bray CJ to which I have referred, emphasise the centrality of fundamental principles in our legal system.  The question which arises, therefore, in the present case, is whether the ""interests of justice"" could accommodate the giving of evidence of the applicant's statement to the Corrective Services Officer during the course of an interview for the purposes of the officer preparing a report as to the applicant's suitability for an intensive correction order.  
78An intensive correction order is an order made by the court directing that a sentence of imprisonment of not more than 2 years imposed on the offender be served in the community:  Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 7.  Part 5 of the Act deals with the sentencing procedures for intensive correction orders.  Section 67 specifies the considerations to which the court is to have regard in determining whether to make an order.  It provides, relevantly, as follows:
""67 Suitability of offender for intensive correction order
(1) An intensive correction order may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied:
(a) that the offender is of or above the age of 18 years, and
(b) that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(c) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(d) that the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the intensive correction order.
(2) In deciding whether or not to make an intensive correction order, the court is to have regard to:
(a) the contents of the assessment report on the offender (prepared under section 70), and
(b) such evidence from the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order.
...
(4) A court may make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment only if the assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community ...""
79Sections 69 and 70 are also relevant.  They provide:
""69 Referral of offender for assessment
(1) Before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community.
(2) A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years.
...
70 Assessment of suitability
(1) When an offender is referred for assessment, the Commissioner of Corrective Services is to investigate and report to the court on the matters referred to in section 67 (1) and such other matters as the regulations may require.
(2) An offender's assessment report:
(a) must take into account, and specifically address, the matters prescribed by the regulations, and

(b) may indicate the nature of any conditions that it would be appropriate for the court to impose on an intensive correction order if such an order is made.
(3) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the conduct of investigations and the preparation of reports for the purposes of this Part.""
80The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010 (NSW), cl 14, provides, relevantly:
14   Assessment reports
(1) An offender's assessment report must take into account, and specifically address, the following matters:
(a) any criminal record of the offender, and the likelihood that the offender will re-offend,
(b) any risks associated with managing the offender in the community (taking into account the offender's response to supervision in the community on previous occasions),
(c) the likelihood that the offender will commit a domestic violence offence,
(d) whether the offender will have suitable residential accommodation for the duration of an intensive correction order,
(e) whether any circumstances of the offender's residence, employment, study or other activities would inhibit effective implementation of an intensive correction order ...
...
(4) An offender's assessment report must also include an assessment of:
(a) factors associated with his or her offending that would be able to be addressed by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and
(b) the availability of resources to address those factors by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and
(c) any issues relevant to the administration of an intensive correction order in respect of the offender that may be relevant to the court's determination of an appropriate date to be fixed for the commencement of the sentence.""
81In summary, therefore, the statement of the applicant was made to a person in authority during the course of an interview, conducted pursuant to an order of the court, made pursuant to statute, for the purposes of assessing the applicant's suitability for an intensive corrections order.  The question asked by the Corrective Services Officer was not part of the information required by the Act and Regulation.  Further, although the applicant was not compelled by law to answer the questions asked by the officer concerned nor was he otherwise required, as a matter of law, to provide information to that officer, there was undoubtedly significant pressure on him to do so, given the circumstances in which he provided the information.  Importantly, the statement was made without any warning to the applicant that the information could be used in evidence against him on the question of his guilt, although it should be accepted that the applicant would, or at least ought to, have appreciated that the report of the interview would be provided to the court for the purposes of sentence.  
82Against that background there are a number of factors that are relevant in determining whether it is capable of being in the interests of justice to grant the prosecution leave to give the post-conviction statement made by the applicant to the Corrective Services Officer.  The relevant factors do not all point in the same direction.  There is the public interest in bringing a wrongdoer to conviction.  There is the consideration to which reference has already been made that a person should be put upon their trial on the available evidence.  However, I do not consider that that factor carries much if any weight in this case.  The legislature has recognised in the enactment of s 18 that fresh evidence may be given, by leave, including by the Crown, on the appeal.  Accordingly, this is not a case analogous to those cases where it has been held that an appellate court should acquit where the ground for quashing the indictment has been an insufficiency of evidence at the trial:  see above at [9]-[10].  
83The post-conviction statement was made in the course of a court ordered process, which was directed to a particular purpose, namely, the assessment of the applicant for a particular sentencing option in circumstances where the magistrate, in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act, s 69 must have already determined to impose a custodial sentence.  In my opinion, it would not be capable of being in the interests of justice to grant leave to adduce that evidence.  The reasons why I consider that this is so relate first to matters personal to the applicant and secondly to broader policy considerations. 
84As I have already indicated, the applicant made the post-conviction statement in circumstances where he had been ordered to attend upon the Corrective Services officer for an assessment to be undertaken for the purposes of a particular sentencing process, namely, whether the Court should make an intensive correction order.  At the commencement of that assessment, the applicant was told by the Corrective Services Officer to tell him what had happened and counselled him to tell the truth.  It is likely that the applicant felt obliged to respond to the direction that he tell the Corrective Services Officer what happened.  There may have been adverse consequences for the applicant if he did not respond, as the Corrective Services Officer may not have been able to make an assessment, or at least a favourable assessment if the applicant did not co-operate in the interview.  The consequence may have been the imposition of a prison sentence:  Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ss 7 and 69. 
85There was no requirement in the statutory prerequisites for the assessment process being undertaken by the Corrective Services Officer to ascertain the underlying facts relating to the conviction from the applicant.  Having determined to do so, the Corrective Services Officer cautioned the applicant, not that anything that he said might be used in evidence against him should the matter be subject to an appeal and possible retrial, but that he should tell the truth.  The potential consequence to the applicant of doing so is that the Crown now seeks to prove its case against the applicant out of his own mouth.  
86Had it not been the requirement, made by court order, that the applicant attend for the purposes of assessment, the evidence the Crown now seeks to use would not have been available.  The admission was made in circumstances where, in a real and practical sense, the applicant was denied his common law right of silence.  That is a right which our legal system has always considered to be fundamental.  The vice, as I see it, was that the admission was obtained in the court ordered process in which the applicant found himself engaged.  I do not consider it is capable of being in the interests of justice that the Crown now be allowed to use the applicant's admission as to the commission of the crime, obtained in these circumstances, to be given on the appeal.  
87Before concluding, there is another matter to which reference needs to be made.  Section 18(2) provides that ""fresh evidence may be given"" (emphasis added) by leave, but only if it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be given.  The case under s 5B was stated in terms that leave had been given that the evidence be ""adduced"".  It is not apparent from the case stated whether the Chief Judge of the District Court had granted leave to adduce the evidence subject to any question of admissibility or whether his Honour's ruling was intended to be a grant of leave to give the evidence, that is, a ruling that the evidence was admissible. 
88The Court was informed by counsel for the applicant that the question of admissibility, as such, had not been determined.  The Crown did not dispute this.  Assuming that to be so, there would be a question whether the evidence would be excluded under the Evidence Act, s 90 or s 137.  It should be emphasised that the ""interests of justice"" is a wider concept than ""unfairness"" to the accused person within the meaning of s 90 or ""unfair prejudice"" within the meaning of s 137.  However, it is not necessary to determine those questions.
Conclusion
89For the reasons I have given, therefore, I would answer the question submitted by Blanch J, Chief Judge of the District Court, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, ""No"".  
90HIDDEN J:  I agree with Beazley P.
91FULLERTON J:  I agree with Beazley P.

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Rothman J. 
2ROTHMAN J: The applicant was convicted after trial in the District Court of attempting to choke with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely indecent assault, contrary to s 37 of the Crimes Act (Count 1). The maximum sentence for the contravention of s 37 of the Crimes Act is 25 years' imprisonment. 
3The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years' imprisonment, commencing 17 January 2012 and concluding 16 January 2019 and a remainder of term of a further 2 years and 4 months, concluding 16 January 2021. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the conviction and sentence. 
4Only one ground of appeal is raised on each of the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal. The grounds of appeal are:
""Appeal against Conviction
1.The jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
Appeal against Sentence
1.The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.""
5Other than an appeal against a conviction on a ground that involves a question of law alone, appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence arise only on the grant of leave: s 5 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Neither ground of appeal, namely, the ground of appeal against conviction nor the ground of appeal against sentence, is a ground of appeal against conviction involving a question of law alone, as a consequence of which the applicant requires leave of the Court. 
Facts
6The complainant was walking down King Street, Newtown, at around 2.00am on 13 January 2012. The complainant first saw the applicant walking towards her. He looked at her; turned as they passed each other, with the complainant seeking to avoid making eye contact. The complainant heard him stop walking and turn back towards her. 
7The applicant walked up behind the complainant, placed his arm around her neck and choked her. The complainant fell to the ground and blacked out. 
8The applicant transferred her into an alley. The complainant, having regained consciousness, fought the applicant and scratched him during the transfer.
9Once in the alley, the applicant threw the complainant to the ground and lay on top of her. A number of persons living nearby heard the commotion and attempted, initially by shouting, to prevent the assault. One such person called Emergency Services. 
10The applicant left the alley, returned to King Street, Newtown, and hailed a taxi. 
11The residents nearby, or some of them, went to the alley and tended to the complainant. The complainant appeared distressed and was bleeding from an injury above her eye. 
12It is uncontested that the applicant did not know the complainant before the assault. It is also uncontested that the applicant approached the complainant from behind and put his right arm around her. Further, there is no contest that the complainant tried to remove the applicant's arm from around her. There is some issue as to whether the right arm, to which reference is made above, was put around the complainant's shoulder or neck, and at the appeal hearing much was sought to be made of the evidence in relation to this discrepancy or inconsistency between the complainant's evidence and that of the applicant. 
Evidence at Trial
13The complainant gave evidence of all of the matters recited in the fact summary above, except that which occurred during the time that she had blacked out. The complainant said she was ""punching, hitting, scratching, anything I could, to try and make him let go"", but is not sure if she made contact (Transcript, page 7, line 13-15). She did not recall inflicting the particular scratch/nail injuries on the applicant, but otherwise testified to all of the facts above. There was independent evidence of some of the matters on which the Crown relied. 
14Mr Samuel Dalley saw the complainant fall, saw the applicant pick her up and turn towards Queen Street, noticed that the complainant had left her bag on the ground, took off his ear phones and crossed the road to pick up the bag. 
15After he removed the ear phones, he heard a female voice saying, ""Get off me"". He then saw the applicant run towards him and pass him in the street. Mr Dalley went to the assistance of the complainant and returned her bag. The complainant swore at him. Mr Dalley noticed that the complainant had an injury to her head and was bleeding. The complainant seemed angry, shaky and frantic. 
16Given the emphasis placed by counsel at trial and the applicant before the Court on the alleged inconsistency of Mr Dalley's evidence with that of the complainant, some further short explanation is required. As is clear from the foregoing, Mr Dalley was walking along King Street with earphones in his ears. 
17He first noticed the complainant when she fell to the ground. It was the fall to the ground that caught his attention. As a consequence, Mr Dalley's evidence is not directly concerned with the initial attack and alleged choking. It is consistent otherwise with the complainant's evidence and, at least to some degree, with the evidence of the applicant as to the later events in the incident.  
18Mr Max Rolon lived on the first floor of an apartment building, the window of which looked out onto the alley at which the events were said to have occurred. He heard a scream of ""help me"", which seemed like it was coming from directly below his window. 
19He saw a person lying on top of another in the alleyway and could hear a female voice saying ""Help me. Get off me"". Mr Rolon saw the applicant rise onto all fours. He was wearing clothing consistent with that described by Mr Dalley. Mr Rolon screamed out to the applicant and immediately dressed and went downstairs. Mr Rolon described the complainant as in emotional distress with a bleeding eyebrow. 
20Despite the submissions in this Court, Mr Rolon's evidence (and Ms Flockhart's evidence) is consistent with the evidence of the complainant and directly inconsistent with the applicant's evidence that he did not lie on top of the complainant. 
21Ms Kirsty Flockhart was a neighbour who also heard the noise. She lived with Mr Rolon and confirmed his evidence, or that part of it which related to the events before Mr Rolon left the apartment to tend to the complainant. Ms Flockhart called the Emergency Services. After calling Emergency Services, Ms Flockhart also went to the alley and described the complainant as ""very upset, really disoriented, really upset, she was crying and had lots of cuts and visible injuries"". 
22Mr Anthony Fleming was another neighbour awoken by the noise in the alley. He too heard a female voice shouting for assistance and went to the aid of the complainant. 
23Mr Richard Scott seems to have heard events earlier than those that occurred in the alley. He heard a female voice saying words to the effect of: ""No I don't want to come with you"" or ""I don't want to come to your house"". He was not sure of the exact words. 
24About 35 to 40 seconds later, he heard incoherent screaming. He went onto his balcony and saw a man across the road, who called out ""Call the police"". The man picked up a large handbag and walked towards the woman. Mr Scott then also went to the assistance of the complainant. He described her as having a mark on her face and looking ""very distressed"". He did not see the applicant. 
25There was police evidence, the most relevant aspect of which is the evidence of an interview of the applicant, being an electronically recorded interview of a suspected person (ERISP), which is Exhibit 8 in the proceedings. The ERISP was generally to the effect that the applicant did not wish to answer questions and gave, in response to some questions, an alleged alibi. The police asked the applicant why his DNA was found under the complainant's fingers, to which the applicant replied:  ""You've got me red-handed"". He then showed the police his right forearm with four bits of skin missing. He then said ""I've pretty much conceded the whole case"" and said he did not wish to answer anything further. Notwithstanding the last mentioned attitude, the applicant, later in questioning, admitted he was the person shown on CCTV footage and, in answer to a question put to him by police that he choked the complainant and dragged her into Queen Street, the applicant responded by saying: ""Correct"". 
26A DNA sample was taken from the applicant and it matched the DNA found under the fingernails of the complainant. The CCTV footage showed the applicant at a nightclub, standing outside the club, walking down George Street and a few other streets, before arriving at King Street and crossing paths with the complainant. It also showed the applicant hailing a taxi and leaving in the taxi. 
27Evidence was also adduced from other police and from experts, which it is unnecessary to recite in these reasons. It is desirable to summarise the evidence of Dr Rosemary Isaacs, a General Practitioner specialising in sexual assault. Dr Isaacs examined the complainant, who was not, at that time, in physical distress, but her eyes were red, she had limited neck movement and there was a red mark on the right side of her neck. The complainant had a small abrasion above her right eye. There were five bruises and two abrasions on her right arm; there was an abrasion on her left arm; there was an area of tenderness on her back. 
28Dr Isaacs described these injuries as consistent with the history given by the complainant of the man grabbing her around the neck with his elbow; her struggling; blacking out and being dragged by him. 
29Dr Isaacs opined that the application of pressure to the complainant's neck with the crook of the applicant's elbow could have caused her to lose consciousness. Dr Isaacs said that there would not necessarily be bruising on the neck. Nor would she necessarily expect it. Dr Isaacs saw the complainant some 14 to 15 hours after the alleged incident had occurred. 
30Dr Duflou is the Chief Forensic Pathologist of the Department of Forensic Medicine in Sydney and gave evidence for the applicant. His evidence was, it seems, affected by an understanding that the choking, if it were to have occurred, was by the hands of the applicant. When cross-examined on the basis that the strangulation occurred by the crook of the elbow, Dr Duflou's evidence as to the expectation of reddening and fullness in the complainant's face or haemorrhages in the eyes and fingernail impressions on the neck was significantly qualified. As a consequence, there was little or no inconsistency between the medical practitioners.
31The applicant gave evidence as to his use of prescription drugs (Zoloft) and the evidence otherwise admitted identity and basic facts, although did not admit the offence. 
32The applicant gave evidence of seeing the complainant, following her in the street and perceiving that she was looking at him through the reflection of a window on a number of occasions. 
33The applicant then testified to the fact that he went over to the complainant and ""gave her a hug""; placed his right arm around her shoulders with her neck in the crook of his arm. She was startled. The applicant denied choking her or squeezing her arm but realised that she was scratching his arm so he pulled his arm back forcefully. The complainant stumbled and fell onto the pavement. 
34The applicant kneeled beside the complainant and tried to grab her nails and remove any DNA evidence. 
35The applicant testified that he removed the complainant to the alley because the light was brighter and he could better remove the remnants of his DNA. He heard and saw the person across the road, while he was in Queen Street and heard and saw the commotion by residents. The applicant denied any sexual intent towards the complainant and sought to give innocent explanations for the inculpatory answers given to police during the ERISP. 
Argument on Appeal 
36The applicant for leave to appeal has filed with the Court two lengthy sets of handwritten submissions, one of them received on 15 August 2014 of approximately 82 pages and the second sent on 2 December 2014 of some 83 pages. Neither of those handwritten submissions specify or clarify the manner in which it is said the verdict was unreasonable. Nor do they detail the manner in which it is said, or the reason it is said, the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
37Because the applicant for leave to appeal is unrepresented, more attention has been paid to the evidence in the proceedings than might be warranted by the content of the written submissions. Further, the applicant at the hearing of the appeal, at least through cross-examination, seemed to indicate some areas on which he was relying for the unreasonable verdict ground. 
38During the course of the written submissions, the applicant relied upon ""grounds of appeal"" not contained in the appeal to the Court, which I have taken to be particulars of the ground of appeal. Those particulars were that: there was a lack of reasonable particulars provided pre-trial by the prosecution in respect of how the offence had been effected, as a consequence of which, the specific acts which gave rise to the allegation were effectively concealed and Legal Aid appointed defence counsel failed in their preparation of a defence; the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; Legal Aid appointed defence counsel proved most incompetent not appreciating any of the applicant's pre-trial verbal and written instructions for an appropriate line of enquiry to be pursued of the respective Crown witnesses, whereby a verdict of acquittal was accordingly lost to the applicant; there was no fair trial according to law; the Crown prosecutor failed to put, in cross-examination of the applicant, the allegation of the manner in which the offence was said to be committed, which, it is said, was physically impossible; there was an incorrect summary by the trial judge of an expert witness's testimony; and, the ERISP ought not have been admitted. 
39Ultimately, as seems to have been put in cross-examination during this appeal of the applicant's counsel at trial and instructing solicitor at trial, all of the particulars and the unreasonable verdict allegation derive from what is alleged to have been the physical impossibility of the applicant sustaining the scratch marks in the manner which was described by the Crown. 
40As a consequence, the expert evidence was said to be incorrect, the trial was said to be unfair, the Crown did not put to the applicant the precise manner in which the injury to the complainant occurred (and therefore how the injury to his arm occurred), there was a lack of particulars of the precise mechanism by which the injury to the complainant occurred and, as a consequence of all of that, the jury's verdict was said to be unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 
41The injury to the complainant to which the foregoing refers is the choking and rendering unconsciousness. The injury to the applicant is a series of fingernail marks in the applicant's right forearm. The applicant submits that the location of the injury to his forearm on the distal edge (on top of that edge of the forearm closest to the radius bone) and the placing of the scratch marks at that point is inconsistent with the forearm being in the position described by the complainant and described by the Crown in its opening and closing addresses. 
42Nothing was put at the hearing of the appeal relating to the appeal against sentence. There is little in the written submissions relevant to it. To the extent that anything by way of submission is put in writing, the submissions concentrate on the fact that the sexual offence, being indecent assault, only carries a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment. Yet, the sentence imposed upon the applicant was for a non-parole period of 7 years. 
43The applicant does not differentiate between the indecent assault as an element of a much more serious offence and the maximum sentence for indecent assault itself. 
Consideration
44Essentially, the applicant's case on appeal depends upon the location of the injuries to his arm and the purported amended discrepancy in the description of how those injuries were sustained. 
45Because of the applicant's perception of inconsistency in evidence and impossibility of occurrence, the applicant accuses his counsel and solicitor at trial of incompetence or failure to put the instructions given to them, or both. None of that allegation is made out. 
46Ms Mayne, the solicitor at trial, gave evidence in the appeal. Her evidence was compelling and displayed a remarkable knowledge of the facts of the case and organisation of material provided, at length, by the applicant to the Legal Aid Commission. Those notes and that evidence confirm that the trial was conducted wholly in accordance with the instructions of the applicant. 
47Counsel in the trial, Mr Averre, likewise, while not having access to notes of the trial, displayed a remarkable memory of a trial that occurred two years earlier and the details of the examination, cross-examination and address that occurred during the course of the trial. His memory of the instructions received from the applicant was also compelling. 
48Contrary to the applicant's submissions, each of the applicant's solicitor and barrister dealt with all of their instructions appropriately and competently. A study of the transcript at trial discloses that cross-examination was competent and appropriate and tested all that was necessary to test in order to disclose, to the best advantage, the applicant's instructions. 
49The fundamental difficulty faced by the applicant is that his case depends upon a perception by him of that which the Crown and the complainant said about the injuries to his arm and the manner in which he ""choked"" the complainant. That perception was, in significant respects, incorrect. 
50The complainant was aware that she had scratched (or dug her nails into) the applicant's forearm, but was unsure, or did not recollect, precisely when it was that injury was inflicted. Thus, the evidence of the applicant that it was inflicted at the time that the arm was on the ""shoulders"" and/or ""neck"" was uncontroverted. It also occurred just before, or at the time that, the complainant was rendered unconscious. 
51Thus, there is no discrepancy in the timing of the infliction of the injury to his forearm. 
52Secondly, and far more importantly, the applicant's recollection of the Crown address is significantly in error. During the Crown opening (AB201, transcript 28.11.12, page 3) the incident was relevantly described in the following way:
""She [the complainant] will tell the Court I expect that when she got to the next corner, which is Queen Street, a fairly quiet street, the man came up behind her. He put his arm around her throat and proceeded to apply pressure to her. He said nothing. At this stage [the complainant] had a large shoulder strap bag on her shoulder. The Crown says that the accused applied so much pressure that she blacked out momentarily, causing her to drop the bag. The accused made no attempt to take the bag or look in the bag and indeed ignored the bag and dragged her down Queen Street...""
53In the closing address (AB401, Transcript 4.12.12, page 28) the Crown said:
""And she [the complainant] did glance in the window when she realised that he was following her and she started to go faster and the accused, he thinks that this is some sort of amorous engagement, runs after her. And the Crown says he put her in a headlock with his arms squeezing, applying quite some force. 
She drops her bag, he has no interest in her bag. He makes no demand for money or property. Doesn't look in the bag. His interest is in her. 
She passes out. You might have thought that the scuff marks on the top of the boots where he dragged her, she said that those scuff marks weren't there before this altercation.""
Later in the closing address, the Crown says (AB402, Transcript 4.12.12, page 29):
""The accused has scratch marks on his right arm. The photograph. You might think that where those scratch marks are, very much supports the evidence of [the complainant]. If someone had their arm around your neck, and you were trying to get them off, the obvious way to do it would be to reach around and try and wrench them off, leaving marks in the position where you might expect to find it. Not if someone just puts their arm around you in a hug. How would you get scratch [marks] on the outside of the arm, you just push the arm away and run.
Well [the complainant] had no opportunity to run, she was in a serious headlock and she wasn't motioned down the alleyway. She was dragged while she was unconscious and then she was very much frogmarched down there and she was thrown on the ground. 
You have all the injuries, you will see the photographs.""
54The applicant submits to this Court that there was a change in the Crown position relating to the position of his arm during the choking incident. There is no significant or substantial change in the position described by the Crown. That was the evidence of Mr Averre. That evidence is corroborated by the transcript. 
55The misperception of the applicant was disclosed during the course of his cross-examination of Ms Mayne, the solicitor at trial. In demonstrating to her a position of the arm, he described the expert evidence (and some of the inferences available from the lay evidence) as the pressure being placed on the neck by the ""crook of the elbow"". The display of the applicant, during the course of cross-examination, was that the elbow was at the front of the neck. Nowhere, in the evidence or the submissions, is it suggested that the elbow was at the front of the neck. 
56The evidence both of the experts and lay witnesses, together with the addresses of the Crown both in opening and in closing, are consistent with the crook of the elbow being at the side of the neck, not at the front of the neck. Thus, the evidence is consistent with the applicant's evidence that that the upper part of the arm (the humerus) was at the back of the neck, the elbow was bent at the side of the neck and the forearm was at the front of the neck. 
57The foregoing positioning of the arm, which seems to be the only available position on the evidence before the Court below and before this Court, renders unarguable the applicant's submission that the infliction of the injury in that position was impossible and renders any submission as to inconsistency and lack of cross-examination unsustainable. 
58Because the applicant is unrepresented, I have paid more attention to the evidence even though no submission was addressed to it other than as dealt with above. There is no aspect of the trial, including the conduct and competence of counsel or solicitor, that has occasioned the miscarriage of justice or rendered the trial anything other than a fair trial.  
59More importantly, the evidence in the proceedings would not even arguably suggest that it was not open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted. I have no doubt of the kind that would suggest there was an insufficiency of evidence or that would involve a reasonable doubt as to the conclusion reached by the jury: see Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473; M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623-624; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400. 
60I have no doubt, reasonable or otherwise, as to the guilt of the accused and the appeal against conviction is, in my view, untenable. 
61Ultimately, the expert evidence supported the version of events described by the complainant. The independent witnesses supported the version of events given by the complainant. Each class of evidence was materially inconsistent with the version of events given by the applicant. The criticism of the evidence of Mr Dalley as inconsistent with the evidence of the complainant misunderstands the circumstance that the observations of Mr Dalley occurred after the initial contact by the applicant, at the time immediately after the complainant lost consciousness. As a consequence there is, in the expert and independent evidence, only corroboration of the complainant's version and significant inconsistency with the version given by the applicant.
62As earlier stated, in relation to the sentence appeal, the applicant's submission concentrates on the maximum sentence available for indecent assault without regard to the fact that, in the offence here charged, the indecent assault is but one ingredient or element of the far more serious offence of which the applicant was convicted. 
63The maximum sentence for the instant offence is 25 years' imprisonment. The applicant was convicted after trial and, notwithstanding the subjective factors to which the sentencing judge referred, a sentence of a non-parole period of 7 years with a remainder of term of 2 years and 4 months, commencing 17 January 2012 is neither out of the range available to the sentencing judge for this offence and this offender nor manifestly excessive. 
64While the foregoing expression of view as to manifest excess is a conclusion, it is based upon the findings of fact of the sentencing judge as to the circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender and relates, particularly, to the range of sentences that have been imposed for such an offence, bearing in mind that there are few such examples. 
65The expression of opinion takes account of the circumstances of the offence described above, the intoxication of the applicant and the applicant's brain and/or psychiatric injuries. The sentencing judge took into account that the offence that was ultimately committed after the choking was an indecent assault and not sexual intercourse without consent, thus lessening the culpability of the applicant, but also that the offence was interrupted by the conduct of the surrounding residents and others who observed or heard what was occurring. 
66There is no error of principle or error that would warrant this Court interfering or considering interference with the sentencing discretion exercised by the trial judge: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. The sentence is consistent with the statutory regime and within the range of sentences available and is not manifestly excessive. 
67For the foregoing reasons, I consider that the ground of appeal on conviction and the ground of appeal on sentence are untenable and do not warrant the grant of leave to appeal. I propose that the Court refuse leave to appeal. 
68WILSON J: I agree with Rothman J. The question of leave is one which involves consideration of the merits of the proposed appeal; in my opinion the grounds advanced by the applicant in support of both his conviction and sentence appeals are wholly lacking in merit.
69I wish to fully endorse the observations of Rothman J with respect to the evidence given before this Court by Ms. Mayne and Mr. Averre, the applicant's solicitor and counsel respectively at trial. Ms. Mayne was an impressive witness who was clearly an extremely capable solicitor; she had a thorough grasp of the applicant's case, her memory of it being significantly aided by the comprehensive file notes and records that she had taken and maintained. The practice of making thorough contemporaneous notes bespeaks her professionalism. Mr. Averre too was a witness of integrity. I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of each.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765662,R v Bugmy (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 322,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ: William David Bugmy (the respondent), pleaded guilty on 17 May 2011 to two counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer whilst in the execution of duty contrary to s 60A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Act) and one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Act.
2The facts and circumstances giving rise to the offence are set out in the judgment of Rothman J, which I have had the benefit of reading in draft, and it is unnecessary to repeat them.  His Honour also has set out the aggravating circumstances surrounding the offence as found by the sentencing judge and the sentencing judge's findings of the subjective circumstances of the respondent.
3The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of 8 months commencing on 8 January 2011 in respect of the first two counts and a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 8 April 2011 in respect of the third count.  In imposing these sentences, his Honour allowed a discount of 25% for an early plea.
4The Crown appealed to this Court, initially upon the ground that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.  Subsequently, three further grounds were added: His Honour failed to properly determine the objective seriousness of the offence; His Honour failed to properly acknowledge the category of the victim as a serving prison officer in the lawful performance of his duties; and the weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
5On 18 October 2012 this Court allowed the appeal in respect of the sentence imposed on the third count and resentenced the respondent on that count to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 8 April 2011 and to expire on 7 April 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 8 April 2016 and to expire on 7 October 2018: R v Bugmy [2012] NSWCCA 223 (the first appeal)
6In reaching this conclusion the Court determined that the three additional grounds of appeal were made out.  In relation to the first and second grounds, the Court concluded that the primary judge erred in finding that the offence was at or about the mid-range of seriousness for the type of offence in question and should have concluded that the offence was somewhere between mid-range and somewhat above mid-range: the first appeal at [31]-[33].
7In relation to the third ground, the Court concluded that the sentencing judge had failed to give adequate weight to the respondent's bad criminal record and that he erred in taking into account the respondent's mental illness so as to reduce the weight to be given to general deterrence in circumstances where it was conceded that his mental illness had nothing to do with the offence: the first appeal at [41]-[43].
8The Court also expressed the view that with the passage of time the extent to which social deprivation in a person's youth and background can be taken into account must diminish: the first appeal at [50].
9The High Court allowed an appeal from this decision: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 (the High Court decision).  The Court described the additional three grounds as particulars of manifest inadequacy and indicated that this Court, in those circumstances, erred in resentencing without deciding whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate: the High Court decision at [22]-[24] and [55].  The plurality also held that this Court erred in stating that the evidence of the respondent's deprived background lost much of its force when viewed against the background of his previous offences: the High Court decision at [42] and [43]. 
10In these circumstances, the matter was remitted to this Court.
11Two issues thus arise.  First, was the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge manifestly inadequate, second, if so, should this Court in the exercise of its residual discretion decline to resentence the respondent?
Manifest inadequacy
12For manifest inadequacy to be made out it must be established that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25].  Put another way, it is necessary to establish that the sentence was outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed, such that the appellate court concludes there must have been some misapplication of principle even though when or how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59] and Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58].
13The submissions of each of the parties in the present case tended to focus upon individual errors rather than on the question of whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  This was to some extent to repeat the approach criticised in the High Court decision.
14In the present case I am of the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  It was a serious assault done with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to a law enforcement officer going about his duties.  The assault was unprovoked and had tragic consequences for the victim.  Further, although it could not be described as premeditated, it was a culmination of a course of conduct which indicated a clear intention to inflict serious harm.
15In that context it must be remembered that the maximum penalty for the third count was 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
16It is of course necessary to take the respondent's subjective circumstances into account.  Further, weight must be given to the respondent's deprived background, taking into account, while his inability to control his violent approach to frustration reduces his moral culpability, it also emphasises the need to take into account the protection of the community and the need for personal deterrence: the High Court decision at [44] and [45], R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 and Munda v State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600 (Munda) at [54]-[58].  In this regard the respondent's lengthy criminal record for violent offences is particularly relevant.
17Taking these factors into account I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed on the respondent was manifestly inadequate.
The residual discretion
18The residual discretion is to be exercised having regard to the fact that the principal purpose of a Crown sentence appeal is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 (Green) at [1].  In that case the plurality described the purpose as a limiting purpose, not extending to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges: Green at [36].  In Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; (2010) 31 VR 634 the Victorian Court of Appeal at [104] stated that factors which might be relevant include delay, parity, the totality principle, rehabilitation and fault on the part of the Crown.  To that may be added, the imminence of the release of the respondent on parole: Munda at [72].
19The respondent pleaded guilty to the offence in question on 17 May 2011.  He was not sentenced for a period of nine months, the Court of Appeal setting aside his sentence five months later.  The judgment of the High Court was delivered approximately 12 months thereafter and a further year elapsed before the remitted proceedings were heard.  Without ascribing fault at all, the delay in this case has been significant.
20It should further be noted that the respondent is eligible for parole on 8 April 2015.  
21Further, any guidance as to the relevant sentencing principles will have been given in the High Court decision.  No further guidance will be given by this Court resentencing.
22In these circumstances the residual discretion should be exercised in favour of the respondent and the appeal dismissed.
23ROTHMAN J: The Court has before it an appeal by the Crown against the sentence imposed by the District Court on the respondent, William David Bugmy. The respondent entered a plea of guilty to three offences: two counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer while in the execution of officer's duty, although no actual bodily harm is occasioned, contrary to s 60A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900; and one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
24The High Court of Australia, after a successful appeal from an earlier judgment of this Court, remitted the Crown's appeal to the Court (Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2012) 249 CLR 571) and the Court is required to deal with the appeal afresh. 
Facts
25It is, as a matter of completeness, necessary to re-state the facts relevant to the sentencing exercise. Those facts have been summarised a number of times: first, by the sentencing judge; by an earlier judgment of this Court (R v Bugmy [2012] NSWCCA 223); and in the High Court. Necessarily, each summary depends upon Agreed Facts that were before the sentencing judge. 
26Before re-stating those facts, it is appropriate to set out the history of the charges and proceedings. 
27On 8 January 2011, the respondent was a remand prisoner in the Broken Hill area and assaulted Corrective Services Officers. He was charged with three offences:
(i)On 8 January 2011 at Broken Hill [the respondent] did assault Steven Pitt, a Corrective Services Officer, while in the execution of his duty, contrary to s 60A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years;
(ii)On 8 January 2011, at Broken Hill [the respondent] did assault John Donnelly, a Corrective Services Officer, while in the execution of his duty, contrary to s 60A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years;
(iii)On 8 January 2011, at Broken Hill [the respondent] did cause grievous bodily to Jason Gould with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years and which has a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
28The respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and on 16 February 2012 he was sentenced in the District Court as follows:
Counts 1 and 2: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 8 months to commence on 8 January 2011 and expire on 7 September 2011;
Court 3: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 8 April 2011 and expire on 7 April 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 7 April 2017. 
29The total effective sentence was non-parole period of 4 years and three months with a balance of term of a further 2 years. 
30Pursuant to the provisions of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against that sentence. The ground of appeal, in that appeal, was that: 
""The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate"". 
Certain particulars were advanced, in the following terms:
(i)His Honour failed properly to determine the objective seriousness of the offence;
(ii)His Honour failed properly to acknowledge the category of the victim as a serving Prison Officer in the lawful performance of his duty;
(iii)The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence;
31On 18 October 2012, this Court allowed the Crown appeal in relation to Count 3, quashed the sentence imposed in the District Court on that count, substituting a more severe sentence, and dismissed the appeal against Counts 1 and 2.  
32From the orders of the Court, the respondent to this appeal sought leave to appeal and, once leave was granted, appealed to the High Court of Australia. On 2 October 2013, the High Court allowed the appeal, set aside orders 1, 3 and 4 of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 18 October 2012, and remitted the matter to the Court to deal with in accordance with law. The Court now deals with the Crown appeal in accordance with the orders of the High Court of Australia. 
33As earlier stated, there was an Agreed Facts Statement tendered by the Crown, which was marked as Exhibit A in the sentencing proceedings. Even though the appeal now before the Court concerns only Count 3 (the appeals in counts 1 and 2 having been dismissed by the earlier judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal and not disturbed in the High Court), the facts will include those matters that gave rise to the charges in Counts 1 and 2, otherwise the context of the offence in Count 3 would be lacking. 
34On 8 January 2011, the respondent was on remand at Broken Hill Correctional Centre. Jason Gould, a Senior Correctional Officer, was on duty and heard the respondent arguing with another correctional officer, Correctional Officer Caldwell. SCO Gould approached the respondent and made an enquiry, the contents of which are not set out in the Agreed Facts. 
35The respondent was upset that a proposed visitor to him may not be able to arrive before the expiry of visiting hours. SCO Gould offered to find out if visiting hours could be extended to accommodate the visitor's later arrival from Senior Officer Merton.
36The respondent followed SCO Gould into the wing in which the office was located and where Officers Gould and Caldwell were standing. The respondent was prohibited from entering the office. 
37The respondent said he would fight SCO Gould and made various threats, including ""I'll split you open"". 
38SCO Gould called his superior, Assistant Superintendent Pitt and advised him that the emergency team might be required to attend his location. The respondent then walked away. Some minutes later Assistant Superintendent Pitt attended the office. 
39A few minutes later, the respondent was involved in a telephone conversation with his girlfriend, during which the respondent threatened to ""split Gould open"". At or about that time, Officers Pitt and Donnelly entered the yard to speak with the respondent. At the end of the phone call, Officer Pitt asked the respondent ""how did you go?"". The respondent replied:
""That cocksucker, I'll get him"".
40Officer Pitt explained that he meant the phone call and the respondent replied ""come on, you want a piece of me, I'll split you c_ _t""
41The respondent ran to a nearby pool table and held up a number of pool balls as if threatening to throw them at Officers Pitt and Donnelly. Officers Pitt and Donnelly retreated as two balls were thrown, one narrowly missing Officer Pitt. While throwing the pool balls the respondent yelled: 
""Come on c_ _ ts, come on I'll split youse"".
42The foregoing assaults are Counts 1 and 2 in the original charges. 
43Officers Pitt and Donnelly called for assistance. Senior Correctional Officer Gould came into the yard. When the respondent saw SCO Gould he began throwing pool balls in his direction and said: 
""Gould you c _ _ t, I told you I am going to split you open"".
44The respondent then threw two pool balls at SCO Gould, which struck him in the back. The respondent ran into the yard while SCO Gould went into the office. When SCO Gould was attempting to close the office door, the respondent threw one or two pool balls at SCO Gould, one of which struck him in the left eye. This last assault was that which was charged in Count 3 and is the offence with which the Court must deal. 
45The ball was subsequently found to have broken into three pieces, which his Honour accepted occurred during the assault (ROS, 7) and was not broken before it was thrown. 
46The respondent continued to throw pool balls at the correctional officers before climbing onto the gym roof, carrying a number of pool balls. The respondent threw some of these towards the officers, however none struck anybody. Later, the respondent descended from the roof and surrendered to officers. 
Remarks on Sentence
47The sentencing judge noted that SCO Gould's eye injury was serious and included retinal detachment and orbital fractures, including a ruptured globe and total iris disruption (ROS, 5). His Honour also noted that SCO Gould was required to undergo a number of operations, including a bone graft from his hip to repair the bone around the eye, and the insertion of metal plates in the orbital floor and cheek. These procedures left SCO Gould in considerable pain and the mental plates were removed 8 months later (ROS, 5). SCO Gould was, at the time of sentencing, on the waiting list for a donor corneal tissue transplant as his left cornea was completely decompensated (ROS, 5). 
48The sentencing judge noted that SCO Gould was a Correctional Services Officer, which, in the correct view of the sentencing judge, was an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS, 6). His Honour considered that the nature of this aggravating factor made general deterrence more relevant but noted, correctly, that the respondent's mental health issues must be considered in relation to those aspects (ROS, 16). 
49The sentencing judge noted that SCO Gould has, as a result of the injuries to him, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, has essentially lost his career, and has significant ongoing psychological issues. During the sentencing proceedings, the respondent's counsel conceded that significant psychological harm was inflicted on SCO Gould, justifying the finding of aggravation in accordance with s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. His Honour made it clear that, in sentencing the respondent, he took into account the psychological harm, but not the physical injury as that was an essential element of the maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm for which he was sentencing (ROS, 6). 
50His Honour took account of the use of the pool ball as a weapon as an aggravating factor to which s 21A(2)(c) refers and agreed with the Crown that the respondent used the weapon available to him at the time (ROS, 6-7): Nowak v R [2008] NSWCCA 89; (2008) 183 A Crim R 526 at [15]-[17]. 
51The sentencing judge also noted the respondent's substantial criminal record, particularly for matters of violence, both as an adult and as a juvenile and the fact that the respondent was on remand for charges of assault police (and other associated charges), for which the respondent had not yet been sentenced. His Honour utilised the prior convictions as an aggravating feature, particularly with reference to the attitude of disobedience of the law and the increased weight to be given to retribution, deterrence (relevantly personal deterrence) and the protection of society and, in so doing, expressly referred to the judgment of the Court in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566, applying Veen v R (No 2) [1998] HCA 14; (1998) 164 CLR 465 and Weininger v R [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629. 
52His Honour considered the subjective circumstances of the offender in depth. While the Crown takes issue with the weight his Honour gave to the subjective circumstances, no issue has been taken by either party to the accuracy of his Honour's statement of those circumstances. 
53The respondent was 29 years of age at the time of the offending (ROS, 3) and his early life exposed him to significant violence and alcohol abuse and limited his education to year 7. As a consequence, the respondent's literacy and numeracy skills were poor (ROS, 10). 
54The respondent's childhood also saw him utilise substances of addiction and he commenced using cannabis and alcohol at the age of 12 years and has developed a high degree of dependency on both of these substances (ROS, 11). 
55Rehabilitation has not occurred, although the respondent had previously indicated a willingness to enter into residential rehabilitation (ROS, 11). 
56There were two forensic psychiatrist reports upon which his Honour relied, being reports of Dr Westmore. While the respondent is a poor historian in terms of his own life, the psychiatric reports disclose that the respondent has experienced auditory hallucinations of uncertain origin, probably as a result of alcohol abuse (ROS, 11-12). The reports note that the respondent was on anti-psychotic medication at the time of review, which appeared to assist him. No particular diagnosis was given, however it was noted that the respondent has a Conduct Disorder, Alcohol Abuse Disorder, Alcohol Amnesic Disorder, Substance Abuse Disorder and probable episodes of depression, together with brain damage likely caused by early alcohol consumption or an early head injury (ROS, 12). Neither report establishes a link between the mental disorders or illness and the offending behaviour (ROS, 12).
57His Honour, in his Sentencing Remarks, referred expressly to the judgments in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and allowed some moderation to the weight to be given to general deterrence because of the issues associated with the psychiatric and/or brain injury from which the respondent suffered (ROS, 13). The respondent has spent a considerable amount of time in custody. 
58The sentencing judge noted that the respondent was of Aboriginal descent and grew up in circumstances of social deprivation and in a dysfunctional environment associated with alcohol and abuse. His Honour held that the principles in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and R v Kennedy [2013] NSWSC 1940 were required to be considered (ROS, 14). 
59His Honour examined the statistics for offences of like-kind and expressly referred to the need to impose a sentence that is proportionate to the criminality of the offence (ROS, 14-15). 
60The respondent had, at the time of sentencing, been held in segregation due to the finding of a syringe in his bag. His Honour took the view that such a factor would not reduce the sentence significantly, but was prepared to take it into account in the finding of special circumstances (ROS, 14). His Honour also noted that the respondent was in danger of being institutionalised and had a great need for intensive residential full-time rehabilitation, which factors operated in favour of a finding of special circumstances, despite the respondent's extensive criminal history (ROS, 16-17). 
61His Honour allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty (ROS, 2) and noted that the degree of accumulation should not be significant (ROS, 16). His Honour recommended release at the expiration of the non-parole period, subject to supervision that may require treatment for alcohol and substance abuse in a residential program (ROS, 18). 
Principles on Sentencing and Appeal
62To a large extent the principles applied by this Court in dealing with a Crown appeal are well-known and do not need restating in full. Nevertheless, given the history of this litigation, it is appropriate to summarise, albeit very briefly, the relevant principles to be applied on this appeal. 
63An appeal is a creature of statute, otherwise unknown to the common law (except to the extent included within the writs of certiorari: see Marbury v Madison (1803) 5 US 137). A Crown appeal, even within the provisions for statutory appeals, is a recent and relatively rare enactment. Once there is provision for a Crown appeal as of right (see s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912), the appeal must be dealt with in accordance with law. 
64Until the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 there existed a discretion, unqualified by statute, to dismiss a Crown appeal against sentence or refuse to impose a less severe sentence in any such appeal on the basis of ""double jeopardy"", being the difficulty, distress and anxiety caused by the prospect that the offender will be sentenced twice for the same offence. 
65Notwithstanding the provisions of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, there remains a residual discretion to be exercised by this Court to dismiss a Crown appeal against sentence: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7; Bugmy v R (HC) at [24]; Green R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [26] and [131]; Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP) (Vic) v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; (2010) 206 A Crim R 14 at [99]-[105]; R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; (2010) 77 NSWLR 45.
66It is unnecessary and inappropriate to set out exhaustively or to define precisely the many reasons that, as a matter of discretion, might form a basis upon which the Court may dismiss an appeal utilising the residual discretion. Some have been mentioned in the foregoing authorities. In Green & Quinn, Bell J referred to an appellant's progress to reform and the closeness to the date of their eligibility for parole as two such bases for exercise of the residual discretion. In Karazisis, Ashley, Redlich and Weinberg JJA referred to delay, parity, the totality principle, rehabilitation, fault on the part of the Crown, and lack of fault on the part of the appellant as factors, each of which is far removed from double jeopardy, yet would be easily seen as factors justifying the exercise of the residual discretion in any given case. 
67The principles on the exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss an appeal regardless of the view of the Court that there may be error, either identifiable or manifest, are an important starting point not only because they govern the exercise of the Court's discretion in this case, but also because they were the subject of comment in Bugmy in the High Court. The High Court, at [24], commented that the Court was ""required to consider whether the Director's Appeal should nonetheless be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion"". As such, it is necessary in this appeal to consider the issue. 
68Otherwise the principles on appeal, and on a Crown appeal, are well-known and established. So too, are the principles in sentencing. 
69Sentencing is a process of intuitive synthesis, in which the sentencing judge imposes a sentence appropriate to the offence that was committed and the offender who committed it. A process of intuitive synthesis is, in part, involved because the purposes of sentencing are overlapping, cannot be considered in isolation from each other and often point in different directions. 
70Those purposes are prescribed by s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and include the protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. Obviously, in an ideal world, a guarantee as to the rehabilitation of an offender would be the best personal deterrent and prevent reoffending. Yet, rehabilitation is not a guaranteed outcome. Moreover, such an approach would necessarily ignore the need for adequate punishment for an offence already committed and the need for general deterrence of others who may be tempted to offend. 
71The fixing of an appropriate sentence must take into account each of those factors and seek to impose a sentence that accords with each of those purposes in a manner appropriate for the offence and the offender. Often the particular issues faced by an offender will dictate the nature of the sentence and its structure. The fixing of a sentence and its structure is not a mechanical or mathematical exercise and, within the range of sentences that are available for the offence and the offender in question, different judges may structure a sentence differently. There is no one correct sentence that may be imposed. 
72As a consequence of the foregoing principles, and the nature of the exercise undertaken in sentencing, there are established principles limiting the basis upon which this Court will interfere with the imposition of a sentence on appeal. The Court will not merely substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge and the mere fact, if it be the fact, that one or more judges of this Court would have sentenced on a different basis or with a different structure will not, of itself, allow the Court to intervene. 
73The Court will intervene when error, either identifiable or manifest, has been disclosed. That error must involve a mistake of law, acting on a mistake of fact, the misapplication of principle, taking into account irrelevant factors or not taking into account all relevant factors. Where an error of the foregoing kind cannot be identified, the Court will intervene only where the result is such that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust and the Court can therefore infer that there has been a failure to exercise the discretion properly. 
Ground of Appeal: Manifest Inadequacy
74The Court will deal with the particulars of inadequacy as part of dealing with the one and only ground on which the Crown relies. As earlier stated, in order for the Crown to establish that the sentence imposed in the District Court was manifestly inadequate, the Crown must establish that the sentence with which the Court is now dealing was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  There is no single correct sentence and a sentencing judge ""should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected"": Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26], cited with approval in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58]. 
75In Hili & Jones, the plurality discussed manifest inadequacy and referred to the judgments of the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 and Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 to the effect that manifest inadequacy is a conclusion and not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from sentences that have been imposed in other cases. It is justified when the sentence imposed is outside the range of available sentences in all of the circumstances of the case: Bugmy (HC) at [52] per Gageler J, citing Hili & Jones at [58]-[60].
76As was made clear by the High Court in Bugmy, the Court of Criminal Appeal on the earlier occasion did not deal with the question of manifest inadequacy, nor the residual discretion. 
77Before discussing the particulars provided to support its submission that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, it is appropriate to emphasise one particular aspect of the sentence imposed. 
78The aggregate sentence imposed for all of the counts before the sentencing judge was, as earlier stated, a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months with a further 2 years remainder of sentence. One aspect of the sentence that has not been given sufficient attention, particularly when one is dealing with a submission of manifest inadequacy, is the recommendation or condition of release on parole, at the conclusion of the non-parole period, that the offender undergo full-time residential rehabilitation. Most of such courses are a minimum of 9 months in duration and usually approximately 12 months in duration. Assuming, as we must, that the recommendation or condition will be implemented by the probation and parole service, the effect is for a period of ""custody"" of approximately 5 years' duration. 
79Neither party, in particular the Crown, referred to this additional aspect of the structure of the sentence imposed by his Honour. The Crown dealt with the particulars of the sentence, rather than the exceptional nature of the structure imposed by his Honour, which reflected his Honour's significant experience in criminal law and in the conditions appropriate in rural New South Wales, particularly for Aboriginal offenders. 
80The Crown points to the determination by his Honour of the objective criminality of the offence as ""slightly less serious"" than the mid-range of seriousness as error. To the extent that the Crown submits that it is error because it does not ""accurately reflect the submissions of either party"", the assessment by his Honour was a conclusion. It does not need to ""reflect the submissions of either party"". 
81An assessment by a sentencing judge of the degree of objective seriousness is an assessment that will be disturbed only on one of the well-known bases for the interference with the sentencing exercise. 
82The assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence did not involve any identifiable error of principle by the sentencing judge. Nor did it take into account any irrelevant matter or fail to take account of any relevant matter. His Honour seems to have accepted a differentiation in seriousness between the state of mind involved in the offence and the injuries that were sustained. This is akin to a fact finding or evaluation exercise. 
83The circumstances covering an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (commonly termed ""maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm"") are extremely wide. As his Honour correctly noted, the offence is a result offence in that the existence of the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, if it did not result in actual or grievous bodily harm, would be charged as a common assault and, at the other extreme, if the result were the death of the victim, the charge would be murder: McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 at [37]. 
84As is now well-established, the assessment of objective seriousness of an offence is one that is typically part of the role of a sentencing judge and this Court is extremely slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made at first instance: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], per Spigelman CJ. The assessment of objective seriousness, while one that may be different to that which the Court as presently constituted would derive, was one that was open to his Honour. 
85The next particular on which the Crown relies is his Honour's finding that the offence was committed on the ""spur of the moment"". The Crown distinguishes between the use of those words and the respondent's submission below that the offence, while not entirely spontaneous, was not planned or organised. The distinction is, in the context of these proceedings, somewhat semantic. 
86His Honour, the sentencing judge, found that the offence arose due to the respondent's reaction to the inability to allow him visitor access. Plainly, that is neither planned nor organised criminal activity and, as a consequence, does not form any factor that is an aggravating feature of the offence (see s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Rather, it is a factor that is a mitigating factor pursuant to the terms of s 21A(3)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is that mitigating factor to which his Honour was referring when his Honour described the conduct as ""spur of the moment"". 
87The Crown also relies upon a proposition that his Honour failed to sufficiently acknowledge the victims' position as law enforcement officers. His Honour described the victims' employment and that their employment as correctional services officers was an aggravating factor pursuant to the terms of s 21A(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (ROS, 6). It is not clear, from the Crown submission, what more the Crown says his Honour could have done. There is no arguable basis for the proposition that there was an error of principle or a misapplication of principle in the approach of his Honour in this respect.  
88Next, the Crown relied, as a particular of manifest inadequacy, on the manner in which his Honour dealt with the psychiatric issues to which Dr Westmore had referred. The Crown was critical of his Honour for taking these matters into account to the degree he did in circumstances where the psychiatric reports referred to ""probable"" and ""likely"" diagnoses, because of the difficulty in conditions under which the psychiatrist assessed the respondent. 
89As was made clear by this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [278], his Honour was entitled to take into account the comments of the forensic psychiatrist and deal with the psychiatric issues that the respondent was, more probably than not, suffering in the manner in which he did. 
90Otherwise, in terms of the respondent's objective case, with the exception of the issues associated with social deprivation, with which I will deal later in these reasons, the Crown has failed to demonstrate the proposition that too much weight was placed on the subjective circumstances. As the High Court said in Bugmy at [24]:
""However, within a range of sentences for this offence and this offender, the weight to be given to the evidence and the various, conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for [the sentencing judge]. The authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a sentence for that imposed by [the sentencing judge] was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to the appellant's subjective case. The power could only be engaged if the Court was satisfied that [the sentencing judge's] discretion miscarried because in the result his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards.""
91I must then deal with two aspects of the particular described as ""social deprivation"", before dealing, more fundamentally, with manifest inadequacy and the range of sentences. 
92The Crown's submission in this respect was significantly different from that which was put before the first Court of Criminal Appeal hearing, different from that which was put before the sentencing judge and different from that which was put before the High Court. In essence, the Crown submits that, notwithstanding the endorsement of the principles in Fernando and Kennedy by the High Court in Bugmy, the sentencing exercise required greater emphasis on denunciation, deterrence and protection of the community. 
93The respondent seeks to answer that submission in a number of ways, but, amongst them, was an oral submission that the circumstances of disadvantage of the Aboriginal community are ""unique"" because of the history of dispossession and those unique circumstances are entitled to be taken into account. Apart from the fact that the last mentioned submission seems contrary to the comments in the judgment of the High Court in Munda v State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600, it is illogical. 
94The fact, if it be the fact, that dispossession is a disadvantage suffered uniquely by persons of Aboriginal descent in Australia cannot, without more, be a matter relevant to sentencing. Sentencing synthesises the issues of objective seriousness and the issues of relevance in the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
95There can be no doubt that Aborigines were dispossessed (see Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23; (1992) 175 CLR 1). But others may have been dispossessed from other lands and now live in Australia. 
96Relevant to sentencing is the effect of any issues or disadvantage on the offender, not its uniqueness. Nothing is before the Court that, in my view, would allow it, in these proceedings, to accept that dispossession, of itself, has had an effect on Mr Bugmy's offending. It is just as illogical to take account of a unique disadvantage solely on that basis as it is to refuse to take account of a relevant disadvantage simply because it is unique. 
97There may be material which would, in other circumstances, allow for the proposition that other disadvantages have been suffered, which are relevant to Mr Bugmy's moral culpability and his inability to control violent impulses: see R v Lewis [2014] NSWSC 1127 at [39]-[43]. However, no such issues of mitigation have been the subject of evidence or detailed submissions before the Court. 
98Ultimately, the issue in the proceedings rests upon the assessment of this Court as to the range of sentences available to the sentencing judge and whether the sentence imposed is outside that range. As earlier stated, it is insufficient for this Court to come to a view, simply, that the Court would have imposed a more severe sentence. The sentence must be plainly unjust. 
99In my view, the non-parole period and head sentence fixed by his Honour are not within the range available. This offence is an extremely serious one and the injury inflicted debilitating. Ordinarily, that conclusion would be sufficient to interfere with the sentence imposed. 
100The inadequacy of the non-parole period is ameliorated significantly by the condition imposed by his Honour of full-time rehabilitation during the parole period. There can be little doubt that his Honour's experience in criminal law and in rural New South Wales has been used to fashion a sentence that his Honour considered most appropriate for the offence committed and the particular circumstances of the offender. Of itself, that condition renders the sentence imposed exceptional. 
101Given my attitude to the sentence imposed, I must consider the residual discretion. There has been significant delay (over three and a half years) since the respondent pleaded guilty to these charges. The respondent's sentence is only now being finalised. That delay is not attributable to the respondent. 
102Moreover, there has been a significant alteration in the Crown's submissions, including to the particulars regarding the alleged manifest inadequacy, from those that were put before the sentencing judge; those that were put before the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first appeal; those that were put before the High Court; and those that have been put before this Court. Even the Crown's attitude to the application of the Fernando principles altered between the sentencing judge and the first Court of Criminal Appeal hearing and altered again in the High Court. 
103Despite the forgoing, it should be noted that the doctrine of ""double jeopardy"" has been abolished with respect to a Crown appeal against sentence: R v JW. In the context of a sentence appeal, the term ""double jeopardy"", while arguably not a form of double jeopardy in the strict sense, encompasses the distress and anxiety that a respondent may experience when faced with the possibility of a more severe sentence: R v Hayes (1987) 29 A Crim R 452 at 469 per Kirby P. While this Court has accepted that evidence of actual anxiety and distress may be relevant to resentencing (R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9; R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 33), the fact that a respondent on a Crown appeal is subject to ""double jeopardy"" is not relevant to either the exercise of the discretion to intervene or the determination of what sentence should be imposed, once the decision to intervene has been made: R v JW. 
104While I am prohibited from considering ""double jeopardy"", I retain a residual discretion to reject a Crown appeal for reasons other than ""double jeopardy"". The assessment of his Honour as to the prospects of rehabilitation, together with the exceptional structure imposed, are significant factors in determining whether the residual discretion should be exercised. The delay and change in the Crown position on various matters of significance are of most relevance to this consideration.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that the Court should exercise the residual discretion and dismiss the appeal. 
105I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
106RA HULME J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Bathurst CJ and Rothman J. I agree that the Crown appeal should be dismissed in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion.

2765665,Kidd v R [2014] NSWCCA 319,"Judgment

1WARD JA: Mr Kidd wishes to appeal from his conviction in 2004 on a count of aggravated armed robbery. To do so, he requires an extension of time pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for the filing of his notice of appeal.

2Mr Kidd contends that evidence that was not in his possession at the time of the trial has now become available to him and that this evidence is credible and capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to his guilt; hence there has been a miscarriage of justice.

3The evidence in question is from a prison inmate (""GAR"") as to statements allegedly made to him by Mr Kidd's former de facto wife (Ms Meagher) during the course of a relationship between them for (on any version of events) a short period of time in late 1999/early 2000 to the effect that certain items of jewellery from the robbery for which Mr Kidd was convicted had been given to her not by Mr Kidd (as was her evidence at his trial) but by a Mr Ian Smith. Additionally, Mr Kidd relies upon GAR's evidence that Ms Meagher had suggested to him back in 1999/2000 that she wanted Mr Kidd (who was then awaiting sentence on other crimes) to remain in prison (to take advantage of his son's entitlement under the estate of his deceased mother) as evidence of a motivation on her part to lie about the jewellery.

4While Counsel for Mr Kidd, Mr Lange, acknowledges that the evidence of motivation in and of itself is not sufficient to warrant a re-trial, he submits that when coupled with the evidence as to receipt of the jewellery from Mr Smith the evidence warrants a new trial.

5It is said that the evidence was neither actually nor constructively available to Mr Kidd at the trial because there was no reason for him to suppose that GAR would have had any relevant evidence to give.

6In these reasons a pseudonym is used for GAR and his former wife EHR because of the possibility that identification of GAR would identify the victim in unrelated sexual assault matters.

Extension of time for appeal

7The time within which an appeal should have been brought expired on 27 August 2004. Mr Kidd's application for an extension of time is supported by an affidavit of his solicitor, Mr Michael Bowe, sworn 30 December 2013. Mr Bowe deposes that Mr Kidd first sought advice as to the prospects of an appeal based on fresh evidence in or around October 2011. Mr Bowe refers to the steps taken in the time taken between Mr Kidd seeking that advice and the filing of the application in the present proceedings. The Crown does not object to the extension of time sought.

8In exercise of the discretion whether to extend time, the court will have regard to the prospects of success of the appeal (R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275). For the reasons below, I am of the view that the application for an extension of time should be refused but that even if leave were to be granted this appeal would be dismissed.

Background

9Mr Kidd was convicted on 4 March 2004, following a trial in the District Court before Karpin DCJ and a jury, on a count of aggravated armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

10The robbery took place on 11 September 1997 during a home invasion at the Burraneer home of a Mr Madden and his now deceased partner, Ms Falloon. A number of men armed with weapons including shot guns entered the Burraneer home late at night, wearing balaclavas, and stole a quantity of cash and jewellery, including a gold cross and chain and a customised gold Mercedes emblem key chain. Mr Madden was severely beaten during the home invasion.

11At around the time of the offence, the Burraneer premises had been the subject of surveillance by undercover police officers involved in surveillance duties with the National Crime Authority. During the course of that surveillance, police officers had recorded the presence (on 4 July 1997) near the Burraneer home of a vehicle registered to Ms Meagher. They also recorded the presence on that date of a vehicle registered to a Mr Eric Murray. They had observed a number of men wearing dark clothing and beanies near the home. The timing of this incident coincided with evidence later given by Mr Madden and Mr Smith of an attempted break-in a week prior to the actual home invasion.

12On 12 December 1997, police searched Ms Meagher's home pursuant to a search warrant and seized a cross and chain which Ms Meagher was wearing (later identified by both victims as proceeds of the Madden robbery) as well as a Mercedes and car keys with a gold Mercedes emblem key chain. Sawn off shot guns, fluorescent police vests, jewellery and other items that were found to be the proceeds of the robbery were found by the police at Mr Murray's address.

13There was an investigation by the NSW Crime Commission in 1998 as to the robbery, in the course of which (on 12 February 1998), Ms Meagher was required to attend and give evidence at Mr Kidd's trial. Ms Meagher admitted that she had lied on oath to the Commission (T 327- 329). Ms Meagher did not give the police any information about the Madden robbery until an interview on 10 November 2003 (T 348.56). Her attendance at that interview followed a request made by Mr Kidd's trial Counsel that she do so (T.372.1).

14Mr Kidd and a number of others (Mr Smith, Mr Middleton, Mr Markovich and a Mr Capsis) were charged with offences relating to the home invasion. Mr Smith, who by then had been arrested in Queensland in relation to an unrelated matter, was given an indemnity from prosecution in respect of his involvement in the offence, conditional upon his active cooperation in the criminal proceedings against his co-offenders in the robbery (T 97.40). Mr Smith subsequently received a reduced sentence in an unrelated matter in Queensland for his assistance to the authorities (T 175-6).

15Mr Kidd denied the charge. At the time of the trial, Mr Kidd had already been convicted, and was awaiting sentence, on two unrelated counts of armed robbery.

The Trial

16The trial at which Mr Kidd was convicted commenced on 16 February 2004, after an earlier aborted trial.

17The Crown case, in summary, was that: Mr Kidd had known Mr Madden since the early 1990s, when the former took his car to be repaired at the latter's car yard; prior to the robbery Mr Kidd had information from a security guard who had provided security for the Burraneer home as to the security systems at the house and as to there being cash on the premises; Mr Smith (who had been a corrections officer at a correctional centre in Queensland) and Mr Middleton (a former inmate at that correctional centre) were friends; Mr Middleton introduced Mr Smith to each of Mr Kidd, Mr Markovich, Mr Murray and Ms Meagher; there were a number of occasions when one or more of the co-offenders carried out a reconnoitre of the Burraneer home and meetings took place with a security guard (Mr Capsis) in which he provided a remote control for the alarm system; on the fourth reconnoitre the alarm was tested; there was an unsuccessful attempted entry to the house when pot plants were removed from a side wall and a sensor light was triggered; Mr Madden said that on that occasion the alarm wires were cut; on the night of the robbery, Mr Kidd, Mr Smith and Mr Middleton carried out the home invasion while Mr Markovich's role was to cut the telephone wires; Mr Markovich was wearing a police vest; the offenders went to and from the property by boat; they then drove to an apartment owned by Mr Kidd in Bronte and divided the proceeds of the robbery.

18Mr Smith admitted his involvement in the robbery. Mr Smith's evidence at the trial included that: he had overheard a conversation between Mr Middleton and Mr Kidd with regard to going to look at a house that he had been told they were planning to do a home invasion on; they went to look at a house at Burraneer that he was later informed belonged to Mr Madden and Ms Falloon (T 103.30; 107.17); Mr Kidd was present at the first reconnoitre of the property in June 1997 (T 106.5ff) and at the second reconnoitre of the property on or about 4 July 1997 (T 112.21); he had met Mr Kidd outside a unit in Drummoyne when there was discussion about the plan to travel to the property by boat (T 117.10ff); Mr Kidd was present at the fourth reconnoitre of the property (T 123.19ff). He also gave evidence of an occasion when they had gone to the home and removed pot plants from a side wall accessing the area from a neighbouring property which triggered a sensor light (T 107-110). Mr Smith gave evidence as to Mr Kidd's role during the home invasion (see from T 142.42- 161.37); and as to the division of the proceeds of the robbery at the unit in Bronte (T 164.34-166.44).

19It was Ms Meagher's evidence that: Mr Kidd had spoken of his involvement in the robbery (T 308.34-48); that Mr Kidd told her that there was a nice gold chain amongst the jewellery that he would give her and that he did so at his unit in Bronte (T 306.14-17; T 302.36-305.1); and that Mr Kidd had also given her a custom made key ring. She denied that the jewellery had been given to her by anyone else and denied that, among other persons involved in the robbery, it had been given to her by Mr Smith (T 348.26).

20Ms Meagher also said she had been told by Mr Kidd of an earlier attempt to break into the Madden home during which wires were cut (T 310). Ms Meagher said she was told by Mr Kidd that a security guard was providing information regarding the home and that the house had two security systems, one of which was back to base.

21Mr Madden gave evidence that Mr Kidd was not one of his assailants (T 78.41 - T 80.17). He also gave evidence of an attempted break-in some weeks before the home invasion when two large cement pots had been moved and the alarm wires had been cut (T 49.30). Mr Madden gave evidence as to the two security systems at the house and that the security had been provided by Mr Capsis (T 297.50).

22Mr Kidd denied that he had given Ms Meagher the cross and chain identified as the proceeds of the robbery; denied ever having seen the gold Mercedes emblem key chain; denied being involved in the preparation for the robbery and the robbery itself; and denied making any admissions regarding the robbery to Ms Meagher. 

23At the time of the trial, Ms Meagher had the care of Mr Kidd's son, whose mother had died, and Mr Kidd was on remand pending sentencing on other serious armed robbery charges. Ms Meagher was cross-examined to suggest that she had lied about what she said had occurred with Mr Kidd and that the reason she had lied was because she wanted to retain control of the money from the estate of Mr Kidd's son's mother (T 364.22- 366).

24In the course of the summing up, the trial judge said that the evidence of Mr Smith was at the nub of the trial because that essentially was the direct evidence that Mr Kidd was involved in the matter; and directed the jury that if the jury did not accept Mr Smith's evidence placing Mr Kidd in the crime as beyond reasonable doubt then the jury would have to acquit Mr Kidd. The jury was directed that it must look at Mr Smith's evidence carefully.

25The trial judge reminded the jury that both Mr Smith and Ms Meagher were admitted perjurers. In particular, the trial judge reminded the jury that Mr Smith was someone who, on his own admission, had committed serious criminal offences; had lied to the NSW Crimes Commission; had gained a considerable advantage from the information provided to the authorities; and had been given an indemnity from prosecution for the Madden robbery based upon his undertaking to give truthful evidence in the Kidd trial. The jury was cautioned carefully to consider those matters when assessing his evidence.

26The trial judge told the jury that Ms Meagher also fell into the same category of ""potentially unreliable evidence"". The trial judge told the jury to bear in mind Ms Meagher's admissions about lying to the NSW Crime Commission and reminded the jury of the suggested motive for her to give false evidence, namely her desire to retain control of Mr Kidd's child who had been in her care since 1998. The trial judge reminded the jury that the accused's counsel had suggested that the motive was for Ms Meagher to retain control of a substantial estate worth in excess of $3 million. The trial judge also noted that the estate was in fact controlled by the Public Trustee who paid money to Ms Meagher for the care of the child and to whom Ms Meagher must account.

27The trial judge directed the jury that the evidence of Mr Smith and Ms Meagher must be looked at separately and with great care; and that the jury should also look at the suggested ulterior motives either might have had and the explanation given for telling lies to the NSW Crime Commission.

28The jury retired on 3 March 2004. A guilty verdict was returned on 4 March 2004.

29Mr Kidd was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years commencing on 26 August 2009 and expiring on 25 August 2019, with a non-parole period of seven years and six months to expire on 25 August 2015. Mr Kidd appealed unsuccessfully against the sentence imposed on him (Kidd v R [2009] NSWCCA 229).

The fresh evidence

30As noted above, the principal evidence that Mr Kidd now seeks to rely upon is testimony from GAR to the effect that, while he was in a relationship with Ms Meagher (which he puts in his affidavit as being from December 1999 to March 2000), at a time when Mr Kidd was in prison in Queensland for other offences, Ms Meagher suggested that they could steal Mr Kidd's son's estate if Mr Kidd agreed to her adopting his son; that Mr Kidd would have to be killed if he ever got out of prison ""as he would never let us get away with stealing his son's inheritance""; and also said words to the effect that:

This problem may never arise as Bert won't be getting out of prison if I have anything to do with it. The New South Wales Crimes Commission is very interested in some jewellery that I received from Smith.

and:

I will do something with the Crime Commission and get Bert.

31Mr Kidd adduced evidence from GAR's former wife (""EHR"") to corroborate the evidence given by GAR as to his relationship with Ms Meagher. In her affidavit, EHR deposes that GAR was released from a term in prison in October 1999; that on his release he moved in with her at her Mount Vernon property; that, just before Christmas 1999, Ms Meagher and some others visited the home at Mount Vernon and that GAR left with them the next morning; and (at [12]) that GAR came back ""after six to eight weeks"" and that they then travelled for three or four months around Australia but that their relationship ended in Mildura in around May/June 2000.

Significance of the fresh evidence

32Mr Kidd does not submit that the fresh evidence is of such cogency as to warrant that the conviction should be quashed. Rather, what Mr Kidd seeks is a new trial.

33Mr Kidd submits that the central importance of GAR's evidence must be understood in the light of the evidence of Mr Madden, who had known Mr Kidd for some 15 years before the robbery but who had given evidence that Mr Kidd had not been one of his assailants (T 78.41 - T 80.17). It is submitted that there was little by way of corroborative evidence which would have enabled the jury accurately to assess the veracity of Mr Smith's evidence and hence the finding of the jewellery was a crucial piece of evidence for the prosecution.

34It is noted that, of the six areas of evidence that the Crown in summing up asked the jury to think about when considering the evidence of Mr Smith and Ms Meagher (T 484.54 - T 485.2), two related to the recovery of the jewellery from Mr Kidd and Ms Meagher's home. Counsel for Mr Kidd submits that at trial no explanation could be proffered for the finding of those items in Ms Meagher's possession and hence it is said that the jury would almost have been compelled to conclude that Mr Smith's evidence should be accepted, since there appeared to be no real link between Ms Meagher and the robbery other than Mr Kidd.

35Mr Lange submits that the fresh evidence also demonstrates that there was, at the time of the offence, a ""link"" between Ms Meagher and Mr Smith which was downplayed at the trial by both witnesses. In that regard, reference is made to the following exchange in the examination in chief of Mr Smith (at T 100.41-43):

Q. Do you recall meeting anyone else through Mr Kidd?
A. I met his spouse, de facto at that stage, I don't believe they were married, Joe [sic] or Josephine.

36It is suggested that use of the words ""Jo or Josephine"" must have been calculated to give the impression that the acquaintance was no more than fleeting. Without knowing how that answer was given, it is impossible to conclude that this was a deliberate attempt by Mr Smith to downplay any sort of link or relationship between the two. If anything, the comment that he did not think they were married at that stage suggests some familiarity with the couple's personal situation rather than a downplaying of his acquaintance with one or both of them.

37Mr Kidd also refers in this context to Ms Meagher's evidence (at T 306.19-39 and T 307.49-56) that it is said gave the impression that there was only a limited association with Mr Smith. In the first of those transcript references Ms Meagher gave a general description of Mr Smith (including that he ""was a family man"" and that he had a wife and one or two children). Again, that suggests that there was at least a sufficient connection between them to have given Ms Meagher some knowledge of his family circumstances. In the second, Ms Meagher responded to a question whether she had ever seen Mr Smith in the company of Mr Kidd by recounting an occasion when Mr Smith came to her apartment unannounced. She was not very happy about that and they left; and then, when asked who she meant when she said ""they left"", Ms Meagher said: ""Robert Kidd, and well I didn't know his name, I know it was Ian, but they used to call him something else"". GAR deposes in his affidavit to Ms Meagher having identified Mr Smith by his Christian name as well as his surname. GAR says that he finally came forward as he believed in the interests of justice that his evidence concerning Mr Kidd should be heard.

38It is submitted that, in the absence of any real connection between Ms Meagher and Mr Smith, there would have been no basis for a rational jury to conclude that Mr Smith had given Ms Meagher the proceeds of the robbery; that necessarily, on the evidence, the only person who could have done so was Mr Kidd; and hence that the possession of the jewellery by Ms Meagher was significantly corroborative of Mr Smith's account.

39It is submitted that the import of GAR's assertion that Ms Meagher had said that the Crime Commission was very interested in jewellery received from a man called Mr Smith was that it provided a context in which Ms Meagher might lie, Ms Meagher having appeared before the Commission in 1998 and therefore knowing of its interest in the proceeds of the robbery.

Evidence in response

40The Crown filed a number of affidavits on the present application. The principal evidence was from Mr Smith and Ms Meagher, each of whom was cross-examined by Mr Lange.

41In his affidavit, Mr Smith deposes (at [2]) that he was first introduced to Ms Meagher when he and Mr Middleton went to visit Mr Kidd. He says that the longest contact he had had with Ms Meagher was approximately 15 minutes at a Drummoyne residence when, at Mr Middleton's request, he went there to arrange a place for the three to meet; Mr Kidd was not there and he had waited for Mr Kidd to return. He deposes that he could only recall one other time he had contact with Ms Meagher, that being when he went to a location at the Haymarket area and made a call to a phone number supplied by another of the co-offenders (Mr Middleton) when Ms Meagher answered the telephone. Mr Smith did not recall any other contact with Ms Meagher and said that at no time had he ever given her any jewellery or anything else.

42He deposes (at [2]) that:

After the home invasion on Madden's in Burraneer, Robert Kidd, Mark Middleton, George Markovich and myself met at Robert Kidd's penthouse apartment in Bronte. At this time, the cash was divided evenly between us. Robert Kidd asked if anyone would like any of the jewellery. I took an emerald ring, Mark and George said they didn't want to take anything. Robert Kidd said he knew someone that he could sell the jewellery to. That was the last time I saw any of the jewellery other than the emerald ring that I took.

43In Ms Meagher's affidavit, she deposes that she does not know GAR but that she had met him, in company with an older gentleman, at her then home in Clontarf or Balgowlah Heights. Her recollection was that the initial meeting ""could have been something to do with borrowing or paying for a car"". She deposes that:

They did several things, painting, removal of rubbish, they helped out around the house. They were always together. They asked me if I could give them some work, I gave them heaps of work. They also kept complaining that they wanted more money off me, and that they were promised money. The only thing I can remember with [GAR] was that I asked questions and he said he needed money, he had no money, needed some work and he had no driver's licence. He said he had a family, a wife. I avoided going home because I didn't want them to be there, and they had nowhere to go. I also got attacked in Newtown around that time, and I didn't want to go home. I have had no contact with them since that time. I had no relationship or sex with [GAR] or the older bloke.

In relation to Ian Smith, I know him as the security guard. He was always very polite, and he had a wife and family, kids. All I can say is that he's a nice man, didn't have much to say. I met him at Balmain and Drummoyne. I met him with Bert [Mr Kidd] at Wrights Road in Drummoyne at my place, and Bert and him went outside. I met him several times at my place at Drummoyne, he came to see Robert. I can't think if I met him at Haymarket. I may have spoken to him over the phone, but not knowing it was him. I think I may have had a conversation with him about the police going to his house and that he was on the run. I haven't had anything to do with him since.

During the time that I had anything to do with Ian Smith, I never received any jewellery from him nor did I receive anything else from him at all.

44Also filed was an affidavit from a detective sergeant of police, annexing signed interview notes of an interview (not electronically recorded), with GAR in May 2014. I will refer in due course to some of that record of interview. GAR did not challenge the accuracy of his written statement of interview at the police station. He accepted that he had signed the document and initialled every page. He said that he had read it quickly but he did not think that the police officer was ""verballing"" him (AT 20.18 - 27).

45The Crown also filed a number of affidavits providing evidence of matters going to GAR's whereabouts at the time of his claimed relationship with Ms Meagher and to the times when Mr Kidd and GAR were in Goulburn jail in the relevant period.

46First, an affidavit from a detective inspector of police in the robbery and serious crime squad, annexing an information report that the detective inspector had prepared at the conclusion of an investigation into the alleged involvement of GAR in armed robbery offences. Reliance was placed on this solely to note the reference in the report to various of the particular addresses for GAR (which did not include an address at Clontarf or Balgowlah Heights, those being the suburbs where it was variously suggested Ms Meagher had lived at the time).

47Second, an affidavit sworn by the acting director and secretary of the New South Wales State Parole Authority who deposed to enquiries that had been caused to be made in relation to the conditions of GAR's parole. That enquiry disclosed that there were a number of case notes that indicated GAR was residing at different addresses, including an address at Clontarf (as per a case note 5/1/2000); a property in Gol Gol (case note of 1/3/2000) and Mildura (case notes 15/3/2000 and 14/4/2000). There was also reference to ""A Intake data for date 01/2000)"" indicated that GAR was residing at an address at Mount Vernon.

48Third, an affidavit as to the periods of time when each of Mr Kidd and GAR were incarcerated at Goulburn jail.

Determination of application

49The test for the admission of fresh evidence is that set out in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 per Kirby J(at [63]). His Honour noted that what the Court is ultimately concerned with is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice:

...The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301).

50His Honour there noted that where a new trial is sought or the evidence is not of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the following issues arise:
Is the evidence fresh?
If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or ""plausible"" (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?
If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ 301-302.

51As to what constitutes a miscarriage of justice in such a case, in Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392, Mason and Deane JJ said (at 402):

The appellate court will conclude that the unavailability of the new evidence at the time of the trial involved such a miscarriage of if, and only if, it considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant of the charge if the new evidence had been before it in the trial.

See also Gibbs CJ at 396-397 and Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 520 per Barwick CJ.

52I turn then to the three issues identified in Abou-Chabake that must be answered in the affirmative for Mr Kidd's conviction appeal to succeed.

Is the evidence fresh evidence?

53The first issue is whether the evidence is ""fresh"" evidence. The Crown did not contend that GAR's evidence was available to Mr Kidd at the trial nor that it could have been available to him through the pursuit of reasonably diligent enquiries. That said, it appears from a question and answer given when Ms Meagher was cross-examined on a voir dire at the aborted trial, that Mr Kidd's then trial Counsel must have had some instructions as to the existence of a relationship of some kind between GAR and Ms Meagher, since otherwise the question is inexplicable. However, there is nothing before this Court that would enable a conclusion to be made that GAR's evidence was constructively available to Mr Kidd at trial. Accordingly, the evidence should be treated as ""fresh"" evidence.

Is the evidence credible or capable of belief?

54The second issue is whether that evidence is credible or at least ""capable of belief"" or plausible. In that regard, it is not sufficient that GAR's evidence as to a relationship with Ms Meagher be capable of belief. What must be credible, in the relevant sense, is his evidence as to what Ms Meagher said to him about the jewellery from the robbery and her desire to take steps that would keep Mr Kidd in prison. The present case is similar to Gallagher v The Queen, where Gibbs CJ observed (at 396) that ""the critical question is whether the evidence was apparently credible"". His Honour went on (at 397) to explain that in many cases the appellate court ""will be able to do no more than decide whether or not the evidence is apparently credible, or capable of being believed"".

GAR's credibility

55GAR was cross-examined by audio-visual link. He is presently serving a lengthy custodial sentence in Goulburn correctional centre. He was not a particularly reliable historian, though in part that may be explained by the time that has elapsed since the events in question.

56He was uncertain about various matters, such as the reasons his parole was revoked (AT 8.31), although he was prepared to agree to these being an inability to adapt a normal lawful community life, failure to report to his supervising officer and failure to reside at an agreed address. He agreed that it was a condition of his parole that he inform the parole authority of where he resided at any given time but did not remember whether he had changed addresses with the parole authority at some stage (AT 9.6). He said that checks were conducted on where he lived at the time only rarely and intermittently and that if there was going to be a check he would have made sure he was there (AT 9.10).

57GAR denied knowing who Mr Kidd was in 1999 (AT 10.16) but that answer must be understood in light of his later evidence (at AT 12.22) that he was aware who Mr Kidd was before he had contact with him at Goulburn jail because Ms Meagher had told him who he was. In parts of his oral evidence, GAR seemed to equate knowing someone with knowing of them or knowing someone who knew them (eg at AT 14.11; AT T14.18 in relation to Mr Madden).

58GAR said that his first contact with Mr Kidd was at Goulburn jail between June 2004 and March 2005 (AT 10.45). He agreed that at that time he knew who Mr Kidd was (AT 10.48). He denied that Mr Kidd had contacted him before he first saw Mr Kidd at Goulburn jail in June 2004 (AT 13.4). His first written communications with Mr Kidd were not until after Mr Kidd had left Goulburn jail (which the Court was informed was in November 2011) (AT 13.9). He said that Mr Kidd made contact with him in writing weekly (AT 12.47) but that he was ""certainly not"" a friend of Mr Kidd (AT 13.25).

59GAR accepted that it was possible that he had had contact with Mr Kidd during later periods when he was at Goulburn jail (around March 2006; between July 2006 to September 2007; between June 2008 to August 2009; between September and October 2009; and November 2009 and April 2010) but in essence his evidence went no further than that he was sure that if Mr Kidd was there he would have seen him but he did not know if Mr Kidd was there at those times (see AT 11.16-48). GAR conceded that there had been plenty of opportunity for he and Mr Kidd to concoct this fresh evidence but was adamant that that had not happened.

60GAR's evidence as to how it was that he came to disclose the information contained in his affidavit to Mr Kidd's solicitor is both contradictory and implausible.

61GAR was not certain whether direct communications with Mr Kidd started before he made his affidavit in the proceedings (AT 12.5). He had no recollection when he first communicated directly with him (AT 12.10). He had no idea when it was that Mr Kidd first contacted him and could not hazard a guess when asked for his best estimate at the earliest time that he had communication with Mr Kidd.

62In his 2014 interview with police, GAR is recorded, when asked if Mr Kidd had asked him to supply an affidavit on his behalf, as saying ""he probably did, it's an obligation, doesn't mean I trust him""; that Mr Kidd did not tell him what to put in the affidavit; and that Mr Kidd was ""a prolific letter writer, all the time. I'm not here because of him. I'm here cause it's the truth. My relationship with Josephine is true, the other stuff is my personal views"" (A. 24).

63The detective sergeant's notes further record that GAR said that the nature of his contact with Mr Kidd whilst GAR was in custody in Goulburn was: ""A few letters. He was here, so I'd see him here in passing, not contact. The contact has been in relation to my association with Josephine. It's pretty basic"". (A.11)

64In cross-examination on this application (AT 15.17), GAR at first said that the first time he was asked to recall the conversation that he had put into his affidavit was ""When the solicitor came and saw me."" At AT 15.20, he amended that to say that actually there was a telephone call prior to that with the solicitor and he thought it was on the phone call and the solicitor came down after that. At AT 15.25, he said that the solicitor had contacted him. At AT 15.33, he said that probably the first time he told anybody about what he claimed Ms Meagher had said to him was ""the solicitor that I told when I spoke to him on the phone"".

65At first blush the implausibility of this is obvious. Unless GAR had told someone about the alleged conversations with Ms Meagher, it would have required sheer clairvoyance on the part of Mr Kidd's solicitor to have suddenly contacted GAR to see if he had any fresh evidence or relevant information to give. In response to a question from the bench as to whether he had been contacted by the solicitor ""out of the blue"", GAR said:

A. Yeah he did. I got called over to the reception and they said that there was a legal conference and they handed me a telephone and I spoke to him. I spoke to him for probably half an hour.

66GAR said that, aside from the occasion when he spoke to the solicitor, he had not spoken to anyone else about what was in the affidavit (AT 15.49). Pressed on that, at AT 16.10, GAR said that he could not recall anybody particular that he would have spoken to but that he may have told other people and that he could not particularly recall the conversation but he may well have spoken about it.

67Later, he resiled from the suggestion that the contact had come out of the blue (AT 26.49):

Q. But out of the blue one day Bert Kidd asks you to do an affidavit to the solicitor about Josephine?
A. Not out of the blue, no, not out of the blue, but I don't remember the circumstances leading to it, I do not, but it's not out of the blue.""

68GAR then maintained that he had a clear recollection that Mr Kidd had asked him to supply an affidavit on his behalf (AT 22.43) and said he could see Mr Kidd yelling at him across the triangle (at the jail) ""if I get a solicitor to come and see you will you give an affidavit in relation to you knowing Josephine?"" (AT 22.49). He placed that conversation as having happened not long before Mr Kidd left Goulburn jail because he said it was not long after that the solicitor spoke to him on the telephone (AT 23.4 - 14). He then said (AT 23.22) that he did not have the clearest recollection of Mr Kidd asking him to do an affidavit but he thought ""that's how it would have went down"". He said that he remembered Mr Kidd yelling at him across the yard; he did not remember the actual words he used but he thought he would say he did ask him to do an affidavit. Then (at AT 23.47): ""Well I don't remember it per se but I'm thinking that that's what happened, I've got some sort of a memory of it but I don't have a clear recollection of it, no"".

69For Mr Kidd to have yelled across the prison yard at GAR to enquire whether GAR would sign an affidavit would explain how it was that Mr Kidd's solicitor came to contact GAR but does not explain how Mr Kidd would have become aware that GAR would have the relevant information.

70Mr Kidd's case on this application is, in effect, that Ms Meagher had denied knowing him; that GAR was able to dispute this and thus cast doubt on the reliability of Ms Meagher's testimony; and that it was not until GAR spoke to the solicitor about having had a relationship with Ms Meagher that he volunteered the information that Ms Meagher told him that she had received the jewellery from Mr Smith (that just happens to be what Mr Kidd maintains is the critical evidence to contradict Mr Smith's otherwise unshaken testimony).

71GAR said in cross-examination he had been asked by Mr Kidd to do an affidavit attesting to Ms Meagher having known him because she had denied having known him. At AT 27.40, he said that he was told that Ms Meagher had denied at the trial having known him. It is not clear by whom he says he was told that information. Relevantly, there was no suggestion that in the trial in which Mr Kidd was convicted that that had ever been an issue or the subject of any evidence. Rather, it was raised in a single question and answer in a voir dire at the aborted trial. The Court was provided on the second day of the hearing of this application with one page of the transcript of the voir dire (T 5/2/04 p 19) in which the relevant exchange was recorded.

72GAR suggested that he could have had a conversation with his former solicitor (a Mr Green) in about 2003 (or even as late as 2005) about Ms Meagher denying that she knew him (AT 28.14) but nowhere was it made clear how that would have arisen in the context of the criminal matters on which Mr Green was acting for GAR in the relevant period.

73On GAR's account of events, therefore, he was asked by Mr Kidd to provide an affidavit attesting to the fact that he knew Ms Meagher (and hence to support a conclusion that Ms Meagher was lying when she had denied that at an earlier aborted trial) and that it was not until he spoke with Mr Kidd's solicitor that he volunteered the information as to what he recalled Ms Meagher saying to him about the jewellery. GAR denied (at AT 24.8) having told Mr Kidd what he said Ms Meagher had told him about the jewellery. (See also transcript at AT 24-25.)

74At AT 25.38, GAR said that he now knew that he could be ""of some assistance"" and ""I can see a bloke that's being loaded up by Josephine"" (i.e., Ms Meagher) but then said that he did not know when he had learnt that Mr Kidd had been or was being ""loaded up"" by Ms Meagher. He explained what help or assistance he thought he could give Mr Kidd by coming forward with the information (at AT 25.48/26.6):

I think me coming forward now will help Mr Kidd by the fact that Josephine said she didn't know me and she clearly did and that I lived with her -
...
And the fact that Josephine with me had conspired to take the boy's money and that Josephine was worried about the fact that if Bert found out that that there would be major repercussions and something would have to be done about Bert and that's it, that's what I thought that would assist him and that's the information that I've got to give.

75It beggars belief that GAR would not have thought fit to relay to Mr Kidd the conversation in which he says Ms Meagher was suggesting she would ""load"" him up yet was apparently forthcoming about his relationship with Ms Meagher. Moreover, it is clear that GAR knew about the concept of a conviction appeal based on fresh evidence as he had run such an appeal three times before in his own unrelated matters (GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163; GAR v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164; GAR v R (No 3) [2010] NSWCCA 165). Therefore, whether or not he appreciated the significance for Mr Kidd's case of the source of the jewellery found in Ms Meagher's possession, he cannot have failed to appreciate the significance of a witness professing an intention to falsify evidence in order to set someone up for a crime.

76At AT 26.15, GAR said ""Josephine could see that I was reticent about having discussions about having to deal with Bert and she said that something, it may not ever get to it, there's a piece of jewellery that the Crime Commission were interested in that I got from Smith and I said Jockey Smith and she said ""No Ian Smith"". So I told the solicitor that, that she thought she could do something with that to get Bert put away"". When asked whether he had ever told Mr Kidd about that conversation with Ms Meagher he said:

A. Well I don't recall speaking to Bert about that per se. However, you've got to understand that the situation we're in is not a situation where we can just have general conversation or private conversation. You know, he's in one section of the prison and I'm in another section of the prison, it's not easy for us to communicate. (AT 26.26)

77GAR was vague as to other aspects of the matter such as when he became aware that Mr Madden was alleged to be the victim of the home invasion offence:

A. I don't know. That's to see - that's what I mean. I shouldn't even be - I don't know who told me or - you know the police - you know I'm not certain, I'm not certain. I don't know where - where that - it could have come from Josephine. I'm not certain so really I'm out of my depth here. I - it's not something I know anything about so I shouldn't be discussing it. It's just rumour and innuendo. (AT 14.31) 

At AT 14.32, he said that it could have been fourteen years ago that he became aware or it could have been a few years ago.

78As to the length of his claimed relationship with Ms Meagher, GAR's evidence varied. In his affidavit, he said he was in a relationship with her for three months. In cross-examination he said (at AT16.18):

A. Well it was some period. It was somewhere around that time yes. Might have been a bit less. Might have been a little bit more. It was around that period. Wasn't long.

...

A. Yeah well, I think it was a bit less than that [December 1999 - March 2000], I think that's - it might have been a month less than that. I think that's incorrect.

79He later said that it might have been a month less than he had said in his affidavit but he thought it was about three months; and then (AT18.8) he said he would accept it was possibly nine weeks but certainly not two; it was ""around three months"" but he did not know how long, ""if it was a month less it could have been a month less it certainly wasn't two weeks"". He said that the shortest timeframe that would accord with his recollection of how long he was living with her was ""around three months"" (AT 18.18).

80He said that he thought Ms Meagher knew Mr Smith ""quite well"" and had ""some sort of a relationship with him"" but said he did not know exactly what the circumstances were (AT 18.39). He said that that was what Ms Meagher had told him (though there is nothing in his record of interview or his affidavit as to this) and, when pressed on this, said that he had an actual recollection of her telling him that she had a relationship with a man by the name of Ian Smith and that she told him that during the period that he was with her (AT 19.25). He also said that she had named other men during that period. He said that he remembered the name Ian Smith because he had initially thought it was someone called ""Jockey"" and because he had a friend named Ian (AT 19.15).

EHR's credibility

81GAR's claim to have had a relationship with Ms Meagher is corroborated to an extent by entries in a diary that his former wife (EHR) kept in 1999 (Exhibit C). In that diary there is a notation on 2 October 1999 ""[GAR] home"", which EHR said was the day her husband was released from incarceration (AT 32.5). On 26 December 1999 there was an entry ""[GAR] left"". (Insofar as that suggests that GAR did not leave until after Christmas, it is inconsistent with a statement that EHR made to the police in 2002 to the effect that she and the children were left alone at Christmas.)

82At a police interview on 23 January 2002, EHR is recorded as saying ""I think he had been in the home about two weeks when he ran off with a woman because the children and I spent Christmas alone"". The Crown submits (and there is force in this submission) that it is more likely that the version of events given in 2002 would be accurate than a version many years later.

83Prior to the entry ""GAR left"" there was a diary entry for 21 December 1999 that reads ""lunch, finance, Josephine"". EHR said (at AT 32.47) that Ms Meagher had visited her home at Mount Vernon that day. (Ms Meagher denies that she ever visited the Mount Vernon property; denies knowing where Mount Vernon is; and denies knowing anyone who owned a five hectare property.) EHR said that she was told of the visit early that morning by her husband and that the purpose of the visit ""was allegedly to discuss finance with my husband for a car that he was purchasing for me"".

84This is consistent with GAR's recollection that Ms Meagher came at one stage to the Mount Vernon property. When asked how he knew Ms Meagher, the note taken by the detective sergeant of his interview with GAR records that he said he ""got taken to - someone wanted to borrow my van, Ray Murray, I went over there to move stuff"" (A.18); but then that he had known her ""Since '99. She came to my property"" (A.19), and the explanation is consistent with Ms Meagher's evidence that she had a motor dealer's licence.

85However, it is not readily able to be reconciled with GAR's statement to the police as to the first day he met Ms Meagher. Asked in the police interview how the relationship with Ms Meagher started, GAR is recorded as having said that: ""I walked out into the lounge room. She had all her clothes off & said ""I really like you"". That was the first day."" (A. 20). That seems bizarre if the first meeting was at the Mount Vernon property when there were at least four people having lunch together.

86Again, somewhat inconsistently even in the course of the police interview, when GAR was then asked if Mr Kidd was aware back then that he was in a relationship with Ms Meagher he said that it ""wasn't really a relationship"" (A. 21).

87Whether or not Ms Meagher ever actually visited the Mount Vernon property, EHR's diary notes are consistent with GAR having left that property (and his then wife) for a period from late December 1999 and the parole notes indicate that he had given a Clontarf address as the place he was residing in early January 2000. Ms Meagher's evidence on this aspect of the matter (as on most others) was confusing and unreliable.

88As to the time period in which GAR was away, EHR's evidence was confused. In the absence of her 2000 diary she was unable to give any clear evidence on this issue (which suggests that her evidence as to when GAR had left is also based largely on a reconstruction from her 1999 diary notes). At AT 33.40, she said:

A. It was - it was several weeks but I'm not in possession of the 2000 diary [which was apparently tendered as evidence to the police] so I'm unable to be specific but it was, I thought, two weeks or more.

89At AT 35.4, when shown her police statement, EHR said ""Yes, and I'm really not sure of how long he was with her but I thought it was several weeks.""

90She said at AT 35.29 that GAR returned to her home one day to tell her that he was intending to have a child with Ms Meagher and that he was going to leave and live with her. She then said that he returned to the home on a different occasion to take up residence with her again and that that was when they decided to try and reconcile the marriage and made plans to travel around Australia (AT 35). The reference to having a child with Ms Meagher could be consistent with a plan to adopt Mr Kidd's child being discussed rather than GAR contemplating having his own child with Ms Meagher (whose evidence at the trial was that she had been undergoing IVF treatment around the time of the Madden robbery). Discussion of a plan to do away with Mr Kidd may also be consistent with GAR's statement that he left Ms Meagher because he thought she was a ""dangerous"" person to be with, though GAR's previous convictions suggest he was no shrinking violet.

91Ultimately, while GAR's evidence is capable in my opinion of causing a jury to conclude that he had some kind of relationship with Ms Meagher, there are aspects of that evidence that are inherently implausible - one of which being that in the course of what (on any version) was a relatively brief relationship Ms Meagher, she and GAR would be concocting a plan to fabricate evidence against her then husband.

Mr Smith/Ms Meagher

92Mr Smith gave evidence that in 1997 he was living in Queensland with his wife and children (AT 43.24); that in between visits that he made to Sydney in relation to particular jobs he returned to Queensland (AT 43.28); that he had met Mark Middleton during work at Queensland (AT 43.32); and that by association with him he came to meet Mr Kidd. He firmly denied ever having given anything to Ms Meagher (AT 43.41; 45; AT 46.25).

93Mr Smith confirmed his affidavit evidence that there were two meetings that he had at a Drummoyne address where he met Ms Meagher (AT 44.22). He agreed that he had attended there a number of times but said that most of the times they talked with Mr Kidd on the grounds behind the building and did not go into the apartment. That is consistent with Ms Meagher's evidence that she did not like them in her apartment and that Mr Kidd used to go outside to talk with the men.

94There was a direct inconsistency between Mr Smith's evidence (see AT 44.36) that he had not attended the Balmain premises (he said he had no recollection of a residence in Balmain and did not know where Balmain was) and Ms Meagher's evidence that he had visited there several times. Ms Meagher said the Balmain premises were both business and residential premises but that he had attended the Balmain premises with Mr Kidd.

95There was also an inconsistency as to whether he had, as Ms Meagher suggested, had a telephone conversation with her in which he had indicated he was ""on the run"". Mr Smith denied that he had had any other phone contact with Ms Meagher other than when he called the Haymarket premises and said he would have had no reason to talk to her about the police going to his home or being on the run (AT 45).

96At AT 46.34, Mr Smith denied that he had had any contact with Ms Kidd other than that he had stated. It was not put to Mr Smith in cross-examination that he had had a relationship of any particular kind with Ms Meagher.

97Mr Smith was clear and concise in his evidence and was not shaken in cross-examination. By contrast, Ms Meagher was confused in many aspects of her evidence, which she gave in a vague and vacant manner.

98An example of this occurred at the commencement of her evidence in chief:

Q. At any stage did you receive a gold cross and chain from Ian Smith?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. From Ian?
A. From Ian, I did.

Q. You're saying Ian Smith?
A. Ian, the security guard - sorry, Robert Kidd gave me the gold chain, yeah.

99The general impression Ms Meagher gave when giving her evidence was that she was confused. Her response to the question put to her at AT 47.30 was given in a mechanical fashion and is not relied upon by Mr Kidd other than as a matter that might bear upon her credibility. Ms Meagher did not appear to be focussing on the questions asked of her and I would place no weight on that answer. She gave no appearance of giving any real thought or consideration to what she was being asked. Insofar as the answer at AT 47.33 commenced ""From Ian"", my impression was that Ms Meagher was mechanically repeating the question not proffering that as part of her answer.

100Ms Meagher nevertheless firmly denied (AT 48) having received anything at any time from Mr Smith; denied telling GAR that she had received any jewellery from Mr Smith or was going to do something with the Crime Commission to set up Mr Kidd; and, in her affidavit, denied any sexual or other relationship with Mr Smith.

101Her answers in cross-examination were inconsistent in other aspects. She first said she was not clear what Mr Smith's occupation was (AT 48.27); but then referred to the ""security guard"" and agreed that she did know him to be a security guard (AT 48.38/41). Later, at AT 60, she seemed to have no difficulty remembering that Mr Smith was or had been a security guard, saying that ""The security guard has never given me anything"".

102Ms Meagher said that she had met Mr Smith just a couple of times at Drummoyne; on the first occasion when he went outside with Mr Kidd and then at Drummoyne ""maybe another once or twice after that"" (AT 49). As noted earlier, she said that she had met Mr Smith at Balmain ""maybe a couple of times there too"" (AT 49.48). She said (AT 50) that the meetings at Balmain were meetings where Mr Smith came to meet with her husband. She thought she might have met Mr Smith at Haymarket but a lot of people were there and she did not know. She recalled some conversation about something with the police that might have involved Mr Smith (AT 51) and thought there was something to imply he had a lot of trouble and that it was he who had told her about those problems ""vaguely, yes"".

103At AT 51.36, she said:

Q. So based on what you told us earlier, more than twice the number of fingers on your hands [the times he met him at Drummoyne], isn't that right?
A. He was at my place on a couple of occasions, I can't recall how many. I had no interest in him whatsoever.

104At AT 51.43 she said she had seen Mr Smith at her place a few times. She could not recall if it was two or three but said ""he was here but they left and they used to leave"".

105In cross examination (at AT 52) it was put to her that the evidence given by her at the trial (referred to earlier) at T 307.49-56:

Q. Did you ever see Ian Smith in the company of Mr Kidd?
A. Did I ever see Ian Smith? Well, one day he came to my apartment, that was unannounced. I wasn't very happy about that and they left, and I saw them out on the foot.

was to the effect that she had said there that she had only seen Mr Kidd once. That is not how her answer reads on paper - rather it is consistent with her relating one occasion but without indicating one way or the other whether it was the only one.

106Many of her answers were non-responsive (such as at AT 53.11) when she said ""nobody is welcome in my home or business at all unless I approve of it, and I don't approve of it"".

107At AT 54.37, Ms Meagher denied that she was ""friendly"" with Mr Smith; at AT 54.41 she denied that she met him outside the presence of her husband, Mr Kidd.

108As to GAR, Ms Meagher said that she met him when he came over unannounced with an older gentleman. Just as GAR's statement in his police interview recounted a bizarre event (namely that on the first day he met her she simply walked into the lounge room without any clothes on), Ms Meagher's evidence was unusual in that apparently she saw nothing strange in people that she did not know appearing unannounced in her lounge room (AT 55.12):

Q. So he just knocked on your door or how did he introduce himself?
A. No, the front door was open, they were in my lounge room.

109Ms Meagher said that GAR and another man had come over for some work; that she had never seen GAR before that but she thought she had seen the older gentleman, someone by the name of Ray. She said that the door was opened and they just walked in. She said ""basically people just want work off me all the time and they had been sent over from the husband"". Ms Meagher said that the older gentleman was a friend of Mr Kidd and he came over to help her with odd jobs, painting moving rubbish and then said ""they wanted to get a car off me"" (AT 56.2).

110At AT 57.1, Ms Meagher explained that she had a motor dealer's licence and went on to add non-responsively, ""and I'm not a benevolent society, nor do I lay-by vehicles, and they were looking for a cheap vehicle. I was quite happy to help somebody, but I'm not there for breakdowns et cetera et cetera et cetera"".

111At AT 57.41, she said she would have seen GAR quite a few times:

I guess - like not a lot, but quite a - I think with the two of them, the older one was sort of in love with me a little bit and he was a little bit upset because the other one was there, and that sort of little feeling I felt was a bit of an issue with these two. So the old one keeps wanting to come over all the time.

112AT AT 58, Ms Meagher quite emphatically said that no one was allowed to stay at her place and certainly not a person, again volunteering that ""I've got no interest"".

113She denied that she had had a relationship with GAR at the end of 1999 and denied that she had gone to his house at Mount Vernon on 21 December (AT 58).

114Nevertheless, there was an exchange at AT 59 that suggests that GAR thought there was some basis for asking to use her address for parole purposes:

Q. You allowed him to use your address as his residential address for the purposes of parole?
A. No he asked me and I said no.

Q. He asked you. What did he ask you?
A. They keep asking you for stuff all the time and the answer is no I'm not going to give anybody any money or anything.

Q. What did he ask you about?
A. Money, a car.

Q. What else?
A. Borrow this, take that.

Q. But did you ask you whether he could use your address?
A. No one is allowed to do anything. What you do is your own thing but no you're not allowed to be using my address.

Determination on second issue

115The Crown points to various matters that cast doubt on the plausibility of GAR's version of events.

116First, the apparent delay in Ms Meagher's implementation of a plan that, according to GAR, had been in Ms Meagher's mind in late 1999 or early 2000. The first occasion on which Ms Meagher told police that Mr Kidd had given her the jewellery stolen from the Madden home was November 2003 (and then only when she acceded to a request from Mr Kidd's solicitor that she speak to the police).

117Second, the temporal difficulty involved in the proposition that as at the time of the trial in 2004 Ms Meagher would have had the motivation to lie about the jewellery that it is suggested she had in order to prolong Mr Kidd's time in custody (i.e., to facilitate her adoption of Mr Kidd's child or to enable her to have access to his inheritance).

118By the time Ms Meagher was interviewed by the police on 10 November 2003, Mr Kidd had been convicted of offences in Queensland and sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period scheduled to expire in September 2006. On 27 August 2001, Mr Kidd had been charged with a series of offences in New South Wales, not just the aggravated armed robbery at the Madden residence. He was convicted of an aggravated armed robbery at Manly on 26 August 2003 and of an attempted armed robbery at the National Australia Bank on 3 September 2003. Both those matters had been adjourned for sentence until after the trial for the Madden robbery. The Crown submits that the proposition that Ms Meagher might need to fabricate evidence in order to prolong the period of time Mr Kidd spent in custody is therefore unlikely.

119Moreover, by the time Ms Meagher gave evidence in Mr Kidd's trial, there had already been proceedings regarding the estate of the child's deceased mother and the Public Trustee had replaced Ms Meagher as the trustee of the estate. Ms Meagher was cross-examined at the trial to suggest that her motivation to lie was in order to retain the care of the child and hence the access to funds from the Public Trustee for his care.

120Ultimately, little reliance can be placed on Ms Meagher's denial of a relationship with GAR but that does make his evidence of the conversation with her (as to the receipt of the jewellery and suggestion that she would falsify her evidence) plausible. Given the temporal issues there is no sensible basis for concluding that she had a motivation in late 2003 (or at the trial in 2004) to lie about the provenance of the jewellery. Mr Kidd was clearly facing a lengthy custodial sentence for other offences; Ms Meagher had already been replaced by the Public Trustee in relation to her stepson's interest in his deceased mother's estate; and the adoption proceedings to which reference was made at her trial had either been abandoned or had otherwise come to an end.

121The second issue posed in Abou-Chabake cannot be answered in the affirmative in my opinion.

Would fresh evidence have caused jury to entertain a reasonable doubt/is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted?

122The above conclusion means that it is not strictly necessary to consider the third issue posed in Abou-Chabake, namely whether in the context of the evidence given at the trial the fresh evidence would have been likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Mr Kidd or whether there is a significant possibility that had the evidence been available the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted Mr Kidd. I consider that issue briefly as follows.

123The Crown submits that, given the strength and cogency of the evidence given in the trial and the nature of the directions given in relation to the evidence of Mr Smith (i.e., that the jury must consider it independently of the evidence of Ms Meagher and must be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt), it is not likely that the jury would have entertained a reasonable doubt (and there would not be a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted Mr Kidd) if the jury had heard the evidence of GAR.

124The Crown points to the considerable challenge made to the veracity of Ms Meagher at the trial: she admitted to lying on oath when she gave evidence to the New South Wales Crime Commission in February 1998 (T 322-329, T 344-345) when she said that she had never heard of Mr Madden and had never been to Burraneer; that she had given inconsistent evidence on an earlier voir dire about which she was cross-examined at the trial (T 334-336), she having said that Mr Kidd had never discussed with her what happened on the night of the robbery; and that she had given a further version of events to police in an interview about which she was also cross-examined at the trial (T 349-352). The Crown notes that her evidence at trial was contrasted with evidence she had given at an earlier aborted trial in relation to the offence (T 358.6). It was suggested to her that she was making her evidence up as she went along (T 360.5).

125In effect, the Crown submission in this regard appears to be that further evidence as to Ms Meagher's unreliability as a witness would still not have caused the jury to entertain sufficient doubt as to Mr Kidd's guilt.

126Insofar as Mr Kidd submits that, other than the finding of the cross and chain and the Mercedes key chain, no other evidence was capable of giving credence to Mr Smith's evidence, the Crown points to the evidence from both that Mr Smith and Ms Meagher that there were two occasions when she drove Mr Kidd to the scene for the purposes of undertaking recognisance and that the police surveillance on 4 July 1997 had identified the cars of Ms Meagher and one of the co-offenders present in the street where the Maddens lived and that a police officer had seen a number of men standing around the entrance to the victim's home dressed in dark clothing, some wearing beanies and others rolling up balaclavas (T 398). It is submitted that this evidence gives substantial credence to the evidence of both Mr Smith and Ms Meagher.

127Had the evidence from GAR as to the conversation with Ms Meagher in which he claims she said she had received the jewellery from Mr Smith been credible, then there cannot be excluded a possibility that this would have been sufficient to cause the jury to entertain doubt as to Mr Smith's evidence (which the jury must have accepted in order to convict Mr Kidd), even though that possibility seems only a slender one. Mr Smith's evidence on that issue in the present application remained unshaken; both GAR and Ms Meagher were singularly unimpressive witnesses; and there was nothing credible to support the notion of any kind of relationship between Ms Meagher and Mr Smith that would make explicable the giving by him to her of the jewellery. In any event, it is not necessary to decide this third issue, given the conclusion that the fresh evidence is not apparently credible or capable of being believed (in the words of Gibbs CJ in Gallagher to which reference has already been made).

Conclusion

128The circumstances in which GAR came to give the so-called fresh evidence are such as to give rise to a strong suspicion of concoction of evidence but it is not necessary to make any finding to that effect. GAR's evidence as to the conversation with Ms Meagher as to the provenance of the jewellery is not credible. Nor are the circumstances in which GAR came to disclose that conversation.

129In circumstances where the appeal lacks merit, leave to extend time for appeal should be refused. Were leave to have been granted the appeal would for the above reasons have been dismissed.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765668,R v MB (No. 3) [2014] NSWSC 1796,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1On 11 December 2014, following a special hearing conducted over a period of 9 days, I found that on the limited evidence available MB (""the offender"") had committed the offence with which she was charged, namely that on 18 November 2010, at North Strathfield in the State of NSW, she murdered her six month old daughter, OB. 
2Having reached that conclusion, I adjourned the proceedings to allow counsel for the offender to make submissions to me regarding the length of any limiting term.  
3On 17 December 2014 I heard submissions from counsel for the offender and from the Crown.
The relevant legislative provisions4Section 23 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act"") is in the following terms:
23 Procedure after completion of special hearing  (1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court: 
(a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 
(b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 
(2) If a Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person, the Court may impose any other penalty or make any other order it might have made on conviction of the person for the relevant offence in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
(3) Any such other penalty imposed or order made, under subsection (2), is to be subject to appeal in the same manner as a penalty or order in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
(4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence). 
(5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court: (a) after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time, or 
(b) directs that the term commence at a later time so as to be served consecutively with (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively with) some other limiting term nominated in respect of the person or a sentence of imprisonment imposed on the person. 
(6) When making a direction under subsection (5) (b), the Court is to take into account that: (a) a sentence of imprisonment imposed in a normal trial of criminal proceedings may be subject to a non-parole period whereas a limiting term is not, and 
(b) in a normal trial of criminal proceedings, consecutive sentences of imprisonment are to be imposed with regard to non-parole periods (as referred to in section 47 (4) and (5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ). 
(7) If the Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a forensic patient, it must notify the Tribunal that a limiting term is not to be nominated in respect of the person. 
5Section 24 of the Act is in the following terms:
24 Consequences of nomination of limiting term (1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court: 
(a) must refer the person to the Tribunal, and 
(b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate. 
(2) If a Court refers a person to the Tribunal, the Tribunal must determine whether or not: 
(a) the person is suffering from mental illness, or 
(b) the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a mental health facility and, where the person is not in a mental health facility, whether or not the person objects to being detained in a mental health facility. 
(3) The Tribunal must notify the Court which referred the person to it of its determination with respect to the person.
General principles as to the determination of a limiting term6I am required to specify a limiting term which is the equivalent of the total sentence which would have been imposed had the offender been found guilty following a trial.  The limiting term represents the period beyond which the offender cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing: R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120; (1999) 108 A Crim R 85.  In determining the limiting term, I must take into account all relevant factors, and apply all the relevant principles that would otherwise have applied to the sentencing of the offender had there been a trial before a jury: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239.  The facts and circumstances of the offending are set out at length in my earlier judgment and I will not repeat them.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIESSubmissions of the offender7The primary submission of counsel for the offender was that the objective seriousness of the offending fell at the lowest end of the range.  Counsel advanced a number of propositions in support of that position.
8Firstly, it was submitted that the offender was ""labouring under a major psychiatric illness"" at the time of the offending conduct, which manifested itself in (inter alia) separation of thought, high anxiety and perceptual distortions.  
9Secondly, counsel submitted that the offender was preoccupied with the thought that OB had achondroplasia.  It was submitted that her belief in this regard was genuinely held, and that in this sense there was a nexus between her mental state and her offending. 
10Thirdly, it was submitted that the 000 call indicated that the offender was under considerable stress, and in ""severe mental turmoil"", at the time of the offending.
11Fourthly, counsel submitted that I would not be satisfied that the offending was pre-meditated.  He submitted that the various statements made by the offender to her friends (which were set out at length in my earlier judgment) should be viewed as ""utterances"" which reflected ""exasperation or not coping"", and which were consistent with the major psychiatric illness under which the offender was labouring at the time.  I should note that I rejected a similar proposition advanced by counsel at the hearing (see [266] of my previous judgment).  In terms of the internet search conducted by the offender in respect of death by drowning, counsel submitted that the offender's mind was in ""severe turmoil"" at the time.  He submitted that this tended against a conclusion that the search was indicative of pre-meditation.
12Finally, and in what might be described as an ""overarching"" submission, counsel for the offender submitted that the circumstances of the offending were ""exceptional"" and ""far beyond run-of-the-mill"" because of the ""very complex circumstances"" which existed at the time.  In this regard, and in terms of such circumstances, counsel pointed to the ""very significant and profound effects of the psychiatric illness under which (the offender) was labouring"".  
13In terms of mitigating factors, counsel submitted that the offender was a person of otherwise good character.  It was further submitted that I should find that the offender was remorseful and that this was evidenced, in particular, by the contents of the 000 call.  
14Finally, it was submitted that the evidence of the offender's mental state was such that she should be regarded as an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  
Submissions of the Crown 15The Crown submitted that the most significant factor in determining the limiting term was an assessment of the seriousness of the offending.  In making that submission, the Crown took issue with the proposition that the offending fell at the lowest end of the scale.  
16The Crown submitted that even if it were accepted that the offender held a genuine belief that OB had achondroplasia, this did not in any way sanction what had occurred.  The Crown submitted that the offence was one of ""convenience"", and not one which resulted from a momentary loss of control.  In this regard the Crown placed particular emphasis on the statements made by the offender to her friends in the period leading up to OB's death.  It was submitted that OB's death was obviously something that was operating on the offender's mind in that period and that her statements were consistent with an absence of affection for OB, a lack of bonding with her, and a firmly held view that OB had compromised her otherwise ""perfect"" life.  
17The Crown accepted that the medical evidence supported the conclusion that the symptoms of the offender's mental illness fluctuated from time to time.  However, it was submitted that the statements made by the offender to her friends were not isolated, were maintained over a period of time, and were consistent with the internet search regarding death by drowning.  It was submitted that all of these considerations tended against the proposition that the offending was spontaneous.
18The Crown also pointed to the fact that OB's age made her completely vulnerable and defenceless.  It was submitted that the offending necessarily involved a serious breach of trust and that it was necessary for any limiting term to reflect those considerations.  
19In terms of the offender's subjective case, the Crown submitted that statements made by the offender to her mother which were recorded by listening device were completely at odds with a conclusion that the offender was remorseful, and reflected the fact that she sought to blame other circumstances for OB's death.  It was submitted that a number of those statements made it clear that the offender, far from being remorseful, was concerned primarily with herself.  The Crown submitted that in determining whether there was any evidence of remorse, the statements made by the offender to her mother were substantially more informative than the contents of the 000 call.
20No issue was raised by the Crown as to the offender being a person of otherwise good character.  The Crown did not cavil with the general proposition that the offender's mental state rendered her an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  Further, I did not understand the Crown to take issue with the proposition that specific deterrence was of limited significance in the present case.
CONSIDERATION 21Section 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") provides that it is an aggravating factor if the offence:
""was part of a planned or organised criminal activity"".
22It has been observed that the wording of this provision conveys more than simply that the offending was planned:  Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 per Howie J at [12] (Simpson and Buddin JJ agreeing).  In that case, it was observed that the sentencing judge's determination that there had been a ""level of planning"" did not necessarily give rise to a conclusion that the aggravating factor in s. 21A(2)(n) was established.  
23In my earlier judgment (at [51]-[69]; [111]-[120]) I set out the evidence of statements made by the offender to her friends which, I concluded, evidenced a desire on the part of the offender to rid herself of OB. I also made reference (at [173]) to internet searches carried out by the offender, one of which concerned an article about drowning and sudden cardiac death.  I found (at [264]-[268]) that all of this evidence supported a conclusion that the offender had intentionally killed OB.  
24However it is important to bear in mind that intention and planning are quite different.  A person may act with the intention of bringing about a certain result without actually having planned in advance to do so.  It is also necessary for me to have regard to the whole of the evidence in determining whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offending was planned: R v Reynolds [2004] NSWCCA 51 at [39] per Simpson J, Levine and Barr JJ agreeing.  In this regard, the evidence of the offender making arrangements for OB's Baptism (referred to at [111] of my previous judgment) is inconsistent with a conclusion that the offending was planned.
25I am satisfied that the offender had thought about killing OB at various times prior to 18 November 2010.  She told her friends as much.  The internet search is consistent with her having investigated ways in which OB might be killed.  In that sense, her act of drowning OB cannot be viewed as entirely spontaneous: Reynolds (supra) at [40].  However, in all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the offending was planned in the sense contemplated by s. 21A(2)(n).
26I am satisfied that in the period leading up to 18 November 2010 the offender believed that OB had some genetic or other abnormality.  That belief was completely contrary to the reassurances which she was repeatedly given by qualified medical practitioners but I am nevertheless satisfied that it was a belief which, in her own mind, she genuinely held.  There was a connection between that belief and the offender's feelings of resentment towards OB (see [264] of my earlier judgment).  Those feelings were, in turn, at least part of the motivation for the offender to want to kill OB.  I am satisfied in these circumstances that there was some connection between the offender's mental state and the offending.
27As I have noted, the general submission advanced by counsel for the offender was that the circumstances of this case were properly regarded as ""extraordinary"".  That submission tended to revolve around the evidence of the offender's mental state.  I accept that the offender's mental state is a relevant consideration in determining the limiting term: R v Wilson (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 1684 per Harrison J at [79].  I have taken the evidence of her mental state into account.  However, as Harrison J pointed out (at [80]) an offender's mental state does not operate to displace other matters, including the objective seriousness of the offence.  In that regard, his Honour cited the observations of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and McCallum JJ agreed) in Bhuiyan v R [2009] NSWCCA 221 at [30]:
""In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ recognised the difficulties faced by a court when sentencing persons with mental disorders. Those difficulties are compounded when a person is found not fit to be tried but, applying conventional principles a court is required to determine a limiting term. It is necessary to keep steadfastly in mind that although in most cases the serious mental illness will have deprived an offender of their usual capacity for reason and control it must not be allowed to overwhelm appropriate consideration of the circumstances of the offence and the other subjective features of the offender. The particular difficulties faced by an offender which may have contributed to the offence will be addressed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal which in appropriate circumstances may release the offender before the limiting term has expired.""
28The offender's actions in intentionally killing OB represented a serious breach of trust and a complete abandonment of maternal responsibility.  That breach of trust is an aggravating factor having regard to the provisions of s. 21A(2)(k) of the Sentencing Act.  Moreover, OB was a defenceless and vulnerable 6 month old child who was completely dependent upon the offender for her survival.  That vulnerability is a further aggravating factor having regard to s. 21A(2)(l) of the Sentencing Act.  
29For the reasons expressed in my previous judgment, I am satisfied that the offender intentionally killed OB.  I am satisfied that she did so because she regarded OB as an imposition upon, and an interference in, her life (see [307] of my previous judgment).  In these circumstances, the conclusion that the offending in the present case was of the utmost seriousness is inescapable.  For all of these reasons I am unable to accept the submission that the offending falls at the lowest end of the scale of objective seriousness.  I place it slightly below the middle of the range, albeit not by a substantial margin.
The offender's subjective case30The offender is now 39 years of age.  She was aged 35 at the time of the offending.  It was accepted by the Crown that she is a person of otherwise good character. That is a mitigating factor having regard to s. 21A(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act.
31I do not accept that the offender has demonstrated any remorse.  The fact that she was obviously distraught when making the 000 call does not evidence remorse, nor does the content of the conversation which took place at that time.  Moreover, there is other evidence which tends wholly against a conclusion that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  
32In recorded conversations the offender told her mother that she wished she had never fallen pregnant with OB: Ex AH 2 p. 10.  She sought to attribute the blame for OB's death to others, including medical practitioners: Ex AC 2 at p. 6-8; Ex AD 2 p. 2; Ex AE 2 p. 5.  She also sought to attribute OB's death to the fact that she had skin tags on her ears (Ex AF 2 at p. 3; Ex AH 2 at p. 11).  On another occasion she expressed indignation at the position in which she found herself, threatening to ""sue for fuckin' compensation"" in the event that she was placed in custody (Ex AH 2 at p. 37).  Those various statements are, in my view, the antithesis of genuine remorse. 
33The offender's mental state is such that she is not a suitable vehicle for general deterrence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 esp. at [177] per McClellan CJ at CL.  Moreover, the unique circumstances of her offending are such that I am not satisfied that there is a particular need for specific deterrence.
34Whether there is a likelihood of re-offending, and what the offender's prospects of rehabilitation might be, are factors which are difficult to determine.   In his most recent report of 1 February 2014 (Ex AT 3) Professor Greenberg noted that the offender was under treatment from a psychiatrist who had prescribed two forms of anti-depressant medication.  Professor Greenberg reported that the offender had acknowledged to him that she had not been compliant with her medication for at least the preceding month, and possibly longer.  Professor Greenberg proceeded to confirm the diagnosis of a Schizophrenic disorder.
35There is no evidence before me as to whether the offender's compliance with her medication regime has improved in the past 10 months.  Determining the likelihood of re-offending, and the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, is dependent, at least in part, upon her adherence to any prescribed regime of medication.  Her recent history is not favourable in this respect but I have no evidence before me as to the current position.  
36In all of the circumstances the evidence does not permit me to reach a finding in respect of either of these issues.
ORDERS37In accordance with s. 23(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 I indicate that if the special hearing involving the offender had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence of murder, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.  
38For the reasons I have expressed, I make the following orders:
(1)I nominate, as the limiting term in respect of the offence of murder, a period of 20 years commencing on 11 December 2014.(2)In accordance with s. 24(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 I refer the offender to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.(3)The offender is to be detained in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine.  (4)The Registrar is to notify:
(i)the Minister for Health;
(ii)the Chairperson of the Mental Health Review Tribunal; and
(iii)the Commissioner for Corrective Services NSW,
of these orders.**********

		13 March 2017",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765677,Lay v R [2014] NSWCCA 310,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 14 November 2013 after pleading guilty to attempting to possess a commercial quantity of heroin as a border controlled drug which had been unlawfully imported contrary to ss 11.1 and 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). That offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000.

3The Criminal Code specifies a commercial quantity of heroin as 1.5 kilograms. The quantity of heroin the applicant attempted to possess was 4.8 kilograms.

4After allowing a discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty the applicant was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.

5In separate sentence proceedings before the same sentencing judge in February and March 2014, two other men, Helio Lay, the applicant's cousin, and Chi Man Lam, an associate of the applicant's cousin, were sentenced for their roles in attempting to possess a consignment of heroin, of which the quantity that the applicant attempted to possess was a relatively small part. Both co-offenders were also sentenced for their roles in attempting to possess a commercial quantity of methamphetamine which had also been unlawfully imported. Methamphetamine is also a border controlled drug under the Criminal Code with a commercial quantity specified at 0.75 kilograms pure. Helio Lay was also sentenced for a separate offence of trafficking a commercial quantity of methamphetamine contrary to the Criminal Code.

6Helio Lay was sentenced as follows. For attempting to possess heroin and methamphetamine contrary to ss 11.1 and 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code he was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. (Under the Criminal Code provision is made for a single charge to be laid where two different border controlled drugs are involved in the commission of an offence and for the combined weight of the drugs to be taken into account for sentencing purposes.) For trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s 302.2(1) of the Criminal Code he was sentenced to 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The sentence on the first count was accumulated by 18 months on the sentence imposed on the second count, resulting in a total effective sentence of 17 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months.

7Lam was also sentenced on two counts. For the first count, attempting to possess a commercial quantity of heroin contrary to ss 11.1 and 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. The second count, attempting to possess a commercial quantity of methamphetamine contrary to ss 11 and 307.5(1), attracted the same sentence. Both counts were ordered to be served concurrently.

8In the sentence proceedings of both Lam and Helio Lay his Honour made express reference to the factual findings he made when sentencing this applicant and the sentence he imposed. This was not only to ensure that appropriate attention was given in the sentencing of co-offenders to the need for their sentences to reflect the fundamental norm of equal justice underpinning the parity principle (a consideration to which his Honour made express reference), but because in sentencing Helio Lay his Honour was urged to find he was at all times operating under the direction of this applicant. In the result, and despite what his Honour described as his grave suspicions, he was unable on the evidence before him in Helio Lay's sentence proceedings to make that finding, although he was satisfied that Helio Lay was primarily acting under the direction of one or more than one person in relation to both offences. 

9It will be necessary to refer to the sentencing reasons in respect of both the applicant's co-offenders in order to deal with the second of the applicant's grounds of appeal mounted on parity grounds.

10A summary of the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentences imposed on his co-offenders relative to the drugs the subject of all counts and their weight is set out in the table below:

11The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that his involvement commenced at least by 24 July 2012.

Ground 2: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentences imposed on Helio Lay and Chi Man Lam.

Proceedings on sentence

12At the sentencing hearing the Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts and the applicant's criminal history. Relevantly, for the purposes of the appeal, the applicant tendered a letter from the applicant's wife, a report from Dr Ton K Lee, general practitioner, dated 27 September 2013, and a report from Dr Mark Howard, psychologist, dated 5 November 2013.

The facts as found by the sentencing judge

13On 17 January 2012, Yuk Yin Tang arrived in Sydney from Hong Kong. Later that month he entered into a residential tenancy agreement over an apartment on Sussex Street.

14On 4 February 2012, Fu Vico Lee, also a Hong Kong citizen, arrived in Sydney. 

15Later in February Tang registered the business name ""Best at Home"" as a retail homewares business operating from the Sussex Street apartment.

16On 18 February 2012, the applicant travelled to Hong Kong.

17On 23 February 2012, Tang and Lee signed a commercial lease over warehouse premises at Alexandria.

18On 4 March 2012, a shipping container imported from Bangkok consigned to the business Best at Home was delivered to the Alexandria warehouse. It contained ceramic vases and clay lamps. The statement of agreed facts refers to this consignment imported by Tang and Lee as a ""dry run"" designed to give the impression that Best At Home was a legitimate import business and to enable them to determine whether the consignment would be subjected to surveillance by Australian Customs or law enforcement agencies.

19Between 12 March and 13 June 2012, four further containers of homewares were imported, each of which were also described in the facts as ""dry runs"".

20On 9 June 2012, the applicant returned to Australia.

21On 12 June 2012, phone records indicated that the applicant was contacted by Helio Lay using a mobile phone with a number that ended in 448 (""the 448 number""). 

22On 12 July 2012, the co-offender, Lam, arrived in Brisbane from Hong Kong, from where he travelled to the Sussex Street address in Sydney.

23On 18 July 2012, two further containers were consigned to the Best at Home business at the Alexandria warehouse. On this occasion, in addition to the containers of homewares, 300 oblong-shaped silver packages were located by Customs, each containing methamphetamine with a purity of 78 per cent. The calculated pure weight of the methamphetamine was 233,070 grams (233 kilograms). In addition, 720 further packages were located containing heroin with a purity of 69 per cent. The calculated weight of pure heroin was 174,483.8 grams (174 kilograms).

24The drugs were replaced with an inert substance for the purpose of a controlled delivery. The container was delivered to the warehouse at Alexandria on 26 July 2012. 

25Lee and another Hong Kong national, Kwai Leung Poon, had various discussions concerning the anticipated arrival of Hung Kai Lok, another Hong Kong national. He arrived in Sydney on 19 July 2012 and took up residence in the Sussex Street apartment.

26Call charge records indicate that on 21 July 2012 Helio Lay and the applicant were in telephone contact, with the applicant using the 448 number and Helio Lay using a number that ended in 990 (""the 990 number"").

27Call charge records also indicate that at around 4.22pm on 24 July 2012 the applicant, this time using a mobile phone with a number ending in 181 (""the 181 number"") called a Hong Kong telephone service ending in 991 (""the Hong Kong 991 number""). These records also indicate that the following day Helio Lay contacted the applicant by telephone, with the applicant now using the 448 phone number and Helio Lay using the 990 phone number.

28On 26 July 2012, Tang, Lam and Lok unpacked the two containers at the warehouse located in Alexandria. The sentencing judge found that over the course of the next two days Lam and Lok removed 714 of the substitute heroin packages and 306 of the substitute methamphetamine packages, apparently unaware that the drugs had been intercepted.

29On Saturday 28 July 2012, Lee and Poon discussed the fact that two people were to come to the Alexandria warehouse to collect the items on the following Monday or Tuesday (30 and 31 July). On the same day Helio Lay contacted the applicant on the 448 phone number.

30The following day, Poon instructed Lee to set aside what he believed to be 200 heroin packages and 50 methamphetamine packages, with instructions that the balance of the packages were to be given to the ""person"". At around 1.16pm Helio Lay, using a mobile phone with a number ending in 973, received a call from Lee and organised to meet him the next day at 1pm at Market City in Haymarket. Immediately after that call, telephone call charge records indicate a number of calls, or attempted calls, passed between the applicant and Helio Lay. After a call between the applicant and Helio Lay at 2pm, the applicant, using the 181 number, placed a call to a Hong Kong telephone service with a number ending in 938 (""Hong Kong telephone number 938"").

31On Monday 30 July 2012, Helio Lay and Lam arrived at the Alexandria warehouse and met with Tang and Lok. Helio Lay and Lok loaded three cardboard boxes containing 200 heroin substitute packages and 50 methamphetamine substitute packages into a Honda motor vehicle driven by Helio Lay.

32At around 1.27pm he left the warehouse and drove to his residence in Green Valley. At the same time the applicant, using his 181 number, called Hong Kong telephone service 938. Call charge records indicate that, while driving to his residence, Helio Lay had three phone conversations with the applicant, with Helio Lay using the 990 number and the applicant using the 448 number.

33When Helio Lay arrived at his residence the applicant's vehicle was parked outside. The applicant then removed 20 substitute heroin packages from the boot of Helio Lay's vehicle and placed them in the boot of his vehicle. At 4.19pm, using the 181 number, he rang Hong Kong telephone number 938. After leaving Helio Lay's residence, he was stopped by police and placed under arrest.

34Upon being searched, three clear clip-sealed bags were located in his jacket pocket which contained a white crystalline material which, upon later analysis, revealed no prohibited substances. A SIM card for the 973 telephone number (the number Helio Lay had used to communicate with Lee) was also located. The calculated weight of the pure heroin that the applicant attempted to possess was 4846.6 grams. Its total wholesale value was estimated to be around $1,966,720.

35The police located 180 heroin substitute packages and 50 methamphetamine substitute packages in Helio Lay's vehicle. Inside his premises a number of plastic bags which contained a white coloured crystalline substance were located which, upon analysis, contained methamphetamine, with a purity ranging between 70.1 per cent and 79.3 per cent.

36Lee, Lam, Tang and Lok were also all arrested.

37When interviewed by police, the applicant stated that he had first spoken to Helio Lay about the heroin on 30 July 2012, the afternoon of his arrest, when he was told to come to his cousin's home. He said it was only when he arrived that he was told about the drugs and shown them, at which time he asked for access to ""20 pieces"" on credit. He also told police that he planned to store the heroin at his home and ""slowly over time"" sell it at Star City Casino to discharge a $300,000 gambling debt which had accrued as a result of his gambling activities in China and Hong Kong. He told police he was to pay Helio Lay $3.2 million when the heroin was sold. The sentencing judge noted that the applicant also told Dr Howard that it was on the afternoon of his arrest that he was called by Helio Lay and asked to come to his home and that it was only upon arrival that he was asked if he wanted to take a quantity of heroin to sell. 

38On sentence it was submitted that his Honour would find the applicant's involvement was limited in time, in accordance with what he told others after his arrest. The sentencing judge rejected that submission. He was satisfied that the applicant's involvement in what proved to be his attempted possession of the heroin on 30 July 2012 commenced at least by 24 July 2012. On the appeal it was submitted that this was a finding not open to him on the direct evidence or any inference legitimately capable of being drawn from that evidence. 

The applicant's criminal record and other subjective factors

39The applicant was charged in 1991 for his possession 4.2 kilograms of heroin contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) which he told police on his arrest at that time he obtained on credit from an overseas supplier for resale with no particular purchaser in mind. In 1993 he was convicted and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years.

40His Honour regarded the significance of the applicant's previous drug conviction as disentitling him to the leniency which might be afforded an offender with no prior convictions. He also found that the subject offending was not an aberration and that its scale warranted the imposition of a sentence which factored in the need for personal deterrence as well as general deterrence. 

41His Honour was unable to make any meaningful prediction of the risk of further offending given the applicant's reoffending after serving a lengthy period of imprisonment imposed in 1993, although he did accept that the applicant's age when he will be entitled to be considered for release to parole might diminish the risk to some extent. 

42The applicant was 61 years at the time of sentence. He was at that time being treated for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol levels. There was also evidence that he has been hospitalised, on one occasion, as a result of a heart condition. The additional hardship that the applicant would suffer as a result of his age and ill health was taken into account by the sentencing judge in the imposition of sentence.

43The applicant did not give evidence on sentence. The sentencing judge treated the applicant's account to Dr Howard, including that he had no idea how to sell the heroin he claimed to have been given on credit or that his offending was unrelated with his past offending, with appropriate caution. Further, in the absence of evidence from the applicant, his Honour said he was unable to make any assessment of the genuineness of the applicant's remorse as expressed to others. 

44His Honour was, it seems, prepared to accept that the applicant had accumulated gambling debts of $300,000 to ""loan sharks"" but he did not accept that this operated in mitigation of sentence, or that it diminished the applicant's ability to resist engaging in what his Honour described as serious offending given the quantity of heroin involved. 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that his involvement in the offence commenced at least by 24 July 2012

45On sentence the applicant's senior counsel, who did not appear on the appeal, conceded that the applicant played a significant role in an enterprise in which a number of co-offenders were involved and which had as its objective obtaining possession of a very large quantity of border controlled drugs for distribution. Counsel accepted that the characterisation of the applicant's role was reflected in the agreed facts by his attempt to obtain possession of 20 kilograms of heroin (of the consignment of 174 kilograms) to sell. Counsel submitted, however, that did not allow for the further finding urged by the Crown that the applicant's involvement predated his arrest by weeks and months. It was the Crown's submission that the applicant's travel to Hong Kong in February 2012 was connected with the dispatch of the drugs to Australia. Counsel for the applicant submitted that at most his involvement predated his arrest by a day and, more likely, not until the day of his arrest, consistent with his account to police and his account to Dr Howard. 

46His Honour was conscious of the need to ensure that the principle in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 was not breached by sentencing the applicant as if he had a role in the importation of 174 kilograms of heroin, repeating more than once in the sentencing reasons that the applicant's criminality was limited to the role he played in obtaining possession of a very large quantity, namely 20 kilograms, with the intention of distributing it for sale. Nonetheless, his Honour considered (as he was entitled to) that the duration of the applicant's involvement in the offence to which he pleaded guilty was a matter which informed the question of objective seriousness. Self evidently, a person who acquires knowledge of the pending availability of a commercial quantity of drugs on the day that possession is attempted is likely to be regarded as less morally culpable than a person who knows of that fact for a longer period of time and takes purposive steps over time to facilitate delivery to himself or herself, whether by maintaining or even initiating contact with those who are to make the drugs available. 

47His Honour sentenced the applicant on that basis. Contrary to the both the submission advanced on the applicant's behalf and the finding urged by the Crown, his Honour concluded:

""... I am of the view that the offender's involvement in the attempt to obtain possession of the drug predates the time he asserted to police when he was arrested. This conclusion is based upon the timing and frequency of calls the offender engaged in with the offender Helio Lay and calls made by the offender to unidentified persons in Hong Kong. The pattern of calls permits the drawing of an inference beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's involvement commenced by at least 24 July 2012.""

His Honour continued:

""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's involvement predates the time of his admitted involvement in attempting to possess the drug for which he faces sentence, that it the amount of 4.8 kilograms of heroin. I am of the view that the offender had contact with persons in Hong Kong in order to facilitate the transfer of possession of 4.8 kilograms of heroin to himself for the purpose of distribution in Australia. I cannot, however, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his travel to Hong Kong in June was for that purpose.""

48The pattern of calls to which his Honour referred necessarily included the applicant's use of the phone with the 181 number to contact the 991 Hong Kong number on 24 July 2012, two days before the container was delivered to Alexandria and after its dispatch from Hong Kong. This was an agreed fact, as was the fact that the applicant contacted the 938 Hong Kong number on three further occasions using the same number, namely on 29 July 2012, 30 July at 1.27pm, en route to collect the heroin from Helio Lay and 30 July at 4.19pm after collecting the heroin. The calls on 29 July and the call at 1.27pm on 30 July were after the applicant had phone contact with Helio Lay using another phone number, and after Helio Lay organised a meeting with Lee in Haymarket, following which he transported the drugs in his car to his home. On his arrest he was in possession of the SIM card Helio Lay had used to contact Lee. 

49On the appeal, the applicant's counsel sought to emphasise that the call made to Hong Kong on 24 July was to the 991 Hong Kong number, whereas all the calls on subsequent dates were to the 938 Hong Kong number. The applicant also submitted that there was no direct evidence that any of these calls were drug-related and, in particular, nothing to link the 991 number to the drug enterprise, being the only call he made on 24 July 2012. Counsel submitted that it was equally open for his Honour to infer that the applicant was calling the 991 Hong Kong number on that date in relation to his $300,000 gambling debt, or that the call may have related to his employment with his nephew in a logistics business in China. 

50Counsel also advanced the submission that the rejection of the applicant's account to police and Dr Howard as untrue did not, of itself, entitle the sentencing judge to find that the applicant's involvement predated the day of his arrest by at least the six days. What counsel on the appeal had to confront, and in my view what he failed adequately to address, was that his client did not give evidence to put the agreed facts of his contact with Hong Kong at a time which counsel conceded was significant in the overall scheme in an innocent context. While the applicant was not obliged to give evidence on sentence, the fact that he did not quite properly allowed for a contrary inference to be safely drawn, and beyond reasonable doubt, from the agreed facts. 

51The fact that an alternate inference was open (assuming the submission put by counsel on the applicant's behalf can be so categorised) does not mean his Honour's finding cannot stand. As Basten JA observed in Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 at [8], a sentencing judge would not be bound to reject an impugned factual finding in those circumstances since he would be entitled to dismiss a competing inference (as his Honour did in this case), assuming a sufficiency of evidence or inferences from the evidence to establish the contrary as not raising a reasonable doubt in his mind. The distinction between a sentencing judge's assessment of facts and what they are capable of proving, and factual findings which this Court might make if it were to furnish its own view of agreed facts, must be maintained. Basten JA went on to say:

""...The boundary between a difference of opinion and a finding of error may not be a bright line, but it involves a distinction which must be respected.""

52This Court is bound by a sentencing judge's findings of fact, provided that they are supported by the evidence, or inferences legitimately drawn from the evidence, and that any facts that aggravate the objective seriousness of an offence or the applicant's offending are established beyond reasonable doubt. This Court has no power to substitute its own factual findings for those of the sentencing judge in the absence of error being demonstrated. 

53Where a factual error is made in the exercise of the sentencing discretion adverse to an offender, or where the sentencing judge failed to consider a material fact or an immaterial fact was erroneously relied upon in the House v The King sense ([1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499), this Court does not assess whether, and to what extent, the error influenced the outcome. The sentencing discretion having miscarried, it is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 per Spigelman CJ at [19], the approach recently endorsed as correct by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [40]-[43]). 

54For my part, I am not satisfied that any factual error of the kind contended for by the applicant has been demonstrated. 

55In assessing the applicant's role, and in supporting what his Honour ultimately found to be a number of purposive steps the applicant took in the days before he took physical custody and control of what he believed to be 20 kilograms of heroin, his Honour took into account the entirety of the factual matrix in the evidence that was before him in his sentencing reasons.

56I would reject the first ground of appeal. 

Ground 2: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders

57Two submissions were advanced to support what was said to be a disparity between this applicant's sentence and those of his co-offenders giving rise, in the applicant, to a justifiable sense of grievance. 

58Firstly, counsel drew attention to the commercial quantities of both the heroin and methamphetamine as the border controlled drugs involved in the offences committed by the applicant's co-offenders which, counsel submitted, exceeded the quantity of heroin the applicant sought to obtain possession of by an order of magnitude not adequately reflected in the sentences imposed in relative terms. It was further submitted that, irrespective of whether the first ground of appeal is made out, the applicant's offending was for a relatively short time as compared to the length of time during which his two co-offenders were involved in their attempts to access the drugs (including, in the case of Lam, his arrival in Australia for that purpose) and, further, that the gravity of the applicant's conduct in attempting to obtain possession of 20 kilograms of heroin was, for that reason, markedly different from their proven conduct.

59In Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58], McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme J and Latham J agreed) observed that an applicant faces a considerable obstacle in invoking the parity principle where a sentence said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance was imposed in circumstances where the sentencing judge was aware of the sentence imposed on co-offenders and it is clear that the sentences are structured in that knowledge. In this case, the co-offenders (who did not complain of disparity) were sentenced after the applicant. That said, as noted earlier, the sentencing judge was alert to parity considerations.

60The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice. In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, their Honours said of equal justice:

""...It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, [65]:
""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.""...""

61The sense of grievance complained of when the sentence for one offender is compared relative to that of a co-offender, or co-offenders, is to be assessed objectively governed by considerations of substance rather than form. It is only triggered where differences in the sentences imposed on co-offenders are disproportionate to relevant distinctions in the role each played in the commission of the offence (even if the roles might be differently described or involve different conduct) and in an offender's subjective circumstances. There are, necessarily, degrees of both similarity and difference in the criminal conduct of co-offenders and in their subjective circumstances. In some cases that requires that different sentences be imposed. However, it is only where there is a marked discrepancy between sentences not reasonably explained by the degree of difference between co-offenders and their offending that the disparity gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance requiring appellate intervention.

62On the appeal, insufficient attention was directed by both counsel to the sentencing reasons which attended the sentence imposed on the applicant's co-offenders. My analysis of that material leads me to conclude that this ground of appeal must fail.

The sentence of Helio Lay

63On 14 February 2014, Helio Lay was sentenced. It was the Crown case in those sentence proceedings that the heroin was to be distributed in 1 kilogram lots and that Helio Lay agreed to store it at his house for an indefinite period, distributing it to another person or other people who would collect it from him from time to time. That was accepted for sentencing purposes. Further, his Honour concluded that Helio Lay was at all times acting at the direction of others, not as an ""unknowing dupe"" but as somebody who had taken a number of steps before and at the time of the collection of the drugs at Alexandria, well aware of the scale of the illicit drug trade in which he was involved, including his collection of a very substantial quantity of two types of border controlled drugs for transportation to his home. His Honour was satisfied that the weight of the border controlled drugs has increased significance on sentence where an offender has knowledge of the quantity that is ultimately the subject of the charge without that feature being determinative of the sentence to be imposed.

64It is clear from the sentencing reasons in Helio Lay's case that it was the Crown case that the call charge records, summarised in the agreed facts, did not reveal the complete picture of his relationship with this applicant given that, in total, the conversations between them only extended over about five minutes. Counsel for Helio Lay submitted that his client was at all times operating at the direction of the applicant. The sentencing judge noted that the sentence proceedings of this applicant proceeded on the basis that there was no evidence that he was involved other than in collecting a portion of the heroin of which the larger portion remained under the custody and control of Helio Lay. 

65In resolving that issue in his Honour said: 

""... On the material placed before me, whilst there is grave suspicion that it was [the applicant] who was at all times directing the offender here, I am unable to determine whether, if it were not for the intervention of police, he would have further involvement with the drug collected from the Alexandria warehouse or had any involvement with the methamphetamine found in the offender's garage. The further material place d before me in those sentencing proceedings does not permit me to conclude that he was the person who was at all times directing the offender though, as I have indicated, I am of the view that the offender here was primarily acting under the direction of a person or persons in relation to both offences."" 

66The sentencing judge also found that Helio Lay involved himself in both drug offences for which he was sentenced for financial reward. He rejected Helio Lay's assertion that he was to receive $10,000, concluding that the return (from making the drugs available for distribution) would have been ""significantly higher than that"". He made no finding that Helio Lay was to sell the drugs for profit or that the applicant was to account to him for the heroin sold. 

67In dealing with Helio Lay's subjective circumstances, his Honour noted that he was aged 56 at the time of sentence and that he had an established work history after settling in Australia from East Timor as a refugee 27 years previously when he migrated as a married man with three children. His wife filed for divorce some months after he was remanded in custody. He reported having a good relationship with his children and grandchildren. 

68Helio Lay was also in good health and had no previous criminal record. The sentencing judge accepted that he was a person of previous good character and that his offending was out of character. That being so, his Honour found it difficult to understand why Helio Lay had involved himself with offending of such gravity. While he was satisfied that Helio Lay's motivations were financial, his Honour also found that the offending appeared to be ""an aberration"". He was satisfied that Helio Lay had good prospects of rehabilitation.

The sentence of Chi Man Lam

69On 7 March 2014, Lam was sentenced. The sentencing judge accepted the Crown's submission that the offender performed an essential role as a trusted member of the drug syndicate, travelling to Australia for the sole purpose of committing the offences with which he was charged, principally by removing the secreted drugs from the imported homewares in the container. He was also satisfied that Lam facilitated the collection of the drugs from Alexandria by Helio Lay. 

70Nevertheless, his Honour was ultimately satisfied that Lam's overall knowledge of the enterprise was limited to what he needed to know to assist in the removal of the drugs from the container and that he had a limited understanding of the role that he was to perform at the time of his arrival in Australia, being reliant on instructions from others after that date. Lam was sentenced on the basis that he was recruited to undertake a role as unpacker and facilitator only, and that whilst he directed or facilitated the collection of the drugs by Helio Lay, even then he was acting at the direction of others. The sentencing judge positioned Lam at the lower end of a hierarchy of offenders.

71Lam, who was aged 31 at the time of sentence, had no prior criminal record. He was unemployed in Hong Kong in the period leading up to his travel to Australia for the purpose of participating in the criminal syndicate. His Honour was satisfied that the assessment by Community Corrections that Lam had a low risk of reoffending was accurate, and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation having constructively utilised his time in custody since his remand in both employment and study.

72Upon that analysis, it is clear that there were a range of factors, including an assessment of the role the offenders occupied in a multi-faceted drug enterprise and their subjective circumstances (in particular, the prior good character of both co-offenders), differentiating this applicant from his co-offenders for sentencing purposes. In my view, those factors provide a more than sufficient explanation for the sentence imposed on this applicant relative to the sentences imposed on Helio Lay and Lam despite the fact that the commercial quantity of drugs he was charged with attempting to possess was significantly less than the commercial quantity of drugs the subject of the charges with which his two co-offenders were sentenced and that, on his Honour's findings, he was involved for a confined period of time prior to his arrest. 

73I do not regard the fact that the principle of totality was necessarily invoked in the partially accumulated sentences imposed on the applicant's co-offenders as dictating any different result.

74I would reject the second ground of appeal. 

75The orders I propose are: 

(1)Leave to appeal is granted.

(2)The appeal is dismissed.

76HAMILL J: I agree with Fullerton J.

		19 December 2014",2014-12-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765680,R v Jiao (No 3) [2014] NSWDC 354,"Judgment


	
	Yi-Hua Jiao was charged before me with a Commonwealth offence I will refer to as money laundering. It was an offence against s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). Last Tuesday 16 December 2014 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge. I convicted Ms Jiao and stood the case over to Thursday 18 December 2014 to hear any evidence and submissions on sentence. I granted Ms Jiao bail for that purpose. I granted her bail overnight to Friday 19 December 2014.
	


HIS HONOUR: Am I right did I sentence her on the Thursday or the Friday?

SANTISI: You sentenced her on the Friday. She was granted bail on Tuesday.

On that Friday I sentenced Ms Jiao to six months imprisonment to commence from that day.


	
	Mr F Santisi of counsel who appeared for Ms Jiao in the trial and in the sentence proceedings applied for bail pending an appeal. He made available to me a notice of intention to appeal which became exhibit 44 in the proceedings.
	
	
	Ms J Katrib who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on the bail application drew my attention to s 22 of the Bail Act 2013. It is a very significant provision and says as follows -
	


“Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, a Court is not to grant bail or dispense with bail for any of the following offences, unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist that justify that bail decision:

a) An offence for which an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against i) a conviction on indictment, or ii) a sentence imposed on conviction on indictment, …”


	
	Ms Jiao’s notice of intention to appeal is both from the conviction and from the sentence. I stood the bail application over to today, Monday 22 December 2014, inviting Mr Santisi to address me on two particular issues as well as any other matters. The first issue concerned the likely time before an appeal would be heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal. I indicated that I would be satisfied with inquiries being made and information provided from the Bar table. The second specific issue was whether there were any authorities on the application of s 22. Mr Santisi provided the information on the first issue and Ms Katrib provided me with relevant authorities on the second issue.
	
	
	Ms Jiao’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal needs to be called over by the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The next call over date is 29 January 2015. Mr Santisi indicated that because of the intervening holiday period and Court vacation it may well be that the parties are not ready to take a date from the Registrar on 29 January 2015. If they were ready then a date as early as March could be possible. More likely, Mr Santisi suggests, is that the appeal will need to be adjourned to the following call over which he surmised would be in February 2015 and a hearing date accordingly would likely to be in April or May 2015.
	
	
	This contrasts with the sentence of imprisonment which I imposed on Friday which expires on 18 June 2015. His obvious concern is that if the appeal is successful and the conviction set aside and Ms Jiao either acquitted or given a fresh trial then she will have served well over half of her sentence if not two-thirds of her sentence. (Ms Jiao is a middle aged Chinese woman who is a national both of Taiwan and New Zealand.)
	
	
	The authorities which Ms Katrib made available to me make it clear that that factor alone, although obviously important, is not the only consideration.
	
	
	In the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Cassaniti [2006] NSWSC 1103, Basten JA was dealing with an application for review of a bail decision pending appeal. The then applicable legislation was s 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 which nobody has suggested is any different in relevant terms to the provision I am applying. His Honour at [25] made reference to the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and McHugh and Gummow JJ in United Mexican States v Cabal (2002) 209 CLR 165. Basten JA extracted two paragraphs from that judgment of the High Court. They were [39] and [40] and I set them out here -
	


“[39] In determining whether to stay an order of imprisonment and give bail to the applicant or appellant, the court must consider not only the position of the applicant or the appellant but also the position of the Crown. To stay an order of imprisonment before deciding the appeal is a serious interference with the due administration of criminal justice. As Thomas J pointed out in ex parte Maher [1986] 1Qd R 303 at 310, to allow bail pending the hearing of an appeal after a person has been convicted and imprisoned:

- makes the conviction appear contingent until confirmed;

- places the court in the invidious position of having to return to prison a person whose circumstances may have changed dramatically during the period of liberty on bail;

- encourages unmeritorious appeal;

- undermines respect for the judicial system in having a single ‘recently sentenced man walking free’;

- undermines the public interest in having convicted persons serve their sentences as soon as is practicable.

[40] Consequently, the doctrine of this Court is that in a criminal case an order granting bail will only be made if there are exceptional circumstances.”

Basten JA acknowledged that “the principles in the High Court involve no statutory test, but rather an application of the general law”. His Honour however observed that that gave rise “to no point of distinction” and that “the insertion of s 30AA was intended to restore the Common Law principles”.


	
	Basten JA referred to the importance of making some assessment, albeit limited, of any grounds of appeal but went on to observe at [34] that nevertheless “the fact that an appeal cannot be shown to be more than merely ‘arguable’, and perhaps less in relation to the indirectly affected convictions, diminishes the strength of the present application.” His Honour accepted for the purposes of the argument that the reasonable likelihood of success on appeal “was by no means the sole relevant criterion”, (see [20-21]) and that it was not “necessary to establish that an appeal is virtually certain to succeed”. Nevertheless his Honour went on to observe that “the heavy burden faced by an applicant in these circumstances is not diminished when no attempt is made to demonstrate that the grounds of appeal establish more than an arguable point.”
	
	
	In R v John Kay Jin Khoo [2013] NSWSC 1518 Johnson J was dealing with an application for bail pending an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from sentence proceedings. His Honour was dealing with this application under s 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 and made reference to Cassaniti’s case as well as other authorities. His Honour too acknowledged at [18] that “the likely hearing date in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the relationship of that date to the earliest release date, is a factor to be taken into account.” His Honour observed at [19] that “the existence of merely arguable grounds is not enough. The grounds must be most likely to succeed.” His Honour in that case then went on to consider each of eight grounds of appeal which had been put forward as most likely to succeed in that case. His Honour concluded at [49] “that the grounds of appeal, viewed individually or cumulatively, do not demonstrate that there is a ground or grounds which are most likely to succeed.” His Honour declined to recommend to the Registrar that case be given expedition but encouraged the parties to prepare submissions so that they were in a position to proceed when before the Registrar, who would allocate a date. His Honour concluded at [52] that it “cannot be said that the grounds of appeal are such that the period of time in custody until then should lead this Court to grant bail to the Applicant.”
	
	
	I should therefore make some assessment, although of course limited, of the likelihood of the success of the appeal. I express it in those terms because no notice of grounds of appeal has been filed. What has been filed is a notice of intention to appeal and a notice of intention to appeal for leave to appeal. The first is in respect of the conviction and the second is in respect of the sentence. No grounds of appeal are set out in that document which became exhibit 44. That is not a criticism because the document makes no provision for such grounds to be articulated as such.
	
	
	What Mr Santisi did was to articulate five matters which he said, subject to the likely advice from senior counsel, may form the basis of grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The first was that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence. That point he said is available before even considering the defence evidence. My own opinion is that that is not a strong ground of appeal. The evidence was that Ms Jiao admittedly dealt with cash which had attributes which attracted suspicion. It was a large amount of cash and there was evidence before the jury to the effect that the way it was bound and the condition of the cash constituted attributes which were suspicious.
	
	
	The second matter articulated by Mr Santisi concerns a note which the jury provided to me on Tuesday 16 December 2014. The note is significant here because it was provided at about 3 o’clock and the jury returned with a verdict a little after 4 o’clock. The note became MFI #53 and reads as follows:
	


“‘Satisfied beyond reasonable doubt’. Does this mean I need to be 100% sure of the prosecutor’s evidence? Or does it mean just over the line ie. 50-60% sure? Please clarify thanks”.

Mr Santisi argued that the coincidence of the timing of the note and the return of the verdict left a definite sense of unease and a sense of a miscarriage of justice. For what it is worth I do not agree with that. The note is also consistent with the jury - indeed perhaps just one juror, so far as the terms of the note are concerned - wanting to clarify the meaning of beyond reasonable doubt by presenting two extremes. One extreme was 100% sure and the other was 50-60% sure. I gave a direction acceptable to both counsel which discouraged the jury from thinking in terms of percentages and encouraged them to think in terms of beyond reasonable doubt as meaning what those words mean in ordinary parlance. I do not regard that note as being a basis for likely success on appeal.


	
	The third point raised by Mr Santisi concerns the circumstantial case presented by the Crown Prosecutor. He singled out two particular aspects. They are the fact that the transaction relevant to the case occurred in the Star Casino here in Sydney and secondly that a part of the prosecution evidence involved the then accused identifying the man with the cash by means of their common knowledge of the serial number on a $5 note. Mr Santisi argued that the jury needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those two particular circumstances in a circumstantial case put forward by the Crown which contained a good number of additional components to that.
	
	
	That is not my recollection of how the prosecution urged the jury to consider those two aspects of its case. I did not gain the impression that the prosecution was presenting a circumstantial case part of which was an essential component which required the proof of that essential component beyond reasonable doubt. My recollection is that I did not direct the jury to that effect and neither counsel took exception to my direction. The circumstantial case presented by the prosecution was not, in my opinion, one which depended on proof beyond reasonable doubt of those two components.
	
	
	The fourth argument put forward by Mr Santisi this morning concerned opinions expressed by a witness, a Federal Police Officer named Federal Agent Burnicle. Mr Santisi was concerned that there had been no opinion evidence direction given about that witness’ evidence. The witness’ evidence was controversial in that I heard argument about it and admitted parts of his evidence. It was admitted, as I recollect, as opinion evidence. He was qualified by the Crown Prosecutor (Mr B Neild) leading evidence from him about his qualifications and experience before expressing opinions about certain matters including the use of serial numbers on low denomination currency.
	
	
	My recollection is that I did not give an opinion evidence direction, despite providing to counsel a list of the topics on which I proposed to direct the jury and inviting them to ensure that the list was comprehensive. I was not asked to include an opinion evidence direction. In retrospect perhaps that should have been included because the witness’ evidence did include opinions. But it seems to me that in the atmosphere of the trial it was not obvious to either counsel that such a direction was needed. Perhaps that is because the point made by Mr Santisi in cross-examining the witness and to the jury was less upon his expertise as such and more about Federal Agent Burnicle’s familiarity with this particular case. He emphasised a number of times to the jury that that witness could say nothing about the transaction in this particular case. That seemed to me to be the main issue. I do not think that there is a ground of appeal which is likely to succeed regarding that issue.
	
	
	The last possible ground of appeal regarded what Mr Santisi described as an over simplification of the prosecution case presented by Mr Nield as the Crown Prosecutor. It ignored, Mr Santisi argued, the commercial realities of life. This is a fair point in one sense. I say that because there was a good deal of evidence that cash transactions and particularly involving large amounts of cash are not unusual for Taiwanese nationals. Nevertheless I did not regard the case as over simplified. I thought Mr Nield presented the case in a commendably simplified way. He focussed on the dealings of Ms Jiao and those attributes which would attract suspicion about the transaction and he focussed on why Ms Jiao’s explanation should be rejected. It was for the defence - and the burden was undertaken appropriately - to provide evidence about matters which could go to raise a doubt about the prosecution case or discharge the defence’s own burden which happened to apply in this case. To my mind the presentation of the prosecution case was not such that it would represent a ground of appeal that was most likely to succeed.
	
	
	I am therefore in a position where, on the one hand, I have no grounds of appeal but argued points presented by Mr Santisi this morning, none of which in my opinion reach the level of grounds which may become most likely to succeed. But, on the other hand, I have the prospect that Ms Jiao could spend half to two-thirds or more of her sentence in custody and then find that her appeal succeeds.
	
	
	The relationship between those two is significant. If someone presented an application for bail under s 22 of the Bail Act with an absolutely hopeless ground of appeal as being argued, then despite the sentence being likely to expire before the appeal is heard it would obviously not be appropriate to grant bail. I regard it as appropriate to weigh these two considerations.
	
	
	The strength of the appeal points is a factor to be taken into account. The likely serving of a good part of the sentence is another factor to be taken into account. However also to be taken into account are the very significant considerations advanced by the High Court in Cabal’s case and adopted by Judges of the Supreme Court in this State. I must weigh in those considerations about the administration of criminal justice.
	
	
	On balance, given the fact that none of the grounds of appeal could be described as most likely to succeed and the considerations referred to by the High Court, I do not regard this case as one being where special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying a bail decision.
	
	
	Accordingly I refuse the application.

		14 September 2015",2014-12-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765681,Grover v R; Grover v R [2014] NSWCCA 315,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  On 16 May 2013, the applicants, Daniel Grover and Brian Grover, were sentenced in the District Court after pleading guilty to multiple counts on separate indictments. 
3The first indictment charged both applicants with one count of possession of a precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, intending that it be used by another person in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s 24A(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (""the possession count"").  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 10 years, or both. 
4A ""precursor"" is defined in s 24A(3) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as ""a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section"".  Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 stipulates that ""pseudoephedrine"" is a precursor for the purposes of s 24A(1)(a) of the Act. 
5The possession count with which Daniel Grover was charged was committed between 30 May 2009 and 8 February 2010.  The possession count with which Brian Grover was charged was committed between 15 June 2009 and 25 February 2010. 
6On the second indictment both applicants were charged with three counts of supply of a prohibited drug, also pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity (""the supply counts"").  A large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine supplied as a prohibited drug attracts a maximum penalty of $500,000 and/or life imprisonment to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies.  A large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine is specified at 5 kilograms. 
The offences the subject of both indictments
7The possession count concerned the applicants' possession of pseudoephedrine, in the form of cold and flu tablets, which Daniel Grover obtained from various pharmacies between 30 May 2009 and 8 February 2010, and which Brian Grover obtained in the same way between 15 June 2009 and 25 February 2010, with the intention that the pseudoephedrine (the active ingredient in the tablets) would be extracted by another person and used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.  On some occasions, packets of cold and flu tablets were purchased on the presentation of false New South Wales driver's licenses, the applicants' photographs being displayed attached to false names.  On other occasions, the tablets were purchased by the applicants on presentation of genuine documents of identification. 
8Daniel Grover was charged with possession of 95 packets of the tablets and Brian Grover with possession of 73 packets of the tablets.
9Both applicants were charged with the possession count on 3 February 2011 and released on bail.
10Soon thereafter, police were alerted to the fact that Daniel Grover was attempting to obtain a further quantity of cold and flu tablets.  A telephone intercept warrant was applied for and granted on 23 May 2011.  The applicants' conversations with each other, and with co-offenders, were monitored from that time.
11The first supply count involved the supply of pseudoephedrine on 24 May 2011 in an amount not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug, namely 24 kilograms.  The cold and flu tablets had been stolen by persons unknown from GlaxoSmithKline Pty Ltd, a pharmaceutical company who manufactured the medication in Australia for sale in the Middle East.  The tablets the subject of this supply were not recovered. 
12The second and third supply counts, committed on 11 June 2011 and 2 August 2011 respectively, also involved the supply of pseudoephedrine in 24 kilogram consignments of cold and flu tablets stolen from the same company. 
13In each of the second and third supply counts, the tablets were seized by police and analysed.  Although the total weight of the tablets varied referable to the number of individual tablets in each consignment, the difference in the two consignments was insignificant for sentencing purposes.  The combined weight of the tablets the subject of the second count was 22,761.4 kilograms.  The combined weight of the tablets the subject of the third count was 24.029 kilograms.  Since the tablets the subject of the first count were not intercepted, the precise weight of that consignment, particularised in the charge as 24 kilograms, was not the subject of further refinement.
The sentences imposed
Daniel Grover
14After allowing for a 20 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty, Daniel Grover was sentenced on the possession count to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, to commence on 3 August 2011 and to expire on 2 February 2014.  For each of the supply counts, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.  The sentences on the supply counts were partially accumulated on each other and on the sentence for the possession count. 
15After a finding of special circumstances, a total effective sentence of imprisonment of 17 years with a non-parole period of 11 years was imposed.  
Brian Grover
16After allowing for a 20 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty, Brian Grover was also sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years for the possession count, to commence on 3 August 2011 and to expire on 2 August 2013.  For each of the supply counts, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.  These sentences were also accumulated by twelve months on the possession count and partially accumulated on each other. 
17After a finding of special circumstances, a total effective sentence of imprisonment for 16 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months was imposed. 
18The applications for leave to appeal against sentence are confined to the sentences imposed on each of the three supply counts. 
The grounds of appeal
19Daniel Grover relied upon two grounds of appeal as follows:
(1)Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences; and in her assessment that the offending comprehended by the supply counts was of a high order and above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
(2)The sentences individually and in aggregate are manifestly excessive.
20Brian Grover relied upon the same two grounds of appeal and, in addition, that:
(3)He has a justifiable sense of grievance as a consequence of the sentences imposed upon Daniel Grover.
(4)Her Honour failed to observe principles of totality.
The evidence on sentence
21The Crown tendered an agreed set of facts which were set out extensively in the remarks on sentence.  For present purposes, it is sufficient for the facts to be summarised as follows. 
22The three supply counts shared the following common features:
(1)Each count involved the supply of approximately 24 kilograms of pseudoephedrine in the form of cold and flu tablets that had been stolen; 
(2)The tablets were to be transported from Sydney to Brisbane via third parties with the applicants' cousin, Matthew Grover, as the intended recipient; and
(3)Each count was committed whilst the applicants were on bail for possessing pseudoephedrine as a precursor.
The first supply count
23On or about 23 May 2011 an agreement was reached between the applicants and Matthew Grover for 24 kilograms of the tablets to be delivered to him at a prearranged meeting point in Coffs Harbour at an agreed price of $100,000.  The applicants sourced the stolen tablets for that purpose.  A co-offender, Matthew Soames, collected the tablets from an unknown source and stored them in his house overnight.  The tablets were contained in two supermarket bags.  Matthew Soames was instructed by Daniel Grover to weigh the bags.  Each bag weighed 12 kilograms.  As Matthew Soames was unable to travel to Coffs Harbour it was agreed that his father, William Soames, would transport the tablets. 
24On 24 May 2011, William Soames travelled to Coffs Harbour.  The applicants and Matthew Grover were in dispute over the fact that the loose tablets had not been packaged into 3 kilogram bags as stipulated by Matthew Grover.  On receipt of the two packages, Matthew Grover weighed the tablets and gave William Soames $100,000 to be given to the applicants.  William Soames was paid $500. 
25Matthew Grover subsequently telephoned Brian Grover to confirm that the 24 kilograms of tablets had been received and that $100,000 had been given to William Soames.  Soames was arrested by police on 11 August 2011 and charged with supplying 24 kilograms of pseudoephedrine.  The tablets were not recovered.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.
The second supply count
26On 11 June 2011, another 24 kilograms of the stolen tablets were packaged in preparation for supply in 3 kilogram packages.  On this occasion Brian Grover directed Matthew Soames to collect the tablets from the home of another person for on-supply to Matthew Grover.  He was stopped by police on the Pacific Highway, north of Newcastle.  The tablets were seized.  Matthew Soames was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of 24 kilograms of pseudoephedrine by his father on 24 May 2011, and supplying a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine on 10 June 2011.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
27The applicants were aware that the tablets had been intercepted. 
The third supply count
28Approximately two months later, another consignment of 24 kilograms of tablets was prepared for supply by the applicants.  The prearranged meeting point for that supply was a car park in St Clair, with the tablets to be delivered by a third person acting on instructions from, and under the supervision of Daniel Grover.  The intended recipient was Damien O'Brien, who acted on behalf of Matthew Grover. 
29Before the transfer was complete, police arrested Daniel Grover.  The tablets were seized.  Brian Grover was arrested shortly thereafter. 
The expert evidence
30The evidence relied upon by the Crown in the agreed facts was supplemented by the tender of a statement of Detective Sergeant Cadden, an ad hoc expert in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.  He gave evidence as to the chemical composition of the tablets seized (the subject of the second count) based on information supplied by the manufacturer of the tablets.  He derived what he described as the ""theoretical potential yield"" of pure pseudoephedrine in a chemical extraction process under optimum conditions, from which he then derived a ""theoretical potential yield"" of methamphetamine.  He also gave evidence of the wholesale value of methamphetamine. 
31The results of that analysis were as follows:
(1)Each tablet weighed approximately 0.635 grams;
(2)Each tablet contained 0.03 grams of pseudoephedrine;
(3)The level of purity of pseudoephedrine in each tablet was 4.724 per cent;
(4)The gross weight of the tablets would contain 1076 grams of pure pseudoephedrine;
(5)On the assumption that the yield from the processing of the pseudoephedrine had been 89 per cent, a theoretical yield of 958 grams of pure pseudoephedrine would be derived; 
(6)On the assumption that the yield from the further processing of the pure pseudoephedrine had been 76 per cent, 728 grams of methylamphetamine would be derived;
(7)The wholesale value of 728 grams of methylamphetamine is between $285,200 and $432,000; and
(8)The theoretical street value of 728 grams of methylamphetamine is between $364,000 and $728,000, although the value may be much higher due to the addition of inert agents.
I note that (7) involves an error in calculation (transposed in her Honour's sentencing remarks) and that the wholesale value is between $120,120 and $182,000.
32These results were extrapolated by the sentencing judge in the assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the three supply counts.
The criminal records and pre-sentence reports
33The Crown also tendered the applicants' antecedent criminal records and pre-sentence reports.
34Daniel Grover's criminal record included driving offences, various offences of dishonesty, and relatively minor offences of violence.  He was also convicted of possessing a precursor intended for use in the manufacture of prohibited drugs in September 2005 and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 months. 
35Brian Grover's criminal record also included driving offences and various offences of dishonesty.  He had no previous convictions for drug offences and had not previously served a sentence of imprisonment.
36It would appear that the differential of six months on both the effective head sentence and the non-parole period in the sentences imposed on the applicants is to be accounted for by what the sentencing judge found to the greater significance attaching to the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence and specific deterrence in the sentence imposed on Daniel Grover by reason of his prior criminal record.
The applicants' subjective circumstances
37A range of documentary evidence was tendered on behalf of each applicant, including psychologists' reports, an affidavit from the applicants' father and other family members, and certificates evidencing their engagement with educational programs whilst on remand.  Both applicants gave evidence on sentence, as did their mother. 
Brian Grover's subjective case
38The sentencing judge noted that Brian Grover was 31 at the time of the commission of the offences.  At the time of sentence he was in a stable relationship and the father of an infant daughter who was born after he entered into custody.  He left school at the end of Year 9 and had a stable work record since that time.  At the time of his arrest he was operating a business previously operated by his parents to allow them to retire.  As a consequence of his imprisonment, his parents have resumed the operation of the business.  He claimed he had a gambling addiction; that he was $2,000 in debt and that he was ignorant of the processes involved in drug manufacture.  In the opinion of his psychologist, the applicant was appropriately described as a ""probable pathological gambler"" with an associated diagnosis of ""impulse control disorder"". 
39The applicant had successfully completed the ""Best Bet Program"" by the time of sentence and had demonstrated a willingness to engage in further intervention for relapse prevention.  The reporting psychologist considered him to be an excellent candidate for therapeutic intervention in post-release attendance programs offered by Mission Australia. 
40He was considered by the author of the pre-sentence report to be genuinely remorseful and that he would require a low level of intervention upon his eventual release.
Daniel Grover's subjective case
41Daniel Grover was 35 at the time of sentence.  He has three children from three relationships.  A teenage son was living with the applicant's parents.  He also left school at the end of Year 9 after which he obtained employment as a forklift driver and, when not working in that capacity, worked in his parents' business.  Prior to his arrest he was operating a takeaway food business.  He developed an addiction to alcohol at the age of 18 and began using amphetamines on a monthly basis two years prior to entering custody.  In the opinion of the reporting psychologist, he will have difficulty addressing his dependency on alcohol without appropriate intervention.  Daniel Grover also asserted that he had a gambling problem.  A number of problematic personality traits were identified by the reporting psychologist. 
42In his pre-sentence report, Daniel Grover was assessed as suitable for a medium level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Services.  He had also undertaken courses and counselling whilst on remand.  Her Honour noted that his response to supervision in the past had been satisfactory. 
The facts found for sentencing purposes and the challenge to them
43The sentencing judge regarded the applicants' moral culpability as of ""a very high order"".  She described their conduct as suppliers of large commercial quantities of pseudoephedrine in the following way:
""... sourcing large quantities of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine; liaising with the ultimate purchasers in Queensland; agreeing on price; organising couriers; packaging the drugs and arranging for their delivery.""
44Her Honour regarded those arrangements as well planned and orchestrated, and that the applicants were motivated solely by financial reward.  She declined to make a finding that Brian Grover's gambling debt operated in mitigation. 
45When considering the sentences imposed on co-offenders (including William Soames and others) and their roles in the criminal arrangement, her Honour described the applicants as being: 
""... well up that chain ... capable of accessing significant quantities of bulk pseudoephedrine, arranging for its collection, warehousing by others albeit only overnight, negotiating price, the place of delivery, the courier and receiving or anticipating receiving significant sums of money upon the successful completion of the deals ..."".
46After dealing with the offending the subject of the possession count (which may be disregarded for present purposes) her Honour noted that both applicants were charged and released to bail in respect of that offending on 3 February 2011 and that within a very short time they reoffended by supplying a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine as a prohibited drug, conduct which was repeated over successive months despite the fact that the tablets the subject of the first supply count in May 2011 attracted police interest, a matter which was well known to the applicants given the arrest of a co-offender.  
47The fact that all three supply counts were committed while the applicants were on bail rendered the offending on each count more serious.  One of the questions raised by the appeal was whether that factor, together with the fact that the applicants pleaded guilty to multiple counts of supply of a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine (with Daniel Grover having a prior conviction for dealing in pseudoephedrine), distinguished the authorities to which her Honour referred in her sentencing remarks for comparative purposes. 
48In considering the impact of the evidence of the police expert directed to ascertaining the potential for the pseudoephedrine to be exploited in the manufacture of methamphetamine, her Honour held that the community would be exposed to ""potentially disastrous consequences"" by the distribution of the methylamphetamine (the product of the manufacturing process) and that the profits to ""criminals"" as ""considerable"".  (It was no part of the Crown case on sentence that the applicants would derive a share of the profit from the manufacture of the methylamphetamine and its supply at either a wholesale or street level.) 
49In her Honour's assessment, the extent of harm to the community resulting from each of the supply counts was informed by the potential yield of 728 grams of methylamphetamine per consignment of 24 kilograms of impure pseudoephedrine, which she referred to as exceeding a large commercial quantity of that drug.  On appeal, the Crown conceded that was an error, a large commercial quantity of methamphetamine being 1 kilogram not 0.5 kilograms under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 
50The applicants submitted that this error (which may have been transposed from Pham v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 208 where at [43] Simpson J referred to 0.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine as constituting a large commercial quantity of that drug - the Schedule to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act specifies 1 kilogram as a large commercial quantity) contributed to her Honour's erroneous finding that each of the supply counts were positioned above the mid-range of objective seriousness.  They also submitted that the sentencing judge failed to appreciate that the actual quantity of pure pseudoephedrine in the tablets the subject of each count was substantially below the 1.25 kilograms threshold for a commercial quantity of that drug.  Counsel submitted that, although the charge of supply of a large commercial quantity was properly laid in reliance on the admixture provisions in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the purity of the individual tablets remains a critical consideration for sentencing purposes since, unlike other prohibited drugs under Schedule 1 to the Act, the tablets are not susceptible to being cut and on-sold to end users.  Their only value as a prohibited drug is the pure pseudoephedrine that may be extracted from them. 
51The Crown submitted that her Honour's error in the appointment of a large commercial quantity of methamphetamine at 0.5 kilograms has not been shown to have erroneously influenced her assessment of the objective seriousness of the supply counts.  What was relevant was the potential yield of a significant quantity of methylamphetamine, and the potential for harm that is generated from that quantity of drug being disseminated to end-users.  In the Crown's submission, that fact, coupled with the role each of the applicants performed as principals in the supply of the large commercial quantities of pseudoephedrine over a three month period, properly attracted a finding of offending above the mid range. 
52The applicants submitted that there were other errors in the sentencing judge's approach to the question of the extent of harm which, taken together with the error in appointment of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, had a compounding effect ultimately leading to the imposition of manifestly excessive sentences.
53These errors included what was said to be her Honour's undue emphasis on the potential yield of methylamphetamine when the applicants were not charged with manufacturing that drug or taking any step in the process of its manufacture.  Insofar as the extent of harm is a material enquiry into the objective seriousness of the applicants' offending as suppliers of pseudoephedrine as a prohibited drug, in accordance with the approach in R v Cousins [2002] NSWCCA 340; 132 A Crim R 444 (a case which was concerned with the possession of pseudoephedrine as a precursor contrary to s 24A(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act where an element of the offence is that the pseudoephedrine was intended for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug), it was submitted that her Honour failed to take sufficient account of the range of variables in the process by which methylamphetamine is manufactured which impacts on yield.  In addition to the grossly inferior quality of the tablets the subject of each count, it was submitted what was also likely to be an unsophisticated manufacturing process added to the likelihood that the actual yield of pure pseudoephedrine would likely be considerably less than the optimum yield identified by the expert.  It was submitted that because the gravamen of the applicants' offending must be gauged referable to the actual extent of harm, it was an error to regard the objective seriousness of their offending as above mid range, even accepting their role in acquiring the tablets and arranging for their on-supply. 
54The applicants emphasised that the inferior quality of the tablets also operated to distinguish their offending from the three cases to which the judge referred in her sentencing remarks: R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111; R v Phan & Ors [2009] NSWDC 181; and Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208.
55The applicants submitted that, were her Honour to have made an assessment of the extent of harm in each of the cases to which she referred, each of which involved purity levels of between 20 and 30 per cent, rather than disregarding them as being of limited assistance for comparative purposes, she would necessarily have concluded that the offending in each was objectively more serious than the applicants' offending although less severe sentences were imposed.  This is said to be exemplified by the following summary:(1)El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111
259.22kg @ 20% purity = 52.34kg pure pseudoephedrine (part of a consignment of 800kg).  
Following a plea of guilty he was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.
After a successful Crown appeal, the sentence was increased to 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.
(2)Pham [2010] NSWCCA 208
10.124kg @ 30% purity = 3.0372kg pure pseudoephedrine.
Following a plea of guilty he was sentenced to 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
(3)Tran [2014] NSWCCA 32
10.124kg @ 30% purity = 3.0372kg pure pseudoephedrine.
Following a plea of guilty he was sentenced to 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
(4)Phan, Nguyen, Phan and Olivieri [2009] NSWDC 181
43.9kg @ 21.33% purity = 9.365kg pure pseudoephedrine.
For their involvement in the supply of a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine the following sentences were imposed on Dinh Phan, Nguyen and Olivieri.  (Duc Phan was sentenced following a plea of guilty as a principal both in the importation of the drug supplied together with the importation of another consignment of pseudoephedrine in which none of the offenders was involved.)  Nguyen was found to have played a secondary role to Duc Phan and was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years.  Duc Phan was sentencded to 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and Olivieri was sentenced to 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
56The applicants' counsel referred the Court to two additional cases involving the supply of a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine: R v Standen [2011] NSWSC 1422 and R v Jalalaty [2010] NSWSC 1561.
57The objective seriousness of the offending in Standen and Jalalaty was substantially more serious than the present case.  The offenders conspired to import approximately 300 kilograms of pseudoephedrine through an elaborate scheme of concealing the pseudoephedrine in shipments of rice.  Both offenders were convicted of conspiring to import a border controlled substance pursuant to s 307.11 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  Standen was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and supply of a large commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW).
58The sentencing judge held that Standen was a principal and senior to Jalalaty.  His criminality was aggravated by his misuse of knowledge and contacts acquired through his position as Assistant Director of Investigations at the New South Wales Crime Commission.  The objective seriousness of the supply offence was held to be above the middle of the range.  The offender was sentenced to a head sentence of 22 years (with a non-parole period of 16 years) for the supply offence after a five-month trial.  It should be noted that the sentencing judge took into account Standen's onerous custodial conditions, namely his being held in a Special Purpose Prison, in determining the length of his sentences.
59Jalalaty's role was to receive the shipment of rice in which the pseudoephedrine was concealed under the guise of his food importation and distribution business; to arrange for the clearance of the container with the rice and pseudoephedrine; and to sell the rice so as to give the importation the appearance of legitimacy.  The conspiracy involved a high degree of planning and the offender was regarded by the Court as a principal.  His plea of guilty and assistance afforded him a discount in the vicinity of 40 per cent.  He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment (with a non-parole period of 6 years), equating to an undiscounted sentence of 16 years and 8 months.
60The applicants' counsel submitted that Standen and Jalalaty provide significant support for the proposition that the undiscounted head sentence of 17 years and 6 months for each of the supply offences imposed on the applicants was manifestly excessive.
61Since hearing the appeal, the related cases of Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266; DS v R [2014] NSWCCA 267; Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269; and Yousef Jidah [2014] NSWCCA 270 have been determined.  In each case the applications for leave to appeal were against the severity of a sentence imposed for the supply (or, in the case of Wilson, his knowing concern in the supply) of 603 kilograms of impure pseudoephedrine (in the form of 2,600,000 tablets), equating to 125 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine.  Each of the applicants was convicted after trial.  Wilson's sentence appeal was dismissed.  He was sentenced as a principal to a total term of 16 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months.  The sentences imposed on re-sentence of DS, Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah on parity grounds were as follows:
(1)DS was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months.  His involvement in the supply extended over some months in advance of the shipment of drugs arriving from Thailand.  He coordinated the release of the drugs for supply and supervised others in that process.
(2)Ibrahim Jidah was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.  Together with his brother, Yousef, he was involved over a period of days in providing transportation of the drugs after they were unpacked in the expectation they would be distributed to a third party or parties for exploitation in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
(3)Yousef Jidah was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
62Finally, it was submitted that, contrary to her Honour dismissing the three authorities cited in her sentencing reasons as being of limited or no utility for comparative purposes, an appropriate sentencing range can in fact be gauged by reference to them, and the other cases to which the applicants referred on the appeal, thereby providing a measure against which to examine the sentences imposed by his Honour with a view to demonstrating that they are each manifestly excessive (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] and Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [28] and [41]).  
Consideration 
63On the appeal, the primary submissions of counsel directed to what were said to be the unjustifiably severe sentences on each of the supply counts, was tracked to the combined effect of error in the specification of the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine; a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to make a qualified finding of the extent of harm referable to the inferior quality of the tablets; and her Honour's flawed analysis of the authorities for comparative purposes such that, even after accounting for the feature of aggravation with each supply offence committed whilst the applicants were on bail, an assessment of objective seriousness of a ""high order"" (above the mid range) was not open on the evidence.  
64In the written submissions of counsel for Brian Grover and adopted by senior counsel for the Daniel Grover, the role of the applicants as suppliers was described as ""opportunistic middlemen"" who attempted to profit from their access to tablets stolen from a pharmaceutical company.  On the hearing of the appeal, it was not submitted that her Honour's narrative description of the applicants' roles as suppliers was not available on the evidence, but rather that to ascribe to their conduct offending above the mid range was an error. 
65In Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116, I endorsed what has been repeatedly emphasised by this Court, namely that a characterisation of the degree or extent of objective seriousness is classically within the province of the discretion of the sentencing judge and, absent an error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499, it is a discretionary exercise not susceptible to appellate review.  In this case, I am persuaded that the error identified by counsel in her Honour's nomination of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, and what I am persuaded was an uncritical approach to quantification of the extent of harm, has resulted in error in her Honour's assessment of objective seriousness.  Although this was serious, flagrant and repeated criminal offending by the applicants as suppliers of large quantities of stolen medications which they knew were to be used for the purposes of manufacturing significant quantities of methylamphetamine, absent error of the kind identified, it would seem to me to be properly characterised as mid range offending.
66I am also satisfied that the sentences imposed on each of the supply counts is manifestly excessive.  Despite the limitations on the use that can be made of extrinsic material when challenging a sentence as manifestly excessive, and accepting that neither sentencing statistics nor past sentencing decisions fix a range within which a sentence might or should fall, even less that sentences imposed in other cases dictate whether a sentence under challenge is beyond the exercise of a permissible sentencing discretion (see Barbaro at [28] and [41]), when the whole of the circumstances that have informed sentences imposed in the past are reviewed and where it is clear that in many cases a markedly less severe sentence has been imposed for objectively more serious offending, I am satisfied the sentences imposed on the applicants are manifestly excessive, in the sense that they are both individually and after accumulation ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  The ground of appeal that complains of a breach of totality principles is, in essence, a complaint about manifest severity.  
67I am not persuaded that the challenge advanced by Brian Grover to his sentence on parity grounds has been made out.  Notably, that challenge is limited to what is said should have been a more marked measure of leniency afforded to him relative to his brother because, unlike his brother, he did not have a criminal record for drug offending and had not been sentenced to imprisonment.  Brian Grover did, however, have a criminal record with a number of offences of dishonesty and what her Honour considered was a mixed response to community supervision.  These are matters her Honour was entitled to take into account in considering affording him a measure of leniency less than what might have been afforded him relative to his brother were he a person of prior good character.  A differential of six months is not so marked or glaring as to attract intervention.  
68The issue of parity will need to be revisited on re-sentence when the sentencing discretion is to be exercised afresh. 
Re-sentence
Daniel Grover
69On re-sentence, the applicant Daniel Grover relied upon an affidavit from David Giddy, solicitor.  Mr Giddy testifies to the applicant having received no adverse disciplinary or conduct reports throughout the period of his remand and to date as a sentenced prisoner.  Of the various records and reports obtained by him from Corrective Services, Mr Giddy says they:
""... typically and variously described [the applicant] as 'polite', 'respectful', 'causes no problems', 'follows all directions' and is a 'good worker, with a good work ethic' who 'works well with minimal supervision'."" 
70On re-sentence, the applicant Brian Grover relied upon an affidavit from his solicitor, Baraa Saddiq, which was principally directed to the applicant's mother's poor health, including ongoing anxiety and severe depression consequent upon all three of her male adult children serving custodial sentences.  I note she is currently maintained on anti-depressant medication and consults with her general practitioner and psychologist regularly. 
71I do not consider that Mrs Grover's understandable concern at the difficulties her sons are confronted with as sentenced prisoners, and the adverse effect on her health, is sufficiently exceptional to justify any substantial reduction in the sentence of either applicant (see R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369; 166 A Crim R 124 at [27] per James J, Hidden and Hislop JJ agreeing).
Brian Grover
72The applicant Brian Grover also swore an affidavit in which he testified to having been in continuous employment in various positions since his incarceration, his most recent and current position being within the Cultural Centre at Junee Correctional Centre.  I accept that role is a trusted position affording him greater freedom that other inmates co-existent with his responsibility for arranging scheduled social events and activities. 
73He said he attempted to enrol in a computer course but, because he was classified as a low-risk offender, he was ineligible and claims not to be eligible for any other training courses.  If this be the fact, it is regrettable. 
74His parents remain supportive of him.  He has an ongoing close relationship with them and speaks to them on average three times a day.  Due to their age and precarious financial situation, and the distance from suburban Sydney to Junee Correctional Centre, they only visit once every six to seven weeks.  The applicant's relationship with his one-time de facto partner has been effectively terminated by reason of his incarceration such that he has little contact with his infant daughter, having only seen her three times this year.  This has had a profound emotional impact on the applicant.
75This material reinforces the finding of special circumstances and that the rehabilitation of both applicants is well advanced.  It does not, however, operate in mitigation of sentence.  In addition, I see no basis for disturbing the partial accumulation of the sentences (and was not urged to by the applicants' counsel), and do not propose to disturb the differential of six months her Honour allowed on parity considerations.
76For the reasons already given, I consider the offending the subject of each of the supply counts by each of the applicants as in the mid range.  After taking into account their subjective circumstances, I consider an appropriate sentence on each of the supply counts committed by Daniel Grover to be imprisonment for 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and those committed by Brian Grover imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  After partially accumulating the sentences, the total effective sentence imposed on Daniel Grover is 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and for Brian Grover a total effective sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.
77The orders I propose are as follows:
Daniel Grover
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)The sentence imposed on Count 1 of the first indictment, ""the possession count"", is confirmed. 
(4)Sentences imposed on each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 on the second indictment (being the supply counts of 24 May 2011, 11 June 2011 and 2 August 2011 respectively) are quashed and the following sentences are imposed in substitution: 
(a)On Count 1, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2012 and to expire on 2 August 2017.
(b)On Count 2, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2013 and to expire on 2 August 2018. 
(c)On Count 3, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2014 and to expire on 2 August 2019.
(5)The applicant will be eligible for release to supervised parole on 2 August 2019.
Brian Grover(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)The sentence imposed on Count 1 of the first indictment, ""the possession count"", is confirmed. 
(4)Sentences imposed on each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 on the second indictment, being the supply counts of 24 May 2011, 11 June 2011 and 2 August 2011 respectively, are quashed and the following sentences are imposed in substitution: 
(a)On Count 1, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2012 and to expire on 2 February 2017.
(b)On Count 2, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2013 and to expire on 2 February 2018. 
(c)On Count 3, a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.  The non-parole period is to commence on 3 August 2014 and to expire on 2 February 2019.
(5)The applicant will be eligible for release to supervised parole on 2 February 2019.

2765686,Police v Keith Stewart Mouat [2014] NSWLC 27,"JUDGMENT


	
	Mr Mouat was involved in two collisions whilst riding his motorcycle. He was charged with two counts of driving under the influence of drugs. The only issue in this case is whether he was driving under the influence of drugs. The prosecution bear the burden of satisfying the court that he was “under the influence” at the time.
	


What does “under the influence"" mean?


	
	This term is not defined by the legislation. The courts have long recognised that there is a line of drug or alcohol use beyond which a person may be proven to be under the influence. In the old case of Mair v Railway Passengers Assurance Co (1877) 37 LT 356, Lord Coleridge CJ mused on the difficulty of considering the point where alcohol or drugs becomes an impediment in the exercising of a person’s mental faculties and where the precise point is:
	


""…enough to say that there is a point, and it seems to me these words would be satisfied when the influence of intoxicating liquor is found in point of fact to be such as to disturb the quiet and equable exercise of the intellectual faculties of the man who has taken the liquor.""


	
	In Sagacious Legal Pty Ltd v Westfarmers General Insurance (No 4) (2010) FCA, Rares J stated:
	


""The determination is one of fact and degree based on the evidence, including, particularly, the observations of those who saw the person at or close to the critical time.""


	
	The key point is that in this offence the quantity of drugs or alcohol consumed is not in issue – it is the extent to which the drug or alcohol has negatively influenced the defendant’s ability.
	


The first incident and charge


	
	The first incident took place at 08.45 on 5 November 2013. The prosecution evidence was limited by admissibility rules, as they had failed to call any eye witnesses. Accordingly, the only evidence was the defendant’s version. In essence, this was that he had to brake hard to avoid running into a car that pulled out from a car park into his path on a major road, and the motor bike slid out under him. By the time the police arrived he was on a stretcher being taken to hospital. He told the police he had consumed “pot” at 10 pm the previous night, four Valium the previous lunchtime, 17 ml of methadone and two Valium at 6 pm the previous night.
	
	
	About a week later the police contacted the defendant by way of “follow-up”. He told the police officer he had swallowed half a gram of cannabis after the fall, prior to the police attending the scene, as he had it on him and was concerned about getting caught with cannabis in his possession.
	


Prosecution case on the first incident


	
	During submissions, Mr Van Dugteren for the defendant took issue with cannabis being considered part of the allegation. That was because the charge was specified in the information as, “to wit, methadone, diazepam and nitrazepam”. The prosecution took no issue with this submission. A careful reading of s 112(2) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW)  limits the prosecution to proving the “influence"" alleged is limited to that caused by the drugs named in the court attendance notice, and thus Mr Van Dugteren’s submission is correct.
	
	
	The prosecution rely wholly on the blood analysis certificates and expert’s report by John Andrew Farrar, a consultant forensic pharmacologist employed by the NSW Police Force.
	
	
	Mr Farrar’s conclusion is that the defendant was under the influence of methadone, diazepam and nitrazepam to the extent that his ability to ride a motorcycle was impaired. His view is that benzodiazepine use results in impaired driving and tolerance, with respect to this drug, does not reduce the impairment. Further, his opinion is that the use of methadone and benzodiazapine concurrently increases that impairment. He states at 3.2:
	


""It is generally safe for such patients to undertake complex psychomotor activities such as driving (Bernard et al, 2009). However, methadone is known to enhance impairment caused by co-consumption of benzodiazepines (Bernard et al, 2009) such as diazepam and nitrazepam.""


	
	In cross examination at 15:25 he repeated the same assertion regarding the use of benzodiazepines, stating, “…they are known epidemiologically to be exacerbated by co-consumption of methadone.”
	
	
	In essence, the prosecution case relies upon Mr Farrar’s opinion relating to tolerance and co-consumption. At 15:10 in cross-examination he stated that tolerance does not impact significantly on unwanted side effects because:
	


""[A] dosage of a drug that produces the desired therapeutic effect will also produce effects that are unwanted irrespective of the development of tolerance, tolerance just means you have to take more of the drug in order to produce the desired therapeutic effect, it still continues to provide the unwanted side effects.""


	
	Mr Farrar was challenged as to both conclusions by Mr Van Dugteren in cross-examination. On the issue of whether a person who is taking a therapeutic dose of benzodiazepines and is a long term chronic user will have their driving ability impaired, Mr Farrar acknowledged that, “there isn’t a perfect linear causal link between them.”
	
	
	I pause to comment that this answer was surprising to me listening to the evidence. After all, Mr Farrar had written in his report, without qualification, at 3.9 – 3.10:
	


""The concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam in Mouat’s blood sample are within the therapeutic range for these substances (Bramness et al 2003)…the combined quantities of diazepam and nordiazepam, at the concentrations detected, cause cognitive and psychomotor impairment, and are epidemiologically associated with increased traffic-accident risk (Longo et al, 2001: Bramness et al, 2003: Smink et al 2008).""


	
	In cross-examination, Mr Farrar stated these conclusions were drawn from the studies of Longo, Bramness and Smink, and another by Drummer. Each study is referred to in the references section of the report by Mr Farrar. 
	
	
	From this cross-examination, it became apparent that Drummer’s paper was a review of other published papers, and the papers of Longo, Brammness and Smink were based upon epidemiological studies. They looked at a sample of drivers with varying limits, tested following accidents or detection and compared those tests. This means that no persons were actually taken into a laboratory and tested on some sort of reaction or skills machine with varying degrees of benzodiazapines in their blood, allowing for tolerance in chronic long-term users. Thus, in Longo, blood samples from 2500 injured drivers were analysed, and 68 of these tested positive for at least one benzodiazepine. There was a significant linear relationship between benzodiazepine concentration and the culpability of drivers.
	
	
	With respect to Mr Farrar, his conclusions are academically interesting, but can hardly prove, on the basis of the reports he referred to, that this individual was impaired at the time of the first incident. The falsity of this logic can be shown through example. There exists an undoubted truth that younger male drivers are more likely to cause a fatal accident than younger female drivers. However, it would be simply illogical to conclude from that truth, that any one single young male driver was, beyond reasonable doubt, guilty of a charge of dangerous driving causing death.
	
	
	Before leaving Longo’s study, it is interesting to note her reference to other studies:
	


""Prior research examining the relationship between benzodiazepine use and crash risk has yielded inconsistent results, with some studies finding no significant relationship (Jick et al 1981; Benzodiazepine Collaborative Group, 1993; Leville et al 1994).""


	
	Surprisingly, this contradictory evidence did not find its way into the report by Mr Farrar despite it being clear in a paper quoted by him.
	
	
	Further, in Longo, the following passage appears:
	


""When interpreting these data, it is important to note that there was no information available on driver’s history of bensodiazapine use, such as the dose taken prior to the crash or the frequency of use. Experimental studies have found that a tolerance to the impairing effects of benzodiazapines occurs after chronic use.""


	
	Perhaps Mr Farrar forgot to mention this when stating with such certainty that tolerance does not have an impact on impairing effects.
	
	
	There was a return to the issue of the impacts of benzodiazapines later in the hearing, and two further papers are referred to by Mr Farrar. The first paper was authored by O’Hanlon, which is referred to in Drummer, but only deals with relatively naïve users of benzodiazapines. The second paper was authored by Verster. Mr Farrar appears to be under the misunderstanding that Verster conducted the tests himself (29:05-29:25). Clearly, Verster did not, and as the title of his study suggests, it is a meta-analysis of other studies. There is no issue of tolerance discussed.
	
	
	Further, Mr Van Dugteren challenged the conclusions in relation to co-consumption of benzodiazepine and methadone. Mr Farrar relied on the Bernard paper for his conclusion in the transcript at 18.5:
	


""Bernard found though that again epidemiologically if – where it was present with co-consumed, some co-consumed drugs it did cause in a statistical sense an enhancement of impairment of driving.""


	
	It soon became apparent this research did not test the motor skills or reaction times of those who had consumed both methadone and benzodiazepines. The study referred to by Bernard was again an epidemiological study, and thus of no probative value in assessing this defendant’s level of affectation. Further, and damning of Mr Farrar’s report, it does not support his contention at 3.2 that, “methadone is known to enhance impairment caused by co-consumption of benzodiazepines such as diazepam and nitrazepam.”
	
	
	There is a telling portion of cross-examination of Mr Farrar at 26:35. Mr Van Dugteren asks what effect a concentration of point three milligrams per litre would have in respect to impairment. Mr Farrar answers:
	


A. Well, if I had that concentration in my bloodstream I would be impaired and some other-

Q. Yes, but you are not a chronic user.

A. That’s correct, and some other people wouldn’t be impaired.

Q. Why would those other people not be impaired at point 3 milligrams per litre?

A. Some of it is caused by tolerance and some of it is caused by biological variation.


	
	That passage seems to directly contradict the statements of Mr Farrar in his report and oral evidence. He concedes tolerance of benzodiazapines does exist, and that it, together with biological differences, means that benzodiazapines affects different people differently.
	


Defence case on the first incident


	
	The defence relied on the expert evidence of Dr Robert Weatherby. In addition to the material considered by Mr Farrar, Dr Weatherby had information that the defendant had been treated with methadone and benzodiazapines for some years, and that his general practitioner had stated in a Medical Report to the Roads and Maritime Service (then known as the Roads and Traffic Authority) that the defendant tolerated his current medication without apparent impairment.
	
	
	Dr Weatherby agrees with Mr Farrar that the levels of methadone and benzodiazepines are as expected, given the prescriptions held and the amounts said to have been taken by the defendant.
	
	
	On benzodiazepines, Dr Weatherby states at paragraph six that:
	


""With long term use of benzodiazepines, tolerance occurs. When tolerance occurs, the dose must be increased to achieve the original effect…tolerance would have developed and it is highly likely that due to the tolerance developed that the impairment of driving skills no longer was occurring.""


	
	He also comments that Mr Farrer, at 3.15 of his report, states tolerance can exist, but then in Mr Farrar’s final analysis, concludes that the defendant was driving under the influence:
	


""Mr Farrar has not considered in his final opinion that tolerance has occurred…Therefore as there were no elevated concentrations and it is known that tolerance had developed, the likelihood of any impairment of driving is extremely minimal…the GP…state(s) that no impairment was apparent.""


	
	Indeed, this is the crux of the dispute between Dr Weatherby and Mr Farrar, as expressed by the latter at 39:35:
	


""Dr Weatherby believes that one can be tolerant to a drug through chronic use which I agree with…My thesis is that in order for the drugs to have a therapeutic effect there will always be an accompanying, unwanted in this case, psychomotor impairing effect.""


	
	Dr Weatherby, at 48:50, is highly critical in his evidence of the suggestion that the Bernard study supports the conclusion that the defendant was impaired by the combination of methadone and benzodiazepines:
	


[M]ost of those studies are of people who are involved in traffic accidents, virtually all of them, and in fact by doing that you’re actually having people who really presumably have most likely been impaired in some way, so when you look at the sort of data you get from that study you’re actually getting a much higher correlation than you otherwise might. If in fact you were to look at the population as a whole….we’re actually getting a lot more examples of people who aren’t having crashes, who are driving unimpaired but do have the presence of these drugs in their body.

Conclusions on the first incident


	
	In a criminal matter, it is unusual for expert evidence to be called. It is even more unusual for expert evidence to be so utterly at odds.
	
	
	In my view, based upon the discussion above, and my assessment of the demeanour of the witness when asked difficult questions, I have significant doubts about the reliability of Mr Farrar’s evidence, particularly when compared to that of Dr Weatherby.  He was partisan, and favoured the prosecution case even when it was not supported by the evidence. It is clear that in parts he relied upon published material which simply did not stack up when those articles were actually read. He failed to mention research which pointed in the other direction from his conclusions.
	
	
	His evidence called to mind a passage by Justice Hunt when describing some anticipated evidence in Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568.
	


""Will the GIO, instead of referring the plaintiff to its usual panel of doctors who think you can do a full weeks work without any arms or legs, do something useful in this case by sending the plaintiff to a specialist in rehabilitation? I am not usually very impressed with the views of that unholy trinity, Drs Lawson, Revai and Dyball, who have been identified as the defendant's doctors in this case, on the basis that those views are almost inevitably slanted in favour of the GIO by whom they have been retained…""


	
	Dr Weatherby was clear in his evidence, made appropriate concessions and was unshaken in cross-examination. He was also in possession of information regarding the defendant’s own doctor’s conclusions, and the length of time that the defendant had been prescribed methadone and benzodiazepines.
	
	
	This is a case where the expert evidence is in direct conflict on two key points. The Judicial Commission of New South Wales Criminal Trials Bench Book at 2-1100 contains a useful summary of the manner in which this is to be approached by the finder of fact. The key points are: that it is not simply a case of choosing between the experts as a matter of “simple preference”; that the onus on the prosecution must be borne in mind; and, the reliability and level of expertise of a particular witness are to be considered.
	
	
	It is necessary to compare the qualifications of Mr Farrar and Dr Weatherby. Mr Farrar has a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Pharmacology from Monash University. He has published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals, although none were presented. He has been involved in research surrounding the effects of drugs on human subjects and metabolic studies, although none of that research was disclosed in this case. He has given lectures at five Australian Universities and has been accepted as an expert in eight Australian jurisdictions.
	
	
	Dr Weatherby has a Bachelor of Pharmacy with Honours, a Master of Science (Pharmaceutical Chemistry) and a Ph.D in Pharmacology. He has been a university professor for decades. He is a member of several professional international organisations and has published numerous papers in peer reviewed journals, although none were presented. He also works for the International Olympic Committee on drug testing.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was driving under the influence of the stated drugs at the stated time. Clearly, he had been a user for a number of years of both drugs. Mr Farrar’s opinion regarding tolerance is rejected, and I accept that tolerance can occur with long term use, and that this decreases the risk of impairment as a result. Further, the levels of the drugs present in his system are not, of themselves, sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was driving under the influence of the drugs in question.
	
	
	That is because analysis of the research shows that the opposite conclusion is illogical and untenable. In particular, the evidence that a combination of benzodiazapines and methadone increases the impairment is inclusive at best, and certainly inapplicable to prove the conclusions reached by Mr Farrar.
	
	
	The charge relating to the first incident is dismissed.
	


The second incident and charge


	
	The second incident occurred on 5 November 2013 when a dog ran into the path of the defendant’s motorcycle. There was an eye witness to this incident, the owner of the dog, and that evidence suggests that the defendant was not at fault. The defendant was charged with driving under the influence of drugs specified as being methadone, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (""THC""), diazepam and nitrazepam.
	


Prosecution case on the second incident


	
	The prosecution case relies on delta-9 THC being a key ingredient that leads to the opinion that the defendant was driving under the influence. Mr Farrar stated under cross-examination:  
	


""[I]n the later incident the concentrations of diazepam are low. I’d say certainly would not be great enough to cause impairment  in their own right except perhaps in a naïve user, but in combination with the other drugs present specifically the delta-9 THC I believe that he is impaired.""


	
	I note, in passing, that this explanation seems to contradict the previous tolerance thesis by Mr Farrar.
	
	
	Regarding the second incident, the first limb of the prosecution case are police observations of the defendant. The attending police officer arrived when the defendant was waiting for the ambulance for significant shoulder injuries. He describes the defendant as follows:
	


""I observed his skin to be pallid and sweaty, his eyes pinpricked and his speech slow and slightly slurred. He did not appear to be in a great deal of pain despite having possibly dislocated or broken his right shoulder or collar bone. I was unable to make any observations of his co-ordination or balance as he remained on the ground and was stretchered into the ambulance.""


	
	In his statement to police, the defendant stated:
	


""I had my methadone dose 33 ml about 10 minutes before the accident at Warrwick’s Pharmacy. The night before I had smoked cannabis in a vaporiser and I had taken three valium the afternoon before about 4 pm and 33 ml of methadone about 4.00 pm the day before. My doctor, Dr Glover has sent a letter to the RTA to say that I am ok on my meds to drive or ride my bike because I have been on them about 10 years. I have a fractured right collar bone, ribs and scapula. I also have grazes to my shoulder and right knee. Ivy has bad grazes to her right arm.""


	
	The second limb of the prosecution case is the expert evidence of Mr Farrar in exhibit eight.
	
	
	Mr Farrar states at 2.2 that:
	


""Mouat is described by attending police as having an indifferent and sedated demeanour. Mouat’s pupils were enlarged, his breathing was shallow, his speech was slurred and slow…and his movements were sluggish.""


	
	Mr Farrar repeats his thesis from the first incident that, “…methadone is known to enhance impairment caused by co-consumption of benzodiazepines (Bernard et al 2009) such as diazepam and nitrazepam.”
	
	
	This statement is not qualified by reference to the epidemiological nature of Bernard’s study, and the casual reader would be forgiven for accepting this statement at face value. This statement is rejected as being unreliable and untenable for the reasons discussed above.
	
	
	The tolerance issue is discussed above and the same reasoning applies to the second incident.
	
	
	The key difference in the second incident is the reliance on cannabis. The defendant stated, and there is no evidence to the contrary, that he swallowed a bud of cannabis in his possession after the accident, before the police arrived. In his statement, the defendant maintained he swallowed the cannabis in an attempt to alleviate his pain.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that the defendant’s cannabis levels in the blood test were not affected by the consumption of the cannabis at the accident scene because that would not have affected the levels of cannabis tested in his blood stream. This was the view expressed during cross-examination at 8:45 by Mr Farrar:
	


""[C]annabis leaf or cannabis bud does not contain very much at all of the active ingredient that is delta-9 THC. It contains primarily a substance called delta-9 THC carboxylic acid which is then converted into the active component delta-9 THC when it is either burned whilst smoking or when it is baked into cookies and consumed orally but not by direct oral consumption.""


	
	Farrar then asserted he based this opinion “upon a paper written by Swift and her colleagues…in July 2013.”
	
	
	The cross-examination showed that Swift’s paper calculated average delta-9 THC concentration in police seizures of cannabis over a period of time. But at no time in that research is there any assessment of the levels that can be achieved via the consumption of cannabis by raw consumption. Mr Farrar admits as much at 23:20. When asked about the basis of his opinion that eating raw cannabis does not affect the relevant blood tested levels, he asserted the conclusion was “well known” – 24:20. Yet again, Mr Farrar is taking the general and making it specific, and drawing conclusions that, in my view, do not logically follow.
	
	
	He was later tested on his opinion at 36:5. It was put to Mr Farrar that the blood test occurred 125 minutes after the traffic incident, and that this explained the relevant THC level.
	


""That is where I disagree because I don’t believe that the consumption of cannabis leaf or bud would produce that concentration of THC…As I’ve said to you twice before I base that on the work of Swift, the concentrations of delta-9 THC in cannabis plant material.""


	
	Indeed Mr Farrar points specifically to the nub of the disagreement he has with Dr Weatherby on this point at 39:45:
	


""Dr Weatherby also states that one can consume raw cannabis plant, that being a bud, and cause elevated delta-9 THC levels in the bloodstream as a consequence and in my opinion that would be insignificant.""


	
	In cross-examination Mr Farrar conceded that there was no rational basis for the conclusion in the COPS entry or in his statement that the defendant’s movements were sluggish – in fact he did not move at all.  Mr Farrar was asked at 35:30:
	


Q: …are you aware of the circumstances whereby Mr Mouat’s movements were observed?

A: No

Q: Are you aware that he was on the ground after a motor vehicle accident and was removed by an ambulance?

A: No, I’m aware that he, as it states here, he had a possibly broken clavicle or dislocated clavicle.


	
	That conclusion is surprising, given that the COPS entry clearly states, “Did not walk at scene. Injured and placed on street”.
	


Defence expert


	
	Dr Weatherby directly challenged the view expressed by Mr Farrar relating to consumption of raw cannabis. At 47:5 he points to hydroponically grown cannabis that is much stronger than the average identified in the seized cannabis referred to in the Swift paper. He clearly states the consumption of raw cannabis, if it occurred as described by the defendant, would have likely led to the elevated levels in the blood test some two hours later.
	
	
	Again, the experts are completely at odds.
	
	
	For the reasons given above at paragraphs 32 to 40, the evidence of Mr Farrar is rejected in favour of the evidence of Dr Weatherby.
	
	
	Further, the observations made by the attending police are just as consistent with serious injury as they are with affection by drugs.
	
	
	In the second incident, there is a reasonable explanation consistent with innocence - the defendant ate the cannabis post-accident and this explains the elevated levels of THC.
	
	
	The second charge is also dismissed.

		03 June 2015",2014-12-21 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2765691,Day v R [2014] NSWCCA 333,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J. 
2McCALLUM J:  Stephen Day seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to an offence of manslaughter contrary to s 18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and an offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 52A(3)(a) of the Act.  In sentencing the applicant, the judge was asked to take into account two further offences of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm on a Form 1.  The applicant also asked to be sentenced in respect of two related matters on a s 166 certificate, being an offence of driving under the influence of a drug and driving having worked more than 12 hours in 24 hours.  The sentences imposed for those offences are not challenged.  
3The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.   The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 52A(3) is imprisonment for 7 years.
4The circumstances of the offences were tragic for all involved.  The applicant was sentenced on the strength of the following agreed facts:
""About 7.40am on Saturday 10th April, 2010 the Offender was the driver and sole occupant of a Mack heavy rigid tipper vehicle registered number PJS-405 (NSW) which was towing a tipper dog trailer registered number P-87015(NSW) in a nominal westerly direction upon the M4 Motorway, a road area in the State of New South Wales, at Orchard Hills.
On that day the offender woke at 3:30am. He commenced work at 4:30am at his usual place of employment, Penrith Sand and Soil at South Penrith. The work assigned the offender was to depart the yard at Harford Street South Penrith at 4:30am and travel empty to Somersby for the purpose of collecting a load of sand.
The offender was in a convoy with two other trucks and they stopped briefly at Thornleigh McDonalds to purchase food at about 5:10am. The offender then travelled to Sommersby arriving at about 6am. He was back on the road by approximately 6:20am. He travelled in the same convoy with the other trucks.
The offender subsequently told police that he commenced the return journey to Penrith. He recalled catching up to his younger brother Matthew Day who was driving a 4th truck and after a brief stop on the M2 he followed Matthew Day on the M2 and subsequently onto the M7 and then onto the M4 to the point of collision.
At the time the vehicle combination was laden with sand with a Gross Weight of 47.78 tonnes.
The Offender's vehicle was travelling at a speed of approximately 100 kilometres per hour.
The Offender's vehicle combination occupied the lane closest to the nearside road shoulder, often referred to as Lane 1.
On the approach to the diverging off-ramp of The Northern Road Overpass the Offender's vehicle combination gradually diverged to its left whereupon it crossed the unbroken edge line and entered onto the road shoulder, more commonly referred to as the 'breakdown lane'.
Having entered that road shoulder the front of the Offender's vehicle combination collided with four bicycle riders all of whom were also riding in a nominal westerly direction upon that road shoulder of the M4 Motorway.  One of the cyclists, Mr David Williams became caught and dragged under the vehicle for a distance and sustained fatal injuries. (Count 1 on the indictment)
Ms. Monique De Abreu, aged 20 at the time of the collision, suffered a fractured left hand and crushed wrist which required internal fixation with screws. Her left elbow was deeply lacerated requiring stitches and her left shoulder (scapula) was fractured. She also sustained a head injury and a deep laceration next to her left eye which has left a significant scar. She sustained lacerations to her legs and has a significant scar on her right leg. She was admitted to Nepean Hospital under the care of Dr DEY. A CT scan of her brain revealed small bilateral frontal contusions (bruising of the brain). Further examination revealed a fracture of the left forearm (ulna styloid), fracture of the 5th metacarpal which was displaced and comminuted, small apical pneumothorax discovered on chest x-ray and a left sided shoulder fracture below the level of the glenoid fossa. Monique was then taken to theatre for operative closure of multiple abrasions (4 involving limbs-left elbow, left wrist & left hand, 1 involving left outer canthus) and open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture of the 5th metacarpal with 3 x 1.3mm scews [sic]. Monique remained in hospital for 9 days. (Count 2 on the indictment)
Mr. Robert De Abreu, aged 26 at the time of the collision, suffered a fractured right forearm (ulna mid-shaft), dislocated right wrist and severe grazing to his lower back. He was admitted to Nepean Hospital and under Dr Charles NEW, Orthopaedic Surgeon for operative fixation of the right ulna fracture on 12/4/10. He was operated on under general anaesthetic to insert a plate and screws. He remained in hospital for 6 days. (Form 1)
Mr. Mathew La Motta, aged 23 at the time of the collision, suffered a broken left wrist which required surgery and insertion of a steel plate. He also sustained a large laceration to his right knee and right elbow which required stitches. He was admitted to Nepean Hospital under the care of Dr CHEN. Medical examination revealed he had sustained a comminuted fracture of the left distal radius. Dr SMITH, Orthopaedic registrar, operated on Matthew for washout and debridement of the right elbow and right knee wounds along with closed reduction of left distal radius. A CT of his spine disclosed a compression fracture of the T7 and T8 vertebrae which did not require surgical intervention. He remained in hospital for 4 days. (Form 1)
Following the initial impact, the Offender's vehicle combination continued along the shoulder of the roadway whereupon it was involved in six (6) separate impacts with road  side furniture  items  consisting  of guard railing, street light  poles  and  an information sign before coming to rest on an embankment approximately 780 metres from its departure from the roadway.
The first person to speak to the offender was his brother Matthew Day who was travelling in his truck about 100 metres ahead of the offender's truck at the time of the collision. Matthew Day observed the accident occurring in his rear view mirror and ran back to the offender's vehicle once he had brought his own to a stop.
He opened the Driver's door and assisted the offender out. The truck was on the roadside embankment, at a precarious angle.
Matthew Day told Senior Constable Ibrahim, in a statement taken that same day that the offender had a puzzled look on his face as he pulled him out of the truck.
Matthew Day told police that after the accident they stood away for the vehicle in the breakdown lane, where Matthew asked the offender ""what the fuck just happened?"". He said that his brother replied ""I think I blacked out. I remember telling you I felt sick, the next thing I know you're dragging me out the truck door"".
The offender was interviewed by investigating police the following day. When asked ""what can you tell me about the crash?"" the offender told Senior Constable Bain, ""we were driving round (sic) the M4 talking about the eggs and bacon. I said ""I felt, I was going to be sick (on the radio) and before I even got to finish hanging up the mike the whole road just went black. That's it. And then I just remember me brother standing on the side of me truck. I didn't know (what) had happened"".
Apart from hitting his head during the collision the offender was uninjured.
At the time of the collision the weather was fine and sunny, the divided, multi-lane bitumen roadway was dry and in good condition and the traffic was considered to be light. The sun, which had risen well above the horizon, was behind the Offender's direction of approach.
In accordance with the Mandatory/Blood/Urine sampling legislation the Offender was Arrested and conveyed to Nepean District Hospital where those samples were obtained (Sample No.D21094). The blood and urine samples were taken at 8.50am on the 10 April 2010.
The analysis of the blood/urine sample (D21094) subsequently returned a positive reading to the prohibited substance 'Cannabis' (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 0.028mg/lt & Delta-9-THC acid 0.14mg/lt).
A report was obtained from Dr. Judith Perl. The blood concentrations of the THC and delta-9-THC acid indicate that he had ingested cannabis within 2 to 3 hours of the blood sample being obtained, in Dr Perl's opinion, blood concentrations of delta-9-THC above 0.010 mg/L are associated with impairment.
A report was also obtained from Associate Professor Graham Starmer who opined that ""given the concentrations of THC and THC acid in a blood sample, it is possible to calculate the time of last exposure to cannabis and its 95% confidence limit using the method of Huestis et al (1992). Applying this calculation to Mr Day's blood levels of cannabinoids, I estimate at the time of last exposure to cannabis was 1.67 hours before sampling with 95% confidence limits of 0.63 - 4.39 hours"". This estimate is in accord with that of Dr Perl.
Dr Perl further indicated that, based on the symptoms described by the Offender, his manner of driving (veering out of his traffic lane) and his high blood level of THC (and THC acid), at the time of the collision the Offender's ability to drive was ""very significantly impaired"" due to cannabis toxicity but that the ""level of impairment did not amount to very substantially impaired"".
In a further report Dr Perl indicated that there was no scientific evidence or ""statistics"" to suggest cannabis induces ""blackout"" and the pharmacological profile of cannabis would not suggest a hypothesis that blackouts are possible.
During the investigation the data relating to the Global Positioning System (GPS) fitted to not only the Offender's vehicle combination, but other vehicles in the company fleet were obtained in conjunction with Enforcement Officers of the Roads and Traffic Authority.
That data, supplemented by work diaries, receipts and other documents subsequently seized were provided to a forensic analyst for compilation and review.
From that analysis it was determined that the Offender had grossly exceeded his permissible work hours whilst the driver/operator of a heavy vehicle between 1st March, 2010 and the day of the collision. Those excessive work hours in the four (4) days leading up to the collision fell within the 'Critical' and 'Substantial' categories.
An expert opinion in relation to fatigue was obtained from Professor Anne Williamson.
Professor Williamson's opinion is that the Offender on the 10 April 2010 was ""highly likely to be fatigued"" and therefore his driving ""would have been impaired"". Analysis of the Offender's vehicle activity reports and daily work sheets show the Offender had no rest breaks during his work periods which exacerbated the Offender's levels of acute fatigue. She stated ""there is little doubt that Mr Day was experiencing chronic and acute fatigue on 10 April 2010"". She further stated ""Mr Day was vey [sic] likely to have been fatigued when he started his work shift on 10 April 2010 and he had no rest breaks from driving on that day"".
In respect of those work hours the data indicates that the Offender performed work from 3.25am on Friday 9th April, 2010 to 10.32pm that same evening, a total of 12 hours and 30 minutes work time.
In relation to the period of rest required in order to nullify the effects of his fatigue over the week leading up to the 10 April 2010, in her opinion ""he would have needed an extended period in which to obtain rest and sleep. It is doubtful that his would have been achieved in only 24 hour break. Even 48 hours off work may not have been sufficient to obtain full recovery"". Based on the information available of the Offender's working and resting pattern in the period leading up to the crash, Professor Williamson was of the opinion that ""it is highly likely that fatigue was a causal factor in the M4 accident"".
In her report she also states ""other characteristics of the crash also point to fatigue-involvement, including the fact that there was no evidence of speeding, he responded feeling unwell and he made little attempt to brake until well after the collision with the cyclists, suggesting that he was not aware of what was happening around him"". Both feeling unwell and consuming cannabis within a few hours before driving are factors that can adversely affect the driving performance and accentuate the effects of fatigue.
The very significant impairment of the Offender's driving ability at the time of the collision due to cannabis toxicity, in combination with the effects of acute and chronic fatigue, whilst driving a 47.78 tonne truck at a speed of 100 kilometres an hour constitute an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury or death such that the resulting death of David Williams amounts to Manslaughter. The dangerous manner of the Offender's driving in those circumstances caused the grievous bodily injury sustained by the other three cyclists.""

5The applicant was aged 27 years at the time of the offences and 30 years at the time he was sentenced. He was married and had three children, one of whom is autistic. His wife ended their relationship shortly before he was sentenced.  
6The applicant was an experienced truck driver.  At the time of the offences he had been working long hours for a significant period of time due to financial pressure.  He was very anxious and was having difficulty sleeping.  In a pre-sentence report prepared by the probation and parole service, he was recorded as having admitted to smoking cannabis on a nightly basis for approximately one year prior to committing the offence, claiming that the drug ""helped him sleep"".  It must be observed, however, that the agreed facts tendered at the proceedings on sentence establish unequivocally that the applicant must have smoked cannabis early that morning.  The blood and urine samples were taken at 8.50am.  Dr Perl's uncontested opinion was that the levels indicated the ingestion of cannabis 2 to 3 hours before the samples were obtained, which was after the applicant began driving that morning.
7At the proceedings on sentence, the applicant relied on a report prepared by a psychologist, Dr Jacmon.  He expressed the opinion that, at the time of the incident, the applicant was suffering from depression and anxiety at ""clinically significant levels"" due to the harsh conditions of his employment.  The applicant told Dr Jacmon that he was required to work 14 hour shifts or longer, six days a week without a break.  If he stopped to rest by the side of the road he was directed to continue driving.  He was told he faced dismissal if he complained about his working conditions.  He was financially dependent on the job to pay rent and support his family.
8The sentencing judge referred to that evidence but nonetheless found that the applicant's moral culpability was of a high order.  Her Honour referred to evidence given at the proceedings on sentence as to the conduct of the employer.  An employee of Roads and Maritime Services gave evidence that the employer had committed clear and consistent breaches of the regulation relating to long distance truck drivers.
9The judge noted that the applicant's pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court and allowed a discount of twenty five per cent.  For the offence of dangerous driving occasioning actual bodily harm, her Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 24 February 2012.  For the offence of manslaughter, taking into account the matters on the form 1, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 24 February 2013 and a balance of term of 3 years.  The overall sentence was accordingly a total sentence of imprisonment for 10 years with a total non-parole period of 7 years.  The applicant is eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 23 February 2019.  
10The first ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant's mental condition in assessing moral culpability.
11As already noted, the opinion of the psychologist was that, at the time of the incident, the applicant was suffering from depression and anxiety at clinically significant levels due to the harsh conditions of his employment.  The psychologist expressed the opinion that those symptoms diminished the applicant's ability to formulate a reasoned judgment at the time of the accident, leading him to self-medicate on marijuana to induce sleep.
12The sentencing judge expressly referred to those remarks.  It was submitted, however, that her Honour did not take that factor into account in assessing the applicant's moral culpability, ""instead"" coming to a conclusion that the applicant's moral culpability was of a high order.  The submission appeared to assume that the conclusion her Honour reached could not sit consistently with the opinion of the psychologist.  In my view, while the outcome may seem harsh to the applicant, that conclusion was open to her Honour.  It is not for this Court to substitute its own view for a conclusion properly reached within the sentencing judge's discretion.  Her Honour noted that, while the applicant may have been under significant pressure from his employer, ""at the end of the day he was an experienced driver who would have known full well the potential consequences of driving acutely and chronically fatigued and significantly impaired by the ingestion of cannabis"".  That was a perfectly reasonable conclusion, in my view.
13The conduct of the employer was nothing short of appalling.  One cannot help feeling angered by it, and sorry for the applicant and indeed other truck drivers faced with such harsh (not to mention illegal) conditions in order to maintain their employment.  Ultimately, however, I do not think it can be said that the sentencing judge's conclusion as to the applicant's moral culpability was not open.  Her Honour was not required to excuse what was otherwise undoubtedly moral culpability of a high order on the strength of the psychologist's report.
14Ground 2 is that the sentencing judge erred in the proportion between the non-parole period and the overall sentence.  For the offence of manslaughter, the non-parole period was two thirds of the total sentence for that offence (9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years).  However, the effect of the 12 months accumulation between the two sentences that the overall proportion was 70 per cent (10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years).  
15The applicant submitted that the additional term was extended ""only by a period of 26 weeks in a 10 year sentence"".  It was submitted on that basis that the non-parole period, despite the finding of special circumstances, did not achieve the purpose of the finding.  
16The judge said that there was a need for a ""lengthier than normal period of parole"" as this was the applicant's first time in custody and, since he was suffering from depression and anxiety, he would need ongoing psychotherapy and drug and alcohol counselling.  For that purpose, the sentence allows a period of three years.  Although it would have been open to take a more merciful approach, I do not think it can be said that a period of three years is erroneously inadequate for the purpose identified.  I would reject ground 2.  
17Ground 3 is that the sentence is manifestly excessive.  In support of that submission, the applicant provided a table of motor vehicle manslaughter cases from 1991 to date.  From that table, the following cases were relied upon as highlighting the alleged manifest excess in the sentence imposed upon the applicant:  R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; (1999) 110 A Crim R 198; R v Ryan [2000] NSWSC 724; R v Do [2000] NSWCCA 459; R v Lawler (2007) 169 A Crim R 415 and R v Winter [2012] CCA 218.
18I do not think those cases establish that the sentence imposed for the offence of manslaughter in the present case was outside the proper range.  The offending in Cramp was undoubtedly more serious than that in the present case serious.  The applicant encouraged a drunk 16 year-old girl to drive at high speeds with 3 other children in the back of the car.  She was killed when inevitably she crashed.  The offender's conduct was described in the following terms in the judgment (at [105]):
""It is difficult to imagine a more serious course of conduct than that followed by the appellant. What took place happened over a period of about three and a half hours and over a distance of thirty-five kilometres. The appellant was the only adult having the care of four children. He was aware that he was too drunk to drive and, in order to avoid the consequences to himself of drinking and driving, encouraged the deceased to drive. It was he alone who supplied alcohol and encouraged her to drink it. Three young children as well as the deceased were put at risk. Very high speeds were reached on the direct encouragement of the appellant to drive faster. All this was done in the face of the fear of the three boys, their entreaties and efforts to bring the career to an end.""
19The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for nine years and four months, comprising a minimum term of seven years and an additional term of two years four months.  In dismissing the offender's appeal against that sentence, the Court said (at [107] to [109]) per Barr J; Sully and Ireland JJ agreeing at [1]):
""In fixing the sentence his Honour referred to the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, provided for in s 52A(2) Crimes Act, the maximum sentence for which is fourteen years' imprisonment. His Honour observed that that was the crime which in his opinion most closely resembled the crime for which he was punishing the appellant and took fourteen years' imprisonment to be a general guide to the current opinion of the Parliament concerning the maximum sentence for motor vehicle manslaughter.
His Honour erred in making that observation and that comparison. The offence for which his Honour was sentencing the appellant was manslaughter, a much more serious offence than aggravated dangerous driving causing death. The maximum penalty was penal servitude for twenty-five years. His Honour's error favoured the appellant.
In my opinion this case was of such a serious nature as to be seen as falling into the worst category of cases of its kind. The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive.""
20It is accordingly plain that the sentence imposed in Cramp cannot be seen as a proper comparator for the purpose for which it was relied upon in this appeal.  The Court of Criminal Appeal appears to have regarded it as being too lenient.
21Ryan was a case involving a truck driver who, in a state of tiredness and amphetamine-induced intoxication, intentionally drove onto the wrong side of the road.  Unsurprisingly, there was a collision and two people were killed.  He pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter.  He was sentenced by Adams J to a term of imprisonment for seven years and ten months with a non-parole period of five years and ten months.
22In written submissions in the present case, the applicant relied on remarks made by Mr Ryan to a doctor after the accident suggesting that Mr Ryan intended to kill the victims.  However, the judgment records that Adams J did not accept that those remarks reflected Mr Ryan's state of mind at the time of the accident.  His Honour said (at [19]):
""It is at least reasonably possible that his statements in the hospital, themselves probably exaggerated, were a reconstruction warped by the intensity of his emotions resulting from the amphetamine intoxication combined, I rather think, with profound feelings of guilt"".    
23It may be accepted that the circumstances in Ryan bear some similarities to the present case and that the sentences imposed were more lenient.  That does not of itself establish that the present sentences were erroneously excessive.
24Do was a case involving a truck driver who, overlooking a warning that said ""Trucks must use low gear"", was seen to accelerate away very quickly from the top of a hill, reaching ""a terrifyingly high speed"".  He tried to put the truck in gear to slow it down and tried to warn others by flashing his lights and sounding the horn as the truck ""careered out of control"".  He collided with a car and a house killing the driver of the car and a young girl in the house.  He pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter.  He was sentenced to wholly concurrent terms of imprisonment for 4 years comprising a minimum term of 3 years with an additional term of 1 year.  In dismissing a Crown appeal against the leniency of those sentences, the Court said (at [22] per Beazley JA as her Honour then was; Wood CJ at CL and O'Keefe J agreeing):
""In my opinion, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not manifestly inadequate, although I consider them to be at the very bottom of the range. However if, contrary to my view, the sentences did fall outside an appropriate discretionary range, I am of the opinion that when the principle of double jeopardy is applied, this Court should not interfere.""     
25I do not understand the applicant's reliance on the decision in Lawler.  That was a case in which a truck driver who drove knowing that his brakes were in poor condition was unable to stop as he approached a traffic jam.  His collision with the congested traffic resulted in the death of one person and grievous bodily harm to two others: he pleaded guilty to one offence of manslaughter and two offences contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act.  He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of ten years and eight months with a non-parole period of eight years.  An appeal on the sole ground of manifest excess was dismissed.  The applicant relied upon the fact that the offender in that case knew that his brakes were defective and the tyres were worn, which this Court regarded as being significant in the assessment of his moral culpability.  Equally, however, the applicant in the present case knew he was extremely tired and that he had smoked marijuana before driving that morning.  I do not think the decision in Lawler assists the applicant.
26The decision in Winter is equally unhelpful to the applicant, in my view.  Ms Winter pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter after she hit two pedestrians.  Dr Perl's evidence in that case was that Ms Winter was ""under the influence of cannabis to the extent that her driving ability was impaired, but it is also possible that there was additional impairment due to some uncontrolled medical condition capable of producing blackouts.""    The sentencing judge found that she had blacked out but also found that she had previously blacked out which contributed to her culpability.  The Court upheld a Crown appeal, imposing a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and an additional term of 3 years for each offence.  The sentences were accumulated by 2 years, giving an overall sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.     
27As acknowledged at the outset of this judgment, this was a tragic accident with tragic consequences for all involved.  However, it was not a case of momentarily ignoring a warning. The agreed facts establish that the applicant got behind the wheel of a Mack truck with a heavy load in a state of acute exhaustion and having recently smoked marijuana, a drug he says he would smoke to help him sleep.  The uncontested facts were that he smoked that drug within hours before driving, in which case he must have smoked it in the early hours of the morning.  He should not have driven in those circumstances.  The consequences were tragic, not only for the man who died but for the three other victims, each of whom suffered serious injuries.  One of the victims now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Another has suffered a brain injury of mild severity as a consequence of the accident.  
28I would accept that the overall sentence imposed was stern.  One cannot help feeling greatly saddened by the impact of this accident on the applicant as well as on the victims and their families.  However, I do not think it can be characterised as erroneously excessive.  
29For those reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.
30BELLEW J: I agree with McCallum J.

		31 December 2014",2014-12-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765694,R v Dyer [2014] NSWSC 1809,"Judgment

1The Prisoner stands for sentence for having, on 17 March 2013 unlawfully killed Douglas Hunt, an offence to which, on 8 August 2014 he pleaded guilty. 

2At the time of the offence the deceased and the Prisoner were homeless, and both had attended the corner of Station Street and Allen Place, Penrith where a St Vincent De Paul food van was due to arrive shortly.

3The deceased's practice was to carry all of his possessions around in a shopping trolley. He left the trolley in the middle of Station Street. A Miss Mellissa O'Neill called to the deceased to move it and walked to the trolley to move it herself. The deceased became agitated, saying ""don't touch it Mel, don't touch my stuff.""

4The Prisoner then approached the trolley, placing both hands on the handle and saying ""mate get the trolley off the road, you have to get if off the road."" The deceased clenched and raised his fists as if preparing to fight and called out to the Prisoner ""don't touch me stuff, don't tough me stuff."" Passing traffic obliged the deceased to retreat and the Prisoner again said ""the trolley's got to get off the road.""

5The deceased continued moving his fists around in a boxing motion. The Prisoner said ""if you hit me, I'll have to hit you and then both deceased and the Prisoner pushed each other in the chest a number of times before the deceased's brother stood between the two in an attempt to stop the incident escalating. Believing the situation had calmed, he then walked away.

6The ""Agreed Facts"" continues:

Douglas Hunt was still aggressive towards the offender. He had his fists clenched and appeared ready to engage in a fight with the offender. At this time the offender punched the victim once to the right side of his face with his left fist. The victim did not hit the offender at any time, but he was very loud and aggressive towards the offender, he did engage in pushing the offender, and appeared to be ready to punch the offender.""

7The Prisoner's blow appeared to render the deceased unconscious, causing him to fall backwards and strike his head heavily on the roadway. He sustained a significant laceration to the back of his head and a fracture to the base of his skull. An ambulance arrived. The deceased was conveyed to the Nepean Hospital where he underwent a craniectomy. He remained in a coma until 27 March when he died from a subdural bleed in his brain due to the trauma to the back of his head.

8At the time of the offence the Prisoner was on bail having been charged with common assault on 21 January 2013. He was also on parole pursuant to a sentence of 4½ years, including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods dating from 20 April 2009 for an offence of aggravated entering a dwelling with intent in company. The purpose of entering had been to assault an occupier. The assault had occurred, the victim suffering a number of soft tissue injuries, bruising and swelling to the head and body and split injuries to 2 sections of his head where the Prisoner had hit him with a golf club.

9The Prisoner has been involved in other assaults. In 2002 and 2007 he was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the victim in the latter case being the same victim as I have referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. According to a Facts Sheet that was tendered in the proceedings before me, the 2013 charge arose after the mother of a 14 year old whom the Prisoner was harassing, remonstrated with the Prisoner. The Prisoner responded with 3 closed fist punches, one of which connected to the mother's chin. The Prisoner then said to this victim, ""You fucken slut"" and departed. The Prisoner's antecedent report records that the sentence imposed was ""S10A conviction with no other penalty"". It is not obvious that the penalty can be reconciled with the contents of the facts sheet.

10The Prisoner also has a very extensive record for offences of larceny, stealing motor vehicles, possessing implements to enter a conveyance, and driving whilst disqualified. In November 2005 he was sentenced to just under 3½ years gaol for armed robbery. Counsel were agreed that from 25 November 2003 to 31 October 2014, a period of 10 years 11 months and 7 days, Mr Dyer has been in the community for 275 days, only a little over 9 months. The parole to which he was subject at the time of assaulting the deceased was revoked as from the date of the Prisoner's arrest for his offence.

11Victim Impact Statements from the deceased's grandmother, daughter and brother were read. Given the date of the Prisoner's plea such statements are not subject to the prohibition contained in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. Their terms help to ensure that the Court does not lose sight of the impact the deceased's death has on his family and of the loss which the Prisoner's offence has imposed. And, as in most cases, some aspects of the impact are unique, in this case for example, the loss of opportunity the deceased's daughter has to establish a relationship with him. I have considered these statements but weighing them up against the general pattern of loss due to an unlawful killing have concluded that the sentence to be imposed on the Prisoner should not be increased because of the contents of the statements.

12The Agreed Facts record that on 18 March, the day after the Prisoner's assault on the deceased, the police contacted the Prisoner's parole officer who in turn contacted the Prisoner and the two then met. As the parole officer recounted details of the events of 17 March, the Prisoner became distressed during the meeting and later that day at the parole officer's suggestion, attended Penrith Police Station where he was arrested and charged, initially with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.

13Otherwise, the Prisoner's subjective case was presented in a pre-sentence report, a report by Dr Susan Pulman, psychologist, and his sister who was also the source of some of the information in Dr Pulman's report. 

14The Prisoner was born in 1984. It seems clear that the Prisoner had an unfortunate childhood. He was one of seven half-siblings to 6 different fathers. His mother was a constant user of cannabis who, according to Ms Dyer, ""never showed us any affection"". The Prisoner's parents separated when he was 3 or 4 and he has had no contact with his father. Although the Prisoner reported having a positive relationship with one of his mother's subsequent partners, in the main they seem commonly to have assaulted her and, without opposition from her, to have gone overboard with punishment of the Prisoner. At one stage the Prisoner and his older sisters were removed by DOCS

15His mother frequently moved addresses and the Prisoner attended 7 primary schools. He had learning difficulties and at age 14 was diagnosed with ADHD for which he took Ritalin during his school years. Psychological testing has placed him in the borderline or low average range in a number of areas.

16He was suspended from school on a number of occasions for fighting. Ultimately it appears this suspension became permanent. He wished to return but his mother did nothing about it, resulting in anger and hurt and, according to Dr Pulman, psychological distress. For a time he worked as a carpet layer, detailer, builder's labourer, in fibreglass engineering and with stainless steel bench tops but has been unemployed for approximately 13 years. He started smoking cannabis at 14, having been introduced to it by his mother. It relaxes him but he denies being a regular drinker or user of speed. 

17According to the author of the pre-sentence report, the Prisoner appeared to be remorseful, presenting as emotional when his offending was discussed. Dr Pulman's report contained a statement to similar effect.

18His sister is content for the Prisoner to live with her family on his release and said that her husband is willing to employ the Prisoner in a lawn mowing business. She described the Prisoner as a ""fantastic uncle"" to her children.

19The Prisoner has made a number of statements to the effect that he is not a violent person and has simply reacted to violence of others. I do not accept these statements. Rather does the preponderance of evidence favour the statements of the author of the pre-sentence report and the Prisoner's sister that the Prisoner has difficulty controlling his anger. This and the Agreed Facts lead to the conclusion that it was this difficulty that caused him to inflict the fatal punch on the deceased. The effect of the punch in apparently rendering the deceased unconscious indicates that the punch must have been hard. I am not however persuaded to the requisite standard, that is beyond reasonable doubt, that the Prisoner would have appreciated the risk that he would cause significant injury by delivering the punch.

20Dr Pulman's conclusions included the following:-

Mr Dyer is a 29 year old aboriginal man... He described a family history of disadvantage and abandonment having been subjected to physical and emotional abuse from his mother and her numerous partners. His early experiences most likely contributed to his current difficulties with self-regulatory behaviour which have been exacerbated by a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyper-Activity Disorder. His lack of solid role models and encouragement of substance abuse within the family have only further led to the development of anti-social tendencies.

...

Mr Dyer however, has the intellectual capacity to obtain employment and given a supportive environment with psychological therapy and medication, has a good prognosis for integration into the community.

...

Mr Dyer demonstrated good insight into his offending behaviour acknowledging that he can be quick to anger when defending another person and that his actions can be impulsive rather than considered. 

Mr Dyer displayed what appeared to be genuine remorse...

A period of prolonged detention is likely to exacerbate his symptoms of depression and anxiety. Mr Dyer has not had the opportunity to engage in psychological support and treatment during his period of incarceration. Given his expression of remorse and insight, he is likely to benefit considerably from psychological intervention from a treating mental health professional with experience working with adults with ADHD and a history of psychological abuse and/or trauma. 

...

Mr Dyer's earlier familial experiences suggest emotional and physical abuse which can exist in both indigenous and non indigenous families. Early family trauma is known to contribute to difficulties in managing emotion and impulse control and it is this environment which has most likely contributed to Mr Dyer's development of anti-social behaviour.

21Following the death of the deceased, the Prisoner was originally charged with murder. In due course that charge was the subject of a nolle prosequi and on 6 December 2013 the Prisoner was arraigned on the current charge. A trial was set down for 4 August but on 14 July the Court was advised of the Prisoner's intention to plead guilty. In these circumstances I propose to allow a discount of approximately 15% for the utilitarian value of his plea.

22I accept that the Prisoner is, and since he heard about the deceased's death, remorseful for his actions. Undoubtedly his sister's offer of help means that the Prisoner must be regarded as having some prospects of rehabilitation but his record for offences of assault and dishonesty - whether for a greater drug habit than he was willing to acknowledge or not - means that those prospects cannot be regarded as any higher. 

23As has been remarked on many occasions, the circumstances in which manslaughter occurs are almost infinitely variable. The same can be said of ""one-punch"" manslaughter and in these circumstances I do not think that anything is to be gained by detailed reference to any of the numerous cases where such killings have been considered. Counsel took the same view and it sufficeth to say that the decisions in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571, R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 and R v Field [2014] NSWSC 1797 provide some guidance and, of course, there are others. Because of the differing circumstances, the last two mentioned cases of course called for substantially greater punishment than here. That said, their emphasis on the need for general deterrence in offences of this kind, is a factor to which regard must be had.

24Operating in the Prisoner's favour is that his offence was not one of alcohol fuelled violence - one factor (though by no means the only one) which is relevant to the recent emphasis on general deterrence. Also, he was subject to some provocation by the deceased in circumstances where their proximity was inspired by the Prisoner's trying to assist the deceased. I do not mean by that statement to suggest the Prisoner was in any way justified in his reaction, merely to acknowledge a contributing factor. His remorse operates in the same direction. However, against the Prisoner is his record of assaults. They demonstrate a greater need for personal deterrence and protection of the community than in many cases. Also operating against him is the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the time of his assault on the deceased.

25One matter to which my attention was specifically directed was the Prisoner's recent history of incarceration and the consequence that the Prisoner was at risk of being institutionalised. I accept that the risk exists but given that the incarceration was in response to his own conduct, it is a matter of very limited weight so far as the length of the Prisoner's sentence is concerned. On the other hand, and notwithstanding that the Prisoner's incarceration has not been continuous, that history does justify a finding of special circumstances and extending the balance of term at the expense of the non-parole period. Dr Pulman's remarks as to the impact of a period of prolonged detention argue in that last mentioned direction.

26Of more significance is the Prisoner's upbringing. There is injustice in punishing a man for not adhering to standards he was never properly taught. However, as was pointed out in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [44], dispositions reflecting a deprived upbringing may increase the importance of protecting the community from an offender. Furthermore, and notwithstanding the remarks in Bugmy that experience in growing up may compromise a person's capacity to learn, the Prisoner's school suspensions for fighting and his prior sentences for assault, given the remarks that at least most of those responsible for those decisions must inevitably have made, should have brought home to him long before the death of the deceased, society's inability to accept violence. 

27The need to reflect these conflicting factors makes the decision in this case difficult. I have decided that the sentence I impose should date from the Prisoner's arrest, notwithstanding that for some time thereafter he was serving what would otherwise have been the balance of a parole period. Ultimately, the decision at which I have arrived is as follows:

28I sentence the Prisoner to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 18 March 2013 together with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months making a total sentence of 6 years and 6 months.

29The date upon which it appears to the Court that the Prisoner becomes eligible for parole is 18 December 2016.

		22 December 2014",2014-12-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765696,Leung v R [2014] NSWCCA 336,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Offence and sentenceOn 28 November 2012, after a trial which commenced on 12 November, the applicant was found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of his partner, Mario Guzetti (the deceased).  The offence contrary to s18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 took place on 7 April 2007.
2The applicant was sentenced in the Supreme Court by Price J on 28 March 2013.  His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, commencing 26 July 2012 and expiring 25 January 2017.  The head sentence expires on 25 July 2020.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence.  The ground of appeal against conviction is that the conviction was ""unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"".  The ground of appeal against sentence is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
4The matter was heard by the Court on 15 September 2014.  On 25 September 2014 the Court conducted a view of the premises where the offence took place with a particular focus on the stairs, the kitchen and the hallway from the stairs to the front door.
5The matter has had a somewhat chequered history.
20 April 2009 the applicant stood trial in the Supreme Court for murder before Rothman J and a jury.4 May 2009 Rothman J directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder and also a verdict of not guilty to manslaughter (R v Leung (No 3) [2009] NSWSC 450.8 October 2009 this Court upheld the Crown appeal against the directed verdicts in part.  It ordered a new trial on the charge of manslaughter but the acquittal on the charge of murder was affirmed (R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256).1 October 2010 special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was refused.18 April 2011 the applicant stood trial in the Supreme Court for manslaughter before Adams J and a jury.28 April 2011 Adams J directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter (R v Leung [2011] NSWSC 785).20 March 2012 this Court quashed the acquittal and ordered a new trial (R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31).12 November 2012 the applicant stood trial in the Supreme Court for manslaughter before Price J and a jury.28 November 2012 the jury returned a verdict to guilty to manslaughter and the applicant's bail was revoked.28 March 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Price J (R v Leung [2013] NSWSC 259).
Crown case
6On 7 April 2007 the deceased was aged 71 and the applicant was aged 46.  The applicant and the deceased had been in a homosexual domestic relationship for approximately 4 years.  They lived together in a jointly owned terrace house in Alexandria (the premises).  
7About one month before his death, the deceased spoke to a friend, Giovanni Di Francesca about his relationship with the applicant.  He told Mr Di Francesca that the relationship was deteriorating, that he wanted to end it, that the applicant was becoming aggressive and that he was frightened of him.  In the month before he died, the deceased continued to visit the shop of Mr Di Francesca and spoke of problems he was having in his relationship with the applicant.
8Mr Carter was a friend of the applicant and the deceased, having previously been in a relationship with the applicant.  Mr Carter gave evidence that the applicant had become a frustrated and difficult person following an attack upon him, which resulted in him losing his eye about 18 months before the death of the deceased.  He said that while the applicant was very blunt, he had never known him to be violent and that he would walk away to calm down if he lost his temper.  He gave evidence that he spoke to both the applicant and the deceased separately on 6 April 2007 and was told by both men that they had had an argument.  Both confirmed social plans with Mr Carter for all three of them on the weekend and for the three of them to travel together to China on holidays.
9Fiona Cunney and her family lived in the terrace house which shared a common wall with the premises.  Renovations were being carried out in both terraces and Ms Cunney gave evidence of ongoing problems between herself and the applicant due to the renovations.  This included an argument over the applicant's access to his driveway that resulted in the applicant becoming abusive.  The deceased came over to Ms Cunney's house the day after the incident to apologise for the applicant's behaviour and explained that the applicant was having difficulties coping with ageing and losing his eye.  Ms Cunney overheard the applicant shouting on 6 April 2007 at about 2pm but could not hear what was said.  She said that she was concerned about the applicant's behaviour.
10At around 8.15am on 7 April 2007 Ms Cunney heard noises coming from the premises through the common wall.  She described hearing what sounded like a shelf with pots and pans on it, falling, and the lid or lids rolling on the floor.  She then heard what sounded like the deceased singing for about 10 seconds, something he regularly did.  About 10 minutes later she heard the applicant screaming and crying.  This lasted about 10 - 15 minutes and then an ambulance arrived.
11The stairs in her home were similar to those in the premises and Ms Cunney said that her stairs were difficult to negotiate and that she had slipped on the stairs and fallen up and down them many times.
12Guiseppa Di Francesca, Mr Di Francesca's wife, was also a friend of the deceased and the applicant.  At around 9am on 7 April 2007 she telephoned their landline and the applicant answered the phone.  Mrs Di Francesca said ""Hello Phillip it's me"" and the applicant responded by continually crying and would not, or could not, talk.  Mrs Di Francesca contacted her husband and daughter, who were out together, and told them of her concerns following her telephone call with the applicant.  She directed her husband to go past the premises to check on the deceased.
13Following the telephone call from Mrs Di Francesca, Mr Di Francesca and his daughter attended the premises.  Upon arrival, Mr Di Francesca could hear the applicant screaming and could see him through the front door sitting on the stairs, holding the deceased's head wrapped in a pillow.  He yelled for the applicant to open the door, but the applicant did not respond.  He then became aware that the door was open so he entered.  The applicant was screaming hysterically and Mr Di Francesca could not communicate with him, so he ran back to the car and asked his daughter to call an ambulance and waited outside.
14His daughter called triple 0 and was told that a call had already been made and that an ambulance was on the way.  The applicant made a call to triple 0 at 9.12am on 7 April 2007.  He was crying throughout the call and said ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead"" (exhibit K, T.147-148).
15Ambulance Officers Agars and Kaza arrived at 9.24am.  They entered the premises and saw the applicant sitting at the bottom of the stairs with the deceased's head in his lap on a pillow.  Officer Agars said that the applicant was ""cradling the pillow and rocked the patient's head from side to side.  The Asian man was hysterical.  He was wailing loudly"" (T.28.47).
16The ambulance officers had difficulty accessing the deceased because the applicant was hysterical and would not let them near.  They  tried to calm him and he eventually moved and allowed them to treat the deceased, but continued to cry loudly and hysterically, rolling on the floor and trying to get closer to the deceased.  Officer Kaza assessed the deceased.  He had no pulse, his body was cold and the heart machine detected no activity.  The only injury recorded by the ambulance officers was a cross shaped injury to the deceased's chin.  Officer Agars noted that part of a juicer was lying fairly close to where the deceased lay.  
17The police were called to control the applicant and upon attendance, they restrained him so that the ambulance officers could properly treat the deceased.  When the police arrived they observed that the applicant was hysterical, wailing loudly, inconsolable and incapable of communicating.  They said that he seemed to be genuinely distraught, not feigning the hysteria.  Senior Constable Simpkins assisted the ambulance officers with attempts to resuscitate the deceased (T.63.16).  Senior Constable MacInnes decided to treat the scene as a crime scene and to secure the applicant so that he did not contaminate the scene.
18At some stage the applicant appears to have been saying ""Mario, Mario"" and ""wake up Mario, wake up Mario"".  He was physically restrained by Constable Isabel Lawler and Constable Ryal, who each took hold of one of his arms and he was eventually taken outside.  The applicant attempted to break free of Constable Ryal's grip and struggled with the officers.  The applicant was not under arrest at this time but was handcuffed to prevent him hurting himself or others due to his erratic behaviour.  It took more than one officer to physically control the applicant and handcuff him.
19The applicant was placed in a police caged truck and taken to Redfern Police Station.  While in the police truck, Senior Constable Simpkins had the following conversation with the applicant:
""Simpkins said, ""I am going to ask you some questions about what happened.  You do not have to say or do anything unless you wish to.""  Leung said, ""Yes.""  Simpkins said, ""Anything you say or do may be recorded and this recording may be used in court.  Do you understand that?""  Leung said, ""It's too late.  I need my medication.""  Simpkins said, ""What is your medication for?""  Leung said, ""Depression.""  Simpkins said, ""What happened?""  Leung said, ""We had a fight.""  Simpkins said, ""What was the fight about?""  Leung said, ""I want my medication.""  Leung did not say anything further to police."" (T.60.50 - 61.8)
20At Redfern Police Station the Custody Manager arranged for a mental assessment of the applicant due to his presentation.  At around 11.30am, Mr Carter received a call from the Redfern Police advising that the deceased had passed away and that the applicant was at the station and hysterical.  Mr Carter attended Redfern Police Station and was taken to see the applicant.  He was crying hysterically, and insisting that the deceased was not dead.  The applicant told Mr Carter ""We had an argument, we had an argument"" and ""I was making carrot juice with juicer, Mario kept at me"" (T.163.31).  Mr Carter asked the applicant what happened then and the applicant began crying and sobbing even more and said something about the juice, but his responses were unintelligible.
21At around 3.30pm the applicant in the presence of Mr Carter had a conversation with Detective Sergeant Hamill during which the applicant said ""He is not dead.  He is only in hospital"" and ""I didn't kill or murder him"".  Detective Sergeant Hamill informed the applicant that the deceased was dead and asked the applicant to tell him what happened to which the applicant responded ""I don't remember.  We have breakfast.  Mario argue with me.  He criticise me a lot.  Oh Phillip, then my head started spinning but I don't know what happened"" (T.315.36).
22Mr Carter then suggested that the applicant should get some legal advice.  Thereafter the applicant exercised his right to silence and did not participate in any further interviews with the police.
23Dr Stewart, a Police Forensic Medical Officer, examined the applicant at Redfern Police Station and made this observation about his wrist:
""A.  ... I instantly looked at it and thought it looks like a Chinese burn. 
Q.  Chinese burn? A.  One hand screwing the skin one way and the other hand screwing it the other way, and if you do it for long enough you will get an area of discoloration underneath the skin which makes - it's visible, and it's just what it looked like."" (T.206.10)
24She gave evidence that this kind of mark was more easily caused by one person, rather than by two.  She said that she was not told of the extent of the applicant's physical resistance to his removal from the crime scene, or that he was handcuffed while struggling with two officers.  In cross-examination, her evidence was:
""Q.  One person and then during a struggle I want you to assume two people then assisted in cuffing him? A.  I think, I would, from, I find it difficult to believe that one person in the context of an arrest would have done it.  When I saw it I thought it looks as though this has been a mark inflicted in self defence to ward somebody off but not an arresting person.  It did not strike me as that sort of thing."" (T.214.25)
25In relation to the premises, the police witnesses gave evidence of damage to the wall above the doorway in the kitchen.  This consisted of plaster pieces on the ground that appeared to have come from the damaged wall and carrot pulp around the chipped wall.  Detective Griffin, crime scene examiner, took photographs of the deceased and the house.  He observed blood staining on the northern wall and both sides of the door jamb, behind the deceased's head, on the handrail of the staircase and injuries to the deceased's hands.  He also observed a red substance, which he thought to be blood on the metal juicer found near the deceased.  The juicer was taken and forensically tested.
26Evidence was given by a DNA specialist, Ms Franco.  She said that the metal juicer went to the fingerprint section first to be tested.  By the time it came to the DNA section, the red substance which was shown on it in the photographs was no longer present.
""Q.  And in relation to your observation of this particular item when you got it did it have any observable blood on it like is shown in these photographs or did it have some other substance colour on it? A.  It had no obvious or evident red brown or red stains.  The only stains were blue green stains which I assumed were from the fingerprinting process. 
Q.  And do you know whether that affects testing for blood or not? A.  I don't know this particular stain that was used but I have had trouble in the past with the confirmatory test for blood.  So it does affect it."" (T.273.23)
27The deceased's DNA matched the DNA located on the spout of the metal juicer and he could not be excluded as a contributor to DNA on a different part of that juicer.  The applicant's fingerprint was located on the juicer.  Testing did not find any blood on the metal juicer.  The applicant's DNA was not located beneath the deceased's fingernails and the deceased's DNA was not located under the applicant's fingernails.
28Dr Rodriguez, neuropathologist, gave evidence regarding his examination of the brain of the deceased.  He diagnosed a blunt force head injury, which involved bleeding over the surface of the brain, bruising to the front and on the left side of the brain and bleeding and bruising to some internal structures deep within the brain.  Dr Rodriguez was not able to say whether the brain injuries killed the deceased.  He said that these brain injuries would not normally result in death.
29His evidence was:
""Q.  There was a contusion or a laceration on the back of the head that was noted by Dr Botterill and there was bruising under that laceration, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there will be bruising in that area of the brain, does it? A.  No, it does not.  Actually it is more common in that situation if there's a, a bruise or a laceration at the back of the skull from somebody falling over backwards you are more likely to see the bruising to the brain at the front of the brain where the brain comes into contact with the rough part of the skull.""
...
A.  Well, I use the term blunt force injury to distinguish it as you said from a sharp force injury such as due to a gunshot wound or being stabbed with a knife or a pair of scissors or something like that."" (T.289.25)
30Dr Rodriguez said:
""Q.  Can you explain to the jury what a contrecoup injury is? A.  Okay.  A contrecoup is if you have a blow to one part of the skull, the injury is on the contrary side.  So if you have a blow to the back of the skull the injury is to the front of the brain."" (T.295.41)
31Dr Paul Botterill, Forensic Pathologist, conducted the autopsy on the deceased and gave evidence in the Crown case.  He gave evidence that because the cause of death was not clear, the brain was looked at by a neuropathologist, Dr Rodriguez.
32Dr Botterill's evidence, as a result of the autopsy was:
""In plain terms autopsy findings included tears over the skin of the right side of the chin, tears, grazes and bruises over the skin of the right side of the floor of the mouth, that is the tissue underneath the chin, with multiple skin tears and bruises over the front of the neck and the upper front of the chest, bruising beneath the skin at the back of both sides of the head, a tear of the lining of the inside of the mouth near the right lower lip, some blood over the brain surface, bruises to the left back and hip region and multiple bruises under the skin of the right arm, left forearm, right wrist and knuckles of both hands.  ...
Further investigations were performed.  Brain examination showed changes of blunt force head injury, with brain surface and deeper bleeding and bruising ... 
As at the time of the autopsy, the cause of death was most probably the consequences of head and neck injury.  Although any of the individual injuries might be associated with a simple fall, the extent of distribution of the injuries is more in keeping with multiple blunt force contact.  It is possible that the neck bruising and chest injuries are related to application of force to the neck but no discrete ligature mark or eyeball haemorrhages were identified."" (T.225.29 - 226.6)
33Dr Botterill was able to inspect the premises.  Having done so, he did not believe it was possible for the deceased to have fallen down the stairs and be in the position where he was found.  Dr Botterill said:
""Now, in relation to a fall, from your findings, from the lower, from the landing falling down six steps to the injuries that you saw, are they consistent with falling down those lower six steps? A.  No.  Well, in my opinion, no.  I think the extent of the injuries, the front of the chest, the neck and over the head would not be occasioned by a simple fall down that number of steps.  I'm, I can't recall a case where I have ever seen that extent of injury in that distribution over a fall downstairs. 
Q.  What about a fall from the top of the stairs?  That would be a most complex fall because it would require a person to come down and then turn around and then go down the bottom six steps, would it not?
A.  Yes.  Again I can't recall in any case I have had any association with anybody having a fall of that complexity.  Nor for that matter in discussions with my colleagues can any of us recall a case where that could occur.  Although there is always a theoretical possibility that somebody perhaps who was having a seizure may by a movement of the limb somehow be able to change direction but I think it is extremely unlikely.""  (T.227.40 - 228.6)
Q.  In relation to a possible fall down the stairs we have talked about that early in your evidence but the number of injuries that you observed on this deceased is that consistent with a fall down the stairs or not?A.  It is conceivable but very unlikely that those injuries would all be explained by a fall down the stairs.
Q.  In relation to the injury to the chin you may well be asked whether that is consistent with hitting one of the bollards on the stairs, one of the rounded bollards on the stairs. Would that be likely to cause this complex injury to the chin?A.  It is a possible explanation partly because of the curvature and the location it is still possible even hitting something such as a rounded object such as that may result in a tear such as that.
Q.  Is it likely?A.  It is possible.  I can't more specific than that. (T.251.22)
...
Q.  Doing post mortems have you ever seen such a collection or constellation of injuries resulting from a fall downstairs?A.  No."" (T.252.22)
34In relation to the wound to the chin, Dr Botterill said:
""Q.  ... What I want to ask you doctor, the wound that you saw to this man's chin, is that consistent with being struck by the spout of this juicer? A.  Yes.  There's, the features of the wound to the chin are not specific enough to enable me to say it must necessarily have been that but that is a possible explanation.
Q.  It is a complex wound you would describe it as, would you not? A.  Yes, yes. 
Q.  And would you agree that the wound itself may have been the result of one or more than one blow to the same area? A.  Yes. 
Q.  There is also damage to the area behind that bruising, that is the mouth of the deceased that you noted? A.  On the inside of the mouth cavity, yes.
Q.  Would that be occasioned by force being applied by say this juicer to the outside and that causing injury or damage to the inside of the mouth?A.  That is certainly possible yes.""  (T.226.33)
35Dr Botterill identified a total of 16 specific injuries which he numbered and described (T.229-237).  After reviewing and describing the first 8 injuries, Dr Botterill said:
""Now, in relation to those injuries doctor, can you indicate whether they were consistent firstly with a fall down stairs? A.  Any individual one of those marks could be from a contact that might occur in a fall.  But it would be an extraordinary fall to result in that full distribution of injuries just in that group let alone amongst all the other injuries that were there. 
Q.  And considering that the deceased was wearing clothing what do you say in relation to the possibility of those injuries being caused by being struck with a metal component of irregular shape such as this juicer bowl? A.  That would be another explanation for them, yes.
Q. (Exhibit D shown).  In relation to the juicer bowl, please look at that, particularly in those injuries you have just been referring to as depicted in photo 27, is there any part of that metal implement that you have before you that is called a juicer bowl, anything from there that could have caused those injuries?A.  Practically any of the surfaces here may have been responsible for some of those injuries.  Even though they appear as though they are lines, it doesn't follow that there must be something straight projecting to result in an injury, a blunt force.  A contact with a blunt area on here may also result in what appears to be a straight or slightly curved area.  So many areas over here could be responsible, or could result in that sort of injury.  
Q.  If that as you are holding it now by the spout, if that were used as a handle and the deceased was struck with that implement on any side, would that be consistent with causing injuries like we've seen in photograph 27?""A.  Yes."" (T.233.36 - 234.13)
36Dr Botterill considered that the bruising to the deceased's neck may have been caused by strangulation.  On that issue, he said:
""Q.  Stopping you there doctor, if indeed the deceased was lying on the ground and the accused is strangling him, would that be consistent with the bruising that you have seen on the neck?A.  Certainly that would be an explanation for it.  It's certainly not the only possible explanation but yes, it would be an explanation for the bruising."" (T.238.37)
37That opinion was, however, significantly qualified:
""Q.  Obviously bruising on the neck is indicative of either strangulation by hands, for example, or a ligature of some type, is that right? A.  They're two possible explanations.  You can also get bruising from blunt force contact, not necessarily with fingers but with other structures.  You could also, of course, get bleeding from relatively minor trauma, particularly if somebody were on a blood thinning medication or had some particular pre disposition to bleeding easily, but, yes, strangulation is one of the possible explanations for bruising into the tissues."" (T.239.32)
38In relation to bruising over a broad area of the front and both sides of the neck and over the front of the chest, Dr Botterill said:
""Q.  If indeed this metal juicer bowl was used to strike the deceased in that area, that is the area of the chin again and also the neck, could that cause such bruising? A.  Yes."" (T.239.48)
39In relation to bruising of the brain, Dr Botterill said:
""Q.  What causes bruising in the brain? A.  Again some form of transmission of force against the brain surface, so the brain either bumping against the inside of the skull, so bumping against the inside of the skull. 
... 
Q.  In relation to these areas of haemorrhage, bruising of the brain, they were all caused by blunt force injury, are they not? A.  It's just the usual explanation.  Usually blunt force causes the brain to be moved and it's that twisting movement inside the skull that results in these sorts of changes.
Q.  Could a blow to the area of the chin with a hard object, such as this juicer bowl, could that have caused the brain to be bruised as you've just described? A.  Yes, it's possible.  It's true that most people who have an injury such as that will not get significant brain injury but, yes, it's certainly possible. 
Q.  But a fall on to the back of the head, could that be likely to cause the injuries that you've described? A.  Yes.""  (T.242.3 and T.242.49)
40Dr Botterill concluded that there was nothing to suggest that a heart attack or other abnormality of the heart itself played any part in the deceased's death.  On that issue, Dr Botterill was asked questions in relation to the opinions of Professor Hilton and Professor Duflou, who gave evidence in the applicant's case.
""I don't particularly disagree with much of the detail in Professor Hilton's report except he has more concern about the possibility of the heart being an alternative explanation for the death. Again I do not agree with that opinion but I respect the fact it is not an unreasonable suggestion to be made.  Again I can't really say too much more about Professor Hilton's report in that respect of.
With Professor Duflou's report I think the main difference between our views is that he does not appear to have the same concern about the extent of the bruising over the neck that I have.   Nevertheless my view is that, although I can't say with certainty those bruises were necessarily strangulation, some form of blunt force contact has occurred and in my opinion it is most likely that whatever that blunt force contact was, particularly in combination with the injury to the head, is a more likely explanation for why he died."" (T.248.25)
41In cross-examination Dr Botterill was asked to explain the somewhat counter intuitive proposition that bleeding might not immediately follow a heavy blow to the body.  
""Q.  But again sometimes wounds do not accord with commonsense, you don't bleed instantaneously do you, only in rare cases?A.  Well it does depend on where the injury is located but with many lacerated wounds the bleeding may not be instantaneous, that is true.
Q.  The mere contact does not result automatically in blood flow does it out of the body?A.  Again it does depend on the circumstances but, correct, you won't necessarily get immediate release of blood at the time of contact, no.""  (T.255.42)
42Dr Botterill was asked questions concerning difficulties in estimating when bruising took place.  
""Q.  As they start to become yellowish that is a guide that even that is not a firm tool in aging a bruise is it?A.  It is about as firm as we have.  It is true that the yellowish discolouration is because of the chemical breakdown of the red cells by a particular process we know takes at least 18 hours, probably about 24 to occur, but as with one of the injuries here you cannot exclude there is more than one time of bleeding in any particular site and there is no test available to enable you to state that.
Q.  It is one of those areas where old fashioned observation is about as good a guide as any?A.  In my opinion yes.
Q.  Well in terms of the length of time that a bruise can still be exhibited on your body they can last over a week sometimes, even longer?A.  Yes.  Usually if they last more than that first day or they are visible for more than the first day they will undergo some change as they fade so they will develop a yellowish or brownish discolouration then fade but certainly with a deep bruise it can still be there a week later for sure.
Q.  What is the outside age of the bruising in the chest and neck area?A.  Again I can't really say beyond about either at the time of death up to about a day before."" (T.258.14)
43Dr Botterill was asked questions about the bruising of the chest:
""Q.  The bruising on the chest if you are a lay person and you are indulging in a frenzied attempt to resuscitate someone by shaking them and pressing hard on their chest does that [deliver] bruising?A.  Yes it can.  The location is not typical for resuscitation but if one were placing the fingers and hands up in the high chest on the neck, yes, that could be an explanation for bruising.
Q.  Particularly if you don't know what you are doing?A.  It is misguided but yes it is possible."" (T.259.39)
44Dr Botterill was cross-examined as to the cause of death:
""Q.  Well did that kill the deceased, the blow to the head?A.  Again I can't say with certainty that it did.  I can say it certainly is potentially fatal but I can't give you the assurance that it was that alone and not necessarily in conjunction with the neck injury. (T.259.5)
...
Q.  Certainly?A.  I admit I cannot say with [certainty] whether it is the head injury alone, the neck injury alone or combination of both, just I believe it is most likely to be a combination of both.  I cannot point to any other additional feature to help in that delineation."" (T.262.6)
45In summary, the Crown case was that on the morning of 7 April 2007 an argument took place between the deceased and the applicant which escalated to such an extent that the applicant struck the deceased to the chin and at other locations with the metal juicer which caused the deceased to fall and hit his head and that the applicant also strangled, or attempted to strangle him, and that these acts caused his death.
Defence case
46The applicant did not give evidence.
47The case for the applicant was that the Crown could not exclude the possibility of a variety of causes of death and could not establish that any act or acts of his caused the death of the deceased.
48There was evidence that the applicant was a person of good character with no criminal convictions.  There was evidence that the applicant was in a loving and caring relationship with the deceased.  While Messrs Carter and Di Francesca gave evidence that the applicant and the deceased argued like most couples, both said that these arguments were verbal and that the deceased had never told of any physical violence between them.
49Ronald Johnson was a long term friend who gave evidence in the applicant's case.  His evidence was that he himself was in a long term homosexual relationship and that he had close personal dealings with the applicant and the deceased and that they seemed happy together and were a ""normal gay couple"".  He had never observed the applicant to be violent.
50Mr Veness was a licensed builder who carried out an inspection of the stairs in the home.  He found that the rise and tread of the stairs did not comply with current building codes.  He said that he had difficulty coming down the stairs and had to be careful not to overstep and miss the tread.  Based on my observations when a view of the premises took place, I would agree that the treads are very narrow and that one has to take particular care when descending the stairs so as not to fall.  
51Two expert witnesses were called in the defence case.  Their evidence can be summarised as follows.
52Professor Johan Duflou was a forensic pathologist.  He had not been to the premises.  There was no issue that he, like Dr Botterill and Professor Hilton, was very experienced in his field and at the time that he gave evidence was a director of the Forensic Medicine Clinic which is commonly known as the Sydney Morgue.  He explained that in about five to ten percent of cases, forensic pathologists might not be able to determine a definite cause of death.
53Professor Duflou rejected the proposition that the deceased had died as a result of his heart condition.  
""Q.  He had an enlarged heart, he had a 50 per cent blockage in one of the arteries and I think 25 in the other two? A.  Yes, that's correct. 
Q.  That of itself is not going to kill him, is it? A.  I don't believe it does.  As I said earlier, if the pathologist is honest with himself in terms of seeing that level of heart disease, I think that it is a normal degree of heart disease for a person of that age.  Arguably a number of us in this room could have that extent of heart disease.  I don't think it would be reasonable to say that death was as a result of that heart disease.  Now, there are always exceptions in this, but to me that extent of heart disease I would not class as severe, although there was some disease present."" (T.346.8)
54Professor Duflou gave evidence concerning the juicer found near the deceased:
""Q.  In terms of the juicer that you have read about, would you expect that if that implement had struck the deceased man at least once in the chin occasioning the laceration that you have observed, once on the back of the head, perhaps a couple of times in the chest and blood obviously flowing, would you expect to have blood on this implement? A.  Yes, I would.  The first blow which causes a breakage of the skin need not necessarily have blood on it. 
Q.  Can I just ask you to pause there, professor.  Again lay people generally expect that if you belt somebody hard with some implement and they bleed that the blood is going to flow instantaneously, but that doesn't necessarily follow, does it? A.  No.  It's something that you would imagine instinctively would be the case.  I don't know if it has been your personal experience potentially, but you certainly can sustain an injury and it initially doesn't bleed and then after a few seconds   oh, there's blood there.  That certainly does happen in real life and very frequently the initial   the object which causes the initial impact does not have blood on it but it is subsequent impacts which get the blood on it. 
Q.  And if that implement was used to strike the deceased up to three, maybe four times, it would be highly irregular not to have blood on the implement? A.  Well, I think it's fair to say if bleeding had commenced and the blows were sustained in the area where there was now blood that I would really think there would be blood on it, yes."" (T.346.21)
55Professor Duflou said that a fall from one's own height, especially if a person fell backwards, was potentially very dangerous and could be lethal.  He identified that type of head injury as a contrecoup injury.  He said:
""... The exact mechanism is open to some debate, but essentially from purely falling backwards on to the back of your head you can die.  It's a relatively uncommon outcome but it's certainly one that's in the standard experience of any forensic pathologist who does autopsies, even on an irregular basis.  It's one of those things that you see and that you know about, and I have certainly seen them and a fair number of them over the years."" (T.347.1)
56Professor Duflou was of the opinion that the injury to the deceased's chin could have been caused by coming into contact with one of the bollards on the stair.  He said:
""A.  It could.  Looking at the bollard it's relatively featureless, it's round, it has no sharp surfaces, but certainly striking a rounded surface hard enough can cause a laceration like that."" (T.347.45)
57Professor Duflou was not able to say whether the deceased was standing up when he sustained the injury to his jaw.  He was not able to say whether the deceased was standing up when he was hit or came in contact with something on the back of his head.  He was not able to say whether the impact to the chin took place before the impact to the skull at the back.  In relation to the possibility of unskilled attempts at resuscitation causing bruising to the deceased's chest, he said:
""Q.  Did you see any indicators of misguided resuscitation, that is, very small bruises in the incorrect part of the chest area that we know should be applied? A.  Well, there were grazes and bruises in that area.  Their mechanism, or what the purpose of those bruises is, I don't know.  It could be the result of  being struck in that area, it could be the result of being scratched or whatever in that area, possibly the clothing pulled, I don't know.  It could be an attempt at resuscitation, certainly not expert by any stretch of the imagination.  I don't know."" (T.349.47)
58In relation to the cause of the deceased's death, Professor Duflou said:
""Q.  Can you help us with the cause of death?  What is the [cause] of death? A.  In my view at a fairly simple level I believe the cause of death is most likely a head injury.  There's brain damage.  There has obviously been impact with the head in some way or other and there has been a couple of impacts to the head.  I must say I personally would not have considered a neck compression in this case as being contributory and I don't think the heart disease was contributory in terms of causing death.  So my personal view would have been that a head injury is the cause of death.  In terms of the nature of the head injury, it's a blunt force type injury of a diffuse nature.  How that was caused, I don't know."" (T.350.30)
59Under cross-examination Professor Duflou gave evidence as to the possible mechanism of the deceased's death.  
""Q.  You referred earlier to contrecoup type injuries.  There is bruising to the front of the brain, is there not? A.  Yes, there is some bruising to the front of the brain, yes, definitely. 
Q.  Not extensive but some bruising? A.  Yes, correct. 
Q.  That is consistent, is it not, with the brain moving forward similar to a contrecoup injury and striking the front of the skull and causing that bruising? A.  Yes.
Q.  So a scenario that the deceased was struck in the chin area by the juicer, that he fell back and hit the floor and perhaps a wall causing injury to the front of his brain is consistent with that, is it not? A.  That is a possibility, yes.  Certainly I don't think I have ever moved away from that."" (T.356.35)
60He gave this evidence in relation to the shape of some of the bruises to the deceased's chest:
""Q.  ... Now, you see they are varying degrees of darkness but they are basically curved lacerations are they not? A.  I don't think they were described as lacerations.  They were abrasions mainly. 
Q.  Oh sorry, bruises? A.  Yes. 
Q.  But they are curved, are they not? A.  Some are.  Some are not, but some are. 
Q.  Would they be consistent with being caused by this metal juicer bowl?A.  It is possible that some of the edges of that juicer bowl could cause that, yes."" (T.357.36)
61Professor Duflou did not consider that the deceased's injuries were caused by him falling down the stairs.
""Q.  In terms of falling down a set of stairs doctor, those injuries don't appear to be consistent with that, do they? A.  Probably not.  It would be difficult to try and attribute it to something specific causing that.  After saying that, you can get unusual injuries from tumbling down the stairs but I'd agree that likely not.
Q.  And you would agree that certainly in relation to a possible fall from the top of the stairs that that is unlikely, is it not? A.  I would think that it's unlikely that the deceased fell down one flight of stairs and then turned around and a second flight, given the injuries that are seen externally.  It can certainly happen that a person falls down two flights.  That's unusual, but I would expect more injury I would think.
Q.  Yes.  Perhaps more bruising to the legs or arms or those areas that would come into contact with the hard object? A.  Yes."" (T.358.4)
62In relation to whether attempts at resuscitation caused chest bruising, Professor Duflou said:
""Q.  But these cuts above don't appear to be anything in your experience anything like attempts, good or bad, about resuscitation? A.  They are not cuts, I emphasise again. 
Q.  A breaking of the skin? A.  Grazes, yes.  This is not expert resuscitation, by no stretch of the imagination is that what you see in, you know, any competent resuscitation at all. 
Q.  No.  And it is more consistent, is it not, with being struck by a juicer, exhibit D? A.  That may very well be the cause, yes."" (T.362.5)
63Professor Duflou thought that it was most unlikely that the deceased had been strangled.
64Professor Hilton was also a forensic pathologist.  He also had worked at the Division of Forensic Medicine, connected with the Coroner's court and had performed many post mortems.  He did not visit the premises.
65Professor Hilton gave evidence that the deceased's cause of death was unclear.
""Q.  If we could just go then immediately to this case at hand.  On the material that you have been given and you have heard and you have read, what caused the death of Mr Guzzetti in this case? A.  Well, to me the actual cause of death here is unclear.  Dr Botterill who performed the autopsy gave as his opinion that the cause of death was a combination of blunt head injury and I think neck injury.  He couldn't quite properly in my opinion distinguish between which of these groups of injuries was more likely than the other, if indeed there was one more likely than the other, to have caused the death.  And I think the, I think that his reticence if you like was entirely justified.
Q.  Did you see, and I think you have used this phrase in the past concerning this case, did you see any stigmata of strangulation? A.  Well, there was some bruising to the neck.  Now, excluding that or putting that to one side, the other things one usually sees or often sees in cases of manual or ligature strangulation just were not present.  There is very often little pinpoint haemorrhages in, on and around the eyes, on the cheeks.  There was no evidence of that whatsoever.  
There is not infrequently damage to the cartilage that go to make up the Adams apple, particularly if the subject is an older person.  There was no evidence of any damage to these cartilages.  
Sometimes one sees a break in a little horseshoe shaped bone that sits above the larynx underneath the jaw called the hyoid bone.  Again, there was no evidence of any damage or fracturing to that bone.
Q.  As a result do you think that a cause of death was strangulation or attempted strangulation? A.  I think the cause of death here is obscure."" (T.376.46 - 377.25)
66Professor Hilton did not think the brain injury was sufficient to cause death:
""A.  Well, no.  The, the, there were injuries to the brain but the most likely mechanism by which brain injury kills, apart from things like gunshot wounds and what not, is swelling of the brain in response to injury and the swelling then progresses to compress the vital centres of the brain and the brain stops functioning.  This was not present here.  There was no evidence of brain swelling anything like approaching the expected fatal level."" (T.378.18)
67In relation to a fall down the stairs, Professor Hilton said:
""Q.  In terms of the staircase itself, if the head impacted with the solid timber structures of the staircase or on a wall, could that cause the injuries to the head? A.  Yes.  The, it's a nonspecific phenomenon that could be induced by something hitting the head, the head hitting something, the person falling over.  It is not uncommon, it is not an uncommon mechanism of death when someone falls over backwards and bangs the back of the head, for instance. 
Q.  And so the members of the jury understand, you don't have to fall from great heights.  You can unfortunately die just falling backwards or forwards I suppose, from your own height? A.  Well, usually backwards from your own height, yes.""  (T.378.36)
68Professor Hilton was not able to exclude a heart attack as being the cause of death.
""Q.  Can we tell whether the deceased man had a heart attack before a fall or didn't have a heart attack at all in this case? A.  No, we can't.  There was no physical evidence visible either by the naked eye or by microscopy of tissue changes associated with a heart attack.  However, where death occurs with rapidity or extreme rapidity or with sudden death you can well have a state where there is absolutely no visible evidence and in fact there is no biochemical evidence, either."" (T.379.35)
69In relation to the bruising to the chest and neck, Professor Hilton rejected strangulation as a cause but thought there could have been other causes:
""Q.  In relation to the injuries to that area, given the severity of the bruising that you see, are you able to say with any certainty that that may have been caused either in the act of attempted strangulation or by striking the deceased with this juicer component? A.  I don't think it's at all likely to have been induced by an act of attempted strangulation.  The bruising is nonspecific in the sense that it could have been produced by a flattish object such as the juicer, yes, but I would not support the proposition it was associated with attempts at manual strangulation.
Q.  Would the marks on the chest be suggestive of there being a struggle  A.  Yes. 
Q.    between the protagonists? A.  Yes. 
Q.  Professor, would you say it's highly unlikely that those marks and bruises were caused by a fall, given the number and complexity of them? A.  A simple fall, I think unless it was against some object I would be - I would not support the simple fall as causing this entire complex of bruising.
Q.  Because in terms of the actual wounds themselves, they were counted to be, I think, nine in number by Dr Botterill.  Do you accept that? A.  There were nine marks which may correspond to individual bruises   sorry, I take that back, which may correspond to individual blows. 
Q.  And in relation to those injuries, that is, the injuries to the neck and the injuries to the chest that you refer to, would you be prepared to say, professor, that they are inconsistent with a fall? A.  I would not go so far as to say they were absolutely inconsistent with a fall.
Q.  Well, in relation to the injuries to the chest, given the number of them, and you have just given this evidence, they are not consistent with a simple fall, are they? A.  No, unless it was on to a complex surface."" (T.387.48 - T.388.31)
70A further relevant consideration is the direction made by Price J during his summing up as follows:
""The evidence in this trial does not enable you to draw an inference that the staining seen by Detective Griffin on the juicer was blood, let alone human blood.  Please remember that in a criminal trial that suspicion or irrational guess is not enough to reach that conclusion.  It is my firm direction of law that you must not conclude that the staining on the juicer was human blood and more particularly, the blood of Mr Guzetti."" (SU 31.9)
Neither side challenged the correctness of that direction in the appeal.
Submissions and consideration
71The function of this Court in a conviction appeal was explained by the majority (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 where their Honours said:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal
11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
...
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""
...
20 The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal exposes a fundamental problem with its approach to its task. The Court concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence. ...
21 To determine satisfactorily the applicant's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged.""
72The applicant submitted that having regard to the uncertainty of the evidence of the four forensic experts regarding what might have caused the death of the deceased, the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  The applicant submitted that the Crown was not able to put to the jury a rational and compelling case as to how the deceased was intentionally harmed by the applicant resulting in his death.
73The applicant submitted that the issue to be decided in the appeal was not whether there was evidence upon which he could have been convicted, but whether or not the evidence had sufficient cogency or probative force such that the jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt.  The applicant submitted that the crucial question was whether the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act or acts on his part that caused Mr Guzetti's death.  The applicant submitted that it was not open to the jury to be so satisfied because of the medical evidence.
74He submitted that the medical evidence was at best equivocal as to the cause of death.  Dr Botterill could not say with certainty what killed the deceased but thought it was most likely a combination of the head and neck injuries.  Dr Rodriguez was able to say that there was evidence of blunt force head injury and there was a small amount of haemorrhage and bruising at the front of the brain.  He was not able to say with certainty that it was the brain injury which had killed the deceased.  Professor Duflou's opinion was that the head injury was the cause of death but he was not able to describe the mechanism.  Professor Hilton was not prepared to say what was the cause of death but could not rule out a heart attack.  Both Professors Duflou and Hilton rejected strangulation or attempted strangulation as a cause of death.  The applicant submitted that with the medical evidence in that state, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had caused the deceased's death.
75The applicant submitted that an important element of the Crown case was that he had used the part of the juicer which was found near the deceased as a weapon against the deceased.  He submitted that in those circumstances, one would have expected there to be quantities of the deceased's blood on the juicer.  He noted that in this case, there was no evidence of human blood on that part of the juicer and in particular, there was no evidence of the deceased's blood on the juicer.  He submitted that this fact, which was highlighted by the trial judge, constituted an important gap in the Crown case.
76The applicant submitted that by reference to every aspect of the Crown case, there was an explanation consistent with his innocence.  The blood smear on the lower part of the balustrade was according to Professor Duflou consistent with part of the deceased's upper torso coming in contact with it.  He submitted that the blood spatter on both sides of the door jamb and on the wall beyond it was equally consistent with a fall as not.  In that regard, he noted that there was no expert evidence as to the origin of that blood spatter.  The applicant submitted that there was no certainty as to the final resting place of the deceased's body, given that it had clearly been moved so as to enable a pillow to be placed under the head.  He submitted that a fall down the stairs could have occurred whilst the deceased was ascending the stairs or descending the stairs.
77The applicant submitted that the bruising and injuries observed on the neck and upper chest could be explained by inexpert, vigorous attempts to resuscitate the deceased.  The applicant submitted that there was a further difficulty in relation to the bruising to the neck and chest in that the date when the bruises were incurred could not be established with any certainty.  He submitted that the evidence was that the bruising could have occurred at any time within 24 hours of the deceased's death.  He submitted that although the deceased's DNA was found on the juicer, his was not, and it could not be ascertained from what part of the body the deceased's DNA had come, or how it had come to be present on the juicer.
78The applicant submitted that the evidence of Ms Cunney was unreliable and had been shown to be so at trial.  The unreliability emerged from the changes in her testimony, between the first trial and this trial.  The applicant submitted that her evidence on earlier occasions referred to the deceased singing and made no mention of ""crying out"".  The applicant also submitted that it was common ground that his relationship with her was not particularly good. 
79He submitted that the statements which he made to police and others to the effect that ""we had a fight"" were equivocal and were equally consistent with a verbal argument as with a physical confrontation.  
80While it is true that the defence could point to an explanation consistent with innocence in respect of each circumstance relied upon by the Crown, that does not mean that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt.  The Crown case was a circumstantial one.  It relied upon a number of circumstances to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference from the evidence was that the applicant, by a dangerous and unlawful act, caused the death of the deceased.
81It follows that each piece of evidence in the Crown case should not be looked at in isolation.  Rather, the total effect of the evidence relied upon by the Crown needs to be considered.
82The Crown case was that the applicant lost his temper with the deceased during a verbal disagreement and hit him with a metallic juicer bowl several times causing him to fall over, hit his head, receive brain damage and die.  The Crown submitted that the applicant hit him in the chest with the juicer.  As to whether the applicant also tried to strangle the deceased was not a necessary part of the Crown case.  The deceased had a laceration on his chin, and it was the Crown case that the applicant had struck him more than once in that area causing a more complex wound and blood to spatter behind him.  The deceased's injuries were set out in the series of photographs in exhibit M and in the diagram drawn by Dr Botterill (exhibit N).
83It was necessary that the Crown case exclude the possibility that the deceased fell down the stairs.  Unless the Crown did so, there was always a scenario consistent with innocence which could explain the deceased's death without intervention on the part of the applicant.  
84In my opinion, the evidence did exclude falling down the stairs (whether the deceased was ascending or descending) as a cause of his death.  Dr Rodriguez did not express an opinion.  Professor Hilton was doubtful but was not prepared to exclude the possibility.  Dr Botterill and Professor Duflou were definite that a fall down the stairs, be it from the intermediate landing or from the top, was unlikely.  Dr Botterill was of the opinion that such a fall could not explain the distribution of injuries on the deceased (see [33] hereof).  Professor Duflou gave evidence to similar effect (see [61] hereof).
85The applicant sought to meet that issue by adducing evidence that the bruising to the upper chest and neck could have been produced by inexpert attempts at resuscitation (see [43] and [62] hereof).  That explanation for the bruising is not borne out by the evidence.  The only persons identified as attempting resuscitation were one of the ambulance officers and Senior Constable Simpkins.  Both were experienced in that procedure and there was no suggestion that either one of them carried it out incorrectly.  The evidence of Dr Botterill and Professor Duflou on this subject makes it clear that if the bruising to the chest and neck was caused as a result of inexpert attempts at resuscitation, those attempts were very inexpert indeed.  I accept that this defence theory is quite inconsistent with the expected expertise of an ambulance officer and the apparent expertise of Constable Simpkins (T.63.29).
86The only evidence on the subject of what injuries one would have expected to have seen had the deceased fallen down the stairs, came from Professor Duflou when he agreed that had a fall down the stairs occurred, there would have been more bruising to the legs or arms and those parts of the body that would come into contact with a hard object (T.358.17).
87Once the Crown excluded a fall down the stairs as a cause of the deceased's death the persuasive force of the Crown's circumstantial case became much greater.  It matters not that the precise mechanism of the cause of death cannot be identified if there was general agreement (except for Professor Hilton) that a blow to the head was the likely cause.  This is the effect of the opinions of Dr Botterill, Professor Duflou and Dr Rodriguez.  That being so, it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that some application of force, other than a fall down the stairs, caused the deceased to fall (probably backwards) so as to bring about the head and brain injury.
88While there may be some difficulties with the evidence of Ms Cunney, its essential effect is borne out by other evidence.  The effect of her evidence was that she heard a noise, like a shelf with pots and pans falling, and then the deceased singing and then about ten minutes later, she heard the applicant screaming and crying.  When police arrived at the premises, they found the chipped plaster and part of the juicer consistent with it being thrown against the kitchen wall at some earlier point in time.  The piece of the juicer found near the deceased's body is consistent with that scenario.
89There are also the statements by the applicant when making the triple 0 call, when inside the caged vehicle and at the police station.  In the triple 0 call, the applicant was crying and said ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead"".  When placed in the caged vehicle and asked what happened, the applicant said ""we had a fight"".  At the police station the applicant told Mr Carter ""we had an argument, we had an argument - I was making carrot juice with juicer, Mario kept at me"".  Later at the police station, he told Detective Sergeant Hamill ""I don't remember.  We have breakfast.  Mario argue with me.  He criticise me a lot.  Oh Phillip, then my head started spinning but I don't know what happened"".
90What is clear from those statements is that at the very least, the deceased and the applicant had a verbal argument before the deceased's death.  An important issue for the jury was whether that verbal argument had escalated into a physical dispute.  Having carefully examined the medical evidence, in particular the location of bruising, grazes and cuts, and having excluded a fall down the stairs, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the verbal dispute escalated into a physical dispute.  That is certainly consistent with what the applicant said in his triple 0 call and in the caged vehicle.
91As the Crown submitted in the appeal, Dr Botterill identified 16 different injuries in his evidence.  Each injury was identified by reference to a photograph, or to a diagram prepared by him.  Of those 16 injuries, 14 were capable of having been caused at or about the time of the deceased's death.  Photograph 3 in exhibit M shows injuries 1 - 6.  The undisputed evidence of Dr Botterill was that these 6 injuries were capable of having been caused by the juicer.  Injury 7 (photograph 23 in exhibit M) was a graze to the back of the head.  This was consistent with the deceased falling backwards and striking either the floor or the wall with the back of his head.
92Injury 8, which was depicted in photographs 27, 28 and 29 of exhibit M, shows the injuries to the chest in the form of cuts and abrasions which all the experts said were consistent with being hit by the juicer.
93Injuries 9 and 10 were not shown in photographs but on the diagram prepared by Dr Botterill and comprised swelling and bruising to the back of the torso on the left side.  Injury 11 is a graze on the back of the arm, shown in photograph 12 in exhibit M.  Injury 12 comprised bruising on the back of the knuckles, shown in photograph 4.  Injuries 13 and 14 shown in photograph 5 comprised grazes on the back of the hand.  While it was common ground that injuries 15 and 16 could not relate to anything which occurred on 7 April, deep bruising was shown at four locations (AD1-AD4) on the diagram - three on the back of the right arm and one at the elbow level of the left arm.
94When one has regard not just to the brain and head injury, but all of the injuries capable of being attributed to 7 April, the force of the conclusions of Professor Duflou and Dr Botterill that a fall down the stairs could not have brought about these injuries is apparent.  The extent and location of these injuries is fully consistent with the Crown case of an assault by the applicant on the deceased with the juicer causing the deceased to fall backwards and hit his head.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the extent and location of those injuries with a fall down the stairs or a fall backwards.  Something more must have happened to have caused the full range of injuries.  The Crown scenario of an assault by the applicant on the deceased is not only a reasonable surmise, it is on the evidence the only reasonable explanation.
95As well as the matters to which I have referred, there are other considerations on which the Crown relied.  Some of these are included in the ""seventeen circumstances"" identified by the Crown at trial.  While not all of these ""circumstances"" are of equal weight or particularly convincing, their total effect is persuasive.
96By way of background, although the relationship between the applicant and the deceased was generally good as the evidence of their friends suggested, there was clear evidence of a deterioration in the relationship not long before the deceased's death.  The noises heard by Ms Cunney, the broken juicer and the damage to plaster in the kitchen, together with the applicant's admissions of there having been a ""fight"", make it clear that at the very least an argument took place on the morning of 7 April at about the time of the deceased's death.  The delay between the deceased's death and the applicant making the triple 0 call, remains unexplained.  While there was no expert evidence directed to the blood spatter, its presence on either side of the doorway and on the wall beyond the doorway, does not appear to be consistent with a fall down the stairs having occurred.
97In the course of reaching my conclusion, I have had to consider three significant challenges to the Crown case.  The first is that no blood was found on the juicer.  The overwhelming evidence was to the effect that had the juicer been used in the way postulated by the Crown, there should have been blood upon it.  
98The explanation for why no blood was found when Ms Franco carried out her tests, can be seen in her evidence at T.273 (see [26] hereof).  By the time she came to examine the juicer, the red substance which other persons had seen on it had disappeared and had been replaced with blue-green stains which she surmised came from the fingerprinting process.  She said that in her experience the fingerprinting stain can cause difficulty when tests for the presence of blood are carried out.
99That provides an adequate explanation for why there was no blood found on the juicer.  In that regard, it needs to be kept in mind that the juicer was found next to the deceased's body and there was evidence from Professors Duflou and Hilton and Dr Botterill that the injuries suffered by the deceased, in particular the complex injury to the chin, could have been caused by the juicer found near the body.  There was also, of course, the presence of the deceased's DNA on the juicer and a fingerprint of the applicant. 
100The defence challenged Dr Botterill's strangulation theory, i.e. that the applicant either strangled the deceased or attempted to do so.  Dr Botterill himself had doubts about the theory and pointed out inconsistencies with it.  Both Professors Duflou and Hilton rejected the theory and gave compelling reasons for their conclusions.  It follows that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant had strangled or attempted to strangle the deceased.  
101That finding does not defeat the Crown case.  There was evidence from Dr Botterill and from Professor Duflou to the effect that the bruising on the upper chest and neck could be explained by the deceased having been struck by the juicer.  That explanation gains further force because of the unanimous opinion of the three pathologists that the injury to the chin was consistent with the deceased being struck by the juicer.  Anatomically the location of the chin injury was very close to the bruising on the neck and upper chest.
102The defence challenged the Crown case on the basis that the Crown had not excluded the deceased having died of natural causes, i.e. because of his heart condition.  The submission depended upon the evidence of Professor Hilton.  When one properly reads Professor Hilton's evidence, the defence submission is not made out.  
103Professor Hilton's primary position was that the cause of the deceased's death was obscure.  He was unable to identify a specific cause of death.  In explaining why he had reached that conclusion, Professor Hilton referred to the deceased's heart condition and said that it was possible that it could have caused his death.  In other words, Professor Hilton was not prepared to exclude the heart condition as a possible cause of death.  What Professor Hilton did not say was that in his opinion the deceased's heart condition was a likely cause of death.
104The evidence of Professor Hilton has to be assessed against that of Professor Duflou and Dr Botterill.  Both Dr Botterill and Professor Duflou were not prepared to conclude that the deceased's heart condition was a likely cause of his death.  On the contrary, both of them rejected that as a likely cause of death.  If anything, the rejection of that proposition by Professor Duflou was even more decisive than that of Dr Botterill (see [40] and [53] hereof).  Of course, Professor Hilton's reservations concerning the deceased's heart condition did not take into account the extensive nature of his injuries which went beyond those likely to be caused by the deceased having had a heart attack and then having fallen backwards.
105On that state of the evidence, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased's heart condition had not caused his death.
106It follows from the above analysis of all of the evidence that the jury was entitled to find beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act or acts of the applicant which caused the death of the deceased, that such act or acts were deliberate and that the act or acts were unlawful.  I would grant leave to the applicant to appeal against conviction but would dismiss the appeal.
Application for leave to appeal against sentence
107The sentence proceedings took place before Price J on 8 March 2013 and his Honour imposed sentence on 28 March 2013.  In doing so, his Honour had regard to the maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter being imprisonment for 25 years.
108His Honour made findings in accordance with the jury's verdict.  No useful purpose would be served by setting out again those findings which were relatively uncontroversial, i.e. the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased, what the neighbours heard, what the ambulance officers and the police observed upon their arrival and what the applicant said on the four occasions that he made any comment about what had happened.  His Honour reviewed the medical evidence and that review was in accordance with the summary of medical evidence set out earlier in these reasons.
109His Honour set out his conclusion as follows:
""34 By their verdict, the jury rejected as a reasonable possibility that the deceased's death was not caused by an act of the offender but by a fall down the stairs, or because of a heart attack or other cardiac event, or by any other cause. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that following an argument with the deceased, when the offender had been making carrot juice, the offender in anger attacked him and caused his death and that the offender's acts were deliberate, unlawful, and dangerous.""
110His Honour then reviewed the nature of the offence of manslaughter, concluding by reference to R v Blacklidge (unreported, NSWCCA 12 December 1995) that ""the starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Mario Guzetti has been unlawfully taken"".
111His Honour made the following findings:
""38 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased with the juicer container in the area of the chin and mouth causing him to fall onto the back of his head causing brain injury and death. Consistent with the jury's verdict, there is no other rational explanation for the wound to the deceased's chin.

39 ...  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased with the juicer container several times to the chest area, causing the multiple curved and relatively straight grazed areas of bruising identified by Dr Botterill as injury number 8. 
40 The Crown has not established to the criminal standard that the offender attempted to strangle the deceased as there was absence of injury to the bony structures of the neck and of petechial haemorrhages.  I do not find that the offender depressed the deceased's vagal nerve in the carotid artery causing vagal inhibition.
41 This was a violent attack carried out in anger by the offender upon his 71 year old partner and exposed the deceased to a high risk of serious injury. It is an objectively serious offence of manslaughter.""
112His Honour noted that the applicant had neither expressed remorse nor shown contrition for the offence so that his Honour was not prepared to make any allowance in mitigation for those matters.  His Honour took into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant did not have any previous convictions.
113Other elements of the applicant's subjective case noted by his Honour were that he was aged 46 when the offence was committed and was 52 at the time of sentence.  He had a challenging childhood in China and Hong Kong but had worked hard to establish himself in Australia.  His Honour accepted that he was a person of good character, was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  As a result, his Honour found that personal deterrence did not have a significant role to play in his sentence.  His Honour noted as a mitigating factor that the offence was not planned but was committed impulsively following an argument.  
114The applicant did not give evidence during the sentence proceedings so that his Honour relied upon the history provided to Dr Adams, a psychiatrist, which was set out in a report dated 5 March 2013.  The applicant was born in Shenzhen China and attended school between age 8 and 14.  Following his mother's death when he was aged 14, he went to Hong Kong to join his father whom he had not previously seen.  His father wanted him to be a mechanic which he did for approximately two weeks, which angered his father, causing the applicant to run away.  He began an apprenticeship in ivory carving, studied English at night and supported himself until he moved to New Zealand in 1984.  He was employed carving jade for approximately 4 years in New Zealand before moving to Sydney.
115The applicant was employed by different jewellery companies in Sydney before beginning his own jewellery business in 1994.  He continued to run his own business until he was assaulted and stabbed on 11 June 2005.  This resulted in the loss of his left eye, nerve damage and back pain.  The applicant told Dr Adams that his mental health had deteriorated following that assault so that he was depressed and antidepressant medication was prescribed.  He said that his mental health improved after six to seven months which he attributed to the deceased's support.  He had not been able to return to paid employment since the assault and was in receipt of a disability support pension.  
116The applicant told Dr Adams that his mental health deteriorated following the deceased's death and being charged.  He described a marked fluctuation of mood over the preceding five years, with periods lasting several months during which he felt ""depressed ... terrible"".  He linked his worst periods of mood to the periods leading up to and ""during the two trials he went through"".  He began to ""self medicate"" with increasing use of alcohol and illicit substances but after six months he used alcohol less frequently.  He described how on the two occasions that he was acquitted, his mood improved briefly but that his emotional state rapidly deteriorated when he learned of the appeals.  He described his level of functioning over the years as living ""day by day"".
117Dr Adams expressed the opinion that the symptoms described by the applicant were consistent with recurrent episodes of major depression.  Dr Adams found a nexus between his periods of low mood and depression and the legal proceedings.  He opined that the offender would benefit from psychiatric review and follow up and that consideration should be given to the reintroduction of anti-depressant medication.
118His Honour noted that the applicant had been in custody until conditional bail with tri-weekly reporting conditions was granted on 7 August 2007.  A further grant of conditional bail, with once weekly reporting conditions, was granted on 20 March 2012.
119His Honour found:
""56 It is hardly surprising that the fluctuating outcomes of directed acquittals at trial and reversal upon appeal have had an adverse psychological effect on the offender. The offender has been left in uncertain suspense for almost six years. Furthermore, throughout much of this time, his liberty has been restricted by bail conditions. Notwithstanding the offender's pleas of not guilty, I do not think that the delay can be attributed to him. There are many cases that deal with delay, as a mitigating circumstance: see for example Hancock v R [2012] NSWCCA 200 [23]; R v Khanas (1999) 108 A Crim R 499; Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59, but it seems to me that the present circumstances are unique as the delay was associated with the emotional highs of two favourable trial outcomes and disappointment in the results of the appeals by the Crown to the Court of Criminal Appeal. However, it is important to observe that the Crown was not entirely successful on appeal, the verdict of not guilty to the most serious charge of murder being affirmed. Given the history of the proceedings and adverse psychological impact upon the offender, considerations of fairness call for leniency being extended to him, which I propose to reflect in a finding of special circumstances, justifying a variation between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of sentence.
57 I further find as special circumstances, his physical disability and need for psychiatric review and treatment.""
120His Honour noted that sentencing statistics were of little assistance in relation to manslaughter offences, given the wide embrace of offending which the offence covered.  His Honour noted that each case depended upon its own facts.  
121As of the date of sentence, it was agreed that the applicant had spent a total of 7 months and 14 days in custody.  Accordingly, his sentence was backdated to commence on 26 July 2012.  As already indicated, the sentence imposed by his Honour was imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, so that the earliest date of eligibility for parole was 25 January 2017.
Ground of Appeal - The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
122The applicant did not challenge any of his Honour's findings of fact nor his Honour's application of principle.  He submitted that in weighing the balance between the objective severity of the offence and the applicant's personal circumstances, his Honour had erred by imposing a sentence which was excessive.
123The applicant submitted that taking into account the protracted history of the criminal proceedings, the facts of the matter, his very favourable subjective case and the adverse impact of the delay on his mental health, the sentence was too severe.  The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to properly implement his finding of mitigating factors, i.e. no record of previous convictions, person of good character, unlikely to re-offend, good prospects of rehabilitation and offence not planned but committed impulsively.  The applicant submitted that despite his Honour's finding of delay and its effects on him, his Honour failed to give that finding sufficient weight when imposing sentence.
Consideration
124The difficulty for the applicant in establishing this ground of appeal is that he acknowledges that his Honour took into account all relevant facts and principles.  Nevertheless, he submits that his Honour failed to give those factors which favoured him sufficient weight so that the final result was a sentence which in all the circumstances was excessive.  Submissions which assert that a sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to matters which he or she took into account, have the inherent difficulty that from the outset they concede no actual error but are required to challenge the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
125In order to successfully challenge his Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion, the applicant had to establish that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).
126In Markarian the plurality (Gleeson CJ; Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said:
""25 As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ""manifest excess"", or in a prosecution appeal, as ""manifest inadequacy"".
...
Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence.  And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.""
127As has been repeatedly stated by this Court, and as was observed by his Honour in this case, manslaughter is an almost unique offence because of its protean character (Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; 160 A Crim R 1).  In R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 Bathurst CJ (with whom Johnson and R A Hulme JJ agreed) said at [226] - [227]:
""226 There is, in truth, no range of sentences for offences of manslaughter which may be said to have a single common component relating to the mechanism of death (such as the victim's head striking the ground after a blow to the head). To the same effect, there is no range of sentences for manslaughter offences said to have been committed by use of a knife or a rock or some other implement. 
227 The myriad circumstances of manslaughter offences render it unhelpful to speak in terms of a range of sentences, or tariff, for a particular form of manslaughter. Gleeson CJ made this clear in R v Blacklidge (see [193] above), in a passage cited regularly in cases such as R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at 530 [40].""
128As has also been said on a number of occasions, the exercise of the sentencing discretion is not capable of mathematical precision.  At best, experienced judges will agree on a range of sentences that reasonably fit all the circumstances of the case.  In particular, there is no right or wrong sentence.  What a sentencing judge has to do is weigh all the circumstances and make a judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence.  This is what his Honour did on this occasion.
129The sentence imposed by his Honour was well within the range available to him, given his Honour's findings as to the seriousness of the offending and the circumstances in which it occurred, but also having regard to the applicant's strong subjective case.  What the applicant has failed to establish is that error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 has occurred or that otherwise the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.  In those circumstances, this ground of appeal has not been made out.
130The orders which I propose in relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence is that leave be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
131FULLERTON J:  I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL, and the close consideration his Honour has given to the question whether, upon the whole of the evidence at the appellant's trial, it was open to the jury to convict him of the manslaughter of his partner Mario Guzzetti.
132After undertaking my own assessment of the evidence, and the inferences that may legitimately be drawn from the facts established by that evidence, I have come to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.  In my view, the Crown did not exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased died from a head injury sustained in circumstances causally unrelated to any act of the appellant that was both unlawful and dangerous. 
133This is not a case where the doubt I have as to the appellant's guilt is one that might have been resolved by the jury's advantage in and seeing and hearing the witnesses or the consideration of the physical evidence (see M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487).  Were that the case I might have concluded that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that no miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
134His Honour's comprehensive summary of the evidence and the competing cases put at trial relieves me of having to refer at length to the evidence or to restate counsel's arguments, other than what is necessary in order to make it clear the basis upon which I propose that the verdict be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
135The transcript of the evidence at trial and the physical evidence upon which the Crown relied in proof of the appellant's guilt was available to be considered on the appeal.  This included a plan of the house where the deceased and the appellant lived as a couple and a large number of photographs of the house.  In addition, this Court attended a view of the premises in order that we might each be informed of what the jury might have learnt about the arrangement of the house since, under s 54 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the view became evidence in the trial.  
136As the premises had been preserved by police as a crime scene, the view also showed the state the premises were in when police arrived where they found the appellant cradling the head of the deceased on a blood stained pillow (and rocking it from side to side) as he lay prone at the bottom of a set of stairs leading to the upstairs bedroom.  As the appellant did not give evidence, the extent to which the deceased's body had been moved by him in the process of arranging his head on the pillow (which, it appeared, had been retrieved by the appellant from the upstairs bedroom), was not established by the evidence.   
137The view of the premises assisted me in appreciating both the confines of the floor space at the base of the stairs relative to the northern (party) wall of the house and the alignment of the uncarpeted wooden stairs directly opposite that wall.  I also gained an appreciation of the proximity of the deceased's body, lying generally west to east in that confined floorspace, to a number of features of the physical evidence relied upon by the Crown as part of the Crown case theory. Those features included the following:
(1)The component of the metal juicer alleged by the Crown to be the weapon wielded by the appellant in series of blows directed at the deceased's face (the unlawful and dangerous act) as a consequence of which he fell sustaining a head injury (the cause of death) on the floor alongside the deceased; 
(2)The kitchen where, on the Crown case, an argument between the deceased and the appellant erupted into physical violence with the appellant throwing the juicer under such force that it hit the wall above the open kitchen doorway causing brick and plaster to shatter.  Carrot pulp was seen on the wall.  The juicer was found on the floor beyond that open doorway; and
(3)The jamb of the open doorway at the base of the stairs which opened into the hallway/living room at the deceased's head and where what the crime scene officer described a ""smudge of [the deceased's] blood"" was located on both the northern and southern sides of the jamb; and 
(4)The northern brick wall of the living room immediately to the west of that doorway (the party wall to the house where Ms Cunney lived) where the crime scene officer described finding a ""fine splatter of blood"".  Photographs showed that the ""splatter"" was comprised of five discrete drops of blood.  It was the deceased's blood in each deposit.  The crime scene officer described ""the fine splatter of blood"" as coming from a ""low angle"".  
138The photographs tendered by the Crown at trial included a photograph of where the juicer was found and the condition in which it was found.  The jury were invited by the Crown to find that after the appellant threw the juicer in an outburst of ""anger and rage"" either at the kitchen wall or which hit the wall above the open kitchen door, he then picked up the juicer and, using it as a weapon, wielded it at the deceased (who, it must be assumed on the Crown case, was at that time at or near the base of the stairs) causing a laceration on his chin as a consequence of which he fell against the northern wall opposite the stairs and then to the floor sustaining a head injury which caused his death. It was the Crown case that he then discarded the juicer where it was found by police beside the deceased's body.   
139The Crown sought to account for the spatter of blood on the hallway/living room wall (in particular, its low angle) by the appellant striking the deceased in the chin a second time at the site of the first injury causing the complex laceration identified by Dr Botterill on autopsy, and that he did so whilst the deceased was on the ground, having struck the back of his head under the force of the first blow.  
140This aspect of the Crown case theory was in reliance on the evidence of the crime scene officer that blood only forms a spatter pattern when an injury has already caused bleeding.  Officer Griffin gave the following evidence:
Q. Are you able to make any comment about the blood spatter on the wall near to the head of the deceased?A. Make comments as to?
Q. How it got there?A. There are a number of ways blood can be deposited on to a vertical surface. In this instance to get the terminology of what we call spatter, to get a spatter-type incident there needs to be already a bleeding injury. Blood needs to be in an area that comes into force or contact to then, in layman's terms, splash that blood on to another receiving surface.
So basically, if I hit myself here now on to an unbloodied area there would be no spatter as such. That first hit or injury would cause the bleeding, a subsequent strike would then cause the blood to be projected forward into a spatter-like manner. 
Q. All right. So if one is already bleeding and they are struck again in the same area, where there is bleeding what would cause blood spatter, is that right?A. Yes, it does.
Q. And in relation to where the head of the deceased was is the blood staining on the wall of any significance as to where he may have been struck to cause that blood spatter, if at all?A. Well, certainly the, the blood that was on the wall in the loungeroom which is marked with those four blood squares, okay? Amongst that there are indications that it did come from a low angle to get deposited on that wall. 
141It was also the Crown case that other injuries identified at autopsy, in particular what Dr Botterill described as ""multiple curved and relatively straight grazed area of bruising to the deceased's upper chest"", were also inflicted by the appellant using the juicer as a weapon to beat or strike the deceased when he was on the floor.  The Crown also alleged that the appellant to strangle the deceased while he was on the floor. 
142There was no evidence of any blood staining to the underside of the deceased's clothing proximate to the area where the grazed bruises were noted, or to his outer clothing suggestive of him being struck multiple times with what, on the Crown case, must have been by that time a bloodied weapon.  This, coupled with the fact that it has not been shown that there was evidence of any blood on the juicer, in my view, very considerably weakened a central feature of the Crown's circumstantial evidence case theory.  For reasons which I will come to presently, the fact that there was no blood on the juicer (despite the Crown examining a number of witnesses on the assumption that there was blood on it when it was located by crime scene officers) also undermines the Crown case that it was used by the appellant as a weapon to strike multiple blows to the deceased's chin.
143The appellant's attempts at strangulation were said by the Crown to be the explanation for bruising on the deceased's neck.  Although Dr Botterill suggested strangulation or attempted strangulation as a contributing cause of death, I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL at [100] that both Dr Duflou and Professor Hilton rejected that theory, and gave compelling reasons for doing so, such that jury could not have been satisfied that the appellant strangled or attempted to strangle the deceased.  At [101] Hoeben CJ at CL did not regard the rejection of the suggestion of strangulation as an explanation for the injuries to the neck as undermining the jury verdict.  It has contributed to the doubt I have as to the appellant's guilt.  
144While I accept, as Hoeben CJ at CL points out, that Dr Botterill and Dr Duflou gave evidence that the grazed areas of bruising to the deceased's chest and his neck could be explained by being struck with the juicer, and that both pathologists and Professor Hilton considered the injury to the deceased's chin was consistent with him being struck by the juicer, in contrast to the view his Honour expressed at [101] I do not regard the anatomical proximity of those sites of injury as lending any weight to the question whether they were likely to have been caused by an assault with the juicer as a weapon, even less that the jury could have been satisfied of that assault as both unlawful and dangerous beyond reasonable doubt. 
145Neither do I assess Ms Cunney's evidence as providing support for the Crown case theory that the juicer was used as a weapon.  On the Crown case it was the deceased ""crying out in pain or surprise or shock"" at being assaulted that Ms Cunney mistakenly thought was the deceased singing opera.  According to her evidence, this was not long after hearing what she described ""as shelf falling with pots and pans on it and lids rolling on the floor, lids or a lid, one or several"".  The Crown alleged that what Ms Cunney heard was the juicer being thrown at the kitchen wall by the appellant (and rolling as it hit the floor) in an outburst of rage at the culmination of a verbal argument.  This was said by the Crown to be consistent with the various accounts the appellant gave to police, and to a friend of his, when spoken to at the police station, to the effect that he had a fight or an argument with the deceased while the appellant was making carrot juice with the juicer.  It was the Crown case, of course, that the appellant had not given a complete account of the morning events or ""the fight"" with his partner since he made no admissions to assaulting the deceased in the fight and denied being responsible for his death.
146Ms Cunney said she heard the deceased singing out (or singing) at about 8.15 am.  She gave no evidence of hearing raised voices before hearing what she thought to be a shelf falling or any sound consistent with a physical fight thereafter.  The deceased's singing lasted for a period of what she estimated to be ten seconds after which there was silence for about ten minutes before she heard the appellant's loud wailing for ten to fifteen minutes before the ambulance arrived. 
147The Crown accounted for the ten minute silence after Ms Cunney heard the deceased singing by the deceased having either lost consciousness after falling heavily to the floor, sustaining the contrecoup brain injury and the bruising and abrasion at the back of his head.  The Crown did not seek to account for the further time that must have elapsed before the appellant telephoned the 000 operator in tears at 9.12 am.  There was no evidence to support any inference that the appellant had cleaned up or attempted to clean up any blood or to conceal in anyway what had occurred.  To the contrary.  The metal juicer component (which on the Crown case had been used as a weapon to assault the deceased and to have caused the complex wound to his chin) was on the floor alongside the deceased's legs and his blood, albeit small deposits of it, were on the northern wall, the door jamb and the balustrade.  
148The colour photograph of the juicer had, what appeared to crime scene officers, to be a liquid stain, reddish in colour, over its inner surface which tested positive for blood on a preliminary or screening test.  It was not tested to confirm that the red stain was blood the juicer was subjected to fingerprint analysis.  
149By the time the DNA specialist, Ms Franco, received the juicer the reddish coloured stain had been obliterated or masked by a blue/green stain, which Ms Franco understood to be the result of the fingerprinting process.  Although she identified the deceased's DNA in two discrete areas on the juicer (including on the spout) she could not say that the deceased's DNA was in blood, tissue or some other body secretion. 
150Despite the evidence being to the conclusive effect that the deceased's blood was not detected on the juicer (a position well known to the Crown when it opened its case), the Crown was permitted, without objection, to lead evidence from the crime scene officer, and from Dr Botterill and Dr Duflou on the assumption that the reddish stain on the juicer was both blood and the blood of the deceased.  Although the trial judge ultimately prevented the Crown prosecutor in his closing address from inviting the jury to draw the inference that the deceased's blood was on the juicer, but had been obliterated by forensic testing processes, and although his Honour directed the jury, in categorical terms, that the evidence did not enable them to draw the inference that the red stain was the blood of the deceased, by that time in the trial, the photographs of the juicer with the red staining on it had featured prominently in the evidence of a number of Crown witnesses.  
151The five photographs showing different angle views of the juicer with the red liquid stain were shown to the crime scene officer early in the Crown case.  He was asked the following questions:
Q. And you have seen the stills that have been obtained from that?A. Yes, I have.
Q. And they are part of the rear part of that exhibit. If you go to the photographs that are contained after the plan you will see five photographs marked 1 to 5 of the same metal implement. Do you see that?A. Yes.
Q. And photograph 1 is a view looking down, photograph 2 from much the same angle is a close-up of that?A. Yes.
Q. And both photograph 1 and photograph 2 show what appears to be blood staining?A. Yes.
Q. Photograph 3 from another angle shows this blood staining, does it not?A. Yes.
Q. Photograph 4, which is to the side of the juicer, shows the blood staining which is quite apparent there, does it not?A. Yes.
Q. And photograph 5 also shows the blood staining from the position of the floor; is that right?A. Yes. 
Q. Now, in relation to this particular implement, did you look under the implement to see if there was any residual or blood staining under the implement?A. Yes, I did.
Q. And what was the result?A. There was nothing on the floorboards underneath the item.
Q. So no drips of blood, no bring of blood on the floor?A. No, there was not.[Emphasis added]
152Dr Botterill gave evidence that he had seen the photographs of the juicer at T226 line 25 -45.  He was asked by the Crown Prosecutor:
Q. And you have seen photographs of that with what appear to be red staining which may well be blood, is that right?A. I've seen those images and yes, it may be blood.
Q. Now, in relation to you being told doctor that on the spout of that juicer bowl there has been found the DNA of the deceased?A. I may have been told that but I don't recall that. 
Q. All right. What I want to ask you doctor, the wound that you saw to this man's chin, is that consistent with being struck by the spout of this juicer?A. Yes. There's, the features of the wound to the chin are not specific enough to enable me to say it must necessarily have been that but that is a possible explanation.
Q. It is a complex would you would describe it as, would you not?A. Yes, yes.
Q. And would you agree that the wound itself may have been the result of one or more than one blow to the same area?A. Yes.  [Emphasis added]
153In the cross-examination of Dr Duflou the Crown showed the same five photographs: 
CROWN PROSECUTOR: I'm referring to, I think there are five photographs at the end of exhibit A which depict the juicer bowl, your Honour.
Q. Do you see those?A. Yes, I do.
Q. You will see on those there appears to be a considerable amount of a reddish substance, does there not?A. Yes, there does appear to be.
Q. That would be a substance from your observation that would be consistent with blood, would it not?A. It certainly has that appearance, yes.
Q. If that could be returned thank you, and if exhibit D could be returned. Now, given that there was blood spatter and given your evidence in relation to the cause perhaps of that blood spatter and given that there is blood found on that implement --
OBJECTION. QUESTION WITHDRAWN.
HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, disregard that. You heard the evidence from Miss Franco that no blood was detected on the juicer. Please bear that in mind, members of the jury.
Q. Yes. Doctor in this case, just to explain it to you, it went to fingerprints, they put it under some considerable testing there and then it went to the DAL for DNA testing. But coming back, what appears to be blood is on that juicer, would you agree?A. Well, photographically it appears.
Q. Yes, that is all I ask you. And we know for a fact there is blood spatter found behind the man's head, take that as a fact. [Emphasis added]
154Absent any evidence that the deceased's blood was on the juicer, or any evidence from which the presence of his blood might be inferred, the views of the various witnesses extracted above that the sustaining looked like blood must be disregarded.  (For my part, I make the further observation that this line of questioning was irrelevant and dangerously prejudicial and should have been the subject of objection of defence counsel.)
155The photographs of the juicer also remained with the jury as an exhibit during their deliberations.  There was no application from counsel that they be withdrawn as having no relevance on the question whether the Crown had proved guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  There were a number of other photographs of the juicer, in situ, which were of continuing relevance in the jury deliberations.  
156I agree with the observations of Hoeben CJ at CL at [97] that the absence of any of the deceased's blood on the juicer, in circumstances where the overwhelming evidence was to the effect that if the juicer had been used in the way contended for by the Crown his blood should have been blood on it, presents what his Honour described as a ""significant challenge"" to the Crown.  However to the extent that in [99] his Honour regarded the disappearance of the red stain, and Ms Franco's evidence as an explanation for why there was no blood that was detected, I must disagree.  The fact that the red stain which had tested presumptively for blood had disappeared by the time it was submitted for DNA testing, does not permit a finding that what was once there was in fact blood, or that because the process of fingerprinting can create difficulties when tests are later undertaken to confirm the presence of blood, that provides an explanation for why no blood was found on the juicer.  To reason in that way, proceeds on the false premise that there was blood on the juicer, whether in the form of the reddish stain or otherwise, and that it was obliterated. 
157Deprived of the submission that the jury could infer there was blood on the juicer, the case ultimately left by the Crown was that the deceased's DNA in three deposits on the juicer, including the under side of the spout, supported the Crown case that it was used by the appellant as a weapon to strike him about the face and body in the various ways contended for.  As was made clear in Ms Franco's evidence, the presence of the deceased's DNA on an item he may have handled that morning, or on some other occasion, would be likely to remain on the item unless and until the place from where the deposit was extracted was washed or wiped.  On the Crown case the juicer had been used the morning the deceased died and that a fight or an argument erupted in the process of juice being made.  There is nothing in the evidence to exclude the reasonable possibility that traces the deceased's DNA were deposited on the juicer quite independently of the Crown case theory that he was struck with it.
158In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the DNA evidence is of such preponderant weight that it overcomes the absence of blood on the juicer were it used, as the Crown submitted, to strike or beat the deceased causing the lacerations to his chin.  The fact that there was no blood under the juicer or the floor around where it was on the Crown case discarded by the appellant after he had repeatedly struck the deceased with it, is also significant.  The fact that the appellant's index finger was on the juicer was intractably neutral.  There was no evidence to suggest that a single fingerprint in the position where it was identified simulated the holding of the juicer as a weapon. 
159I also regard the fact that the juicer was on the floor next to the deceased as neutral at best (cf Hoeben CJ at CL at [99]).  I accept, of course, that the juicer was thrown at the kitchen wall, but it does not appear to me to be beyond the realms of reasonable possibility that it then rolled or was kicked by the deceased or by the appellant as one or both of them left the kitchen after the argument where it remained until found by police. 
160The doubts I have as to the implication of the juicer in the death of the deceased highlight what I am satisfied was the Crown's failure to exclude a reasonable hypothesis for the death of the deceased consistent with the innocence of the appellant.  
161Despite there being some persisting question in the evidence of the pathologists as to the precise cause of death, I am of the view that the jury were entitled to find beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died as a result of a head injury.  The question that then presents, and starkly, is whether the Crown has excluded, as a reasonable possibility, that the deceased fell striking his head either in the course of a fall, or when his head struck the ground on falling, and that he sustained the injury to his chin in that process. 
162Of the seventeen circumstances relied upon by the Crown in proof of its case that it was the deliberate act or act of with the appellant which caused the head injury from which he died, only the fifteenth and seventeenth circumstances deal with the evidence of Dr Botterill and Dr Rodriguez.  Particular reliance was placed at trial and on the appeal on the nature and spread of injuries identified at autopsy which each of the pathologists found difficulty accounting for when invited to consider whether the deceased's fatal head injury might have been the result of a fall.  
163In particular, each of the expert pathologists and Dr Rodriguez, a neuropathologist, were invited to consider whether a fall backwards, as the deceased either mounted the stairs or after he had mounted some or all of the stairs, could account for the head injury.  
164The injury to the back of the deceased's head (numbered 7 by Dr Botterill during the course of the autopsy) was described as a 1 centimetre area of shallow grazing on the left side of the back of the head.  He described it as ""related to movement of that surface against some other surface ... which it did not have a sharp edge (T232).  He also identified bruising associated with the graze on the outer and inner skin of the scalp (T233), and bruising towards the back of the head on both sides (T240).  There was no fracture of the skull.  Dr Botterill went on to summarise what Dr Rodriguez observed upon his examination of the brain in the following terms: 
... a release of blood over the surfaces all the bottom and the front of the right side of the brain and over the side and the top side of the left side of the brain that are due to trauma causing damage to small blood vessels within and over the brain surface. (T241) 
165Ultimately when asked by the Crown whether a fall onto the back of the head would be likely to cause the complex of injuries to the back of the head and to the brain, Dr Botterill agreed that would be the case (T243). 
166Although Dr Botterill he went on to comment that the injury to the deceased's chin may possibly be explained by the deceased hitting one of the bollards on the stairs, given the curvature of the bollard and its location on the stairs, he considered the juicer was more likely to have caused that injury.  
167It is clear from the question framed by the Crown that Dr Botterill's opinion was premised on the assumption that the juicer was used as a weapon, an assumption that I am concerned that Dr Botterill treated uncritically given that he had been invited by the Crown to proceed on the basis that there was blood on the juicer which was contrary to the fact (see [22]). 
168Since I am of the firm view that the absence of blood on the juicer renders that explanation improbable, it follows that the probabilities of there being another explanation for that injury are increased, with the bollard on the staircase being one such mechanism.  
169It is in that context that the following evidence from Dr Botterill is significant: 
Q. In relation to the injury to the chin you may well be asked whether that is consistent with hitting one of the bollards on the stairs, one of the rounded bollards on the stairs. Would that be likely to cause this complex injury to the chin?A. It is a possible explanation partly because of the curvature and the location it is still possible even hitting something such as a rounded object such as that may result in a tear such as that. 
Q. Is it likely?A. It is possible. I can't more [sic] specific than that. 
...
Q. Let's go back to the scenario of a fall down the stairs; if the accused did fall down the stairs and if he did strike the bollard I referred to or indeed the brick wall would you expect that shortly after that there would be bleeding?A. It would depend on which specific injuries we are talking about. The large injury over the right side of the chin you would expect bleeding but not necessarily immediately. If there were a second contact on that area yes you would definitely expect to see blood at that point. The extent of that laceration however is such that you would expect to have some transfer of skin or other tissue to that contact point even in the absence of blood. 
Q. Let's say if one fell down the stairs and hit their chin against the wall or indeed the balustrade or a bollard and then hit their head again you would expect there to be some transfer of tissue or blood would you not?A. Certainly from the open wound on the chin, yes. Some of the abrasions may leave some material present. The bruises may not necessarily. 
170It appears that the bollard was not swabbed. 
171Dr Botterill was then asked by the Crown to consider whether a fall down the stairs might explain the full range of injuries identified on autopsy. He thought this ""conceivable"" but ""very unlikely"" (T251).  He went on to say in the same line of questioning by the Crown at T251 that he had not seen what the Crown described as ""a constellation or a collection of injuries"" as presented in this case in any post-mortem he had conducted or that his colleagues in Queensland had conducted.
172What comprised the ""constellation of a collection of injuries"" was never identified with any clarity.  It was not resolved in cross-examination when again Dr Botterill said that ""it would be an extraordinary fall to result in that degree of injury"" (T262).
173The assumption in both the question asked by the Crown and not clarified in cross-examination is that all or most of the 16 individual injuries which comprised ""the constellation"" were sustained near or at the time of death.  A review of Dr Botterill's evidence discounts at least three sites of injury as logically not within the constellation. They include injury number 10, a yellowing bruise likely to be sustained a day or more prior to death; injury number 15, a scar on the inner aspect of the left elbow and injury number 16, surface scabbing above the ankle on both legs.  
174The sites of bruising and grazing to the deceased's lower back (injury number 9), the back of the knuckle on the right index finger (injury number 12), a graze to the back of the arm above the elbow (injury number 11) and the bruising to the deceased chest and neck were not able to be aged with any greater degree of specificity than up to a day before death.  In respect of the chest injuries in particular, the Crown asked Dr Botterill the following question:  
Q. Doctor, in relation to the injuries that you see there [referring to the bruising on reflection of the neck and chest], given any normal forensic difficulties, but are you able to say whether it is consistent with having occurred at much the same time as the injury that is seen in the area of the chin?A. It is very difficult to be specific about the timing of injuries. Really, the best that one can say is they are within about a day of the time of death or greater than a day or so. And both the injury to the chin and these bruises here were consistent with an injury up to the time of death or a day or so before. 
Q. There is no reason why you couldn't say that despite those difficulties you couldn't say they occurred at the same time or roughly the same time?A. No, yes, yes. They certainly could have occurred at about the same time, yes. 
175In cross-examination Dr Botterill said:
Q. Well in terms of the length of time that a bruise can still be exhibited on your body they can last over a week sometimes, even longer?A. Yes. Usually if they last more than that first day or they are visible for more than the first day they will undergo some change as they fade so they will develop a yellowish or brownish discolouration then fade but certainly with a deep bruise it can still be there a week later for sure.
Q. What is the outside age of the bruising in the chest and neck area?A. Again I can't really say beyond about either at the time of death up to about a day before. 
176The multiple areas of bruising and grazing on the deceased's back, including deep bruising in areas designated as AD 1-4 where the skin over the back of hands and forearms were cut to look for evidence of additional areas of bruising not apparent on an external examination, also showed bruising that could not be aged. 
177Dr Rodriguez gave evidence that the injury to the brain that he observed would likely to be the result of would be mild to moderate force there being no breakage of the skull but enough force to break blood vessels and bruised the brain.  He also gave evidence that the injuries to the brain that he observed might be fatal but not invariably so.  He was unable to offer an opinion as to the height a person might need to fall from to sustain the injuries he observed in the deceased's brain.  He gave the following evidence:
Q. Any way of knowing how far for instance you would have to fall to get an injury like that?A. That's certainly been modelled, distances and, and injury. But that, the simple models don't very well translate into reality where falls are not usually simple and linear falls. So in reality it is no possible, certainly not for me.
Q. Because you are not using a live human in the experiment?A. No, that would be unethical.
Q. Most people would try at least, if they are conscious of course, try and stop themselves falling?A. Yes.
Q. By trying to grab hold of things or they bump into things on the way down?A. (Witness nodded.)
Q. But have you seen injuries similar to what was occasioned to this deceased where at least you have been told by the police or others in a reliable fashion that the fall was of a fairly insignificant nature?A. I don't recall instances like that but there may have been.
Q. What I'm getting at, you don't need to fall from 20 steps or 10 metres or even five metres to get injuries on your brain as seen in this case, do you?A. That is correct.
Q. Yes. But narrowing it down to precisely how far you would have to fall to get an injury like that, you can't assist?A. No.
Q. And to your knowledge no-one is able to help us with that, are they?A. People would express an opinion but I'm not sure that that would be helpful. 
Q. Yes. People express opinions about lots of things. But so far as your experience they are not going to be able to get any closer than what we've got?A. No. Moderate force would be as far as I can ascertain. 
178In re-examination he gave the following evidence:
Q. You mention a contrecoup injury and as you have been told there was an injury to the back of the skull of the deceased and there was a bruising to the front of the brain you have said in evidence, is that right?A. Yes.
Q. Is that similar to a contrecoup injury that was asked of you or not?A. Yes, that would count as a contrecoup, consistent with a contrecoup injury.
Q. Was there bruising on either side of the brain?A. Yes, there was on the left side, this side. 
Q. And if somebody fell, hit their head say on a wall and then hit their head on the back area as they fell further, could that cause a similar contrecoup injury with the brain moving to the side rather than back to front or not?A. Yes, it could.
Q. So the bruising to both the front of the brain and the side of the brain could be consistent with a fall, hitting a wall and then hitting a floor, something like that?A. Yes. Or alternatively one or both of those in isolation.
Q. Or in the alternative it could be as a result of blows to the head?A. That is correct.
179Dr Duflou's evidence was to similar effect.  As to the potential for a person to die from falling backwards he said:
Q. Now, falls. Can you explain to the members of the jury that you've examined and read many, many cases where people will actually die from falling just from their own height?
A. Yes, absolutely. A fall from your own height, especially if you fall backwards, is potentially very dangerous and can be lethal. There is a specific type of head injury associated with that called the contrecoup head injury. The exact mechanism is open to some debate, but essentially from purely falling backwards on to the back of your head you can die. It's a relatively uncommon outcome but it's certainly one that's in the standard experience of any forensic pathologist who does autopsies, even on an irregular basis. It's one of those things you see and that you know about, and I have certainly seen them and a fair number of them over the years. 
180As with Dr Botterill, Dr Duflou considered that contact with the bollard of the staircase may explain the injury to the deceased's chin, in circumstances where you may not find blood in the area of impact:
Q. Well, the injury to the chin occasioned to the deceased man, you've seen photographs of the solid wooden bollard at the end of the staircase?A. Yes.
Q. Could the injury to the chin have been caused by coming into contact with that piece of timber?A. It could. Looking at the bollard it's relatively featureless, it's round, it has no sharp surfaces, but certainly striking a rounded surface hard enough can cause a laceration like that. Sometimes when you're lucky a laceration, a tearing of the skin, can reflect the surface which the person strikes. Often it doesn't. You would think from watching TV shows that it's always the case. It certainly absolutely isn't. It's uncommonly the case that you can say without a doubt this injury wa caused by this object with whatever type of impact.
Q. After having contact with the bollard, so far as you're concerned are you able to agree or disagree with the proposition that having hit the bollard the force then pushes the deceased man back, either hitting his head on another step or the floor or the brick wall that is at the bottom of the staircase?A. Well, I'm certainly no physicist and I would very much hesitate to go in that direction, but certainly falls down stairs are invariably complex falls, they are not a straightforward, single fall and that's it. There can be multiple interactions with the surfaces. 
Q. How you lose your footing, the narrowness the staircase, whether you are up against soft objects, hard objects, the distance that you fall?A. Yeah, there are many variables. 
Q. Your weight, I suppose, is that a factor? A. I suspect it probably is.
Q. Well, have you seen injuries to the back of the head occasioned by the deceased ion this case that have been caused by falls? A. That could be caused by the fall, yes, absolutely. 
181And then later:
Q. If the face or the jaw of the deceased man came into contact with the bollard, would that knock him out?A. It could. I think it's fair to say people can have lacerations of parts of their face, especially overlying bony prominences like the jaw, with relatively little force causing a nasty laceration. On the other hand, when it comes to being knocked unconscious there's relatively - in this case there's I don't think absolute evidence that the person was unconscious as a result of the brain injury, although it's likely, but in terms of when that brain injury happened in the sequence of events, I can't tell.
Q. Did the blow to the chin or the impact to the chin take place before the impact to the skull at the back?A. I don't know. 
182Dr Duflou also accepted (both in evidence in chief and confirmed in cross-examination) that the juicer was an object which could have caused the injury to the deceased's chin equally as he conceded that the possibility of that the deceased was struck on the chin by the juicer and fell backwards hitting the floor and perhaps a wall causing the head injury. 
183In cross-examination he was invited to review and reflect upon the injuries to the deceased's chest.  He accepted that it was possible that some of the edges of the juicer bowl might have caused those injuries.  He was then asked the following question: 
Q. In terms of falling down a set of stairs doctor, those injuries [which must be taken to be limited to the bruising on the chest] don't appear to be consistent with that, do they?A. Probably not. It would be difficult to try and attribute it to something specific causing that. After saying that, you can get unusual injuries from tumbling down the stairs but I'd agree that likely not.
Q. And you would agree that certainly in relation to a possible fall from the top of the stairs that that is unlikely, is it not?A. I would think that it's unlikely that the deceased fell down one flight of stairs and then turned around and a second flight given the injuries that are seen externally. It can certainly happen that a person falls down two flights. That's unusual, but I would expect more injury I would think.
Q. Yes. Perhaps more bruising to the legs or arms or those areas that would come into contact with the hard object?A. Yes. 
184Dr Duflou's evidence in the above extract was also extracted in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [61].  At [84], where his Honour reasoned to the conclusion that the evidence led at trial excluded falling down the stairs as a cause of death (whether the deceased was ascending the stairs or descending), his Honour attributed to Dr Duflou the definite opinion that a fall down the stairs, be it from the intermediate landing or from the top was unlikely.  His Honour cited the extract above in [53] as the source of the evidence where Dr Duflou gave that opinion.  I do not interpret Dr Duflou's evidence in that way.  Having read his evidence carefully, I consider that he leaves open the reasonable possibility that the deceased died as a result of falling down what may have been no more than a few stairs either on the ascent or descent, striking his chin on the bollard in the process and sustaining multiple sites of bruising on his hands, elbow and back as he either sought to break the fall or as he hit various parts of the stairs and/or the floor before ultimately landing at the base of the stairs, striking the back of his head on the floor. 
185Dr Duflou went on to give what I regard as very significant evidence bearing on reasonable possibility that the deceased died as a result of a fall, unrelated to any act of the appellant:
Q. Did the deceased man have a lot of significant injuries or any significant injuries other than the impact to his brain?A. Look, externally the major injury was really the injury to the chin. In terms of severity of that injury, it is not particularly severe. The other external injuries were, from the types of cases I've seen in any event, now I think it's fair to say I tend to see fatalities, they were not particularly severe externally and in fact to me they were surprisingly insignificant compared to what you tend to see in most blunt force type interactions. Internally there was no fracturing of the skull, no fracturing of the jaw, no fracturing of the face, which against tends to suggest in the relative scale of things that it's relatively minor. Again it's more than if, for example, I was walking down the street and somebody suddenly punched me, but in terms of fatality it's very much at the lower end. 
Looking at the brain, there's some interesting injuries there. They're in fact fairly complex in terms of the injuries and how they were caused. They are potentially lethal injuries but with a lot of fairly diffuse brain injury, that affects the whole brain, what you see in the brain at the time of the death you can't necessarily say in many cases that would have caused death. It may have caused death or the person may have died with those injuries, so in other words they were coincidental or possibly they were contributory or possibly they were causative of death. There is unfortunately poor correlation with these types of injuries that were seen between being able to say how severe that injury was in fact. 
Q. Can you help us with the cause of death? What is the caution [sic] of death?A. In my view at a fairly simple level I believe the cause of death is more likely a head injury. There's brain damage. There has obviously been impact with the head in some way or other and there has been a couple of impacts to the head. I must say I personally would not have considered a neck compression in this case as being contributory and I don't think the heart disease was contributory in terms of causing death. So my personal view would have been that a head injury is the cause of death. In terms of the nature of the head injury, it's a blunt force type injury of a diffuse nature. How that was caused, I don't know.
186Were there evidence in the trial capable of satisfying a jury that the neck and chest injuries were sustained at or near the time of death then, despite the absence of any blood of the juicer or in the area where the juicer was found or on the outer clothing of the deceased, I would share the view reached by Hoeben CJ at CL that it would open to the jury to convict the appellant of manslaughter.
187However, the absence of blood on the juicer where, on the Crown case, it was used repeatedly by the appellant as a weapon and, on the Crown case, the only mechanism to account for the injuries to the deceased's chin and the chest (the appellant having none of the deceased's DNA under his fingernails - Dr Botterill having suggested that scratching of the deceased's chest under his clothes in the course of a struggle as a possible explanation for the injuries he described), a lack of any sufficient temporal connection of those injuries to the time of death (or within a reasonable time of it) have added to the doubt I have as to the appellant's guilt. 
188The orders I propose are:1. Appeal upheld.2. Conviction quashed.3. Verdict of acquittal entered.
189ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL and of Fullerton J. I am indebted to Hoeben CJ at CL for his summary of the facts and the evidence. However, I am unable to agree with his Honour's conclusions or with the orders he has proposed. I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J, substantially for the reasons her Honour has given. I wish to add some brief additional reasons for my view.
190This Court's task, when addressing a ground that a conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence is as stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The question the Court must ask itself was articulated by the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in M v The Queen at 493:""... whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question:the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
191The plurality in M v The Queen went on to say at 494: ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
192For the reasons given by Fullerton J I do not think that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant was guilty. That there was a physical confrontation is undoubted. That there was an argument is not in question. The deceased's body revealed several injuries that it was open to the jury to find were inflicted by the appellant. It was also open to the jury to find that the cause of death was a head injury. However, the head injury could have been sustained by a fall, as the evidence of Dr Duflou established. There was no onus on the accused to identify, much less prove, what caused the deceased to fall, if indeed this was the mechanism by which his fatal head injuries were sustained.
193Although it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the Crown had excluded a fall all the way down the stairs as accounting for the various injuries and occasioning the death of the deceased, the evidence did not, in my view, go so far as to exclude a fall, either from the one level, or from a single step or from a few steps in a single flight. Although it is possible that the force of the injuries inflicted by the appellant on the deceased was the reason the deceased fell, if a fall was the cause of the head injuries, I do not consider that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt. The timing of the infliction of the various injuries could not be sufficiently precise to establish contemporaneity with the fall. Nor was the evidence of the neighbour, Ms Cunney, capable of resolving this question to the requisite standard.
194It is not sufficient for the Crown to prove, as it was open to the jury to find that it had, that the fatal injury was not the result of the deceased falling all the way down the stairs. Rather the Crown was obliged to exclude all non-fanciful hypotheses consistent with innocence. Any different requirement would be inconsistent with the presumption of innocence and the right to silence.
195In some cases, the use of a weapon can lead to inferences about the cause of death being drawn which exclude reasonable doubt, particularly where, as here, the alleged offender and the deceased were the only people in an enclosed space. The present case does not belong to this category since the fatal injuries could have been caused by the force of impact of the deceased's head on the wooden floor after a fall which was not precipitated by any unlawful act on the part of the appellant. I do not consider that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had excluded this hypothesis. For the reasons given by Fullerton J, the unproved assumption that there was blood on the juicer may have led the jury to exclude this hypothesis on what I consider to have been an erroneous basis.
196Although all of the Crown evidence must be taken into account, it does not, in my view, resolve the central question beyond reasonable doubt. Nor do the statements made by the appellant immediately after the deceased died permit his guilt to be inferred since they are consistent with the following incontrovertible facts: that the appellant and the deceased had a fight; that the deceased had died; and that the appellant had loved him and had not wanted him to die. 
197Although the jury had an advantage, they had no relevant advantage in respect of the crucial issue which I have identified. The jury's advantage is not capable of resolving the doubt which I experience. In all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the verdict of guilty was reasonably open to the jury.

2765697,MK v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 340,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


On 23 July 2013 her Honour Judge Quirk sentenced the applicant as follows:

Count 1 (Take without consent with intent to obtain advantage on 6 February 2011) – a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 9 April 2011 and expiring 8 April 2012.

Count 2 (Aggravated Indecent Assault on 6 February 2011) – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 months from 24 April 2011 to 8 April 2013 with a balance of parole of 12 months to expire 8 April 2014.

Count 3 (Aggravated Indecent Assault on 6 February 2011) – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 months from 9 April 2011 to 8 April 2013 with a balance of parole of 12 months to expire 8 April 2014.


	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty to an offence of armed robbery committed on the day after the offences just referred to (i.e., 7 February 2011) and was sentenced at the same time by her Honour Judge Quirk to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 9 July 2012, expiring 8 January 2014 with a balance of term of 18 months expiring 8 July 2015.
	
	
	Her Honour’s express intention was to commence the sentences on 9 April 2011. Her Honour said:
	


“However I propose to start his sentence for the present offences two months after the date he went into custody to allow for some custodial punishment for those offences.” (23.7.2013 – T.3.6)


	
	The applicant had been arrested and taken into custody on 9 February 2011 and in accordance with her Honour’s express intention to commence the sentences two months after he was taken into custody, her Honour commenced those sentences from 9 April 2011.
	
	
	On 12 September 2014 this Court heard an appeal by the applicant against his convictions for Counts 1, 2 and 3 above. On 26 November 2014 this Court delivered judgment in relation to that appeal (MK v R [2014] NSWCCA 274) upholding the appeal, quashing the convictions in Counts 1, 2 and 3 and remitting the matter to the District Court for re-trial.
	
	
	As such the only remaining sentence was that in the robbery matter, against which there was no appeal. The sentence in the robbery matter was made partially accumulated upon Counts 1, 2 and 3 by 3 months.
	
	
	Given that the convictions in Counts 1, 2 and 3 have been quashed, the sentence in the robbery offence should now be adjusted to commence on 9 April 2011 as was her Honour’s express intention for the start date of the sentences. The Crown agrees that this Court should adjust the sentence in this way.
	
	
	Section 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 empowers the Court to make such an adjustment. Relevantly that section provides:
	


“59    Court may vary commencement of sentence on quashing or varying other sentence

(1)    A court that quashes or varies a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person (on appeal or otherwise) may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed on that person by that or any other court.

(2)    If a person is subject to two or more sentences, this section applies to each of them.

(3)    A court may vary a sentence under this section on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings on the quashing or variation of the other sentence.

…”


	
	It follows that the sentence for the robbery offence should be one of 3 years, being imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to commence 9 April 2011 and expire 8 October 2012, with a balance of term of 18 months to expire 8 April 2014.
	
	
	Since the Crown and the applicant have agreed that the sentence for the robbery offence should be adjusted in this way, and since both the Crown and the applicant agree that the Court can deal with this matter in chambers without a formal hearing, the order of the Court should be:
	



	
	The commencement date for the robbery offence which occurred on 7 February 2011 is varied so that the sentence imposed on the applicant should now read:
	


“Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 9 April 2011 and expiring 8 October 2012 with a balance of term of 18 months expiring 8 April 2014.”


	
	FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	HAMILL J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL

2765749,R v Hawi [2015] NSWSC 15,"Judgment


	
	This matter is listed for sentence on 3 February 2015 before the Chief Judge at Common Law. Application is now made that the sentence hearing be vacated on that day for two principal reasons.
	
	
	The first is that a pre-sentence report has not yet been prepared and will not in fact be ready for a number of weeks hence. This appears to have been a problem within Probation and Parole rather than something that can be attributable to the parties. An outstanding assessment needs to be undertaken and the relevant persons at Probation and Parole have been on leave. The report is necessary if parole conditions are to be imposed in relation to treatment or residence of the offender.
	
	
	Secondly, in further explanation of events since those set out in the letter of 27 November 2014 in respect of the offender's wife, material in relation to mitigating circumstances under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) needs to be prepared and placed before the Court. There has been some difficulty in gathering this material.
	
	
	The Crown does not oppose the adjournment of the sentencing hearing and in the circumstances I consider it appropriate to vacate the hearing on 3 February.
	
	
	I will stand the proceedings over for mention before the Chief Judge at 2pm on that day.
	
	
	Mr Hawi is excused from attendance on 3 February 2015 and bail is continued on the present bail conditions.

		02 February 2015",2015-01-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765758,R v Hicks [2015] NSWDC 67,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender Peter Hicks admits that, albeit a while ago, he had a sexual interest in underage girls. This interest led to him committing three serious offences. The first was of using a carriage service to groom a person under the age of 16. That is a commonwealth offence carrying a maximum penalty of 12 years’ imprisonment. The second was using a carriage service to transmit an indecent communication. That is another commonwealth offence with a maximum penalty of seven years. And the third is a New South Wales State offence of possessing child abuse material.
	
	
	Mr Hicks attempted to justify his conduct by saying that these offences were all committed at a time when he was working long hours and not seeing much of his partner whose shifts did not coincide with his. He also said that work was stressful. The connection between having a sexual interest in young girls and being stressed at work and not seeing much of your partner is not one which is immediately obvious to me.
	
	
	These offences came to light when the offender began a chat with an adult by the name of Lachlan Hawkins. During these chats Mr Hawkins became aware that Mr Hicks, the offender, had a sexual interest in young girls. For example, he became excited in these chats and was persistent in obtaining details or photographs of young female friends of Mr Hawkins. Very commendably indeed, Mr Hawkins both stopped communicating with the offender and reported these matters to police. What happened thereafter has to be considered carefully because there are a number of aspects of this case which make it different from most of the cases of this kind which come before the Courts.
	
	
	The first thing which is a bit unusual is that the first communication which led ultimately to the offender committing the first two offences I have spoken about came from a police officer. He, of course, was pretending not to be a police officer. He said that he heard from Mr Hawkins that the offender had an interest in young girls and suggested to Mr Hawkins that if he wished to pursue that interest, he should contact his niece. Thereafter the offender did that. Over the course of a number of months the offender communicated with a person he believed to be a 13-year-old girl named Gemma. In fact, of course, that person was not a 13-year-old girl but a police officer pretending to be a 13-year-old girl.
	
	
	The offender sent more than 200 text messages, many of which were inappropriate and of a sexual nature. The offender persistently asked for sexy or “norty” pics to be sent to him. He engaged in inappropriate conversations with the person he believed to be a 13-year-old girl including asking her whether she had ever had sex, whether she had pubic hair and what she had “done to a guy before”. He told her that he would “love to be ur first”. He asked whether she would have sex with another girl, whether she would show him her breasts and told her he would like, and he did not use these terms, to perform oral sex on her. At one stage he asked whether she would expose her breasts to him if they met “next weekend”.
	
	
	What I have described so far clearly amounts to the offence of using a carriage service to groom someone under the age of 16. Fortunately, there was no young girl who was groomed, but of course the offender did not know that. The communications continued until at one stage the offender sent a text containing a photograph and asked, “Does ur pussy look like this?” Once more he made a request that they meet, saying, “Would you like to meet me on a weekend?” He was arrested soon afterwards. Sending the photograph forms the basis of the second count on the indictment, sending indecent material.
	
	
	When he was arrested, the offender had a mobile phone on him. When police examined it they found a number of photographs amounting to child abuse material. There were 11 images. Seven of them depicted children with no sexual activity, one showed non-penetrative sexual activity between children and adults, two showed penetrative sexual activity involving either children and adults or both children and the last, a single photo, was the most serious, depicting sadism or bestiality.
	
	
	There are a number of features as I mentioned earlier that make these offences unusual. The first is that contact between “Gemma” and the offender was initiated by the police. Secondly, and this is conceded by the Crown, at times there would be no communication between the offender and Gemma for a week or so, but it was Gemma, that is, the police officer pretending to be Gemma, who re-initiated contact between them. And the third thing, of specific reference to the third count concerns, the very small number of images stored on Mr Hicks’ mobile phone.
	
	
	All offences of the kind which for which Mr Hicks has to be sentenced are serious, but they are not all of the same seriousness and those three particular features I have just identified must be borne in mind in assessing both the objective seriousness of this offending and also the offender’s moral culpability.
	
	
	The offender lives with his partner, his partner’s mother and one of his step-children. They have, according to him, a stable and supportive relationship. His partner gave evidence in support of him in court today. The offender used to work in a car service centre, but lost his job in 2013 and has not been employed since. He has been receiving treatment for depression and anxiety from a psychologist and although he has had plans to see someone down in Sydney for the purposes of obtaining treatment regarding these offences, he has not begun to do so, he says because it was necessary for these Court proceedings to be finalised before treatment could begin.
	
	
	The offender is 44 years of age with no prior criminal history. He has been assessed by the Probation and Parole Service who, as is commonly the case, have conducted an actuarial assessment of his risk of re-offending. That placed him in the low risk category relative to other male sexual offenders. His prospects of rehabilitation would thus appear to be at least reasonable.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty to each of these offences although not before being committed for trial to this Court. He was not arraigned until the first day of his trial on which day his pleas of guilty were entered, but he had indicated at various times to the prosecution since being committed for trial his intention to plead guilty. Although his willingness to facilitate the course of justice was not the same for all three offences, rather than dividing up a discount specific to each offence, I will reflect the offender’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice by imposing in each case a sentence which is 15 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The facts suggest that there is at least the possibility that the grooming offence would not have continued were it not for the police operative contacting the offender after a period where there was no communication. It is possible also indeed that it would not have come about in the first place were it not for that original telephone call from the person pretending to be Gemma’s uncle.
	
	
	Nor is this a case where the offender was one of those dangerous people obsessed with child sexual assault matters who sits in front of a computer communicating constantly with young girls, grooming them, and downloading child pornography at the same time. The offender’s conduct, while serious as I have mentioned, has a number of unusual features which must of course be reflected in the choice of appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Of course, the offender needs to be punished for what he has done and there needs to be an element of general deterrence built into any sentence imposed upon him. Those two factors require real punishment. The Crown says that only a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate. I have given anxious consideration to whether I should accept that submission. I am not certain that it is an accurate reflection of sentencing principles. Ordinarily, cases of this kind could only result in full-time custody being imposed, but as I have attempted to demonstrate and as Mr Moir more importantly has persuaded me, this is not an ordinary case because of the features I have already spoken about.
	
	
	Of course, any alternative to full-time custody would be irrelevant if the choice of the length of sentence made such alternatives unavailable. Mr Moir concedes that a custodial sentence is required, but seeks to persuade me that it should not be served by way of full-time custody. I agree that a custodial sentence is required and I have determined the appropriate length of the overall sentence that I will impose for these offences. That is likely to be less than two years and accordingly I consider it appropriate, to refer Mr Hicks for his assessment as to whether he is suitable to serve the sentence of imprisonment by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	Accordingly, I remand Mr Hicks for sentence at 10.00 am on Friday 8 May 2015. I will order that Mr Hicks is assessed as to his suitability to serve a sentence by means of an intensive corrections order. Bail is continued for that purpose.

2765761,R v Awad [2015] NSWSC 2106,"Judgment


	
	The Applicant was charged with driving while disqualified on 5 June 2014. He was given bail for that offence. Notwithstanding he is alleged on 15 November 2014 to have supplied a prohibited drug, possess a prohibited drug and dealt with the proceeds of crime being $1670. The drug concerned is cocaine and that supply is an indictable quantity thereof. He was placed on a suspended prison sentence from 1 March 2013 until 28 February 2015 so that at the time of the present offences charged he was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	In addition to the offence of drive whilst disqualified he has been charged with, he has twice been convicted of that offence in the past. It is an offence which suggests that there will be no compliance with court orders including bail conditions. Additionally he has breached bail on two occasions. This is a show cause offence because he was on bail at the time the supply offence was charged. That at least places an onus on the Applicant to justify why he should be granted bail.
	
	
	The Crown in the present case does not have a view either for or against bail in the matter. The proposal is that he should go to live with his parents in Chester Hill. They have written a long letter to the Court demonstrating their support for him and offering to deposit a sum of $50,000 as surety for his bail.
	
	
	I have also a letter from his former employer where he worked as a labourer, who indicates that if his bail application is successful he is happy to re-employ him. Finally there is a letter from his parish priest who speaks well of him and says that he has a wealth of support from his family and the church community.
	
	
	The Applicant does not have a lengthy criminal record and thus far it seems he has avoided custody in fact although he has been given more than one suspended sentence for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm as well as a subsequent offence of driving while disqualified. It would appear therefore that this is his first time in custody, where he has been since 15 November 2014.
	
	
	Whilst not seeking to minimise the seriousness of the drug supply offences, the offence charged is a relatively low order supply offence, as is the dealing with the proceeds of crime. Whilst it is a matter of concern that he has two convictions for driving while disqualified, that he has been again charged with that offence, that the present offences were committed at a time he was on bail and that he has breached bail on two previous occasions, I think that those matters are outweighed by the relative seriousness of the offences; that is the offences charged are at a relatively low level of seriousness.
	
	
	Furthermore, I consider that the support that is being offered to him by a former employer and his parents, who recognise that he has a drug problem which needs addressing will deal adequately with the bail concerns that I have.

		09 September 2016",2015-02-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765783,R v Taskin [2015] NSWDC 61,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Talat Taskin appears today for sentence in relation to three offences, two indictable matters which are to be dealt with in this Court as such and a third matter on a s 166 Certificate. The two indictable offences are offences of demand property in company with menace and robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon which offences were committed in the early hours of 7 August 2013.
	
	
	The demand property in company with menace is an offence contrary to s 99(2) Crimes Act. It has a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. It has no standard non parole period I am informed. The armed robbery matter contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Again it has no standard non parole period.
	
	
	The related offence for which the offender is to be sentenced is an offence of possessing on 8 August 2013, the date as I understand it the prisoner was arrested, a prohibited drug, to wit cannabis leaf of something less than a gram consistent with personal use. I propose in relation to the related offence, bearing in mind the prisoner will be sentenced to a further term of custody, rather than fine him, which might otherwise be an appropriate penalty, to impose a relatively short term of imprisonment which will be concurrent with one of the terms of imprisonment that I am required to impose.
	
	
	The prisoner is a co-accused of a man I sentenced on 18 December 2014, Mr Chaker. Mr Chaker pleaded guilty to the same offences with which this prisoner is concerned and to be sentenced for today. Mr Chaker was committed for sentence to the District Court and in respect to the sentences imposed upon him he received discounts of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence in each case to recognise the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The remarks on sentence in relation to Mr Chaker were not ordered for the appearance of Mr Taskin. The reason Mr Taskin and Mr Chaker were separate was simply because, although they initially came before me together when proceedings were conducted in October this year in which the two offenders provided evidence, the proceedings were adjourned for further reports. Particularly relating to Mr Taskin’s situation at Odyssey House where he had been resident since December last year.
	
	
	When the matter came back before me, if my memory serves me correctly and I don’t have a record of this in front of me, maybe four or five days before 18 December, Mr Chaker who had remained in custody throughout the period of time was ready to proceed but Mr Taskin was not. Thus, Mr Taskin’s matter was adjourned to last Friday, 30 January 2015, and Mr Chaker’s matter was concluded and I remanded him for a few days for sentence and imposed sentence on 18 December 2014.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Chaker in respect of the armed robbery matter I sentenced him to a total sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 1 year and 6 months to commence 6 months into a sentence I imposed in relation to the demand property in company with menaces. In relation to that offence I sentenced him to a total sentence of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 months. Thus the effective sentence I imposed upon Mr Chaker was 4 years and 6 months with an effective non parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	I made a finding of special circumstances in relation to each of the sentences I imposed. The reason I fixed a non parole period in relation to the demand property with menaces sentence was to permit his release to parole before the expiration of that sentence. He had no matters on a s 166 Certificate.
	
	
	In respect of the remarks on sentence in relation to Mr Chaker I obviously canvased facts in relation to the matter that were common in all respects to both Mr Taskin and Chaker. Not that they necessarily played the same role in relation to each of the offences. Although the remarks on sentence that I gave in December have not been transcribed, as it transpired I had typed notes of my remarks on sentence that I had prepared myself and I can rely upon those typed notes to reiterate matters that arose in Mr Chaker’s which are pertinent to the sentencing of Mr Taskin.
	
	
	I do not propose to repeat the facts as set out in Mr Chaker’s sentencing proceedings. Those facts as they were outlined can be taken as read for the purposes of the sentencing of Mr Taskin. I pause to point out, as I will examine in a moment, Mr Taskin is approximately 20 years older than Mr Chaker. Mr Chaker was a person with a shorter criminal history than Mr Taskin but, at the time of the commission of the offences with what I am concerned, was on parole in relation to an armed robbery matter. Mr Taskin has no prior findings of guilt in relation to offences of this type and was not on parole, although he was subject to conditional liberty in that he was on bail in relation to offences that have subsequently been dealt with in the Local Court on 20 February 2014 by an order pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 herein after referred to as the Act and a fine.
	
	
	The first issue, however, before dealing with the similarities and dissimilarities of the two offenders in terms of their antecedents and subjective circumstances is to note that whilst I acknowledge that this prisoner, Mr Taskin, was “considerably older” than Mr Chaker the facts make it abundantly clear that Mr Chaker played a leading role in each offence making relevant demands and when necessary undertaking transactions at the nearby ATM in respect of the armed robbery matter and the like, quoting my remarks in sentencing Mr Chaker. 
	
	
	There is little evidence in the facts that Mr Chaker was directly influenced by the co-accused, although I accept he was considerably less mature than Mr Taskin. The facts are clear that there is regular reference to the conduct of Mr Chaker in perpetrating the offences or executing the offences whilst Mr Taskin at various times stood or remained silently by. Thus, in terms of the comparison between the two prisoners concerning their respective roles, acknowledging of course that they were part of a joint criminal enterprise, Mr Taskin’s pleas of guilty represent his acknowledgment of that fact, it can be fairly said that there is some slight difference between this prisoner and Mr Chaker in terms of their respective moral culpability, if that is the correct expression, on the objective facts so far as the demand money with menaces matter is concerned. But it is clear on the facts that there is greater culpability of Mr Chaker over Mr Taskin in respect of the offence of armed robbery given the observations I made in the sentencing of that prisoner on the previous occasion.
	
	
	Of course I must then weigh up a number of other considerations. There are a number of similarities between the two offenders. Both prisoners had backgrounds of dependency upon prohibited drugs. Mr Chaker had a mental disability which amounted to an intellectual handicap. Mr Taskin has a long-standing mental disability which amounts to a mental illness.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to note, as I have already pointed out, that Mr Chaker was entitled to a 25% discount upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for each offence having regard to his pleas of guilty at the Local Court and the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty.
	
	
	This offender pleaded guilty in respect of the armed robbery matter at the Local Court and was committed for sentence on 20 March 2014, but was committed for trial in relation to the demand property in company with menace. I do not wish to go into the appropriateness of him being committed for trial, that is neither here nor there.
	
	
	I note the specific written submissions about this matter by learned counsel Mr Brasch for the prisoner Mr Taskin, who has skilfully represented his interests in these proceedings. But noting what was said about this matter in submission and the information helpfully provided by Mr Brasch it is my view in accordance with the discretion available pursuant to Thomson and Houlton that the appropriate discount for a plea of guilty entered on arraignment in respect of the demand property with menaces matter is 15%, as was essentially submitted by the Crown.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the scheme of things, it has no effective disadvantage for this prisoner given the structure of the sentence. In that respect I would ask that the remarks I made to prisoner before I was interrupted by the jury’s question before I commenced these remarks on sentence, in which I tried to explain to the prisoner that the sentences to be imposed should be included in my remarks on sentence on this occasion.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence before me on two occasions. He gave evidence a number of months ago and then gave evidence again when the matter resumed last Friday. It is part of the fabric of the matter that this prisoner, when the matter first came before me when I was doing a sentence list, appeared in circumstances where he was then on Supreme Court bail undertaking a rehabilitation course at Odyssey House. I have evidence in the form of reports from Odyssey House, one particularly dated 14 October 2014 and various certificates of accomplishment which I have taken into account.
	
	
	The report from Odyssey House noted that the prisoner had been in the program since release on bail by order of the Supreme Court since 11 December 2013. He had been through various levels or phases of the program and had been making considerable progress during that period of time. The report dated 14 October 2014 said that the prisoner had shown “significant growth during his time in the Odyssey House program” and that he had been compliant at all times and undertaken advice and undertaken various programs and “push(ed) himself for the best of his ability in order to progress throughout the program and achieve a healthy lifestyle.” The report also said that he “demonstrated that he has developed empathy by working well with clients within the detoxification unit and new residents to the program” and he would benefit from completing the program.
	
	
	Unfortunately things went array for Mr Taskin after he appeared before me that first time and he gave evidence that he had some difficulties after he first gave evidence before me. I accept that his lack of motivation, as it may have been described by him or in reports about the matter, is derived more from what he would describe as circumstances that may have been beyond his control. He had ear infections which although medically cleared affected his capacity to understand directions he was given and to respond. Ultimately he was discharged from the program in November 2014 before he returned to appear before me in December, at which time I was forced to revoke his bail respecting the orders made by the Supreme Court in December last year.
	
	
	I accept from the evidence he gave on the last occasion that even though he had been out of the Odyssey House program since November up until the time that I remanded him in custody he had been drug free. He expressed the intention not to use any prohibited drugs again. He had been a user of prohibited drugs for over 20 years.
	
	
	The evidence he gave before me back in October was concerned with a number of aspects of this sentencing proceeding. He expressed remorse for his actions saying that at the time he was “not in the right frame of mind”. He had been taking his medication for his long standing mental illness of many years “on and off” and had been using methamphetamine. He said that he had been hearing voices and felt scared at the time and he was “all over the place”. He understood the need for him to maintain his medication and gave some details of the living circumstances at the time of the offending and his parents circumstances. He gave evidence about the Odyssey House program. He said in his evidence to me that he “wanted to go back to the community as a changed person” and that Odyssey House had been “the hardest thing” he had ever had to do. His ultimate wish is to return to Turkey, the home of his father, and to participate in a family farm that exists there. He said his father had returned to live in Turkey, although his father is with us today and has been here over the last week visiting his son.
	
	
	Although he conceded in cross-examination that he had not been on medication he said that he had been endeavouring to get a proper assessment from Caritas and he had also been taking methadone from a methadone clinic. He had used methadone over a number of years. The drug that he would normally take to abate the conditions of his mental illness was Seroquel and he said that he believed that taking methlyamphetamine had caused him to hear voices. He said that before he undertook the Odyssey House program he had never been on a residential program before.
	
	
	The background of the prisoner about which he spoke is discussed in the report of Dr Nielssen and in reports from the Probation and Parole Service. All of this has to be seen of course in the context of his criminal history, or his criminal history may be seen in the context of this background of mental illness to which I will refer in a moment.
	
	
	The prisoner was born in 1972. Mr Chaker, I hasten to say, was born in 1993. He has a number of findings of guilt at the Children’s Court and then at the Local Court dating back to 1990. Many of his appearances in the Local Court are for summary offences, assaults, minor acts of dishonesty, driving matters, breaching apprehended domestic violence orders, malicious damage and the like. There is one finding of guilt in the Local Court for assaulting a person with intent to prevent apprehension for which he received what was then a good behaviour bond under the Crimes Act.
	
	
	As I have earlier said he has a lengthy history, much lengthier than Mr Chaker, and a large number of findings of guilt, as I read his criminal history, up until now had been dealt with in the Local Court. He does have a finding of guilt for supplying a prohibited drug in 2000 but was given a s10 bond on condition that he undertake psychiatric treatment. It would appear from the record, that whilst he has a great body of antisocial behaviour, many findings of guilt could be seen to be related either to his mental illness or to his long term dependence on or use of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a report on 7 October 2014. Dr Nielssen is a well-respected forensic psychiatrist who is retained equally as I would understand it in my experience by both Crown and defence. He notes that so far as his treatment or his history is concerned in terms of psychiatric history and medical treatment that the offender had had contact with mental health services going back to the early 1990’s when his criminal history started. The prisoner told Dr Nielssen that he had been treated by a psychiatrist, Dr Wong, in Macquarie Street for 8 years between 1992 and 2000 and had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and had been treated with a range of medications.
	
	
	His symptoms through the 1990’s included hearing voices, seeing things and feeling very depressed. He had been previously admitted to Caritas, the psychiatric ward of St Vincent’s Hospital, on three occasions for around 2 weeks at a time, consistent with what would be I would expect substantial psychotic episodes. He had been detained as an involuntary patient. He could not remember being treated by long acting injections such as Modecate as a condition of a community treatment order. His current medication scheme when Dr Nielssen saw him was a potent antidepressant, as it was described, called Efexor and a moderate dose of a tranquilising drug to take at night. He was seeing a psychiatrist regularly at Odyssey House.
	
	
	The offender also reported a traumatic brain injury in 1992 which left him over a period of time confused with gaps in memory. He gave the history of his drug use. So far as his personal background is concerned he came from Turkey to Australia at the age of two. he said his mother had problems with health. He had a middle brother who worked as a software technician but his younger brother had a mental illness as well. He gave details of casual work and some education. He had some relationships over a period of time but it would appear, as he explained to Dr Nielssen, that a number of his criminal offences had an association with some paranoia, particularly in relation to police.
	
	
	The assessment of Dr Nielssen was that he was primarily a diagnosis of schizophrenia based upon the history provided by the prisoner. He said there was little way of objective signs of residual illness at the time of interview. Factors contributing to the development of a chronic form of this mental illness include an inherited vulnerability to psychosis, serious head injury and the use of drugs that might trigger psychosis, particularly cannabis and methamphetamine.
	
	
	He also diagnosed a “substance use disorder” made on the basis of a history of use of drugs and the harmful effects. The role of drug use in triggering episodes of mental illness was noted and its relationship to the recent offences with which I am concerned. He thought that disorder was in remission given the prisoner’s treatment at Odyssey House. He noted that the prisoner reported that at the time of the offence he was affected by a combination of methamphetamine, alcohol and symptoms of mental illness triggered by drug use, insomnia and non-adherence to treatment and also his association with his co-accused. I have taken that report into account and it would appear entirely uncontroversial.
	
	
	The prisoner was in Odyssey House, as I am informed from the information available to me, for 11 months and 10 days. He was discharged on 21 November 2014. One of the matters that was requested and ordered by me was an up to date presentence report, and I have a report dated 29 January 2015. This reports upon his discharge from Odyssey House because of his “failure to engage in the program”. It was said that he actively failed to participate in daily functions. As I have pointed out there would appear to be a significant deterioration in his cooperation at Odyssey House between 14 October and 21 November consistent I would think with the matters identified by Mr Taskin in his evidence. He was given opportunities to address his poor attitude but Odyssey House felt he was unmotivated to continue and he was discharged.
	
	
	It was noted so far as his association with the Community Corrections Service was concerned over a period of time, marked by a number of periods of supervision, that his engagement had been superficial, that he had a lack of insight into his offending behaviour and also his recent disengagement with the Odyssey House program had raised a question of his motivation. The reporter noted that “it was quite disappointing that he failed to complete Odyssey House which raises concern about his ability to commit to and complete a further program targeted to his offending behaviour.” The Community Corrections Service said that although he was suitable for a period of supervision his engagement in case management in the community was doubtful and I have made those observations of the prisoner.
	
	
	There are a number of issues that arise out of the evidence in the case. Of course the time spent in custody will be taken into account. I refused bail in December and he appears from custody now. The prisoner had been in custody for several months before being granted bail in the Supreme Court. I am informed by the parties that he spent 5 months and 21 days in full-time custody up until last Friday and I have made my calculations for backdating the sentence from last Friday. Also there is the period of time that he was at Odyssey House which totals just short of 12 months.
	
	
	There are several decisions which deal with the question of recognition in appropriate cases of time spent in a quasi-custodial setting. One case I was referred to by learned counsel for the prisoner was R v Renshaw [2012] NSWCCA 91, a judgment of the learned Chief Judge of Common Law, Hoeben J where his Honour surveyed a number of authorities with which I am familiar beforehand, Campbell from 1999, Delaney from 2013 and Hughes from 2008.
	
	
	Over many years, in New South Wales at least, courts have been prepared with the approval of the Court of Criminal Appeal to permit a percentage of a time spent in quasi-custody to be acknowledged as time spent in custody, subject to appropriate evidence or knowledge of the character of the rehabilitation centre in question, with discounts of up to 50% or even sometimes beyond recognised. In a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Browne v R [2013] NSWCCA 44, her Honour, Fullerton J for the Court, expressed views, judging from the calculations she undertook quoting extensively from the judgment of Hoeben J to which I referred (see [21]), that a discretionary range of between 50% and 75% of the actual time spent in residential rehabilitation based on the circumstances of the individual case can be allowed. In this matter I believe a discount of 50% is sufficient in all of the circumstances and I understand there was no submission put to the contrary by learned counsel for the prisoner.
	
	
	Of course touching upon this matter is the prisoner’s mental illness, a significant matter in the case, as was the mental disability suffered by Mr Chaker a significant matter in the sentencing of that prisoner. Both the learned counsel for the prisoner cited in his written submissions the well known decision of Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 particularly at [33]-[36]. I am very familiar with Hemsley, not only for the many times that I have been referred to it or had referred to it in judgments, but I actually sentenced Ms Hemsley subsequent to her appearance in the Court of Criminal Appeal and applied ‘Hemsley principles’ to Ms Hemsley.
	
	
	A more detailed exposition upon the matters very skilfully identified by Sperling J is set out in the judgment of the former learned Chief Judge of Common Law, McClellan J in the decision of DPP (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSW CCA 194, at [177].
	
	
	His Honour referred to a range of authorities even more extensive than the authorities referred to by Sperling J and he stated that:
	


“Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing. They can be summarised in the follow manner:

“Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence.”


	
	In my view I hasten to say that is one matter that applies here subject to some comments I need to make about some authorities helpfully referred to me by the Crown.
	
	
	He went on to say further:
	


“It may also have the consequence that the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which may otherwise have been imposed.”


	
	In my view again that applies here, to some extent subject to the matters raised by the learned Crown.
	
	
	Further his Honour said:
	


“It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person because the sentence will be more onerous for that person. The length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced.”


	
	That certainly applies here notwithstanding anything that appears in the judgments referred to by the learned Crown.
	


“Further it may reduce or eliminate the significance of special deterrence. Conversely it may be that because of the person’s mental illness (that person) presents more of a danger to the community.”


	
	I do not believe this prisoner presents as a “danger to the community”. It is interesting to note that, notwithstanding his mental illness, there is no suggestion in the facts that he exhibited paranoid or other symptoms such as consistent with psychosis such as to accentuate the threat that was made to the respective victims.
	
	
	The learned then Chief Judge of the Common Law Division also went on to say at [178]:
	


“I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of a modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence.”


	
	It might be fairly said when comparing what his Honour said to what Sperling J said that his Honour has in surveying a greater range of authority brought fresh nuances to bear and fresh matters to take into account in this difficult area of sentencing.
	
	
	The issue of the circumstances of custody being more onerous as a consequence or because of the prisoner’s mental illness was in my view demonstrated most admirably, or perhaps disconcertingly although I make no criticism of anyone, from the fact that this prisoner when I remanded him in custody last December was the subject of a request by me directly made to Corrective Services that he be immediately medically assessed when he returned to prison custody and receive all appropriate medication. The prisoner could not take medication with him as I would understand it.
	
	
	Now in fairness to the situation as I understand it, and I appreciate I do not have any evidence from the doctors that assessed him on his admission to Corrective Services, he was assessed by Justice Health on admission to custody. The prisoner grumbled about the fact he was not getting the right levels of medication. These are matters of professional judgment and there is nothing really I can comment upon without hearing the other side of the story. But I accept, at least, that the prisoner felt that the medication he was receiving was not adequate to his needs. Be that as it may, what did emerge from his evidence was that through no fault of Corrective Services, I hasten to say, he was not taken directly to Corrective Services custody and thus put in the hands of Justice Health. He was taken to the Sydney Police Centre and kept there for a week with what I understand from the prisoner’s account, and I have got no reason to doubt this, only cursory medical assessment and no medication. This is quite regrettable. It is interesting to note today in the Sydney Morning Herald a report says that there are now over 11,000 people in custody and police are complaining, and rightfully so, that they are being forced through overcrowding to “babysit” people on remand that they otherwise would not be responsible for.
	
	
	Some of the prisoner’s evidence I must approach with some circumspection, but the bald facts speak of the types of difficulties that arise for a person with a mental illness in custody. Usually through no fault of theirs, and sometimes through no fault of the authorities, which of course must be considered in accordance with what was said by Sperling J and by McClellan CJ at CL.
	
	
	In this regard I hasten to say I read very closely the two judgments that the learned Crown Prosecutor referred to but, which were not available to hand up to me on Friday, one of the reasons I adjourned the matter to today. One of those judgments is the decision of Cicekdag v R, [2007] NSWCCA 218, I particularly noted the observations that are made by the Court at [38]-[42], and another judgment of Clay v R [2007] NSWCCA 106.
	
	
	In the decision of Clay, which was the first in time, Howie J in his usual erudite way but with not quite the precision subsequently revealed in De La Rosa, discussed the relevance of a mental illness or disorder in the sentencing process. I do not need to go through the discussion. He criticised the sentencing judge in that matter for not undertaking any analysis of the medical evidence before him. He made the observation, obviously that I take into account, that was referred to in the judgment of Engert in 1996 by Gleeson CJ that the fact that an offender is suffering from some form of mental illness or disorder does not necessarily mean that a lesser sentence will be imposed than if the offender had not been suffering from that mental disorder. Obviously, for example, where specific deterrence is to be given greater weight. A classic example of that is the situation of Robert Vincent Veen from 1998 in the decision of the High Court.
	
	
	He also said:
	


“The existence of a mental disorder may mean the culpability of the offender is reduced to whether the full measure of general deterrence is not appropriate or that imprisonment will be more harsh. It may also be that the offender presents as a danger to the community. Some measure of preventative detention is required.”


	
	Of course no element of preventative detention arises here. He went on to say at para [25] - [26] that:
	


“The prisoner in that matter failed to take his medication, used illegal drugs and thus caused him to commit serious criminal offences. This was not the first occasion that the applicant’s mental state had deteriorated under these circumstances. He had previously come under psychiatric care for that reason and had been told that he was to continue to take his medication and avoid drugs. The prisoner in that matter had “chosen” to stop taking medicine on this occasion and used illegal drugs. He must have known that this was likely to make him mentally unstable. The result is that he became irrational and aggressive and the offences were committed.”


	
	He was not persuaded thus that the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation were strong and thus less weight would be given to his mental illness as reducing his criminal culpability and more weight should be given to personal deterrence. Whilst there are some features of what his Honour talked about in Clay here, it is not the same type of case. It is not suggested for a start that in the facts of the case the prisoner’s conduct exhibited manifestations of his mental illness. Certainly his mental illness was a relevant matter to the offending, but in a far more subtle way than were the facts in Clay. Likewise in relation to the decision in Cicekdag where Clay was referred to and the Court referred to:
	


“The mental disorder was caused to a significant degree by the applicant’s drug addiction.”


	
	This is not that case. I am mindful of a caution that must be exercised, but there are distinctions between those cases and this.
	
	
	I have taken into account the guideline judgement of Henry (1999) 46 NSW LR 346. I specifically refer to that in the other case and the observations I made are to be considered in this case. I am mindful of the guideline which appears at [162] - [165] and also the matters of aggravation that arise and are discussed by the learned Chief Justice at [170].
	
	
	I am also mindful of the relevance of drug dependency in offending of this type set out by Wood J, then the Chief Judge at Common Law at [273] of that judgment. The truth of the matter is of course that the guideline judgment is to be seen as providing structure and guidance to sentencing. The learned Chief Justice himself acknowledged at [10], the judgment of Acting Chief Justice Mahoney in Lattouf, an unreported judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal:
	


“General principles must of their nature be of justice to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. For this reason it is in my opinion important in the public interest that the sentencing process recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing judge. There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles that will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it. But there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard. These are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve, paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in any individual case.”


	
	Of course in this matter there are many common features between this prisoner and the co-accused relating to aggravating factors as well as mitigating factors pursuant to s 21A(2)(3) of the Act. Both prisoners have common aggravating factors of being on conditional liberty, although the other offender was on parole, this prisoner was on bail. In the circumstances, and I emphasise the word “in the circumstances”, this breach of conditional liberty by this prisoner is not as severe as that of the other offender, although he was very much less mature.
	
	
	Also, in relation to the second offence in term, the armed robbery, was an offence committed “in company” which is not a pleaded aggravation and that must be taken into account.
	
	
	Mitigating matters in relation to both offenders were few. The prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded. There were the pleas of guilty. I accept the prisoner’s remorse as genuine.
	
	
	One of the dominating matters to take into account is of course the purposes of sentencing under s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There are a number of the purposes there identified that are important subject to of course consideration of the principles set out in De La Rosa, including weight and general deterrence, specific deterrence, denunciation, punishment, adequate punishment and also of course promoting the rehabilitation of the offender.
	
	
	Particularly one matter of importance is the issue of parity or disparity of sentencing. The matter was very neatly summarised by his Honour Rothman J in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Jimmy v R in which his Honour, one of three judges who each discussed parity principles, cited Aristotlean principles of “equality”, noting that the very essence of equal justice and the parity of sentencing was that alike shall be treated alike and unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of any un-alikeness. Thus, the likeness or un-alikeness of the two offenders are very closely examined to ensure an appropriate sentence for each.
	
	
	I have taken into account all the matters that were put in submission by the respective parties and that is self-evident by the matters I have cited. Written submissions were very helpful from the learned counsel for the accused. Those and the oral submissions particularly identified the mental condition of the prisoner, his prospects of rehabilitation, the time spent in custody and the issue of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act. The Crown was helpful in its identification of the aggravating factors and of course taking me to the two authorities that I have cited. I have obviously had regard to them in these reasons. 
	
	
	Dealing with the issue of special circumstances I need to address the issue of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 [45] where the majority of the High Court dealing with a conviction appeal noted that in sentencing an offender for multiple offences it is appropriate to sentence the offender, not in a global way but by fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and then by regard to the totality of the criminality reflect that with appropriate accumulation and concurrency.
	
	
	That is the way I approached Mr Chaker and that is the way I approached this prisoner. It seems to me given the very significant commonality of features of the objective offending that there should be some partial accumulation. The two offences, as I pointed out in the facts I stated in Chaker, were very close in time and were in the same area of Woolloomooloo/East Sydney and have a very close relationship to one another given their respective mental states of the two offenders. But there must be some partial accumulation. Thus coming back to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that is a “special circumstance”.
	
	
	I have noted what the Community Corrections Services report has said in its most recent report but I believe in the context of the prisoner’s criminal history and his history of mental illness that there still is a substantial need for an extended period of supervision and guidance to assist the prisoner to adjust to community living and to ensure that he maintains the use of the appropriate medication when he is in the community. I accept the general proposition that when the prisoner is on his medication and not using prohibited drugs he is capable of a law abiding lifestyle to a considerable extent.
	
	
	Coming back to the issue of the prospects of rehabilitation, the reason I am circumspect about those is because given his mental illness and his background of the use of drugs. Noting what he said of course when he gave evidence before me last week, his prospects of rehabilitation are very much dependent upon the use of appropriate medication and avoidance of cannabis and amphetamine type substances.
	
	
	Thus, hopefully having taken everything into account, I turn to the issue of making the appropriate orders. Would you mind standing up Mr Taskin.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of demanding property with menaces in company you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non parole period of 12 months to date from 17 February 2014, expiring on 16 February 2015. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of 1 year and 10 months which will date obviously 17 February 2015 and that would expire on my calculation on 16 December 2016.
	
	
	In relation to the armed robbery matter you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non parole period of 1 year and 3 months. That sentence will date from 17 August 2014 and the non parole period will expire on 16 November 2015. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of 2 years and 3 months. That balance of sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 16 February 2018.
	
	
	You can take a seat sir. That means you will be eligible for release to parole on 16 November 2015, but that will be a matter for the Parole Authority. In relation to the later offence of possession of a very small amount of cannabis you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of 1 month imprisonment. That term of imprisonment will date from 17 February 2014 and will have expired on 16 March 2014.
	
	
	I order that the cannabis be destroyed.

2765785,R v Cobb [2015] NSWDC 66,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: All armed robberies are serious, but some are more serious than others. I have an example of a serious armed robbery before me at the moment as I am called to sentence Nash Steven Cobb. He was convicted by a jury of one offence of armed robbery. That trial was conducted before her Honour Judge Wilson SC as she then was. As a result of her Honour’s elevation, I am to sentence Mr Cobb for what he did.
	
	
	While on parole and while under the effects of drugs, the offender and two other men disguised themselves and went into a hotel in Merewether. The hotel was closing for the night, but there were still a number of patrons and bar staff there. The offender had a very frightening weapon with him. It was described as a sword or machete. One of the other offenders, a man called Lane, also had a machete and the third, a man called McGee, had a large knife. Tendered in the trial, but not before me on sentence, was CCTV footage of the relevant events.
	
	
	The offenders turned up in a stolen car. The offender went into the hotel first with the others behind him. Once inside the offenders told those patrons and staff who remained in the hotel to lie on ground. One of the patrons, a man called Mr Sandoz, was not immediately compliant. This caused the offender to first poke him with the weapon he had, striking him with the weapon. Lane then hit the unfortunate Mr Sandoz with the machete to his neck and head and forced him onto the ground. Fortunately for Mr Sandoz and fortunately very much for the offenders including Mr Cobb, Mr Sandoz suffered only minor injuries. Another patron also resisted. He threw a glass at the perpetrators which caused Mr Cobb to throw two glasses and an ice bucket forcibly back at the patron.
	
	
	The offender demanded money from a young lady member of the bar staff, Ms Walker. He held the weapon that he had in his hand very close to her face. He was told that the money was in the office so he ordered her to go towards the office and demand entry. Ms Rickard, another employee, was inside the office. She opened the door, Ms Walker came in and Ms Rickard closed and secured the door before the offender could enter. This did not cause Mr Cobb and his co-offenders to give up. Mr Cobb continued to bash the door and demand entry. Sensibly, in order to protect staff and patrons who were outside the locked door, Ms Rickard opened it.
	
	
	The offender came in and took $30,000 from the desk and the safe. Ms Walker and Ms Rickard then went through a door from the office that leads onto the street. The offender followed them, but then went back to the main door of the hotel and told Lane and McGee to leave. They got into the car, which had been left in a nearby street, and drove away. McGee did not get much; only $1,600, but the rest was split between this offender and Lane, each getting something in the order of $14,000. Some hours after the robbery the offender used part of his proceeds of the robbery to buy a Commodore motor car.
	
	
	A statement of agreed facts, prepared for me because I was not the judge who conducted the trial, indicates that this offender and Lane were the driving force to commit the offence.
	
	
	Very sadly, this is not the offender’s first offence of this type. He has a large number of offences on his criminal history beginning when he was a juvenile. Some of the offences are offences of great seriousness. When he was 16 he was sentenced for assault with intent to rob causing grievous bodily harm. He has been dealt with for an offence of being an accessory after the fact to armed robbery. In August 2010 he was sentenced by Judge Blackmore for offences which included robbery in company, using an offensive weapon to prevent detention and damaging property.
	
	
	Other offences of violence, numerous of them, appear on the offender’s criminal history as well as offences of dishonesty and driving offences. It is very said to relate that the offender has spent an enormous proportion of his life in custody. His time free in the community has been limited indeed, with perhaps the longest period of freedom being the nine months leading up to the commission of the offence for which I must sentence him.
	
	
	The offender is an Aboriginal man born in Walgett. His schooling and work history has obviously been affected by the circumstance that he was detained in Juvenile Justice some months after commencing year 7. He has completed his School Certificate whilst in Juvenile Justice and has done some work, for example, as a landscaper, as a linesman and as a runner for a bookmaker, but on each occasion his period of work has been interrupted by him being sentenced to incarceration.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Bench a psychiatrist, that he grew up “pretty much in custody”. Despite that he has managed to form a relationship. There are two children who live with their mother in Coffs Harbour. Mr Cobb has a number of siblings. He told Dr Bench that a number of his brothers were alcoholics, both his parents have used cannabis all their lives and one of his sisters has been diagnosed with schizophrenia while one of his brothers has been diagnosed with schizophrenia with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
	
	
	The offender has a great deal of trouble with alcohol and drugs. His alcohol consumption is such that he drinks to the extent of having alcoholic blackouts regularly. Consistent with his parental role modelling, he started using cannabis at age 11. He has used drugs such as amphetamines in the past and indeed he had last used opiates, something he only uses whilst in custody, on the morning he was evaluated by Dr Bench. Dr Bench concluded that Mr Cobb met diagnostic criteria for a number of illnesses and disorders; poly-substance dependence, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified in remission, and antisocial personality disorder. He was treated with anti-psychotic medication at the time he saw Dr Bench and not using amphetamines which Dr Bench concluded it was a reason that Mr Cobb was free from psychotic symptoms and had been for some time.
	
	
	The prospects of Mr Cobb’s rehabilitation are bleak, of course, given his extensive criminal history, but one glimmer is provided by his compliance with his anti-psychotic medication and another glimmer of hope is to be found in the circumstance that he has received only one charge an institutional nature whilst in custody of, that is, an offence described as “throw article” which took him 28 days off a number of otherwise enjoyable activities in gaol.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offender was on parole at the time of this offence. He had actually been doing reasonably well for a while, living with his partner and their children in Coffs Harbour, but when he was forced to move out of home as a result of an incident and came back to Newcastle he soon resorted to his old ways using drugs and mixing with people such as Mr Lane. After his arrest for this matter on 10 December 2012 his parole was of course revoked. He served the balance of the sentence imposed by Judge Blackmore until 3 July 2013. Of course, it is a seriously aggravating factor that the offender was on parole at the time of this offence, however, I have to be careful not to double count. I have decided to commence the sentence that I will announce on Mr Cobb from 3 July 2013.
	
	
	I should make it clear, I suppose, that I have made a finding that the offender has a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law. He needs to be personally deterred from doing what he has done for many years of his life. One day, and we all hope this is sooner rather than later, Mr Cobb is going to realise the futility of the life he has been leading. There are many things in the community, enjoyable, things, which simply are not available in custody. Mr Cobb will one day realise that he has missed out on a lot of those things. He only has one life to lead and if he continues as he has been, his life will be wasted.
	
	
	Of course, I have to take into account the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346, but there are many factors in this case which are significantly different from the ordinary case postulated by Spigelman CJ. This offender has far from a limited criminal history. He did not plead guilty. He was in company at the time of the offence and actual violence was inflicted. All of those factors mean that a much longer sentence than that proposed in the guideline judgment is appropriate.
	
	
	I should mention two particular circumstances regarding Mr Cobb’s life which I have taken into account. The first is that remarkably, and yet it would seem truthfully, he has told people that as a 13-year-old he was sexually assaulted by two Juvenile Justice workers. The consequences for Mr Cobb at having been the victim of such an offence are obvious. They were scarcely likely to assist him, a young boy with significant challenges already, in making the right decisions as a youth. The other factor concerns a physical injury that he suffered; extensive burns to a significant part of his body. I am satisfied that those two circumstances will mean that the offender’s time in custody will be harder than it would otherwise have been. I have taken, as I have said, those circumstances into account.
	
	
	I should also mention the principles of parity. Quite appropriately, the sentences imposed on Mr Lane and Mr McGee were made known to me, as was information concerning such things as their background and criminal history. I have to be careful to ensure that the offender does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares his sentence with those imposed on Mr Lane and Mr McGee.
	
	
	I note, for example, that both of them pleaded guilty and Mr McGee’s sentence was further reduced by an undertaking to give evidence against this offender. I note that they were also sentenced in relation to other matters. I have certainly taken parity into account in deciding the sentence to impose upon this offender and indeed I have to say that were it not for the other sentences, I would have imposed upon this offender a significantly longer sentence.
	
	
	Mr Moir made submissions to me that I would find special circumstances in the offender’s favour. I will accept that submission. Quite clearly the offender will need an enormous amount of assistance if he is to avoid becoming one of those sad people we see from time to time who realise only far too late that they have wasted their lives by spending most of them in custody. However, the non-parole I am shortly to announce is the minimum that I consider properly reflects the offender’s culpability.
	
	
	I return to where I started. This offence was a very serious one. Three offenders armed with nasty weapons demonstrated that they were prepared to use them. The people involved must have been terrified and this was all so that Mr Cobb and his co-offenders could get a bit of money. Not for them hard work and dedication. For them, obtaining money at the expense of the wellbeing of innocent members of the community was a decision easily and lightly taken.
	
	
	The sentence I will now announce reflects just how wrong the offender’s conduct was. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 3 July 2013. It will expire on 2 July 2018 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of eight years.

2765786,R v Nowland [2015] NSWDC 386,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Often enough in these courts a submission is made that a young person has committed an offence after being influenced by the wrong crowd and, on analysis, it turns out that the offender appearing for sentence is the person who has influenced others and that he was ""the wrong crowd"". But in this case I am satisfied that Dean Charles Nowland has committed the offences for which I must sentence him, one of them being on a Form 1, after coming under the influence, in quite sad circumstances, of former friends and now that he is no longer under their influence he has good prospects of living, from this day forward, a law abiding life.
	
	
	I have to sentence Mr Nowland for an offence of attempted armed robbery. When I sentence him I am to take into account an offence of concealing a serious offence.
	
	
	The attempted armed robbery arose in the following circumstances: Staff at a sports club in Summerland Point, south of Newcastle, closed the premises one evening. There were three staff members left inside dealing with the night’s takings. There were CCTV cameras around the premises and at one stage one of the staff members noticed a man standing at the front entrance with what appeared to be a crowbar in his hands.
	
	
	Staff quite quickly realised that that man was up to no good. They secured the cash in the safe and phoned police. They remained inside the office and tried to remain quiet. They could not see anything on the CCTV monitors for about 20 minutes, until they saw three men appear on the CCTV cameras on the rear entrance to the club. They were crouching down, trying to remain out of view. They saw one of the men cover one of the CCTV cameras with something, then on the remaining cameras they were able to see two men make their way onto the back deck of the club and peer through the glass door. They were seen to leave, the object covering the other CCTV camera was removed and the three men disappeared.
	
	
	Police, alerted by the staff members, headed towards the club. They went past a particular car, a Ford Falcon. One of the police officers stopped to check on the car. He noticed that the bonnet was warm, suggesting the car had recently been driven, but could not see anyone inside. Enquiries revealed a hole in a fence at the back of the club and a police dog detected a scent going from the hole in the fence to the area where the car had been observed.
	
	
	It seems that police had been intercepting the telephone call of one of the men involved. Those calls revealed that this offender was also involved. Some considerable time after this offence, indeed about 14 months later, Mr Nowland was arrested. He made admissions to his role in the attempted armed robbery.
	
	
	It is important to understand what his role was. It turns out that at the time the police officer looked in the car the offender was actually inside, crouching down out of view. He went with three others to the area where the club was, knowing full well that there was to be an armed robbery, seeing that at least one of them was armed and that they were equipped with cable ties, with which they could restrain the staff members.
	
	
	The offender’s role was to remain in the car and look after it. He was not one of those who approached the club and he was not one of those seen on the CCTV cameras. His role was more minor compared to the others.
	
	
	I hinted at something before when I mentioned the sad circumstances which led to the offender mixing with the wrong crowd. Mr Nowland’s father died of a heart attack when he was quite young. He lived with his mother for a while but left home whilst still at school and ended up living with a friend of his named Cecil Dungay. Cecil Dungay was one of the three men who were seen on the CCTV footage. The other two were his brother, Benjamin and another man by the name of Luke Talbot.
	
	
	For a while this offender was under their influence. He committed two offences of break, enter and steal with them. He was dealt with for those offences and received a suspended sentence and a community service order. However, since being charged with this offence, Mr Nowland has ceased contact with them, except in one particular instance which I will refer to in due course.
	
	
	Mr Nowland’s break with the Dungays has been such that he is now prepared to give evidence against any of the three men, should that be necessary. Only one, Benjamin Dungay, has thus far been charged. His matter is listed for mention in this Court tomorrow, following committal for trial.
	
	
	At court one day the offender was threatened. There was obviously a fear that he would assist the authorities. That is the only contact he has had with the Dungays of recent times.
	
	
	There has been a significant change in Mr Nowland since the commission of the offences. He is living with his mother and sister; he has a casual job with a labour hire company and has been working on average five days a week for some considerable period of time; he has been on a curfew under his bail conditions and has never breached it; he has made new friends through his sister and so the prospects for Mr Nowland are good. What makes them even better is his undertaking to give assistance for the prosecution, should that be necessary. It is hard to imagine a cleaner break from poor influences than that.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity, consistent with the early admissions he made to police when he was approached by them some 14 months after the offence. I will reflect both the plea of guilty and the offender’s assistance, both past and promised, by imposing upon him a sentence which will be 45 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	I should also indicate it has been part of a number of factors which have led to me imposing a different form of sentence on Mr Nowland from that I would otherwise have imposed. I can say that the discount for future assistance is 10 per cent and, in the event that Mr Nowland fails to comply with his undertaking, his sentence should therefore be increased.
	
	
	Of course, the Crown made reference to the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 AcrimR 149 guideline judgment. It is to be noted that there are, as is almost invariably the case, factors in this matter which are different from the commonplace situation postulated in that guideline judgment.
	
	
	Most importantly, of course, this was an attempt. The commission of the offence was thwarted by what appears to have been a decision taken by the three men who approached the club that they could not commit the offence because they could not gain access. Another factor which has to be borne in mind when comparing the Henry guideline is that this offence was committed in company. Working the other way, in the offender’s favour, is the circumstance that the offender’s plea of guilty was early, not of limited utilitarian benefit and, of course, there is the assistance to the authorities on top of that.
	
	
	Ms McLaughlin who appears for the offender submitted that an appropriate sentence in this case would be the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment which was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In discussions with Ms McLaughlin, I raised with her the problem that in the offender’s case a s 12 bond would involve little or no punishment, and may be thought to not reflect the fact that the offender was involved in a very serious offence involving, if it had been successful, terror and perhaps violence committed upon three innocent people.
	
	
	However, Ms McLaughlin submitted and this is a submission I accept, that in the present case there has been a significant component of punishment already. I mentioned the curfew. Allied to that is the circumstance that the offender has had to report three times a week to police for a considerable period. He has been subject to a threat and, as is apparent from his presentation in court, the very process of appearing for sentence has been stressful for him.
	
	
	He must have understood that it was a very real possibility that he would go to gaol, fulltime, where he would be exposed to the possibility of the threat made against him being carried out. In a real sense, he has been punished already because of the commission of this offence.
	
	
	It is for those reasons that, having determined what length of sentence I should impose, I propose to suspend it.
	
	
	Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months. I suspend the execution of that sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, conditioned that the offender enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for the term of that sentence.
	
	
	The conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	He is to be of good behaviour. He is to continue working in paid employment and should, through no fault of his own, his employment be terminated, he is to make constant, active and enthusiastic efforts to obtain new paid employment.
	



	
	He is to continue receiving psychological counselling from Mr Paul Constable for the duration of the bond, unless Mr Constable decides that treatment is no longer necessary or Mr Constable refers him for treatment by someone else.
	



	
	Mr Nowland, I was persuaded today that you are different man from the person you were when you committed this offence, right? I could be wrong, I could have made a mistake. If you come back before me, having committed another offence, I am going to be very disappointed to learn that you have misled me. And the consequences for you are going to be quite significant.
	
	
	What I have done is I have sentenced you to imprisonment but if you stay out of trouble for 18 months you will not have to serve that in prison. If, however, you commit an offence, then I have already sentenced you to imprisonment. So, let me make things very clear to you, Mr Nowland. If you are back before me I will send you to gaol. I will have no hesitation in doing that whatsoever.
	
	
	OFFENDER: I understand.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You have got one chance to stay out of gaol. Take it because if you stuff this up you will be in gaol for 18 months; that is the decision I have already made. Do you understand?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yeah, I understand.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

2765787,R v Robertson [2015] NSWDC 372,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The development of the Internet has brought with it things of great benefit to today’s society, but it has also allowed what I would categorise as an “explosion” in the ability of people to access images of child pornography
	
	
	Before the Internet obtaining such images would have involved very very dark and murky world where attempting to identify those who had possession of such images and were willing to share them carried with it a great risk of being exposed, but now the Internet is apparently, from the number of such cases that come before this Court, a place where access to child pornography is easy.
	
	
	Many cases have spoken about the harm that is caused to children because of the ready availability of such terrible images, that harm includes of course harm to the children the subject of the images. As people access the images the demand for them is created and that demand is satisfied by evil people who abuse children and photograph or video such abuse. Other harms flow from child pornography as well.
	
	
	For that reason sentences imposed on people who like this offender, Paul Anthony Robertson, use a carriage service to access child pornography and possess child abuse material are usually almost invariably severe. Sentences of other than full time custody for offences such as these are rare but it is important not to lose sight of a very relevant circumstance namely, there is a range of seriousness of such conduct and as Mr Krisenthal submits and as the Crown in this case concedes, Mr Robertson’s conduct was very much at the lower end of the scale.
	
	
	He had been accessing and storing child pornography for about five months when his wife discovered what he had been up to. She decided that the matter should be reported to police. To his credit Mr Robertson did not try and persuade her otherwise. So it was that police attended Mr Robertson’s home while he was out on 14 April 2014. Whilst there police found a computer hard drive. The offender arrived home shortly thereafter and in a brief recorded conversation with police he told them he had accessed child pornography on that computer.
	
	
	Police examined a random sample of the images on that computer. A number of image files containing child pornography were discovered. It is estimated that there were something in the order of 1000 such photographs and very importantly it is important to note that the vast bulk of them, perhaps 99% contained images of children in the lowest category of seriousness, namely sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity. A small proportion, perhaps 1%, showed non penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child but none of the images were of a more serious nature in categories 3, 4 and 5 of the scale used under the Child Exploitation Tracking System.
	
	
	This is an important fact to bear in mind and it bears some analysis. In the course of Mr Robertson’s use of the Internet over five months, when he was searching for child pornography it would have been inevitable that he came across images of a more serious kind than those that were ultimately found on his computer. It is clear therefore that he has discriminated in deciding what images to save to his computer and in doing so he has saved only those images at the bottom of the scale.
	
	
	This case is unusual. The images are at the less serious end of the scale both in number and nature. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. Although all offences involving child abuse material are serious not all offences are of the same seriousness and as I have attempted to demonstrate Mr Robertson’s conduct was at the lower end of the scale.
	
	
	Mr Robertson had a happy childhood but has had a sad life in many respects since then. He left home at 15 to become a jockey but was injured and eventually he had to give up that occupation. He married a woman who already had a child and they have had children together but, and this is one of the most important features regarding Mr Robertson’s life, his wife suffers from a significant mental illness. She has been treated, sometimes aggressively, and things have at times improved but as a consequence of her illness the task of caring for and raising the children has largely fallen to him. This has led to him becoming socially isolated and depressed and it was in those circumstances that these offences were committed. He has worked as a taxi driver when he could. Since discovery of these offences he has been required to leave the family home which has allowed him to work more often but which I gather has meant that his mentally ill wife has had to shoulder the burden of looking after the children, a much less satisfactory arrangement than that which was in place before.
	
	
	I am only allowed to take hardship to third parties into account when the circumstances are exceptional. I regard the circumstance regarding Mr Robertson’s wife’s mental illness as being sufficiently exceptional and I can take into account the consequences to Mr Robertson of a sentence, particularly a sentence of full time imprisonment, if such a sentence were imposed upon him.
	
	
	Mr Robertson pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. As far as the Commonwealth offence is concerned, his plea of guilty demonstrates a willingness to assist the course of justice. As far as the State offence is concerned, the plea of guilty has a utilitarian benefit. Whatever the precise reason, in this case I will impose upon Mr Robertson for each offence sentences which are 25% less than they would otherwise have been. The pleas of guilty have also been important in me deciding to impose upon Mr Robertson a different form of sentence from that I would otherwise have imposed.
	
	
	Mr Robertson has no previous criminal convictions and he has been assessed by both a psychologist from whom he is receiving treatment, and by Corrective Service officers, as representing a low risk of reoffending. Part of that finding is no doubt due to what I accept are genuine expressions of remorse on Mr Robertson’s part. Perhaps the best demonstration of his remorse is to be found in what happened when his wife discovered what he had been doing. As I mentioned earlier, he did not try to persuade her to keep things quiet but accepted that she would report his misconduct to police.
	
	
	There is a substantial overlap regarding these two offences. As is almost invariably the case those who possess child abuse material obtain it from the Internet which represents the Commonwealth offence with which Mr Robertson has been charged. However, the circumstance that there are two offences has enabled me to fashion a sentence which overall I believe represents the appropriate outcome in this case.
	
	
	He needs to be sentenced to imprisonment albeit not full time imprisonment in order to reflect the gravity of his wrongdoing. However, imposing a suspended sentence of imprisonment often carries with it no real punishment and in a case where punishment is clearly required, as it almost invariably is, the fact that there is a second count on the indictment enables me to impose punishment in the form of a substantial number of hours of community service. I repeat the overall outcome I believe best reflects the various purposes of sentencing, in particular marking the wrongfulness of Mr Robertson’s crime and punishing him for them while at the same time not losing sight of the need to continue to promote his rehabilitation in the expectation that Mr Robertson’s offences for which I will shortly pass sentence, are very much isolated breaches of the criminal law. The sentence I impose is as follows:
	
	
	For the offence of using a carriage service to access child pornography, the offender is convicted and ordered to perform 400 hours community service.
	
	
	For the offence possessing child abuse material, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months. I suspend the execution of that sentence on condition that Mr Robertson enters into a bond to be of good behaviour for the term of the sentence. The conditions of the bond are as follows:
	
	
	He is to continue to receive treatment from Mr Dieter for the duration of the bond, unless Mr Dieter decides that treatment is no longer necessary or Mr Dieter refers him for treatment by others.
	
	
	In view of his occupation as a taxi driver, he is to notify Roads and Maritime Services of his conviction for these matters within seven days.
	
	
	He is to report to the Wyong office of Community Corrections within seven days in order to begin serving the community service component of the sentence I just imposed.

2765802,R v Wortley [2015] NSWDC 365,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: When Mr Mark Wortley appeared before me on the last occasion last November, things were looking up for him. For reasons which I then expressed, I was persuaded that it was at least possible that I would impose upon Mr Wortley a sentence of imprisonment to be served by means of an intensive corrections order. The matter was adjourned until today for the consideration of a report as to his suitability.
	
	
	Up until fairly recently it appears that he was doing well. Indeed, the report says initially things such as the accommodation was assessed as being suitable, there was a clean urinalysis test on 20 January 2014, but just a few days ago things went dramatically downhill.
	
	
	Mr Wortley is now in custody, bail refused, on fresh charges. He is now not suitable to serve his sentence by means of an intensive corrections order, and he wishes to be sentenced today for the matters for which he appeared before me last November.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is accepted that the only sentence I can impose is one of full time custody.
	
	
	In my remarks last November I set out in very brief detail the circumstances of Mr Wortley’s offending and his subjective circumstances.
	
	
	The new evidence adduced today suggests that Mr Wortley’s prospects of rehabilitation are not as good as I had thought they were.
	
	
	Despite that, I do not propose to impose upon Mr Wortley a sentence longer than that I was contemplating. The circumstance that the sentence will be served by way of full time imprisonment rather than an ICO is enough to reflect the changed circumstances.
	
	
	I should specifically state this. I note that Mr Wortley has spent some two months and eight days in pre-sentence custody. I have taken that into account. I took it into account in considering the likelihood that the sentence I imposed was going to be two years or less. I will not back date the sentence I am about to impose by two months and eight days, but I do specifically state that I have taken it into account in determining the length of the sentence to impose upon Mr Wortley.
	
	
	I will back date the sentence to 3 February 2015, that is the day on which Mr Wortley was re-arrested on those fresh charges. That is to ensure that, if ultimately he is acquitted of those fresh charges, this custody he is currently serving is taken into account.
	
	
	For the offence committed on 11 December 2013, I impose a sentence of imprisonment of nine months. That is to be served by way of a fixed term. I have selected a fixed term because of the sentence I will impose upon the other matter.
	
	
	For the offence of 1 August 2013, I impose a non-parole period of 14 months and a head sentence of two years.
	
	
	The sentences are to have commenced on 3 February 2015.
	
	
	Mr Wortley’s non-parole period will expire on 2 April 2016, on which day he is to be released to parole.
	
	
	As is clear, I have made a finding of special circumstances in Mr Wortley’s favour. They primarily relate to the circumstance that he was doing well until recently, and there would thus be a benefit to both Mr Wortley and the community that he be supervised for an extended period on parole.
	
	
	The drugs are to be destroyed and the matter on the s166 certificate is withdrawn and dismissed.

2765804,R v Johnson [2015] NSWSC 31,"remarks on sentence


	
	Dale Ryan Johnson is to be sentenced on his plea of guilty to the murder of Cheree Anne Lawson at Coomealla near Dareton on 12 March 2013.
	
	
	In sentencing him, I will take into account a further offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the same victim. The fact that there is a further domestic violence offence to be taken into account increases the weight to be given to both personal deterrence and retribution: see Attorney General’s Application No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The offender pleaded guilty on 8 August 2014 in the arraignment list in the Supreme Court. He had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter while the matter was still before the Local Court but that offer was (properly) rejected by the Crown.
	
	
	I am told (and accept) that the matter was never listed for trial and the accused indicated by his early offer to plead guilty to manslaughter that there would be no contest that he was criminally responsible for the death of Ms Lawson. No witnesses were called at the committal hearing and an application for an adjournment in the Local Court was refused. The purpose of the adjournment application was to determine some outstanding issues that may have borne upon a consideration of a defence of substantial impairment which arose from the report of a psychiatrist (Dr Furst). I accept from senior counsel (who unsuccessfully sought the adjournment before the learned Magistrate) that, had that matter been properly considered at that stage, the plea may have been entered prior to committal.
	
	
	The Crown has indicated that the offender is entitled to a discount or reduction in his sentence of “between 15-18%”. In the exercise of discretion, I propose to reduce the sentence by just slightly less than 20% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. In reaching that discretionary judgment, I have taken into account:
	



	
	The early offer to plead guilty to manslaughter;
	
	
	The limited amount of court time that has been expended both in the Local Court and this Court;
	
	
	The fact that the case was never listed for trial; and
	
	
	The likely length of the trial and complexity of the issues, particularly the medical evidence as it bore upon the issue of intention.
	


Controversies between the parties


	
	While the facts are agreed, there remain a number of controversies between the offender and the prosecution.
	
	
	One of those concerns the intention of the offender – that is, did he act with an intention to kill or with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The second is whether the offender should be sentenced on the basis of a loss of self-control or whether any such loss of control is a mitigating feature. The third is the relevance of evidence that the offender was exposed at an early age to alcohol-fuelled violence within his family. Finally, the parties disagree about the proper categorisation of the objective seriousness of this offence and whether, for the purpose of s 54A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), it falls within the middle-range of objective seriousness of all offences contemplated by the crime of murder.
	
	
	To understand my resolution of those disputes, it is necessary to recount the awful factual circumstances that led to the death of Cheree Lawson. As I have said, these facts are agreed.
	
	
	The offender and the deceased had been involved in a relationship for about six months. There had been violence within the relationship and a number of witnesses told police that the offender was jealous of the relationship between Cheree and her former partner (Cale Wallace). On 16 February 2013 the offender committed the offence on the Form 1. This involved hitting the deceased with a brick and seemed to arise as a result of him wanting money for drugs. I now recount the events of the night as agreed between the parties:
	


“16. The deceased had not maintained contact with Cale Wallace during February 2013 but in early March she made contact with him. On the 9th or 10th of March 2013 the deceased told Tanya Taylor that she intended to leave the accused and go to Bendigo with her children and Cale Wallace but not to tell anyone as it was a secret. There is no evidence that the offender ever became aware of this.

17. During Monday the 11th of March 2013 the offender and his mother were at the home of his uncle Brian Carter in Namatjira Avenue where they were drinking.

18. At about 6.40pm the deceased made some purchases at Dareton Mini Mart, drew out $40 cash and then travelled with Cale Wallace and her children to Buronga where the children were dropped off. She and Mr Wallace were dropped off in Mildura by a friend.

19. At 7.16pm she drew $570 from her account with Bendigo bank and at 8.43pm she purchased 2 bottles of Bundaberg rum, four bottles of small Smirnoff vodka & lemonade and some coke. She and Mr Wallace travelled to Dareton by taxi where they were at her grandmother’s place until Mr Wallace went home as he had to work the next day.

20. At 9.30pm the offender left the house of Brian Carter carrying a flagon of port which had been partly drunk. He called in at the home [of] his brother Roger Carter and said he was going to look for some mates.

21. At about 10pm the deceased turned up at the house of Lucy Harris in Neilpo Street in Dareton with the alcohol and some drinking took place.

22. At 11pm Isaiah Johnson was at home at No 36 Silver City Hwy Dareton with his cousin Zac Johnson & the offender who was drinking a flagon of tawny port. They left the house and were seen in a park in Dareton by Jason Smith, Jason Harris, Tony Harris and Gus Williams. The offender and the others spoke with these boys for 10 minutes and they walked off. Isaiah Johnson told police that the accused said to him at this time in relation to Cheree Lawson, “If I catch her with any boy I’m gonna smash her up and the boy.”

23. Between midnight and 12.20am on the 12th of March a taxi driver drove the deceased and 2 other girls to the home of the deceased at Namatjira Avenue and returned for the four boys Jason Smith, Jason Harris, Tony Harris and Gus Williams. Isaiah Johnson was also present at the house. Music was played loudly from a mobile phone set up through a stereo and was heard by neighbours from about 1am. The deceased drank alcohol and danced.

24. A female at the party was told by the deceased that she might go and look for the offender. The offender’s mother says that the deceased came to her house looking for the offender and then left.

25. The offender arrived at her house sometime around 2am and remained in the premises. He was described because of his demeanour as being intoxicated and affected by drugs.

26. A disagreement took place between the offender and the deceased over the music that was playing. The offender was seen to pull the wires out from the stereo. The owner of the stereo became upset with him. He apologised and tried to put the wires back together promising to pay for it.

27. The deceased who was described as legless went outside where she was seen to vomit by one of the women present. The offender took hold of her bag and they left the house and walked a short distance to the home of Raylene Carter the mother of the accused arriving sometime around 3am.

The Offence

28. Ms Carter remembered the time as she was watching a television programme, “Charms” which aired 3.00am-4.00am. Raylene Carter said the two of them were arguing when they arrived. She described the offender as being angry and the deceased being calm and trying to keep the offender calm. Ms Carter said the offender and the deceased were in the kitchen “rowing for a while”.

29. They went into the bedroom where she heard arguing and loud banging noises and what to her sounded to her like 5-6 punches. She heard the deceased say “stop hitting me” and she called through the door for him to stop. He told her to shut up or she would be next.

30. The offender came out of the bedroom at one point and then went back inside. Ms Carter dozed off and was later woken by the offender.

31. He came out of the bedroom crying saying “Help me Help me I think I killed her.” Ms CARTER saw the deceased on the bed in the bedroom. She saw the offender shake the victim to try to get her to move. The offender tried mouth to mouth and at this time Ms Carter ran to Lisa Johnson’s house nearby to get help.

32. During the assault a male resident nearby in Namatjira Avenue heard screams coming from Raelene Carter’s house. The screams would start and stop and this went on for 30 minutes.

33. Lisa Johnson called 000 at 4.45am. The ambulance and one police officer arrived at about 5.17am and the deceased was found to be dead at 5.24am.It appears that the offender had placed the deceased on a mattress in the lounge room and combed out her hair. The offender was seen by a number of persons after he left the house and when questioned about what he had done to the deceased indicated that he was going to kill himself.

34. The offender went nearby to the house of John Mitchell his second cousin. Mr Mitchell heard the offender saying “help me help me”. He spoke to the offender who was crying. They sat on a couch at the front. The offender said, “I think I might have killed her.” When asked “who?” the offender said “Cheree”. Mr Mitchell said he hoped he was joking and the offender said, “I think I did.” At this time the police and ambulance could be seen at the house. Mr Mitchell slapped Dale and he left.

35. The offender and Mr Mitchell have been close all their lives because the offender’s father, Glen Johnson and John Mitchell’s father John Handy are first cousins and John Handy often looked after Glen Johnson’s children. John Mitchell was of the opinion because of previous conversations he had had with him, that the offender was jealous of the deceased.

36. The offender went to the house of his brother Roger Carter at 6am and called out to him. Roger Carter went to the door and saw the accused was crying & upset. The offender said, “I think I killed her.” Roger Carter said, “Are you sure? She maybe just knocked out?” The offender said, “na na Rog. I killed her. I tried to revive her but she wasn’t breathing.” Roger Carter said, “Cheree?” He said, “Yeah bud Cheree.” He was crying and said he wanted to kill himself. They discussed ringing their father. Mr Carter assessed the offender as appearing to be drunk. The offender went to a room to lie down and went to sleep.

37. The offender was arrested at the home of his brother Roger Carter at about 9am on 12 March 2013. He made no admissions to police but was seen to be crying when the allegation was put to him and he was cautioned.”


	
	The accused has been in custody solely in relation to this matter since 12 March 2013 and the sentence that I impose will commence on that date.
	
	
	In relation to the cause of death, the agreed statement of facts continues:
	


“38. The cause of death was given by the pathologist Dr Brian Beer as multiple applications of blunt force trauma to the chest and head. The deceased had multiple injuries such as would occur during a sustained assault. The most extensive injuries were to the chest.

39. Given the injury occasioned by the brick on 16 February 2013 and the potential for “life saving measures” being administered by the accused on 12 March 2013, supplementary reports were provided by Dr Beer and Prof Buckland the Neuropathologist. Dr Beer ruled out any injuries as being caused by “CPR” and Professor Buckland eliminated the injury occasioned on 16 February 2013 as contributing to the victim’s death on 12 March 2013.

40. Dr Beer described in relation to the deceased extensive bilateral, anterior, lateral and posterior rib fractures with right and left pleural haemorrhage. These injuries were sufficient to compromise breathing and lead to death. The left posterior 8th, 9th& 10th ribs were fractured with a second posterior lateral fracture of the 10th rib. There were fractures of the left anterior ribs 1 to 9 with ribs 4 and 5 showing a second fracture. The right 3rd rib had posterior and lateral fractures, the right 4thrib a posterior medial fracture, the right 5th to 9th ribs showed posterior fractures with the 5th, 7th 8th and 9thribs also showing lateral fractures. There were anterior fractures to the right 4th, 5th and 6th ribs.

41. In his additional report, Dr Beer said that the injuries observed to the ribs and tissues indicated “that there had been multiple applications of significant blunt force trauma to all zones of the chest.” Dr Beer in his additional report comments in relation to the head injuries that there was evidence of acute significant blunt force trauma.

42. There was a range of blunt force traumas on the head. There was extensive bruising to the face and skull but no fractures. Professor Buckland observed multifocal thin subarachnoid haemorrhages indicative of brain trauma. There was no overt macroscopic cerebral contusion or overt bleeding into the brain. Professor Buckland in his additional report also says that traces of subarachnoid blood indicates significant blunt force trauma to the brain. This was greater on the right side then the left.

43. In addition the following injuries were recorded by Dr Beer which did not contribute to the death of the deceased:

- There was bruising to the back of the arms, front of the legs and back consistent with defensive injuries.

- There were circumferential bruises to the wrist consistent with being held.

- A fracture of the right ulna and radius almost at the level of the right wrist.

- Multiple superficial incised wounds to the face, right arm and lower back indicating a sharp instrument may have been used.”


	
	The Crown also points to the following parts of the post mortem reports:
	


“3. The head showed a range of injuries consistent with sustained applications of blunt force trauma. There was extensive bruising to the face and scalp, but no skull or facial fractures were identified. There was multifocal thin subarachnoid haemorrhage indicative of brain trauma, but no macroscopic cerebral contusion or overt bleeding into the brain.

4. There was bruising to the back of the arms, front of the legs and back compatible with defensive injuries.

5. There were circumferential bruises to the wrists compatible with restraint injuries.

…

7. … [T]here were multiple superficial incised wounds to the back, right arm face and neck consistent with ante-mortem injuries indicating that a knife or other sharp implement had also been used during the assault. All of these wounds were superficial and did not contribute to the cause of death.”


	
	There are also a series of photographs which depict the many physical injuries that Cheree was subjected to in the period before she died.
	
	
	The deceased had a significantly raised blood alcohol reading of 0.186g/100ml blood. The pathologist said that there is a “well recognized risk of sudden death with the association of a high blood alcohol and blows to the head where it is thought that alcohol significantly potentiates the concussive effect of post-traumatic apnoea”.
	


Intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm


	
	As terrible as these facts and injuries are, I am not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender intended to cause the death of Cheree Lawson. While the assault, or series of assaults, was sustained and brutal, the physical acts themselves do not establish an intention to kill.
	
	
	Repeatedly punching, kicking and restraining a person may often result in serious injury but it is not inevitable, or indeed very common, that it results in death. The role that the blood alcohol concentration may have played in Cheree’s sudden death may be well recognized in medical circles but it is not a matter of general knowledge and would not have been known to the offender.
	
	
	In terms of the acts of an offender giving rise to an inference of an intention to kill, the matter can be contrasted with a case where the offender shoots the victim or strangles or chokes the victim or uses a knife to slit the victim’s throat.
	
	
	Further, nothing in what the offender said at the time of the assault or in its aftermath suggests that he intended to kill Cheree Lawson. His interactions with Raylene Carter, John Mitchell and Roger Carter shortly after the fateful events suggest that he did not intend to kill the victim. That evidence is far from conclusive but it does not bespeak an intention to kill.
	
	
	Further, as Mr Wilson SC submitted, the injuries and investigation of the scene shows that there was at least one knife available to the offender and he did not use it in such a way as to evidence an intention to kill Cheree.
	
	
	Finally, the offender’s action of “trying to revive” Cheree (Lawson) is not consistent with an intention to kill. Again, the fact that he tried to revive her does not, of itself, negative an inference of an intention to kill a short time earlier. However, the attempt to revive is not consistent with such an intention.
	
	
	There being no direct evidence of an intention to kill, it is necessary to employ circumstantial reasoning. The Crown says the actions of the offender give rise to an inference - and “are eloquent of” - an intention to kill. I note the caution that must be exercised in drawing an inference from such evidence particularly when the offender is drunk: see, for example, R v Bellchambers [2008] NSWCCA 235 at [36]-[37] per Allsop J.
	
	
	It is necessary for the prosecution to exclude the possibility that the intention of the offender was to inflict grievous bodily harm. My conclusion is that the evidence does not exclude that possibility. The injuries and actions of the accused are equally eloquent of an intention to inflict serious injury.
	
	
	Accordingly, the offender will be sentenced on the basis that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Cheree but not that he intended to cause her death.
	
	
	There is ample authority that murders involving an intention to kill are generally more serious than those involving an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, although that proposition is not universally true. It all depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. See, for example, R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; 124 A Crim R 451
	
	
	at [34], Apps v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [49] (Simpson J) and Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 at [21].
	


Loss of self-control


	
	Mr Wilson SC submitted that the accused lost self-control and that this offence was committed in the heat of the moment as a result of some disagreement between the victim and the offender. The agreed facts suggest that both parties were affected by alcohol and that the offender was motivated by jealousy and that he was suspicious of Ms Lawson’s relationship with her former partner, who was the father of her 3 children.
	
	
	While I accept that the offender was out of control and in a rage at the time he killed Ms Lawson, I do not accept that this was in any sense a momentary loss of control as is sometimes seen in other cases.
	
	
	I do not accept that the fact that the accused was in a violent rage, most likely brought on by a combination of alcohol and jealousy, mitigates the objective criminality of the offence. On the contrary. This was a sustained assault that occurred over a period of around, or at least, half an hour. In the course of the assault, the victim asked the offender to “stop hitting me” and the offender’s mother tried to intervene. She was told to shut up or she’d be next.
	


Assessment of objective seriousness


	
	As I have said, the parties disagree as to the proper categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence. The Crown submits that the offence falls “slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness”. Mr Wilson SC submits that the offence falls below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	These submissions are made in the context of a statutory standard non-parole period of 20 years. That period of 20 years applies to a case where the offence falls within the putative mid-range of objective seriousness and after trial where there is no discount for a plea of guilty. Obviously that is not this case because the offender will receive a reduction for his plea of guilty.
	
	
	It remains important for a sentencing judge to make a reasoned assessment of the objective criminality involved in the case. Whether it is necessary or useful to do so in terms of labels such as “mid-range”, “low-range” and “high-range” is questionable but, in deference to the submissions of two experienced counsel, I propose to adopt such language.
	
	
	It is certainly not the case that the fact that a particular offence of murder does not involve an intention to kill means that it will necessarily fall below the middle range of objective seriousness: see, for example, Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [32].
	
	
	Factors bearing upon the assessment of the objective criminality here are the sustained and brutal nature of the attack and the fact that it was part of an ongoing abusive domestic relationship. The attack was on a defenceless victim who was well affected by alcohol. It was in the context of a domestic relationship marked by violence.
	
	
	Further, the victim was in the home of the offender’s mother, a place where she was entitled to feel safe. It is conceded by senior counsel that this is an aggravating feature pursuant to the provision in s 21A(2)(eb). In light of that concession it is unnecessary to dwell on the conflict (or nuanced controversy) in the authorities on that subject: contrast for example the approach in R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 with Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 and Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214; and see the analysis by Bellew J in R v Kennedy [2013] NSWSC 1940 at [44]-[50].
	
	
	All of the matters to which I have made reference are matters demonstrating that this was an offence of real objective seriousness.
	
	
	On the other hand, it is properly conceded by the Crown that the offence was not premeditated. It was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity and did not involve the use of a weapon. Further, as I have found, the offence did not involve an intention to kill and there was an attempt by the offender to revive the victim.
	
	
	While the absence of planning and premeditation is a mitigating feature, its significance is somewhat reduced in circumstances where the offender had assaulted the deceased in the weeks leading up to the murder and had made threats towards her: see Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 at [20].
	
	
	There was some controversy over the question of whether the offender was, or was not, on conditional liberty at the time of the offence: see exhibit B. Initially, the Crown accepted that the offender was not on conditional liberty. After Mr Wilson had concluded his oral submissions, the Crown tendered exhibit B setting out the events that followed the incident that occurred on 18 November 2012. The offender was on bail until 6 February 2013 on which date neither he nor the deceased attended Court. As I understand it, the prosecution then obtained the Victorian equivalent of an apprehended violence order and the offender’s bail came to an end. At the date of the current offence (12 March 2013) the order had not been served on the offender. Accordingly, the Crown concedes that “technically” the offender was not on conditional liberty at the time. For this reason, the aggravating feature in s 21A(2)(j) does not apply but both counsel agree that the true relevance of this material is the fact that it establishes a history of domestic violence. This, along with the offence on the Form 1, results in greater weight being afforded to personal deterrence and to retribution.
	
	
	Contrary to the submission of Mr Wilson SC, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, I have not taken into account a body of evidence concerning the offender’s early exposure to alcohol induced domestic violence and the extent to which that impacts upon his moral culpability. I accept that there is some conflict of authority as to this matter (as to which see, for example, Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49, Badans v R [2012] NSWCCA 97, Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172; Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183.)
	
	
	However, in my view, the High Court made clear in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 that “meaningful content cannot be given to [the concept of objective seriousness] by taking into account characteristics of the offender.” The High Court concluded at [27]:
	


“The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.”


	
	I accept that there may be some exceptions to that proposition and that the dividing line between the objective features bearing upon the seriousness of an offence and the subjective features of an offender is not always a clear and bright one. However, in my view, the exposure of this offender to alcohol and violence at a young age cannot properly be categorized as a matter bearing upon a principled assessment of the objective seriousness of his offence. On the other hand, if that evidence is accepted, it may bear upon his moral culpability and a determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	As I said in argument, this point is unlikely to make any practical difference to the outcome. If the evidence is accepted, and if I determine that the offender’s moral culpability is reduced as a result, that finding will sound in the sentencing outcome however it is pigeon-holed in these remarks. That observation accords with what Price J said in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [43]. It also found favour with both of the experienced counsel who appear in these proceedings.
	
	
	Taking into account all relevant matters, in my assessment, the offence falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	For the sake of transparency, I record that if I am wrong in my approach to the offender’s early exposure to alcohol and violence, I would have accepted Mr Wilson’s submission that the offence falls below the mid-range although not by very much.
	


The suffering of Cheree’s family and friends


	
	I have received moving statements from the victim’s mother (Raylene Lawson) and her sister (Janice Rose). These were read to the Court by Ms Quayle and Ms Taylor. Once again, I say thank you to the authors of those statements for sharing your pain and your grief and to the brave women who read them to the Court.
	
	
	Cheree was greatly loved in the community and this is shown by the large number of people who have travelled the 300 km from Dareton and Mildura to keep vigil at this sentencing hearing.
	
	
	Cheree was one of nine children and she was very close to her sisters. If her life was not cut short by the violent actions of the offender, she would now be just 26 years old.
	
	
	She was “charming, beautiful, intelligent and loving”. She was honest. She was a loving, and much loved, aunty.
	
	
	She also had three children of her own (T, J and J). These children are all still less than 10 years old. Her mother, Raylene, has now undertaken their care and she cannot express her relentless and constant grief because she does not want to upset the three little ones.
	
	
	Both Raylene and Janice feel hopeless and helpless in the face of their loss. Neither can see a day when they will not think of Cheree; miss her; mourn for her.
	
	
	Many other people in the court-room have no doubt felt this loss, this helplessness. The court room is full of a great sadness and anger.
	
	
	This is the impact of this senseless, brutal killing on the immediate family and friends of poor Cheree.
	
	
	To Raylene and to Janice and to all of you gathered here to seek justice for Cheree:
	



	
	I know that I can say nothing to reduce your pain.
	
	
	I know that nothing that I do, in sentencing the offender, will bring Cheree back.
	
	
	I know that no sentence that I impose will seem enough. How can it? As Raylene said, as read by Mrs Nola Taylor, the family has been sentenced to a lifetime of grief.
	



	
	The law now allows the suffering of a victim’s family and friends to be taken into account if it amounts to what the law describes as “an aspect of the harm done to the community”. I have discussed this new law in sentencing the man of Hines last year in this Court: see Hines (No. 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 at [77]-[85]. There is no need further to discuss the subtleties of that law today. It would not do Cheree’s family any good.
	
	
	I accept that the impact on Cheree’s family is an aspect of harm done to the community. As Howie J said in Barbetta [2008] NSWSC 688 at [18], as I inferred last year in Hines (at [84]) and as McCallum J said in Halloun [2014] NSWSC 1705, this is probably true in all cases of homicide.
	
	
	On the prosecutor’s application and on the concession by the offender, I will take the statements of Janice Rose and Raylene Lawson into account “in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence” under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (1999) NSW. In doing so, I adopt the sound and sensitive approach articulated by McCallum J in Halloun at [45]-[46] noting that this approach serves the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Act.
	


Deterrence and domestic violence


	
	Cases of domestic violence are too frequent in the community. It is a matter of some notoriety that domestic violence is prevalent within Aboriginal communities. I cannot speak more eloquently of this than did Cheree herself. Her mother told me this:
	


“Cheree was against domestic violence. These are Cheree’s sad, true words from strong, young, [Aboriginal] woman so against domestic violence.

‘It’s sad how some Aboriginal men hit their women and think everything’s going to be ok.

WELL IT’S NOT OK!

We are the ones who feel all the pain and get put in hospital! Cry and feel down about ourselves, you think it’s ok to say “shut up” or get a broken jaw or whatever, come on its why most men get left alone. Then you wish you had never done what you done in the first place. I have seen this happen all my life and now it’s happening to me, well I am done with being scared all the time, so now I am moving on and don’t ever want to go back to that again.’”


	
	The evidence shows that the killing of Cheree was the last of three serious assaults committed by this offender upon her.
	
	
	On 18 November 2012 the offender assaulted the victim in a most serious way. Her statement to the police on 18 November 2012 described that assault as follows:
	


“I was walking down Hunter St, Mildura, and Dale JOHNSON came out of some flats where Neil JOHNSON lives. My brothers and sister kept going and Dale dragged me inside his cousin’s flat. He started bashing me and I just curled up. I don’t think anyone else was there. He got an empty bottle of Jim Beam and hit me everywhere with it. He chocked me until I fell asleep. When I woke he was gone so I went to the phone box. I was putting my hands over my face and ears when it happened. It was in the bedroom. He hit me with the bottle to my arms, legs, head. He bit my back and he was chocking me and punching me in the face.

At the moment my body hurts everywhere and I’m scared he’ll go to my mums house. He was drunk and probably on drugs when he did this.

When I tried to leave the house he kept shoving me down. I thought I was going to die. He didn’t have permission to take me into the house or to hurt me.”


	
	Then, on 16 February 2013, the offender committed the offence on the Form 1. The facts of that offence (set out in paragraph 6 and following of the statement of facts) included striking Cheree with a brick causing her to black out. This caused the injuries to her depicted in the photographs which are document 8 of exhibit A.
	
	
	The sentence that I impose must reflect the need to send a message to people within the Aboriginal and wider community that our society cannot, and will not, tolerate domestic violence. When death is the result, the courts must impose lengthy gaol sentences on offenders. As the Crown has submitted, it is not enough to pay lip service to the principle of general deterrence. That principle must be reflected in the sentence that is actually imposed.
	
	
	Further, this offender has a history of domestic violence both against Cheree and also against an earlier domestic partner. For this reason, the sentence must also send a clear message to him that his behaviour will not be tolerated by society in general and by the Aboriginal community of Dareton and Mildura. I accept the Crown’s submission that the matter on the Form 1 and the offender’s history of domestic violence mean that significant weight must be given to the principle of personal or specific deterrence.
	


The offender’s personal circumstances and other mitigating features


	
	The offender is an Aboriginal man. He was 25 years old when he committed the offence and is now 27.
	
	
	He has a criminal record which disentitles him to the leniency afforded to a first offender but which is not such as to aggravate the offence or to result in a sentence disproportionate to the circumstances of the offence itself: cf Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465; R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 at [86]-[97].
	
	
	His actions immediately after the offence suggest that he immediately accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the harm that he had done. Those actions included:
	



	
	Attempting to revive the deceased.
	
	
	Admitting that he had killed her to several people.
	
	
	Crying as he described his conduct.
	
	
	Saying that he wanted to take his own life.
	
	
	Crying when the allegation was put to him by police.
	



	
	I will take this evidence of remorse into account under s 21A(3)(i) but note that, in the context of this case and in circumstances where his prospects of rehabilitation are speculative, it is not a matter of significant weight compared with other relevant factors and purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	I accept the submissions of both counsel that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are not known. The repeated offences of domestic violence make it impossible to conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to offend again (cf s 21A(3)(g) and (h)).
	
	
	I have considered two reports, one by a psychologist (Dr Howard) and one by a psychiatrist (Dr Furst). Neither report provides evidence of a significant mental health issue or intellectual disability. Dr Furst says that the offender has a “low intellectual function”. Dr Howard administered various tests which disclosed that he was in the “low average” to “average range” for intelligence but that his verbal skills are very poor and that this impacted upon the results. Both reports make some reference to Mr Johnson’s exposure to domestic violence from an early age. He was exposed to alcohol and drugs at an early age and started using drugs and alcohol in his early adolescence. Neither report makes any attempt to relate those matters to the offences.
	


Exposure to alcohol and violence


	
	The most significant aspect of Mr Johnson’s personal history concerns his exposure to violence, alcohol and drugs in his family home when he was a child and as he reached adolescence. I have received affidavits of his mother and his sister and these were not subject to cross-examination or dispute.
	
	
	Raylene Carter said, amongst other things:
	


“7. My partner was also violent to the children He never touched Dale when he was that little, but I remember my partner hitting the other children in front of Dale.

8. My partner was an alcoholic. I used to drink back then as well, because it would help me get through the violence. There was a lot of drinking back then. I ended up drinking whenever my partner did, which at its worst was every second day. I would drink until I would ‘choke’ (which means pass out) so I could not feel any pain. The kids were all there when we would drink like that. Eventually the police were called, and I was told I should move out of town, so I did.

…

13. My memory of Dales father is that he was a cruel person. I believe that he was cruel because he didn’t want to split up with me.”


	
	Natalie Johnson’s affidavit included:
	


“4. Life was difficult for us in Mildura. I recall that my father drank regularly to excess. My parents would have gambling sessions where all the adults would get drunk and play cards. That happened about once a week. Occasionally we would go to other houses for these sessions. My father got drunk most days. It was not unusual for him to have a beer in his hand.

5. We had to move with my mother Raylene Carter, to a refuge in Port Lincoln. Dale would have been very young at that time. I was about 7 years old. We moved there because my father was violent towards my mother. On one occasion, I have a memory of my father hitting my mother with a stick, putting her in the river underwater, stripping her naked and repeating the beating. This happened over and over. I can't remember if Dale was there that time, but he certainly saw things like that from time to time. My father didn't care who was around. It wasn’t a ‘behind closed doors’ kind of thing. He would do it in front of the kids, he didn't care.

….

8. My father had new partners when we came back. He was violent with them as well. One time I saw him hitting a woman with a truck shifter. I had to get the shifter off him, and hide it so he couldn't find it. The lady was knocked out, and he was yelling at her, but she couldn't move at all because she was knocked out. Her ankle was in the wrong place. I was the only person in the house that night. Dale saw a lot of what my father did to those women.

…

10. My father was very hard on Dale when he got a little bit older. Dale was flogged with golf clubs, kicked in the head, thrown to the ground. Dale suffered pretty bad injuries as a result of the beatings. He would get beaten because he didn't act how my father wanted him to act. My father was a very controlling person, he would not allow us to call our mother, and we would not receive gifts from her either. If we did something wrong, like watch a TV show we were not supposed to watch, we would get a whack on the nose so it would bleed. My father's reactions were never small.”


	
	As I have said, the reports of Dr Furst and Dr Howard also touch upon this although neither expert had the extensive and graphic history that is now presented. I accept that this is the result of the offender’s poor verbal and communication skills.
	
	
	It is well recognized that: ""an offender's deprived background may militate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate"": see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at 592 [37]. I have previously discussed and applied this case and the case of Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38 249 CLR 600: see R v Booth [2014] NSWCCA 156 at [20]-[27]; R v Hines (No 3) at [61]-[64].
	
	
	In Bugmy v The Queen, the joint judgment said (at [43]-[44]):
	


""The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.

An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.""


	
	Further, in Munda v Western Australia the majority said (at [54]):
	


“It may be argued that general deterrence has little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised or alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of misconduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidence of crimes, especially crimes of passion.”


	
	However, the majority went on (at [54]-[55]):
	


“That having been said, there are three points to be made in response. First, the proper role of the criminal law is not limited to the utilitarian value of general deterrence. The criminal law is more than a mode of social engineering which operates by providing disincentives directed to reducing unacceptably deviant behaviour within the community. To view the criminal law exclusively, or even principally, as a mechanism for the regulation of the risks of deviant behaviour is to fail to recognise the long-standing obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence. Further, one of the historical functions of the criminal law has been to discourage victims and their friends and families from resorting to self-help, and the consequent escalation of violent vendettas between members of the community.

A consideration with a very powerful claim on the sentencing discretion in this case is the need to recognise that the appellant, by his violent conduct, took a human life, and, indeed, the life of his de facto spouse. A just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of the victim of domestic violence and the legitimate interest of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of a brutal, alcohol-fuelled destruction of a woman by her partner. A failure on the part of the state to mete out a just punishment of violent offending may be seen as a failure by the state to vindicate the human dignity of the victim; and to impose a lesser punishment by reason of the identity of the victim is to create a group of second-class citizens, a state of affairs entirely at odds with the fundamental idea of equality before the law.”


	
	Applying those principles to the present case, I accept that the offender’s exposure to violence at the hands of his alcoholic father and his exposure to early drug and alcohol abuse in the family home reduces his moral culpability for the present offence. I think the inference is inescapable that his experiences as a child and adolescent have impacted greatly upon him and affected his ability to control himself and explain his resort to violence.
	
	
	However, this is of no comfort to the loved ones of Cheree who have travelled many miles to attend Court to ensure, as it was put by her sister, that Cheree gets justice today. Further, it remains an essential part of this sentencing process that members of the offender’s community, as well as society in general, realise that domestic violence cannot and will not be tolerated by the Courts. The sentence that I impose must attempt (insofar as it is possible) to vindicate Cheree Lawson’s human dignity and to denounce the brutal assault that led to her death.
	


Self-induced intoxication


	
	In accordance with s 21A(5AA), I make it clear that I have not taken into account as a mitigating feature the self-induced intoxication of the offender at the time of the offence. However, in conformity with the High Court’s judgments in Bugmy and Munda, I have taken into account the fact that the offender’s early exposure to both domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse reduce his moral culpability and capacity to control his emotions.
	


The purposes of sentencing and relevant legislative guideposts


	
	I have taken into account the relevant purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), as well as the principles of sentencing established by the common law. I must ensure that the offender is adequately punished and is held accountable for his crime and that the community is protected from the offender. I must denounce his conduct but promote his rehabilitation. I must recognise the harm done to the victim, her family and friends and to the community.
	
	
	Murder is the most serious offence known to the criminal law and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. That penalty will be imposed in the most serious of cases and it is not suggested by the prosecution that this is such a case. Nevertheless, in determining the appropriate sentence, “careful attention” to the maximum penalty is required: see Markarian v the Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [30]-[31].
	
	
	There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years that applies to cases after trial, that is where there is no plea of guilty. I approach the standard non-parole period in accordance with the High Court’s judgment in Muldrock v The Queen. Along with the maximum penalty, it is an important legislative guide-post. I do not intend to impose the standard non-parole period. In the course of these remarks I have set out the factors that I have taken into account in determining to impose a non-parole period less than 20 years (s 54B(3)). The two matters of most significance in this determination are the offender’s plea of guilty and the reduction of his moral culpability resulting from his early exposure to alcohol, drugs and extreme domestic violence.
	
	
	I must synthesise these various factors, some of which pull in different directions, and, instinctively, arrive at a just and proportionate sentence.
	


Cases and statistics


	
	Mr Wilson SC has provided me with statistics relating to some 148 cases decided between July 2007 and June 2014. They include only 8 cases where the offender pleaded guilty, was aged 21-25 years and had committed previous offences of the same kind. The statistics show a large variation in sentencing outcomes, a circumstance that accords with the fact that murders are committed in a most diverse range of circumstances. I note that of the 8 cases with those common features, 5 received a non-parole period of 15 years or less. However, the numerical database is so small that I am unable to derive any real guidance from the statistics.
	
	
	Mr Wilson SC has also provided me with summaries of a number of cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal and other judges of this Court (MFI 4). He has placed some reliance and has carefully and helpfully analysed the cases of R v Kennedy [2013] NSWSC 1940, R v Bolt [2013] NSWSC 895 and R v Edwards [2009] NSWSC 164. I note that in Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98 I considered the sentencing outcome in around 20 cases where there was held to be no intention to kill and no premeditation.
	
	
	The correct approach to such material was articulated by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 and by Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1 at [304] - [305]. In Hili and Jones, it was said at [54]-[55]:
	


""In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned'.""

55.   As the plurality said in Wong;

""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.”

Sentence


	
	Synthesising all of this evidence and taking into account those principles of sentencing and purposes of punishment, I have come to the conclusion that an appropriate starting point is a total sentence of 26 years.
	
	
	Allowing a discount of a little less than 20% for the offender’s plea of guilty, the total sentence will be 21 years. I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances requiring an adjustment to the minimum term and an extended period of parole. Accordingly the non-parole period will be 75% the total sentence, that is a period of 15 years and 9 months.
	


Sentence


	
	Mr Johnson, for the murder of Cheree Anne Lawson and taking into account the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, you are convicted.
	
	
	I sentence you to a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months commencing on 12 March 2013 and expiring on 11 December 2028.
	
	
	There will be a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months which will expire on 11 March 2034.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), I advise you of the existence of that Act and the fact that it applies to you and to this offence. I will leave it to Mr Wilson SC to explain to you the relevance and likely impact of that on your post-release life.

2765818,Martin v R [2015] NSWCCA 6,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: Trevor Leonard Martin, the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the Sydney District Court on 24 May 2013. He applies for an extension of time for leave to appeal, which the Crown does not oppose.
	
	
	On 1 March 2012, the applicant was committed to stand trial in the Sydney District Court. However, before a trial date was set, the applicant offered to plead guilty to the following offences which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment:
	


Count 1: On 29 April 2009 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales did rob [the complainant] of a handbag, a purse, a sum of cash, a mobile phone and a mobile phone charger, and at the time of the robbery used corporal violence on [the complainant]. This was an offence of aggravated robbery (using corporal violence) contrary to s 95(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment.

Count 2: On 29 April 2009 at Darlinghurst in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse [with the complainant] without her consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of, or immediately before or after the commission of the offence, [the applicant] intentionally inflicted actual bodily harm on [the complainant]. This was an offence of aggravated sexual assault (inflicting actual bodily harm on the complainant) contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.


	
	After allowing a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, the judge sentenced the applicant as follows:
	



	
	Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 27 October 2011 and expiring on 26 April 2013.
	
	
	Count 2: Imprisonment for 10 years 6 months, consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 27 April 2012 and expiring on 26 April 2019 with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months expiring on 26 October 2022.
	



	
	The total effective sentence was 11 years consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months. The earliest date that the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 26 August 2019.
	
	
	The judge had found special circumstances being the partial accumulation of the sentences and the benefit to the community and the applicant “from him having a longer period of supervision while on parole” (ROS 10). Accordingly, the ratio of the total non-parole period to the total sentence was 72.7%.
	


The Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal:
	


(i)   That her Honour erred in law in stating that the protection of the community is of increased importance when sentencing offenders suffering from mental disorders.

(ii)   That her Honour erroneously applied the principles in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 (“Veen (No 2)”).

(iii) That her Honour erred in failing to take into account and apply principles relevant to sentencing a mentally ill offender.

(iv) The sentence imposed for count 2 was manifestly excessive.

FACTS


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered which her Honour recounted in her sentencing remarks. Shortly stated, the complainant was working as a prostitute in East Sydney when the applicant approached her and negotiated to pay her $70 in exchange for oral sex on him. In a nearby park, the applicant pulled down his pants and exposed his erect penis before handing $70 in cash to the complainant. The complainant put a condom on the applicant’s penis, which he put into her mouth whilst he kissed her right breast.
	
	
	After a few seconds, the applicant placed his right hand onto the left side of the complainant’s throat, with the thumb near her windpipe. The complainant continued performing oral sex. He then placed his left hand down onto the right side of the complainant’s throat with his thumb near her windpipe. The complainant became concerned and stopped performing oral sex. The applicant then squeezed both his hands tightly around the complainant’s throat cutting off the airway. She tried to fight back without success. The applicant pushed her backwards onto her back and maintained his hold on her throat. The complainant then lost consciousness.
	
	
	The applicant pulled up the complainant’s dress and pulled off her underwear. He moved her legs apart, got on top of her and penetrated her vagina with his penis. The applicant ejaculated into the condom he was still wearing.
	
	
	A short time later, the complainant regained consciousness. The applicant still had his hands around her throat and was on top of her. She felt his flaccid penis against her leg. After removing his hands from the complainant’s throat and the condom from his penis, the applicant pulled his pants up and said to the complainant:
	


“Cover your face, I don’t want you to see me. Don’t look at me. If you scream I’ll kill you. If you yell out, I’ll come back and I’ll kill you” (ROS 3).


	
	The applicant picked up the complainant’s handbag and the used condom and subsequently ran away. He dropped the used condom on the roadway.
	
	
	The complainant got up and ran east. She reported the matter to patrolling police who were in a car. The police discovered the condom, which was subsequently analysed to have DNA on it, which was identical to that of the applicant. The applicant could also not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA that was taken on a swab from the complainant’s right breast.
	
	
	On 14 May 2008, Dr Haselton, the applicant’s psychologist, advised police that he had concerns about the applicant’s behaviour. Dr Haselton stated that the applicant had admitted to him that he had recently had sexual intercourse with a prostitute and while doing it, he had squeezed her around the neck to an extent that it became dangerous. The applicant said that he had concerns that he might go too far in that he may kill someone. He also said that he had obtained an adrenalin charge from carrying out the choking.
	
	
	When interviewed by police on 11 June 2009, the applicant denied any assault but admitted to thinking about following people and assaulting them and that he had a strong desire to hurt people by hitting them over the head and wanting to do a “Charles Manson.”
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but reports from Professor David Greenberg and Dr Jonathon Adams, both forensic psychiatrists were tendered. Dr Mridula Kayal, a psychiatrist, gave evidence, as did Dr Adams.
	
	
	In her sentencing remarks, the judge recounted that the applicant’s childhood was marred by the death of his mother when he was eight and his subsequent removal from his family. He has four siblings with whom he has had no contact since then.
	
	
	The judge observed that the applicant’s criminal history as an adult was “fairly limited” (ROS 6), but her Honour noted he was convicted of manslaughter in 1972, indecent assault in 1993 and possession of prohibited drugs in 2009.
	
	
	Her Honour said (ROS 6):
	


“Given the [applicant’s] longstanding mental health issues… his contact with the criminal justice system is not extensive which is to his credit.”


	
	The applicant was born on 26 November 1955 and was 57 years old when sentenced.
	
	
	The material before the judge included the following:
	



	
	A report of Dr M Kayal dated 10 June 2009 (ex B).
	
	
	A report of Professor D Greenberg dated 7 June 2012 (ex C).
	
	
	A further report of Professor D Greenberg dated 6 May 2013 (ex D).
	
	
	A report of Dr J Adams dated 28 June 2012 (ex 1).
	
	
	A further report of Dr J Adams dated 1 February 2013 (ex 2).
	
	
	An addendum report of Dr J Adams dated 18 March 2013 (ex 3).
	
	
	35 pages of St Vincent’s Hospital clinical notes (ex 4).
	


The Psychiatric Evidence


	
	In her sentencing remarks, the judge reviewed the psychiatric evidence noting that that applicant had a well-documented and longstanding history of psychiatric problems. Her Honour observed that “the medical evidence diverges to some extent in identifying his precise diagnosis” (ROS 6-7).
	
	
	Her Honour mentioned that both Dr Adams (retained by the applicant) and Professor Greenberg (retained by the Crown) were of the opinion that the applicant’s problems were complex. Her Honour recounted Dr Adams’ summary of the applicant’s diagnostic formulation which appears in his second report (ex 2) (ROS 7):
	


i.   “a borderline and antisocial personality structure that developed in the context of his early traumatic and disrupted environment,

ii.   a substance use disorder fluctuating between abstinence, abuse and dependence that has compounded his mental state,

iii.   a probably recurrent depressive disorder with intermittent periods of dysthymia (persistent low mood not to the severity of depression) and

iv.   a probable paraphiliac disorder.”


	
	The judge quoted Dr Adams’ belief (ROS 7):
	


“… that [the applicant’s] account of experiencing violent mental imagery is most likely linked to his underlying personality structure as opposed to psychotic origins, but this phenomenological basis requires ongoing assessment.”


	
	Dr Adams’ opinion was that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that at the time of the offending, the applicant was suffering from a mental illness, namely an underlying schizophrenic illness. The judge quoted what was said by Professor Greenberg in his second report (ex D, 5):
	


“I am therefore of the view that while [the applicant] may possibly have an underlying schizophrenic illness his psychiatric presentation is complex and a conglomeration of all his psychiatric problems/disorders.”


	
	Her Honour noted that Professor Greenberg considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the applicant did not have a schizophrenic illness but rather some other form of psychosis. Her Honour said (ROS 8):
	


“It certainly now appears that there is broad agreement among all experts, including Dr Kayal, that the offender has a mental illness although descriptions of the precise diagnosis do vary.”


	
	In oral evidence before the judge, Dr Kayal said that there was likely an underlying schizophrenic illness. He also agreed that the applicant probably had a recurring depressive disorder and a probable paraphiliac disorder. After further quoting various passages from the reports of Dr Adams and Professor Greenberg, her Honour said (ROS 8):
	


“I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the [applicant] was suffering from a mental disorder or disorders at the time of the offences and has continued to do so. In those circumstances general deterrence has less weight. However, protection of the community is of increased importance in the sentencing exercise” (Italics added).

Some further findings by the judge


	
	The judge considered that the robbery (count 1) was an opportunistic taking of the complainant’s handbag and assessed the objective gravity of the offence as being “at a low level” (ROS 5). As to count 2, her Honour said (ROS 5-6):
	


“Count 2, however, is a very serious example of an offence under… s 61J(1).The sexual intercourse was full penile-vaginal intercourse. However, the [applicant] did continue to use the condom the complainant had provided which is often not the case in such offences.”


	
	As to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, her Honour observed that the applicant’s mental health had stabilised since his remand in custody. She recounted that Dr Adams stated that the applicant’s prognosis depended on the applicant’s management in custody and outside the prison system. He would need ongoing psychiatric and psychological treatment and the input of other support services. Her Honour concluded that if all the recommendations of Dr Adams were put in place, both in custody and upon release, the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation were reasonable and his risk of re-offending would be significantly reduced.
	


Ground 1: That her Honour erred in law in stating that the protection of the community is of increased importance when sentencing offenders suffering from mental disorders. 

Ground 2: That her Honour erroneously applied the principles in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 (“Veen (No 2)”).


	
	These Grounds of Appeal may be conveniently dealt with together.
	


Argument


	
	Mr Turnbull SC, for the applicant submitted that the entirety of the remarks on sentence made by her Honour on the principles applicable to the role of mental illness in the applicant’s sentencing are stated in the quotation at [26] above. He contended that a fair reading of her Honour’s remarks supports the conclusion that her Honour was articulating a general principle of mandatory application. Mr Turnbull submitted that there is no support for such a principle in the authorities. He argued that the protection of the community is not a mandatory and aggravating consideration when sentencing an offender with a mental disorder; it is a factor, which is to be balanced against other factors.
	
	
	Another submission was that the majority in the decision Veen v The Queen (No 2) (“Veen (No 2)”) [1988] HCA 14; (1998) 164 CLR 465 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) articulated a nuanced approach which has been repeatedly affirmed by the court as the guiding principles in assessing the relationship between mental health and the protection of society. Mr Turnbull submitted that “the protection of the community is a discretionary matter and one which would intuitively and in practice apply in limited circumstances” (AWS 30).
	
	
	Mr Turnbull pointed out that her Honour did not refer to the test articulated in Veen (No 2) anywhere in her judgment, and in the course of her sentencing hearing, expressly disavowed its application. He submitted that her Honour appears to have erred in law in applying a wrong principle.
	
	
	Mr Ingram SC, for the Crown contended that the applicant’s submissions ignore her Honour’s consideration of the psychiatric evidence. He submitted that it could be seen from the material that was tendered during the proceedings on sentence, that the proceedings were dominated by the issue of the of the applicant’s mental illness.
	
	
	Another submission was that the protection of the community is but one of the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), and that the purposes of sentencing overlap and should not be considered in isolation.
	
	
	Mr Ingram submitted that her Honour correctly concluded that, notwithstanding the applicant’s mental illness, his criminal record did not of itself bear upon her sentencing discretion in the way that it had in Veen (No 2).
	


Consideration


	
	It is evident from the entirety of the judge’s sentencing remarks that her Honour was not articulating as a matter of general principle that the protection of the community is of increased importance when sentencing offenders suffering from mental disorders. Her Honour’s conclusion that protection of the community was of increased importance in the sentencing exercise was tailored to the circumstances of the applicant.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (“De La Rosa”) [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 273 ALR 324 at [177] (McClellan CJ at CL) summarised the principles that apply when an offender is suffering from a mental illness:
	


“Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] – [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] – [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] – [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:

● Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].

● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

● Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].”


	
	During cross-examination, Dr Adams’ evidence included the following (T7 46-50; T8 1-14):
	


Q.   So if he was released from custody and then became non-compliant with medication would you see the psychosis of which you indicated returning?

A.   I think that is quite likely.

Q.   And that being the case that he would be likely to commit further offences of this type or of a similar violent nature?

A.   I would view that as a possibility. I think it from a psychiatric perspective it might be a bit of an over simplification to say purely medication non-compliance equals offending. I would see it certainly Mr Martin’s case is a bit more complex than that but certainly if he were to become non-compliant with medication I would view that there was an increase in likelihood of the risk of re-offending, Yes.

Q.   The other factors such as the supported accommodation and the drug and alcohol services and so on if you became non-compliant and didn’t have those supports either would that also increase the risk of him committing further offences?

A.   Absolutely.”


	
	The applicant’s complex psychiatric problems, the circumstances of the offence and the possibility of non-compliance with medication justified the weight placed by the judge on the protection of the community.
	
	
	There is no merit in the applicant’s complaint that the principles in Veen (No 2) were erroneously applied.
	
	
	In Veen (No 2), the majority said at 477 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) that a prior criminal record was relevant:
	


“…The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality…

There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned. The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: Director of Public Prosecutions v. Ottewell (1970) AC 642, at p 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.”


	
	During the proceedings on sentence, in oral discussion with the applicant’s counsel, the following exchange occurred (T15 23-39):
	


“Carroll: The issue is that the Veen concepts apply pragmatically well to a person who has committed two offences of murder and the court has the ability at that stage to impose essentially a life sentence in the Veen situation.

Her Honour: This isn’t a Veen. I agree with you, this isn’t a Veen situation. I wouldn’t anticipate the Crown would say it is or perhaps I’m wrong. Given the record – the offence of manslaughter was when the offender on my calculations which are usually wrong, was about 17 years of age.

Carroll: Sporadic.

Her Honour: …well there is only 1981 all driving offences, then 1993 incident assault, 2009 possess prohibited drug, that’s it until this.”


	
	The judge’s observation that “[t]his isn’t a Veen” was not a disavowal of the relevance of the applicant’s mental illness but merely an acknowledgement that his prior criminal history did not warrant increased weight being given to retribution, deterrence and protection of the community.
	
	
	I would dismiss Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal.
	


Ground 3: That her Honour erred in failing to take into account and apply principles relevant to sentencing a mentally ill offender.

Argument


	
	Mr Turnbull pointed out, that although no reference was made to any authority, her Honour correctly identified that “general deterrence has less weight” (ROS 8) when sentencing offenders with a mental illness. However, apart from this, he contended that no further mention was made to any of the principles relevant to the applicant’s mental health. Mr Turnbull submitted that her Honour failed to have regard to how this affected an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences and the applicant’s moral culpability. Mr Turnbull relied on the relevant principles from the decisions of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228; MDZ v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 243 and Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240.
	
	
	Mr Ingram submitted that this ground implies that because the judge did not expressly enunciate each, and all of the relevant principles when sentencing a mentally-ill offender, her Honour appears to have failed to take into account and apply those principles. Mr Ingram referred to the extensive consideration of the psychiatric evidence that her Honour summarised in her sentencing remarks. Mr Ingram argued that in the circumstances of this case, where the central issue was the applicant’s mental illness, and where her Honour spent more than two pages of her judgment discussing that issue and its relevance to the sentence to be imposed, the court would reject the submissions that the judge failed to take into account and apply the relevant legal principles.
	


Consideration:


	
	Where an offender suffers from a mental illness which contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced: De La Rosa at [177]; R v Hemsley at [33]. In Ayshow v R at [39] (Johnson J with whom Bathurst CJ and James J agreed) said:
	


“This appeal was heard before the High Court gave judgment on 5 October 2011 in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. That decision changes the law in several respects where sentence is to be passed for an offence carrying a standard non-parole period. To the extent that a question arises whether the Applicant's mental state at the time of the offence may bear upon objective seriousness (Muldrock at 1162-1163 [27], 1163 [29]), it remains a relevant factor on sentence in an assessment of moral culpability. Accordingly, if there is evidence to support a finding that an offender's moral culpability is reduced by a relevant mental condition, the offender is entitled to have it called in aid on sentence. The present ground of appeal will be considered in this light.”


	
	In MDZ v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 243 at [67] (Hall J with whom Tobias AJA and Johnson J agreed) said:
	


“In my opinion, in light of the High Court's judgment in Muldrock (supra), it is open to conclude that the mental condition of the applicant at the time of the offence may bear upon the objective seriousness of the offences: Muldrock (supra) at [27] and [29]. Certainly, in the present case, the sentencing judge, on the evidence, was required to expressly determine the moral culpability of the applicant in assessing the seriousness of the offences and in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed in relation to them. In this case, the evidence required a finding that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by his mental health issues.”


	
	The judge made no reference to the applicant’s moral culpability in her sentencing remarks nor did counsel who appeared for the applicant specifically submit that she should do so. The evidence however, before her Honour included the following:
	
	
	In his addendum report dated 18 March 2013, Dr Adams wrote (ex 3, 6.3):
	


“From a clinical perspective in my opinion it is not possible to ascertain the precise influence of [the applicant’s] underlying schizophrenic illness upon his capacity to deal with his experience of mental imagery, or “visions”, because it is problematic to separate his schizophrenic illness from his mood disorder, personality structure, substance use disorder and probable paraphilic disorder, set in the context of psychosocial stressors. In my opinion it is reasonable to conclude that [the applicant’s] psychiatric problems taken as a whole would have impacted deleteriously upon his ability to recognise, rationalise, and appropriately manage his violent mental imagery.”


	
	Professor Greenberg in his report dated 6 May 2013 opined (ex D, 6):
	


“I am of the view that if [the applicant] had any psychotic symptoms at the time period of his offending behaviour, they (sic) psychotic symptoms did not play any significant role in his offending behaviour. I (sic) my view, he does not have a defence of mental illness. His psychotic difficulties may have played a lesser ill defined role in his offending behaviour. I am of the opinion that the offending behaviour was more likely the result of his sexual preferences, the use of alcohol and illicit substances at the time period, prevailing stresses and a long history of low mood, and his underlying personality difficulties such as anger and violent mental imagery or ‘visions’, rather than flowing from a psychotic condition.

I note that Dr Adams also notes that “from a clinical perspective, in my opinion, it is not possible to ascertain the precise influence of [the applicant’s] underlying Schizophrenic illness on his capacity to deal with his experience of mental imagery, or ‘visions’ because it is problematic to separate his schizophrenic illness from his mood disorder, personality structure, substance abuse disorder, and probable paraphilic disorder, set in the context of psycho social stresses.”

“I therefore concur with Dr Adams that any Schizophrenic Disorder, this disorder likely did not play a significant role in his offending behaviour. Nevertheless the impact of him having a (sic) several co-morbid mental disorders may have played some role although it is difficult to determine the weight of that role.”


	
	It is evident from these opinions that the applicant’s mental disorders may have contributed to his offending. Although a specific submission was not made by the applicant’s counsel on this issue, the focus of the applicant’s case on sentence was his mental health. In my respectful opinion, the judge was obliged to expressly make some assessment as to whether the applicant’s moral culpability for the serious crimes that he committed was reduced by his mental condition. In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour did not make any reference to the applicant’s mental health and erred in not doing so.
	
	
	I would uphold Ground 3 of the appeal. As specific error has been found, it is the duty of this court to exercise its independent discretion and to consider the appropriate sentence: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 313 ALR 451 at [42]-[43].
	
	
	Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider in detail Ground 4 of the appeal in which the applicant complains that the sentence for count 2 was manifestly excessive. The principal contention was that the undiscounted starting point of 14 years was outside the legitimate exercise of her Honour’s sentencing discretion. Another submission was that consideration of the relevant statistics (AWS, annex A) and like cases, support the contention of manifest excess. The Crown pointed to the objective seriousness of the offence and to the mitigating factors and submitted that the court would not be persuaded of the manifest excess of the sentence.
	
	
	These submissions will be taken into account with all other relevant matters in determining whether a lesser sentence is appropriate for the applicant and the offence.
	


Decision


	
	For the purpose of considering whether the sentence imposed by the judge is appropriate or that a lesser sentence is warranted in law, the objective and subjective considerations to be taken into account are disclosed from what I have written to this point.
	
	
	I agree with the judge’s assessment that count 2 is a very serious example of an offence contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act. The applicant inflicted considerable violence on the complainant before the sexual assault. He squeezed both his hands tightly around her throat cutting off the airway. She tried to fight back without success. The applicant pushed her onto her back and maintained his hold on her throat. The applicant then had penile sexual intercourse with his unconscious victim ejaculating into the condom that he was wearing. When she regained consciousness, the applicant still had his hands around her throat and was on top of her. He threatened to kill her if she screamed.
	
	
	Her Honour appears in the passage quoted at [27] above to have considered that the applicant’s use of a condom mitigated the seriousness of the offence. In Dawson v R [2013] NSWCCA 61 at [74] (Schmidt J with whom McCallum J and I agreed) expressed the opinion that the lack of ejaculation in that case could not be considered to reduce the objective seriousness of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I Crimes Act. Similarly, I do not consider that the wearing of a condom in the circumstances of the offending in the present case mitigates in any way the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	As to the assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability for his offending, Dr Adams was unable to elicit any history from him to clearly suggest that he was experiencing symptoms of psychosis at the time of the offence. Professor Greenberg considered that any Schizophrenic Disorder did not play a significant role in the applicant’s offending behaviour. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant’s mental disorders slightly reduce his moral culpability for the offences. I otherwise endorse her Honour’s findings on sentence.
	
	
	The upper limit of the range of sentence for s 61J(1) offence is neither provided by comparative cases nor Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. The maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and standard non-parole of 10 years are to be borne in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154.
	
	
	My conclusion is that the overall sentence imposed by the judge is the appropriate sentence. I am not satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	


1. The extension of time to seek leave to appeal is granted.

2. Leave to appeal granted.

3. Appeal dismissed.


	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Price J. In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, it must be considered that the applicant choked his victim, who fought back unsuccessfully until she was pushed onto her back and became unconscious. He then had penile sexual intercourse with her and on her regaining consciousness, threatened to kill her if she screamed. The seriousness of that offence was not reduced by the applicant having ejaculated into a condom and but little reduced by the applicant's mental disorders. On the evidence they are of such a nature that the applicant does pose a danger to the community when at large. While, as her Honour accepted, general deterrence must in the result be given less weight in this sentencing exercise, considerations of specific deterrence must feature in the sentence imposed upon him. Despite her Honour's error in not making an assessment as to whether the applicant’s moral culpability for his very serious offence was reduced by his mental condition, I have also concluded that no lesser sentence than that which her Honour imposed upon the applicant is warranted in law.

2765825,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhang & Xing [2015] NSWSC 61,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (“the Act”). On 26 July 2012, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police obtained ex parte restraining orders under s 18 of the Act in relation to certain nominated property which includes what I understand to be the family home of Gulun Zhang and his wife, Yuling Xing. Mr Zhang was subsequently convicted of certain offences and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	On 2 June 2014, Ms Xing applied by way of notice of motion for the Court to make various orders: in short, orders that would have the effect of revoking the restraining order or excluding the home from restraint. Ms Xing was represented by a solicitor at that time, but that solicitor filed a notice of it ceasing to act in December 2014. At that stage, the notice of motion had been listed for hearing over three days from Monday of this week, 9 February 2015.
	
	
	Ms Xing appeared without representation before me on Monday. She indicated that she had applied for legal aid last week and that she was awaiting the outcome of that application. She explained that her delay in applying for legal aid was because she had another solicitor working for her in trying to reach a settlement of the matter. Settlement was not achieved.
	
	
	Ms Xing applied for an adjournment of the hearing of her application. Mr Tynan of counsel opposed that application on behalf of his client, the plaintiff. I granted the application and stood the matter over to Tuesday with the hope that there would be news of the resolution of the application for legal aid.
	
	
	Ms Xing again appeared without representation before me yesterday and, again, applied for an adjournment indicating that she had an appointment to see someone at Legal Aid today at 11.20am.
	
	
	Ms Xing has again appeared before me this afternoon at 2.00pm and indicated that she had attended upon a solicitor at Legal Aid this morning. She informed me that this solicitor had discussed the case with her and had referred her to private solicitors in the city who would, she said, prepare a brief for a barrister. Although Ms Xing did not say this, I am assuming that counsel's advice is being sought as to, probably, the merits of her application that Legal Aid can take into account in determining whether or not to grant legal aid.
	
	
	The upshot is that the application of Ms Xing has not been able to proceed over the three days allocated for it this week. Ms Xing again applies for an adjournment of the matter until the legal aid situation is resolved.
	
	
	According to the submissions of Mr Tynan, which I have read, the critical matter is that there is apparently a deadline of 5 March when there will be automatic forfeiture of the property currently subject to restraint, according to the Act. As I understand it, that is not a date that can be extended. Ms Xing assured me that she had stressed the existence of this deadline a number of times to the Legal Aid solicitor she saw this morning. She also informed me that she will be proceeding immediately after I conclude the matter today to the office of the solicitor to whom the matter has been referred.
	
	
	Mr Tynan opposed the proposal that I tentatively put to Ms Xing and had her agreement. That proposal was that I stand the matter out of the list, allowing liberty to restore if Ms Xing determines with the benefit of legal assistance to pursue her application.
	
	
	As I indicated, the matter has been before the Court on each of the three days that I have referred to. On each occasion, the plaintiff has been represented by counsel and solicitor.
	
	
	Mr Tynan informs me that he has been in the matter throughout. He is the author of very detail written submissions that are on the Court file which explain quite fully the plaintiff's attitude to the application. In short, it is contended that some of the orders sought by Ms Xing are statutorily impossible and some face significant evidentiary hurdles.
	
	
	The difficulty for Mr Tynan is, and I sympathise with this, that in the event that an attempt is made to have the matter restored to the list and determined, his availability is limited to only next week (February 16 to 20) or Friday, 27 February, and nothing else before that deadline I mentioned of 5 March. It would be, indeed, very unfortunate and possibly disadvantageous to the plaintiff if the application was to be restored and pursued on an occasion when counsel who has been in the matter for so long is no longer available. That is a matter that I note and note for the future, if it be relevant, but it is not something that can affect what I do with the matter today.
	
	
	Mr Tynan has instructions and has made an application for costs thrown away by the wasted three days that were supposed to be the hearing of Ms Xing's application. In response to that application, Ms Xing has drawn attention to her impecuniosity. I do have sympathy for her. It is a matter for the plaintiff whether any order I make is sought to be enforced. That is a matter in the plaintiff's hands, not mine. I think it is only just that the plaintiff should have the costs thrown away by this application being brought but not heard as scheduled.
	
	
	I make the following orders.
	


1. The matter is stood out of the list.

2. The matter may be restored by either party on two days notice.

3. The second defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs in respect of the three days set aside for the hearing of this application that did not, at the second defendant’s request, proceed.

		12 February 2015",2015-02-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765836,R v Steele [2015] NSWDC 100,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This judgment concerns the admissibility of some evidence which the Crown wishes to lead at trial. The Crown says it is admissible as tendency evidence. The accused objects, arguing, amongst other matters, that there was a real risk that the evidence was the product of joint concoction, or, as Mr Marr ultimately argued, unconscious contamination.
	
	
	I will take some time to look at the history regarding the admissibility of tendency evidence.
	
	
	It took a while for some lawyers and judges to notice that the introduction of the Evidence Act brought about fundamental changes concerning the admissibility of evidence at trials. In some areas of law it has taken almost 20 years to abandon approaches to the admissibility of evidence which were, in truth, killed off once the Evidence Act commenced operation. Over the years repeated attempts have been made to ignore the plain words of the Act in favour of old common law rules.
	
	
	Perhaps the best example of this concerns the admissibility of tendency evidence and, in particular, the effect of a risk of joint concoction or unconscious contamination on the probative value of such evidence. In 1988 the High Court spoke about this in Hoch v R [1988] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292 (5 October 1988). That ruling presented a significant impediment to the tender of such evidence, particularly by the prosecution. But then in 1995 the rules changed with the introduction of the Evidence Act. Unfortunately, and wrongly, on many occasions the Hoch rule continued to be applied.
	
	
	Writing after his retirement from the High Court, Mr Dyson Heydon, in delivering the Paul Byrne Memorial Lecture last year, summarised the position post Evidence Act thus:
	


“The importation of a Hoch qualification was a gratuitous judicial creation unsupported by any explicit statutory language. Indeed, the judicially generated rebirth of the Hoch qualification in, or its grafting onto, a statute was a rather astonishing event, because it took place in the teeth of the legislative murder of its common law existence”.


	
	Mr Heydon makes his position quite clear in his paper:
	


“The Hoch qualification should not have been introduced into sections 97 and 98”.

 


	
	As he notes, although the legislature tried to kill Hoch, it survived, perhaps most notably in 1999 in R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261, where the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a reasonable possibility of concoction meant that the evidence “must” be withheld from a jury.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal then had a go at eradicating Hoch in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319. A five judge bench decision in which the fact that the Evidence Act had changed the rules regarding tendency evidence was made abundantly clear, might have thought to have consigned Hoch to history, but there continued to be pockets of resistance and, zombie-like, Hoch just would not die.
	
	
	Hoch is regularly quoted in applications of this kind and the mandated rejection of evidence spoken about in Colby is referred to on occasion despite the fact that that decision was effectively overruled in Ellis. The most prominent of the decisions attempting to keep Hoch alive post Ellis was BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303, although other cases such as R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 and R v Andrews [2003] NSWCCA 7, which actually predated Ellis, and the two BJS decisions, BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 and BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 advanced a different and what I would describe as a more accurate view.
	
	
	Fortunately, the Court of Criminal Appeal has now begun to speak with one voice. The recent history is largely dealt with in a restricted judgment which I will call J, delivered late last year. The preponderance of views now emanating from the Court of Criminal Appeal is what I, with respect, believe to be correct. Decisions such as Colby, BP and FB v Regina; Regina v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217 are no longer good law in so far as they suggest that a real possibility of concoction requires a rejection of tendency evidence. I will follow the decisions of Le, Andrews, Ellis, the two BJS cases and J. I will focus on the words of the Evidence Act. I will apply those words in deciding the issue before me.
	
	
	The first step, therefore, is for me to assess the probative value of the evidence. Is it significant? As part of that assessment I will not consider the likelihood that the three relevant witnesses have jointly falsely concocted their stories, because each implicitly denied that they had. All three girls said that what they said in interview with police was the truth. Necessarily that means that they were denying concoction. R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66NSWLR 228 and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA121; (2013) 84 NSWLR 363 and R v JG [2014] NSWCCA 138; BC2014061; 21(9) Crim LN 136 say that I should accept that evidence. So does Mr Heydon in his paper. It is no part of my function to decide issues surrounding the credibility of the witnesses when they deny concoction, the question as to whether there was concoction being a matter properly left for the jury.
	
	
	In this case, Mr Marr properly conceded that an assessment of the credibility of the three girls was no part of my function at this stage. Mr Marr asked me to accept not that the girls were deliberately lying, but that there has been some unconscious contamination. I believe Mr Marr’s concession to be correct and, indeed, unavoidable in the light of the recent decisions. That reduces the issues regarding the question of contamination dramatically.
	
	
	Before I get there, however, I have to start at the beginning, by considering whether, ignoring the possibility of concoction and contamination, the proposed evidence has substantial probative value. It is Mr Marr’s primary submission that the Crown’s application falls at this hurdle.
	
	
	The complainant and the two proposed tendency witnesses gave evidence of conduct on the accused’s part which had, to use an old term but one that is accurate in this case, striking similarities. All three were around the same age, early in their teenage years; the alleged assaults occurred in a relatively fixed period of time of less than two years; all three were females; all three describe the accused touching their genitals with his fingers; all three were staying overnight at the accused’s home at the time of almost all of the alleged assaults; all three were again almost all the time wearing night attire at the time of the assaults; they all allege repeated assaults; there is evidence that they were all tickled by the accused in an inappropriate way; and they all describe the accused’s actions in a way which made it clear that he treated their consent, or lack of it, as irrelevant.
	
	
	It is not going too far by any means to say that the evidence establishes a tendency to have a sexual attraction to girls of that age and to adopt a particular modus operandi to give effect to that sexual attraction.
	
	
	Also striking is what they do not allege. In particular, none of the witnesses refer to the accused seeking or demanding or forcing them to touch or stimulate his penis in any way; there are no allegations, for example, of fellatio or any other form of penile intercourse, let alone him demanding that the witnesses rub his penis. As someone who has dealt with allegations of child sexual assault over many, many years, I find what the witnesses do not allege as being unusual.
	
	
	Of course there are differences too, as Mr Marr pointed out. Most notably, the complainant alleges cunnilingus and actual penetration of her genitals by the accused’s finger; something the other two witnesses do not allege. Also, the complainant denies being touched on the breasts; something the other two witnesses say occurred repeatedly. Despite these differences, I regard the circumstances I have referred to as demonstrating a real tendency on the part of the accused to act in the way the witnesses describe. In particular, to have a sexual attraction towards girls in their young teens and, thus, to sexually assault girls in their early teenage years who are temporarily residing at his home, using what could be regarded as innocent tickling as one of the number of means to achieve his objective.
	
	
	But as I mentioned earlier, that is not the end of the matter regarding probative value. I will consider the effect of the risk of what Mr Marr called unconscious contamination on the probative value of the evidence.
	
	
	The first thing to note is that, as might be expected, the witnesses did not give consistent evidence about such things as what they knew of complaints by the others and when they knew it. In general, where that has happened, I have been prepared to proceed on the assumption that the evidence most favourable to the accused should be accepted. I have done this not because I think that evidence should be favoured but because the decision I reach would be the same even if I was to make different findings of fact. I also note that, as might be expected, the mothers of the complainant and the two tendency witnesses were anxious to discover whether, and to what extent, their daughters alleged sexual contact with the accused. As part of that process, on occasions they questioned their daughters in such a way to reveal what another girl was alleging. The centrality of one particular mother, who had a real motive to hurt the accused, (him having left her for a 17 year old girl formerly employed by her), in the making of the allegations is a matter suggesting the opportunity for contamination.
	
	
	But there is other evidence too which needs to be considered in determining the likelihood that the evidence of the witness is the product of unconscious contamination. Here, one of the differences I referred to becomes important. If these allegations, or at least the particulars of them, were unconsciously contaminated by one learning what another is alleging, why then did they not all allege cunnilingus, for example? The mother of one of the girls gave evidence that she had learnt that another of the girls was alleging some form of oral sex. Clearly anxious to find out the extent of what the accused did to her daughter, she asked her whether oral sex was involved and told her that was something which the other girl claimed had occurred. But the fact that, in response her daughter did not also make an allegation of oral sex, speaks eloquently about the likelihood that her allegations were contaminated. That the complainant would deny being touched on the breasts also suggests either that she has not learnt about the details of the allegations made by the others or that, having learnt about them, she has not unconsciously changed the allegations she makes in order to fit in with the versions given by the others.
	
	
	I am fully aware that, at first blush, reliance on differences between the events described by the complainant has a heads-you-win/tails-you-lose flavour about it, where I have relied on similarities earlier in this judgment. In truth, there is nothing illogical in my approach. The examination of similarities and differences was undertaken earlier in order to decide whether the evidence was substantially probative of the tendency. At this stage the analysis is undertaken in determining the level of risk that the similarities have come about through unconscious contamination.
	
	
	I should also mention some evidence which came into the possession of the Crown somewhat belatedly. It appears that first complaint by one of the witnesses was made to her grandmother and father much earlier than the evidence had otherwise revealed. This was a substantial impediment to finding a risk that her evidence was a product of unconscious contamination.
	
	
	I will go so far as to say that the evidence demonstrates no possibility at all that the probative value of the tendency evidence is in any way affected by unconscious contamination. I thus find that the evidence which the Crown wish to tender does have significant probative value.
	
	
	The next step is to consider the risk of prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Curiously, and as Mr Marr pointed out, s 101 of the Evidence Act does not use the words “unfair prejudice”. The omission of the word “unfair” is difficult to understand. All probative evidence adduced by the Crown has a prejudicial effect upon the accused. Unless the concept of unfairness is introduced into the test in s 101(2), then no evidence would ever be admitted as tendency evidence, because as soon as it had the significant probative value required by s 97, it would automatically have an equal prejudicial effect. No tendency evidence could ever satisfy the test under s 101(2).
	
	
	Having been critical of one aspect of Colby, I should note the following accurate statement on the issue of prejudice. At paragraph 97:
	


“Section 101(2) further restricts tendency and coincidence evidence by precluding its use by the prosecution, unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. Prejudice is not established by the mere fact of the weight of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue, the focus is upon the danger that the tribunal of fact would use the evidence upon a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case”.


	
	In its review of the Evidence Act the Australian Law Reform Commission,
	


ALRC Report 102, noted, at page 380, footnote 61:

“The expression ‘prejudicial effect’ is not qualified by the word ‘unfair’. One commentator, Peter Bain, considers the significance of this omission, but concludes, correctly it is suggested, that properly constructed prejudice in question is unfair prejudice”.


	
	The Commission then refers to Mr Bain’s article and cites a number of cases, including Colby, the decision of the CCA to which I have just referred.
	
	
	I am satisfied, therefore, that, properly understood, s 101(2) is to be interpreted as requiring me to balance the probative value of the evidence against any unfair prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. In doing so, I am interpreting s 101 in a way which avoids an absurdity. It is often said that admission of tendency evidence is so powerful that the chances of acquittal are dramatically diminished. All that does is point to the high probative value of the evidence, it does not suggest that jurors will look at matters unfairly or in a manner logically unconnected with the issues in the case. The prosecution is not disentitled from bringing a powerful Crown case because of s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Any risk of unfair prejudice has to be assessed in the light of directions given to the jury by the trial judge. The law proceeds on the basis that jurors follow judges’ directions. Research into the behaviour of jurors bears out the accuracy of that approach. Where is the possible unfair prejudice then? Mr Marr referred to the fact that the two tendency witnesses make allegation of things which they are unable to particularise. Whether that is unfairly prejudicial need not be determined, as I expect that such context evidence would not be admitted, with the evidence of the tendency witnesses being restricted to events about which they can give particulars.
	
	
	Next, Mr Marr referred to the cumulative effect of the tendency witnesses corroborating each other as to an event where they were both present, in circumstances where the complainant’s evidence would otherwise be uncorroborated. In so far as I understand Mr Marr’s point, it seems to me that there is nothing unfair or illogical in the process of reasoning that the jury might adopt, namely, the two tendency witnesses corroborate each other, so it is more likely that they are telling the truth, which, in turn, makes it more likely that the complainant is telling the truth. That process of reasoning does not involve any misuse of the evidence at all.
	
	
	The result is that I can find no unfair prejudice to the accused. In light of my early finding that the evidence has substantial probative value, I have therefore decided that the tendency evidence will be admitted.

2765839,R v Albanese [2015] NSWDC 170,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Brian Lee Albanese appears today for sentence in relation to an offence for which he was committed for sentence, but for which he was also arraigned on indictment, alleging that he on or about 21 March 2014 in the State of New South Wales did attempt to possess a substance, the substance having been unlawfully imported, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely, methamphetamine and the quantity being a commercial quantity.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty is imprisonment for ‘life’ and or a fine of $1.275 million.
	
	
	The offence is one contrary to s 307.5 Criminal Code (Cth), according to the Crown’s written submissions, “by virtue of s 11.1 of the Code.”
	
	
	As I said, the prisoner pleaded guilty at the Local Court. There is some suggestion of some delay in the material specifically addressed by learned counsel for the prisoner. It seems to me, as I will expose when I deal with some Crown submissions, that in accordance with the practice in New South Wales in Commonwealth matters, a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence is appropriate to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by the prisoner. He has facilitated the court of justice with his admissions as well.
	
	
	The statement of facts are a detailed document. Some aspects of that detail need to be repeated, some aspects need not.
	
	
	I start by noting that the prisoner is citizen of the United States of America. He arrived in Australia, as I understand it, on 18 March 2014. It is clear on the evidence that he had come to Australia for the purpose, by arrangement as set out in the facts which I will deal with shortly with another man, to receive a package that he understood had been sent to Australia.
	
	
	The issue of what he knew, what he did not know, what he was expecting in the package when he first arrived in Australia and what he might have expected when he went to TNT on 21 March 2014 and was arrested trying to pick up the package, are all matters of some controversy.
	
	
	This package was addressed to a person called “Jenny Smit” at a storage facility as I would understand it in Epsom Road, Rosebery. The consignor was a person with an address in Mexico. The contents were declared as “barium sulphate.” The net weight of the contents of the package, as I understand it, was just over 10 kilograms.
	
	
	The Crown facts state that barium sulphate can be purchased in Sydney, Australia at $2.07, plus GST which is 10% in the Commonwealth of Australia, per kilo from a particular corporation. The cost of 10 kilograms of barium sulphate equivalent to the weight of the consignment would be $37.77, including the delivery fee.
	
	
	This consignment was examined by Australian Customs officers and the contents were discovered to include ten silver foil sachets inside which were in each case a clear plastic bag containing off‑white powder and also containing a second bag with a crystalline substance. Customs officers did a presumptive test and it gave an indication for the presence of methamphetamine.
	
	
	The consignment, a photograph of which is part of the Crown material, was naturally then more closely examined. Ultimately it was discovered by scientific measurement that the various substances that were respectively wrapped in foil and plastic bags contained 2.028 kilograms of impure methamphetamine with a calculated pure weight of 1.5941 kilograms of pure methamphetamine. The average purity, the usual way these things are assessed, was about 78.9%. The street value of the methamphetamine is said to be about $1.778 million. The wholesale value of the methamphetamine is about $515,000. These figures were not the subject of any dispute. I am very mindful of the fact that street values and wholesale values need to be approached with some little circumspection. There may be some flexibility in price in the market.
	
	
	The prisoner when he eventually was interviewed in relation to this matter told the AFP that he had come to Australia to perform the task, as he understood it, to receive the package in the manner he described in his dealings with the AFP for a sum of $5,000 plus any expenses.
	
	
	In any event, the Customs officials and the AFP in their usual efficient way went about substituting for the border controlled drug, a substance which was put back into the reconstructed package for it to be ultimately picked up, or attempted to be picked up, by the accused on 21 March 2014 at the TNT organisation.
	
	
	The offender arrived in Australia, as I said, on 18 March. He had an electronic travel authority which apparently was issued on his departure from the United States. I noted in his interview, it is a matter that I will take into account in the general scheme of things somewhat to his favour, that he actually had applied for the wrong document to travel to Australia and it was fixed up electronically when he was checking-in at the airport in Los Angeles. He had never previously come to Australia.
	
	
	When he arrived in Australia he set up a mobile phone service with Vodafone Telecommunications. He gave his name but supplied an address in Wolli Creek which used to be called Arncliffe, close to airport, which is in fact the address of the Mercure hotel located at Sydney Airport.
	
	
	I note in his interview, and it was not a matter really emphasised or commented upon in the submissions, that when he gave an explanation for giving an address that the “facts” state was one that he had never been a guest at and nor was intending to stay at, that he told the AFP that he did not provide all the details of his address. He gave some particulars and apparently the person at Vodafone filled in the rest of the details.
	
	
	In any event, he then, when he had the mobile phone with an Australian service connected he rang TNT customer service and made arrangements to eventually pick up the package. He advised his new mobile phone number but advised TNT not to contact him on a listed consignment phone number that he must have had in his possession.
	
	
	The delivery of the package to him was, it would seem to me, stalled by TNT because of the work of the AFP and the Customs office. I have particulars of the documentation that was on the original package and the description of the contents of the package. When the box had been reconstructed there was a controlled delivery of the consignment to the TNT Botany Depot. The accused was told to come and pick up the consignment sometime before 2pm, having been put off earlier in the day. He arrived at 12.17pm in a taxi. He picked up the consignment which had obviously been reconstructed by Customs and the AFP, and as he departed the reception area walking towards the taxi he was arrested.
	
	
	The AFP officers or agents picked up from him the consignment, three mobile phones, including the mobile phone with the Vodafone SIM card used to contact TNT, an Apple iPad, a Mac electronic‑book, laptop, a number of hotel and airline receipts and four handwritten notes with details relating to conversations he had had about the consignment. A copy of those notes were attached to the facts and they are the subject of comment by the prisoner in the course of his interview.
	
	
	The prisoner approximately an hour and a half later was given an opportunity to participate in a taped record of interview. He made contact with the US Consulate which is a sensible thing for him to do and then requested the police interview him later, so that he could get legal advice with the assistance of the Consulate.
	
	
	If one was reading the facts the next thing one would see is that on 1 May, that is obviously six weeks later or thereabouts, he participated in a recorded interview and I will come to that document in a moment.
	
	
	However, the facts are that, by reason of material that is placed in a sealed envelope, I am aware of the fact that in reality the prisoner actively cooperated with the AFP from shortly after the time of his arrest and participated as a civilian participant in a controlled operation run by the AFP with the aim of identifying the intended recipients of the consignment. During this operation he did various things which indicate a complete willingness to assist the AFP. The operation involving him as a “civilian participant” concluded on the 22nd with no arrests and in the course of his cooperation it is clear that he was able to provide particular information about matters relevant to the consignment arriving in Australia.
	
	
	His counsel tendered as an exhibit, but it became a Crown exhibit for obvious reasons, the transcript of the interview of the prisoner on 1 May 2014. The Crown in the statement of facts sought to summarise details of that interview. I do not propose, save for dealing with the particular issues that were raised in submissions, to quote from it extensively.
	
	
	He set out the circumstances in which he came to meet a man called Dale Schwade in Lima, Peru. He gave details about that person. This was a person, I hasten to say, the prisoner had identified shortly after his arrest, and in fact with whom he liaised throughout 21 and 22 March to assist the police in their further enquiries. He gave explanation as to what was asked of him to come to Australia, what his relevant state of knowledge was at various times, the circumstances of his activities in Australia, why he obtained an Australian phone number, why he had a number of mobile phones, things that he was required to do as part of the approach made to him by Mr Schwade, what he was going to be paid which I have already outlined, how he tracked the consignment online and matters pertinent to how he came to become suspicious of the fact that the enterprise that he had agreed to participate in was not a legal enterprise that he initially believed it to be.
	
	
	I might add to some of the detail in the “facts”, because they are not meant to be exhaustive, that the accused told the AFP about another person called Daniel Keenan whose older brother he had stayed with at Peru when he met Mr Schwade. It would appear that he understood that Mr Schwade was friends with the Keenans and he knew the Keenans because there was a Jeremiah Keenan with whom he had worked in the United States in Washington, D.C.
	
	
	Part of the factual matrix of this offending is that the prisoner was for several years before coming to Australia a procurement officer, in part involved in procuring equipment for the Federal Government of the United States, particularly in relation to the area of defence, including equipment that the United States Government was proposing to use for military operations in Afghanistan.
	
	
	This connection between Schwade and the Keenans gave Schwade an air of respectability and it is a relevant matter to assessing the account that the prisoner gave. In the electronic interview in answer to question 24, he went into great detail as to the circumstances in which he came to Australia. He indicated that by the time he came to Australia, having regard to the conversations that he was having with Schwade, there was a certain amount of uncertainty about what he was actually here to do. He said that he was initially brought to Australia to get access to or to obtain a substance “used on statues” and he was to deliver this substance to a business partner of Dale Schwade whose identity was known to the prisoner through Facebook. It was in these circumstances that he agreed because he saw this as some form of exciting new business opportunity for him. I take it from that that his involvement working for the Federal Government had come to an end at least temporarily. He said that he “honestly” thought that in the box that he was to pick up on the instructions of Schwade there were “art supplies.”
	
	
	He then went on to explain that Schwade was very “reassuring” and he was concerned when there was some delay in picking up the package. He said, inter alia, and I am only picking some of the answers he gave in the context of the information provided in the Crown’s detailed statement: “I had no reason not to trust him. The people that introduced me to him were good people, I mean I worked with, you know, his brother in the Government. I had no reason to not believe him.”
	
	
	He made the point that he was in Australia by himself and there was nobody else that he could really trust. When he learnt that there was a Custom’s hold on the consignment he was asked by the AFP interviewer did he suspect there may be drugs, he said, “It maybe something illegal” ... “Whether it was drugs or something else illegal, just something illegal.”
	
	
	He explained the notes in the Post‑it pads, or small pieces of notepaper, were made by him because he was “raising flags...in my mind” and he was trying to keep a record of what was happening, bearing in mind he was having some uncertainty about relevant events.
	
	
	He volunteered that Schwade had asked him to pick up a “Teflon pipe and Pyrex dish” as part of the tasks that he was assigned, but he was not familiar with those items. He did not know what to do with them but he had to deliver the items to Schwade’s business partner. When he saw the package he realised it was from Mexico.
	
	
	He said he had never been to Mexico before and he said the name of the contexts “Barium sulphate” was not something he had heard of previously. All he understood of what was being said, were “minerals used for statues...I didn’t have a specific name for it, nor did I, you know, request the name.”
	
	
	Bearing in mind that the suspicions he had about it being something illegal, either guns or drugs, had arisen the day before, he went through with “picking it up” he said because; “I was simply...scared and, you know, I didn’t know...the best way to get out of the situation besides...doing what he was telling me to do.”
	
	
	He was then asked this question, “Tell me a bit more about that. Tell me what you - what you mean by that?” Answer, “Well when he mentioned that he was - that I was delivering this to the cartel I knew that, you know, I was in danger, you know, because he knew, he knew my name and he knows where I live.”
	
	
	This conversation happened the day before he picked up the package. He had a whole “bunch of questions”, as he described it, in his head. He said that Schwade could sense his “uncertainty.” He said that Schwade “just wanted to make sure that I would still, you know, go through with it. He was asking me to do what he was asking me to do because it was our lives, his life and my life at stake.” (emphasis added).
	
	
	When pressed as to what the cartel was, he said it was “just a very, very dangerous group of people.” When asked what group of people, what type of cartel it was, he said that he was not told what type of cartel it was, just that Schwade had mentioned that his family was Vietnamese and being of Canadian and Dominican descent, he said;
	
	
	“But when I think cartel, I think, you know it’s very dangerous people from where, where I’m from. It’s all - it’s only danger when you hear about them on the news.”
	
	
	He said that he did not know that it was drugs in the consignment.
	
	
	He said, “I just knew it was something illegal” referring to the time that his suspicions were aroused having regard to the delay in gaining access.
	
	
	He went on to explain that he thought this was a “normal trip” and in relation to the hotel, as to whether he had told the person at Vodafone what hotel he was going to be staying at, as I mentioned earlier, he said, “I didn’t have an address and I told the guy that was working that I’m going to be staying in a hotel and just (he) put an address.”
	


“Q. Did you inform him what hotel you’d be staying at?

A. I don’t think - I don’t think I had to. He just simply, you know, put it together.”


	
	That is some of the interview. Some of what I have read supplements what is in the statement of facts. Some is included in the statement of facts. But it is important to read onto the record some of those passages because the question of the accused’s state of mind is relevant to the assessment of his moral culpability. Of course, also relevant to the issue of his moral culpability is the issue of what is described as “non‑exculpatory duress” that is raised on behalf of the prisoner.
	
	
	The Crown also provided detailed written submissions which I will come to when I conclude my treatment of the evidence and a number of comparative cases which invites some comment in the context of other authorities, particularly the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194.
	
	
	In relation to the defence case, apart from the interview, as I said, I note that whilst the prisoner did not give evidence, nor any oral evidence was called on his part, there was produced a number of documents relating to the prisoner’s personal circumstances. This included a letter addressed to the Court from the prisoner which I have taken into account, another document which I would take to be his curriculum vitae, probably a document more appropriate for a job application I should say than court proceedings, and a range of references from people who know the prisoner in the United States, including and this is a very brief summary, Fraternity Brothers from the University of Maryland from which the prisoner graduated in 2007, a co-worker who knew him through in part what was described as the prisoner’s “social activism,” a retired Sergeant Major from the United States Army, retiring in the mid‑90s with a background in military intelligence who appears to be a family friend and is aware of the prisoner’s past employment and family circumstances, another person describing himself as the prisoner’s “mentor” and “spiritual leader”, a Senior Associate for PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Washington D.C./Marylands/Virginia area and other associates who report to be respectable people in their community, including a military member of the United States Air Force who has worked with the prisoner when he worked at a military hospital at an Air Base near Washington, D.C., work supervisor holding the position described in the reference as Director of Procurement with the United States Department of Labour, a co‑worker in defence procurement, the Director of Athletics at a Maryland High School who knew the prisoner through his younger sisters and his coaching of that High School’s basketball team and, finally, a reference from the Chaplain at Long Bay Gaol.
	
	
	I do not mean any disrespect to the way the case was presented, but on behalf of the prisoner I believe I would have been greatly helped by a chronology to sort out the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, of the information available in evidence through the references.
	
	
	I appreciate of course, learned counsel for the prisoner provided written submissions which set out a type of chronological outline of the prisoner’s “subjective background”, with information that does not seem to be able to be found in the references I have been provided, but I am prepared to accept the information is consistent with the other information I know.
	
	
	In relation to that matter, just to put the prisoner’s case in context;
	
	
	he is now aged 30, being born on 6 May 1984. He is one of four siblings. He has got two younger sisters and an older sister as I understand it. His father he has had no contact with since he was five years of age. His stepfather who had raised him since he was seven separated from his mother approximately five years ago. There is evidence in the documentary material that his mother had worked in the Federal Government for over 20 years and up until coming to Australia he lived with his mother and his three sisters, somewhere in the Washington, D.C./Maryland area. This is a house that he purchased jointly with his mother.
	
	
	Over the last several years he has been employed by the US Federal Government as a procurer of property and other items, described as a “Senior Contract Specialist.” I accept that the family is supportive.
	
	
	He is said, in the submissions of his counsel, to have a Bachelor of Administration and Communications at the University of Maryland, but his own CV suggests he has what is described as a Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Public Relations and a “Minor” in Business Administration.
	
	
	As best I can work out, as far as his Federal work is concerned, he has worked, as I have pointed out, in a military hospital, apparently whilst he was an undergraduate. He has particular qualifications relating to procurement of property and has worked for the Federal Government as best I can work out since 2006, including procuring military and defence equipment. This would require of course a security clearance and I accept that up until coming to Australian he was a person of excellent character and with no prior criminal convictions.
	
	
	It would seem that, at face value, all his referees are very respectable people and I have set out some of their curriculum vitae without naming them. The Sergeant Major to which I referred said that he had had 30 years of service in military intelligence and was apparently currently employed with the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, wherever that is, assisting with collating of material, no doubt a position of great responsibility. His various fraternity brothers and other associates appear to be people with responsible positions within their community.
	
	
	The thread of the evidence within the references that I have read, and I accept, is that the prisoner has close community ties in the Maryland/Washington, D.C. area. He is a community minded person. He is involved in what is described as “social activism” and community projects. He is a strong supporter of his mother and his siblings who were left to cope in some difficulty when his stepfather abandoned the family.
	
	
	He, amongst other things, at some time, either whilst an undergraduate or shortly after graduating, volunteered to run the basketball program for a local high school. This area where the high school is located is referred to in some references as “Seton” although I understand the high school is called “Elizabeth Seton.” I have heard of a College famous for its basketball team called “Seton Hall”, where Andrew Gaze played college basketball some 15 years ago, but whether that is in the same area I have got no idea.
	
	
	The various referees talk about the prisoner’s honesty, his commitment to work colleagues and social causes, his professionalism. They all seem to agree that what he has been charged with is a great shock to them and uncharacteristic of him. One referee said that the prisoner she knew “would never go to another country transporting drugs and risking his life to be away from his family and friends.” Within his fraternity at the university he is respected for his qualities and his concern for others, he has no reputation for being an associate of the criminal elements. The Associate with PricewaterhouseCoopers summed it up by saying that from ten years of association the prisoner was ‘driven...genuine...loyal...honest...selfless.” He and others speak of the prisoner’s industry.
	
	
	The Air Force military member talked of him having demonstrated in the past “sound judgment”, strong decision-making skills and being extremely responsible. Part of the prisoner’s downfall he opined might have been his willingness to assist others. Whilst in custody the prisoner has attained some certificates which I have taken into account.
	
	
	The Chaplain has written a very favourable reference saying that the prisoner is active in the Christian group in his wing and he has impressed the Chaplain very much with his concern for his fellow inmates and his overall maturity. The Chaplain described him as a “model inmate” compliant with all directions from custodial staff. The prisoner expressed to him his remorse as he did in his letter to the Court and the Chaplain noted that the prisoner has experienced a “salutary lesson” and believes that the prisoner will seek to obey and respect the laws of any country in which he is resident. He noted the prisoner’s concern to return to his homeland, as one would expect.
	
	
	The prisoner said in his letter to the Court that he hoped to make his experience of being in custody here one that he could turn to advantage to help young people in his home country make better decisions and “trust authorities in these situations.” He said, “I vow to turn this mistake into good for this community and mine in the U.S.” He noted in his testimonial to the Court that when he asserts that he realised that something was wrong, as he stated in the record of interview, he felt scared but he did not know where to turn to, claiming that he had been threatened to do what he was told or bad things would happen to him and that would cause him to comply. This account in his statement does not strictly accord with the account that he gave in the interview, where the threat that he perceived is expressed by him in the interview on 1 May as more indirect and subtle than claimed in his statement to the Court. In his statement he also asserts that being in custody has been a salutary experience and one he does not wish to experience again, and I accept that that is so given his background.
	
	
	He also understands quite obviously that his previous employment in Government is “in jeopardy”, to use his words, as would be any security clearance. I would be very, very surprised if he would ever be given a security clearance such as he had before when he returns to the United States. He also understands that his conviction here in this country will have implications for him in relation to his association with various people. He has said that he, however, would like to re-establish those relationships and it would appear that many of their testimonials indicate that those people will stand by him on his return.
	
	
	I appreciate of course that with regard to the referees who come from the United States and the prisoner’s statement by Court the Crown is effectively prohibited from undertaking any meaningful enquiry in relation to any of the representations that are made. Of course, it could undertake some enquiries to the very existence of the referees through various means, I accept, but many of the assertions cannot be tested. I am not suggesting for a moment that these people do not exist. I believe in the circumstances, particularly having regard to the cooperation the prisoner has shown to the AFP in a very, very timely way, without long reflection, I can proceed on the basis that many of the observations made about him have been made in good faith.
	
	
	I note at least one of the referees has reflected upon the accused’s “innocence”, an assertion I took to be more loose language rather than anything else. Of course, that assertion cannot be correct. Particularly the Crown has not had an opportunity to test the accused’s statement, nor even his previous representations to the AFP but that having been said that they have acted upon his information.
	
	
	I have taken into account in the assessment of both the subjective circumstances of the prisoner and reflection upon the objective facts, particularly as far as his moral culpability is concerned, his ready willingness to be interviewed by police confirming a number of matters, it must be fairly said, already known to the AFP, but in circumstances where he could have exercised his right to silence. There is, as I have said earlier, his immediate cooperation with the AFP. I have already noted the AFP confirms as it might relate back to the observations I made about the subjective case, that the prisoner is known to be a Senior Contract Specialist in the United States and it asserts that the prisoner has close family connection and “strong ties with his community.”
	
	
	So far as his cooperation is concerned I have already read some material from the confidential information provided to me. I point out that there is an opinion expressed within that report that the accused did not “make full admissions in relation to the nature of the substance concealed within the consignment.” However, that opinion or evaluation must be subject to an assessment of the matter by this Court with all the information available to it as to whether the prisoner at the time that he came to the country knew precisely what was being imported or, in fact, whether he believed his visit to this country was to be involved in illegal activity.
	
	
	I note from the information I have the prisoner has continued to provide assistance in the form of written statements relating to matters concerning activities with which he is familiar. I propose not to go into the detail of that information which is independent of the charge. He has provided assistance to the AFP on four separate occasions between April and July 2014 and some details of some of the intelligence he has provided is set out in the report.
	
	
	The level of assistance provided by the prisoner has been assessed by the AFP as “high” and the report says that the prisoner is believed to have “provided all the assistance he reasonably could following his arrest” and continues to provide assistance whilst in custody. The value of that assistance is assessed as “low.”
	
	
	He has provided intelligence both to domestically and internationally but there have been no arrests arising from it. This evaluation clearly is one to be seen as reflecting the results of the cooperation, not the truth or accuracy of the cooperation. I note overall the assistance identified is described as “medium.” That assessment, however, does not necessarily present a yardstick that definitively defines or assesses the calculation of a discount for assistance that the Court has the discretion to grant.
	
	
	I turn now to the submissions in this matter and will deal with the particular matters of controversy, if I might call them that, that arise from the evidence in the case.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions are in their usual way thorough and highly pertinent and there is not a need for me to go to particular matters in detail beyond noting particular matters, although all matters have been taken into account. Clearly I am required to sentence the prisoner in accordance with Pt 1B Commonwealth Crimes Act and amongst the relevant provisions I must have regard to are particularly s 16A and the various matters identified in s 16A(2) Commonwealth Crimes Act. These include the nature and circumstances of the offence which I have summarised, although I will come back to the role of the offender in a moment.
	
	
	The maximum penalty serves as a yardstick and reflects upon the seriousness of offending contemplated by the legislation. This does bring me back to De La Rosa, a case that for some reason the Commonwealth Crown rarely cites in its written submissions, although in all respects is a very, very helpful judgment in Commonwealth sentencing matters relating to crimes that associated with the importation of border controlled drugs. I appreciate, of course, in De La Rosa that offender was sentenced and was the subject of a Crown appeal in relation to his plea of guilty for the importation in 2008 of a border controlled drug, namely, cocaine in what was described as a “marketable quantity.” I am mindful of the fact personally that this prisoner did not “import” the drug but attempted to “possess” the border controlled drug which clear had been imported. I am mindful of the fact, of course, here, we are dealing with a commercial quantity. Here, of course we are dealing with the border controlled drug, methamphetamine. De La Rosa is a case about cocaine, and I am not here to express any opinions based upon authority, or personal, about the relative merits or demerits of methamphetamine as opposed to cocaine as dangerous drugs.
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact that, as I understand it, the scheme for identifying marketable and commercial quantities in terms of weight for those drugs might vary to some extent but the general observations are made by Justice McClellan, the then Chief Judge at Common Law, amongst a Full Bench of five judges concerning arrangement penalties that may be appropriate to consider to achieve consistency in sentencing, from [193] onwards, is of some relevance. His Honour undertook what could be called an exhaustive analysis having regard to detailed submissions from both Crown and defence of the categorisation of offending in relation to both importing trafficable or marketable quantities of border controlled drugs and importing commercial quantities of border control drugs and sought to analyse the matter by reference to categorisation of conduct having regard to particular characteristics of the offending and having regard to the quantities, bearing in mind as he said that whilst the quantity was not definitive within a particular range of criminal conduct, it was still a relevant matter as the High Court had held in Wong.
	
	
	The quantity with which I am concerned here of course is a commercial quantity and his Honour in relation to the importation of commercial quantities of cocaine identified four groups of offending, in relation to marketable quantities he identified three groups of offending. In respect of what he described as “Group 4” he described this group of offenders as being those involving quantities of drugs subject to, of course, the legislative scheme for commercial quantities, ranging from 1 kilogram to 30 kilogram, and offenders occupying roles variously described as instigators, overseers, collectors and couriers. Many of the offenders in this group had good antecedents and no prior convictions and nearly all pleaded guilty. I refer particularly to [214] - [215] and the outline table that he set out at [224].
	
	
	He said in relation to this group he described as “Group 4” in his Table as being usually from his analysis of many cases;
	


“No prior convictions; good antecedents; quantity not indicative; plea not indicative although discount provided for early plea; role not indicative although generally part of syndicate.”


	
	I pause to point out I have got no basis for concluding that the prisoner was part of a “syndicate” in a knowing or substantial way.
	
	
	The matter of the role of the prisoner, as it is discussed by the Crown and this is the reason I dwell on this matter at this time, involves the Crown identifying the various steps in the accused’s involvement from agreeing to come to Australia for payment and the various things he did in Australia set out in para 13 in the prosecution submissions.
	
	
	So far as receipt of the package is concerned, I agree with the analysis of the Crown set out in that paragraph that the prisoner was “the main contact” for the purposes of picking up the package, but there is absolutely no evidence that the accused was “the main contact” for the distribution or dissemination of the border controlled drugs. It is clear that the prisoner’s role is that of a “collector” and clear, bearing in mind he was fully exposed by name and identity, that if something went wrong with the importation he would be the first person intercepted. Thus the true “main contact in Australia”, that is the person who was to make use of the border controlled drugs, was protected if the package was intercepted, as it was, and the person collecting the package was arrested.
	
	
	In the Crown’s very helpful oral submissions, if I might again get a little ahead of myself, the Crown pointed to matters that the prisoner had “given the wrong address” for the mobile telephone service, the prisoner had received - or was to receive a substantial sum of money, the prisoner was the person who arrived separately from the package, had been sent a mobile phone, knew enough about the delivery to advise TNT not to contact the particular contact number that was on the consignment slip and was tracking the package. The Crown submitted that if the prisoner had no knowledge of what he was involved with when he agreed to come to Australia one might ask why he was to be paid so much for doing such a menial task. In relation to that matter the facts of the matter are that given the prisoner had travelled from the United States, whilst the actual collection of a package was a “menial task” it was menial task undertaken not by a local contact but by a person who had taken up a great deal of time to travel here which of itself might explain to some degree the financial remuneration that was to be paid to him.
	
	
	I accept the account given by the prisoner that he when he left the United States he was not aware of the fact that he was coming to Australia to perform an illegal act. There is, however, in this matter from his own account some degree of circumspection that was missing in his approach to the matter. He met a man in Lima, Peru, which of itself to my mind has an element of suspicion, he was given very few details about precisely what he was to take delivery of, except a very general description of the fact that it was relevant to something to do with art supplies, and he was not given a great deal of particulars as to precisely who he was to contact and in what circumstances that contact was to occur. These matters, of course, raise suspicion as do the matters identified in the Crown’s helpful submissions. But the truth of the matter is that there were other features of the case to be taken into account that might reflect upon the truth of the assertions made by the prisoner in his recorded interview. There was his prior good conduct, lack of criminal convictions and his trusted role in the American Federal Government in jeopardy if he was involved in the type of offending that ultimately came to pass. In my view he was somewhat naïve in his approach to the matter but his own interview indicates that his trusting of the man that recruited him stemmed in part from the fact that that person was known to people that the prisoner knew were respectable people.
	
	
	Part of the lacuna of the evidence available to me is that I am unaware precisely of the prisoner’s financial circumstances at the time that he agreed to undertake this exercise. Clearly, he was not doing American Government work at that time. Whether his contract had come to an end, or whether there was no more work, or whether he had a break between contracts it is not clear in the evidence what is the case. To find the time to come out to Australia to perform the tasks that he agreed to do is something that could not have been done if he was then in regular employment. But, on the other hand, there is a body of evidence produced, which I accept, that he is generally industrious and has been in regular employment.
	
	
	Clearly the criminal culpability of the prisoner must focus on his failure, once he became suspicious, to take his suspicions to an authority. I understand he was ‘a stranger in a strange land’ but Australia is not so that much different from the United States that he could not have appreciated that if he had suspicions about the matter they were matters that he could properly take to local authorities. This is not Peru. Anyone who has been to South America, or particularly Peru and Bolivia, knows that one would approach investigating authorities with some considerable circumspection given their reputation for corruption. But no such suggestion can be made of that in Australia. In all respects Australia is very, very similar to the United States in terms of the reputation and integrity of its investigating authorities.
	
	
	Ultimately I conclude, in the context of dealing at the moment with the role of the prisoner in the matter, that I could not conclude that the prisoner came to Australia with the intention of committing an offence or being relevantly as the law requires reckless to the commission of an offence. I have taken into account, of course, the matters raised by the Crown but they have to be seen in conjunction with the matters that militate against the finding that the Crown urges upon the Court in that regard.
	
	
	Turning now to another aspect of the matter raised in submission by the accused, the issue of the non‑exculpatory duress, this is a matter that was urged upon the Court and a number of authorities were referred to by learned counsel for the prisoner. Particularly the submissions of the accused focussed upon cases such as Olbach v R (2005) 158 A Crim R 586, R v Liu [2005] NSWCCA 378, Tiknius v R (2011) 2001 A Crim R 365, in the judgment of Justice Johnson, and most recently in the decision of RCW v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190.
	
	
	The principles to be applied I believe are probably best set out in the judgment of Johnson J. In that judgment between [32] - [53], in his usual thorough way, the learned Judge of the Supreme Court dealt with the mitigatory aspect of non‑exculpatory duress. This is a matter that when it arises for consideration in this Court, it is required to be established on balance by the prisoner. I accept that it affects the degree of the prisoner’s subjective of moral culpability. It is also relevant to the assessment of the prisoner’s prospects rehabilitation in the appropriate case.
	
	
	His Honour cited the South Australian decision of Day v R [2009] SASC 84 [35] where the Full Bench of the South Australian Supreme Court said;
	


“The fact that the offence has not been committed out of motives of greed or malice but rather out of fear may carry with it the consequence that if the cause of the fear is removed, the offender will be unlikely to offend again. But whether in a particular case the fact that fear of intimidation has played a part in the commission of offences, should result in a reduction in penalty, must depend on the circumstances of the particular case.”


	
	Justice Johnson noted at [42]
	


“Matters of motive are causally related to the offending and may be considered as part of the circumstances of the offending. It may mean that the offence is not one motivated by financial profit or greed which may weigh upon the moral culpability of the offender.”


	
	It was also noted that this is a common claim in many importation cases and claims of this sort require a significant degree of circumspection. Careful and close assessment of the evidence to support such a claim should be made with the onus upon the offender being kept firmly in mind.
	
	
	It was also noted that it will still remain for the Court to determine what weight should be given to that factor on sentence. It will involve, amongst other things, consideration of the duration of the criminal conduct, the nature of the threats made and the opportunities for the offender to report the matter to relevant authorities. I have taken all these matters into account.
	
	
	His Honour pointed out that it was also be borne in mind that the policy considerations underlining the law of duress and the raising of duress do not exclude the weight to be given to general deterrence. In some cases as a matter of police “general deterrence may provide a counter‑threat” to the compliance of the prisoner to the duress. (see [51] - [53]).
	
	
	In relation to this matter I have referred to some of the evidence, although there are some other references in the interview of the accused in which this issue was raised. Reliance is made in the oral and written submissions upon the decision of RCW which I have earlier cited. What I have understood from that decision, having read it very closely it has other relevance in this case which I will deal with in a moment, is that the issue that arose in that appeal was that the claim was made that insufficient weight was given to non‑exculpatory duress.
	
	
	The non‑exculpatory duress in RCW was quite different than that here. The facts in relation to the matter that were tendered in the sentencing proceedings stated;
	


“Throughout the course of his involvement in the offending the Offender felt somewhat intimidated by Thomson and his behaviour. He believed that Thomson had become volatile and increasingly prone to making threats of violence. Accordingly, he felt pressured to carry out tasks as requested by Thomson so as to not upset Thomson.


	
	He nevertheless accepts that he voluntarily carried out the tasks requested of him and willingly participated in the offending.”
	
	
	I hasten to say that RCW was an offender who voluntarily then withdrew from the criminal enterprise. Ultimately, the sentencing judge in RCW concluded that the weight to be given to duress in that matter was “slight.” The judge in that matter accepted the applicant’s claim of duress was credible and in fact support for that claim was that the prisoner withdrew himself from the enterprise and came forward before he was aware of any police investigation, that assisted in supporting “the truthfulness of his claim to have only become involved because of the duress applied to him by Thomson.”
	
	
	Here, the prisoner became involved initially without knowledge of importation of drugs, but once he had his suspicions, reading his interview as favourably as I can, no direct threat was made at all by his contact. Reference was made to ‘possible’ implications and that fear affected the prisoner, he said, because the contact knew his address and the address of his family. But there was, it must be fairly said by comparison to the facts in RCW, a lower level of direct and real threat as opposed to speculative threat at work, in the context of assessing the issue of non‑exculpatory duress as it is relevant to the prisoner’s moral culpability. Bearing in mind, of course, that the prisoner did have the opportunity to withdraw because nobody was restraining him from doing it, or to report the matter to the authorities before he took delivery of the package. It is the case that if in RCW the role of that factor was “slight”, accepting what the prisoner has said in his interview, the weight to be given to that matter and this matter must be less than slight.
	
	
	I appreciate of course that the prisoner from his general knowledge of the world may have a reasonably speculated about the implications of what was happening, but in the absence of any direct threat and his continuation of his involvement, notwithstanding his misgivings with no one looking over his shoulder, as I said, the matter is of little moment in this sentencing proceeding.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions properly identify the amount of the drug is a relevant matter. The commercial quantity of methamphetamine is 0.75 kilograms, I am informed. The amount of methamphetamine involved in this matter is thus almost twice that of the commercial quantity threshold but has to be considered in the context of the range of quantities that may be involved which are discussed in greater length than the Crown submissions by Justice McClellan in De La Rosa.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the context of what I have referred to relevant to non‑exculpatory duress, I would have concluded, that one of the factors that weighed upon the prisoner’s mind when he continued in the matter not withstanding his suspicions and what had been said to him by his contact was the fact that he was to receive $5,000 on his return to the United States and was to receive reimbursement of expenses and that was a matter that contributed to his continued involvement in this matter. Of course people involved in any level in relation to the importation of border controlled drugs with their well-known effects upon the community both here and in the United States should understand that an element of general deterrence is to be expected as part of the sentencing matrix.
	
	
	I have dealt with the issue of the guilty plea. It is a relevant matter to take into account under s 16A(2) of the Act but here in New South Wales also the prisoner is entitled to a discrete discount which I am prepared to give him in the discrete discount which I am prepared to give him in the amount of 25%.
	
	
	The Crown refers to the general principles in its written submissions but as I have earlier pointed out it is quite clear from reading the decision of De La Rosa that the Court of Criminal Appeal has on a multitude of occasions approved a range of discount in accordance with the guideline judgment relevant to State offences of Thomson and Houlton.
	
	
	Another relevant matter to take into account in sentencing the offender is the issue of the cooperation of law enforcement officers and there is no need to reiterate the various principals that are identified in the Crown’s very helpful written submissions, the various cases that deal with this issue include the 1989 decision of Cartwright footnoted by the Crown, R v Gallagher from 1991 and more recently decisions such as El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 62, Chiu [1998], SZ (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 and of course the decision of Sukkar who I sentenced at first instance, but whose sentence was increased by the Court of Criminal Appeal ((2006) 172 A Crim R 151) particularly the observations of Justices Howie and Latham. I have taken into account all the particular matters identified by the Crown.
	
	
	I have concluded the prisoner is entitled to a combined discount of 37%, including both the discount for the plea of guilty and the past and present cooperation. The significant features of his cooperation are, in my view, it was complete even if it has not been effective and it was extremely timely given many times people come forward for benefit of their cooperation with the authorities having for months on occasions failed to provide cooperation in circumstances where their cooperation might reasonably be seen to be foredoomed to failure. As I pointed out from the facts available to the Court the prisoner’s cooperation was extremely timely and the fact that no arrests were made I could not attribute it any way to character to the character or quality of his cooperation or its timeliness. However, there is nothing in the information available to me that indicates that there is some aspect of his imprisonment or alternatively there is no aspect of his future involvement with law enforcement agencies, that will require him to give evidence that necessitates a component of future cooperation. Of course, I am very mindful of the observations in Sukkar of the restraint that needs to be exercised in this regard.
	
	
	The assessment by learned counsel for the prisoner that the discount shall be as great as 50% refers to a yardstick for the combination of plea and cooperation that would involve consideration of circumstances of custody and future requirement of the prisoner to give evidence, or the probability of the prisoner to give evidence, against other offenders. That does not arise here.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submissions in relation to the need, obviously, to give weight to adequate punishment. The offender’s character, antecedents and background are entirely favourable.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that good character may on occasions be a matter that may not carry as great a weight as it may in other offending when dealing with people involved in substantial importations of border controlled drugs and like offending, but here the offender’s character, antecedents and background have been of assistance in assessing the account he gave to the investigating authorities.
	
	
	His post‑arrest conduct also has been exemplary as the chaplain has pointed out. This foolish action of the prisoner in continuing to be involved in this offending in circumstances where he had every reason to take the matter to the authorities will jeopardise his future in the United States.
	
	
	It is not the subject of any submission by his counsel of substance that there is any particular hardship to his family. I appreciate that his mother and his siblings are to some extent dependent upon him for his support and encouragement and I am mindful of what he says about the effect upon him of not being able to be with family for important milestones whilst he is in custody. But in the context of all the evidence available to me no exceptional circumstances have been identified that warrant some mitigation of penalty by reason of hardship to third parties. I accept the Crown’s submissions in that regard.
	
	
	Obviously in sentencing the prisoner I am required to have regard to s 17A Commonwealth Crimes Act. It is conceded in the submissions of counsel for the accused that a term of imprisonment must be imposed, although his submission was that I should impose a term of imprisonment that warranted a recognisance release order, which I would take to be from my understanding of the Commonwealth legislation, a sentence of three years imprisonment or less.
	
	
	In my view taking all matters into account most favourably to the prisoner such a sentence would not reflect the true combined picture of the objective facts and the relevant subjective matters to take into account in this case.
	
	
	The Crown provided several supposedly “comparative” cases in its written submissions and these were most helpful, I do not in any way suggest the Crown’s assistance in this regard or in any other regard was not helpful. Those cases without reading the citations are decisions of Tang from Western Australia in 2013, Tran New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in 2013, Lee, a judgment of my brother Judge Berman SC from 2013 and a Queensland decision of Harris from 2009.
	
	
	In relation to Harris and the West Australian case, of course, being interstate cases there are quirks of local sentencing that would not apply here in New South Wales as there are quirks in New South Wales that would not apply here in those States. I have taken into account what I can glean from the material available to me about those sentences.
	
	
	I have already referred to the fact that I have had regard to the analysis of Justice McClellan in De La Rosa which is of great assistance. His Honour said in respect of the fourth group, concerning commercial quantities of the relevant border controlled drug, that the range of sentences that he can identify usually with a plea of guilty were between 6.25 years through to eight years. The value of the pleas of guilty are not identified. The non-parole period range between three to 4.5 years.
	
	
	In this mater I factor in an objective fact, which I would assume generally, that the knowledge of the relevant offenders of the significance of their role in the importation would have been greater at an earlier time than it was for this particular offender, as I have assessed the matter.
	
	
	The New South Wales cases to which the Crown referred me in its schedule of comparative cases which postdate De La Rosa are not inconsistent with his Honour’s analysis in the decision of De La Rosa. There is as I said earlier, however, something out of RCW at first instance that needs to be pointed out. In that case the complaint was made that the judge in sentencing RCW placed too much weight on one particular comparative case. I note particularly the discussion at [47] - [49] in RCW that the Court has to sentence this prisoner subject to the discrete discounts that are recognised by superior courts by applying the principles as set down by the High Court in Markarian [2005] HCA 25, particularly at [51], and of course the decision of the High Court of Australia in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCAS 45.
	
	
	In relation to the use of comparative cases their Honours criticised too much reliance on a comparative case, or comparative cases. In that matter, that is RCW, the Court said in its judgment, “There was no process of instinctively synthesising all the relevant objective and subjective facts and circumstances to arrive at a proposed sentence and then looking at the outcome of other similar cases that may have provided the check or yardstick”. Their Honours approved of the observation that arithmetical quantification of the mitigating effect of a single feature of the case was wrong and of course in that matter there was complaint that personal circumstances of the prisoner had not been taken into account properly given the reliance upon the comparative case.
	
	
	In summarising and dealing with some of the aspects of the Crown submissions insofar as they might be at odds with the defence submissions, I have obviously taken into account the helpful written submissions of the prisoner and the oral submissions that were made on his behalf.
	
	
	I accept the prisoner has excellent prospects of rehabilitation and I accept that he is unlikely to reoffend. I further accept that he has demonstrated true remorse, this is demonstrated not just by his cooperation for which he receives a discrete discount but also by the observations of the chaplain and his concern about family and friends back home in the United States as a result of his wrongdoing. I believe he has insight into the circumstances of his offending.
	
	
	I have taken into account the submissions made in relation to the issue of the fixing of the minimum terms, particularly in the context of the decision of the High Court in Hili v R; Jones v R.
	
	
	Ultimately, all things taken into account, I concluded that the starting point of the appropriate sentence in this matter should be six years and six months. I concluded that the prisoner, as I said earlier, should have a combined discount of 37.5%. That left the sentence to be fixed taking into account the matters brought to my attention and also referred to by me of four years with a non-parole period of two years. The prisoner has been in custody since 21 March 2014.
	
	
	I am sorry to take so long. Mr Albanese, could you stand up, thanks very much. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty and for which you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years to commence on 21 March 2014 and shall expire on 20 March 2018.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence of imprisonment I fix, as I am required to under Commonwealth law, a non-parole period which will commence on the same date that your head sentences commences.
	
	
	The non-parole period will expire on 20 March 2016.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole on that date. That will be a matter for the New South Wales Parole Authority in consultation with the Commonwealth authorities. The likelihood is of course when you are released to parole you will be taken into Immigration Department custody and deported very shortly thereafter. You can take a seat. The sentence means that you will be required to spend a minimum of two years in custody in Australia.
	
	
	Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes. Thank you. Now Madam Crown, is there anything else from you?
	
	
	TANDA: No, your Honour. No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Watson, anything else from you?
	
	
	WATSON: No, your Honour, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. There’s nothing else that I need to explain to the prisoner about the sentence imposed upon him?
	
	
	TANDA: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you, you are excused. Do you want to speak to your client because he will go straight--
	
	
	WATSON: Yes, please.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Feel free to have a quick chat to him, I know the officers want to get away. There is no other offences or anything to be taken into account on a schedule or wasn’t drawn to my attention?
	
	
	TANDA: No, your Honour, just the one charge on the indictment.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes.
	
	
	The fixing of the non-parole period is of course subject to the relevant provision of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that is s 19AL, is it not, of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.
	
	
	TANDA: Your Honour, I will just double-check. Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes. Thank you. That is in the orders I have made and I sign. Yes, thank you, Mr Albanese, I wish you well for the future. I trust you won’t regard Australia adversely by what has happened to you but at the end of the day you’ve ended up being the author of your own misfortune and it’s probably the case if you travel into Los Angeles International Airport involved in the same type of criminality you might have expected a sentence that was somewhat greater than that. Certainly, if you had gone to Bali or Thailand you would well know the consequences in those countries of this type of conduct whatever your role. You are excused, thanks very much.
	
	
	I will adjourn the Court and I thank the Corrective officers very much and I thank the Court staff for staying back.

2765841,R v A (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 76,"Judgment


	
	The accused has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of her infant son. Senior Counsel for the accused has raised objection to a number of discreet pieces of evidence upon which the Crown wishes to rely.
	


THE CROWN CASE


	
	In order to place the issues which are raised on the present application in their appropriate context, it is necessary to set out the terms of the Crown case statement filed in the proceedings. In doing so, I should note that this document was prepared at a time when the Crown had indicted the accused on a charge of murder. The accused has now been indicted on a charge of manslaughter. The Crown case, as opened to the jury, is based upon an allegation of gross criminal negligence, based upon a failure by the accused to provide appropriate medical assistance to her son in circumstances where he was obviously ill. In setting out the Crown case statement the names of any person(s) whose identity might lead to the identity of the deceased have been anonymised, and references to addresses have been deleted.
	


1. The deceased was born on 28 December 2009. He was the child of the accused, born 20 May 1981, and (KI), born 15 October 1966.

2. From June 2012 the deceased resided at xxx with the accused, the accused’s de facto partner (K) and two of the accused’s children (JE) aged 4 and (JA) aged 9 and K’s son (E).

Medical Intervention

3. At 4.20pm on 3 August 2012 K called ‘000’ and asked for an ambulance to attend xxx. He told the ambulance officer that the deceased had been sick for a couple of days, that he had been asleep for a couple of hours, that they had just checked on him and he was really limp and that he could feel a slight heartbeat. K performed CPR on the deceased, under the direction of the ‘000’ operator.

4. Paramedic John Bevan was the first ambulance officer to arrive at the address at 4.27 pm. The accused was in the front yard; she appeared distressed and was speaking on a phone. She directed Paramedic Bevan into the house and said that the step dad was with the deceased. Paramedic Bevan walked through the lounge room, where he observed E watching television. Paramedic Bevan was called into a bedroom by K, who was kneeling over the deceased performing CPR. Paramedic Bevan asked K to continue whilst he set up his equipment.

5. Paramedic Bevan observed that the deceased was blue in colour and had a number of atypical bruises, including to the left jaw and the lower left abdominal area, and had no cardiac rhythm. K told him that the child had been asleep for a few hours and that his mother had checked on him about an hour ago. Paramedic Bevan commenced CPR on the deceased. Paramedic Sean Cooke arrived and intubated the deceased. Paramedics Corey Hammer and Greg Matheson assisted. A number of doses of Adrenalin and Atropine were administered to the deceased. Paramedics Darren Plumb and Robert Kembrey arrived to assist.

6. Once the deceased was stabilised sufficiently to be moved he was taken to Wollongong Hospital.

7. During the time ambulance personnel were in the house working on the deceased the accused did not come into the bedroom, and neither the accused nor K asked about the condition of the deceased.

8. Police arrived at the scene shortly after ambulance personnel. The Accused was more interested in what police were doing than the deceased. The accused said, “I will have to answer to his father about this, you watch”.

9. The deceased arrived at Wollongong Hospital at 5.14pm; he was in cardiac arrest and paramedics were performing CPR. Dr Simon Binks led the resuscitation team who continued standard advanced life support on the deceased. The deceased remained unresponsive and resuscitation was ceased at 5.49pm. Dr Binks noticed multiple small bruises on the deceased’s lower back and a 4x2cm bruise on his abdomen.

10. Dr Susan Piper was allocated the role of speaking to the deceased’s family. Resuscitation had been continuing at the hospital for about 10 minutes and the family had not arrived in the resuscitation room. Dr Piper went to look for the family and was told by ambulance officers that the family had wanted to have a smoke before coming into the Emergency Department. Dr Piper spoke with the family and tried to bring them into the resuscitation room, however the Accused and K were reluctant to come in.

11. Dr Piper spoke with the accused who told her that the deceased had been unwell for a few days, but had seemed better that morning. The accused said that she had put the deceased down for a sleep about 12.30pm that day and had checked on him about an hour before the ambulance was called. The accused said that she checked on the deceased again about 4.20pm and he wasn’t breathing. She called out to K who was in the back yard, K came inside and an ambulance was called.

12. Dr Piper spoke with K who told her that he tried to resuscitate the deceased; K was crying as he spoke of this.

13. The accused, KI, and K were taken to the resuscitation room where they stayed for 5 minutes. After this occurred Dr Piper spoke to the accused about the deceased’s medical history. Dr Piper found the accused vague and it was difficult to get precise timings about the current illness.

Medical findings

14. A post mortem examination was conducted by Dr J Duflou, between the 4 - 15 August 2012. During the examination the following injuries were identified;

a. Multiple bruises to the surface of the body.

b. Blunt force head injury with;

i. Multifocal cerebral subdural haemorrhages.

ii. Multifocal subarachnoid haemorrhage, up to several days old.

iii. Recent thrombosis.

iv. Contusions.

v. Multifocal cortical ischemia of differing ages.

vi. Isolated axonal spheroids, corpus callosum.

vii. Moderate cerebral swelling.

viii. Spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage

ix. Bilateral recent optic nerve sheath haemorrhage.

x. Sparse recent bilateral superficial retinal haemorrhages

c. Multiple skeletal injuries;

i. Fractured ribs 5, 6, &7 on the left laterally.

ii. Fractured left clavicle.

iii. Fractured right scapula.

iv. Bilateral distal radius fractures

v. Periosteal reaction of upper extremity long bones.

d. Abdominal blunt force injury;

i. Peritonitis with 300ml turbid fluid in peritoneal cavity.

ii. Retroperitoneal blunt force injury.

iii. Transmural jejunal injury.

e. Early pneumonia

f. Prolonged ‘stress response’.

g. The victim was described as small for his age and the cause of death was opined to be “multiple injuries”.

h. The proximate cause of death was bilateral subdural haematomas. The right dural convex haematoma was up to several days old.

15. Dr Kristina Prelog examined x-rays of the deceased. The fractures can be dated as follows:

a. Right humerous-2 weeks

b. Right radius and right scapula-2-3 weeks

c. Clavicle and left radius-more than 3 weeks

d. Distal left ulna-more than 6 weeks

16. Dr Hugh Martin examined Post Mortem Photographs and specimens and formed a view that the peritonitis was caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen in the days before death. This is supported by photographs showing bruises to the abdominal wall and the presence of plaque on the wall of the bowel.

17. Dr Paul Taite reviewed the material, in particular a photograph taken of the deceased’s abdomen on 29 June 2012 and was of the opinion that the bruise was suggestive of a punch with a closed fist. In addition he viewed autopsy photographs of the abdominal bruise and found them consistent with blunt force, possibly a kick. Bruising to the lumbrosacral area on the deceased’s back was consistent with a punch with a closed fist.

18. Dr Taite noted that there had been significant head trauma on at least two occasions, the most recent probably within 24 hours of death.

The days leading up to the offence

19. On 24 July 2012 the accused had an argument with K. During this argument she took the deceased and JE from xxx to KI’s house at xxx. She left the children with KI and returned to xxx where she continued to argue with K. This argument culminated with her stabbing herself in the abdomen and being admitted to Wollongong Hospital for surgery.

20. The accused was in Wollongong Hospital from Tuesday 24 July to Monday 30 July 2012. The deceased was in the care of KI from Tuesday 24 July to Sunday 29 July 2012. On Friday 27 July 2012 the deceased attended (day care) where he was reported to be well.

21. On Saturday 28 July 2012 a witness saw the deceased with KI at 1/8 Henrietta Street, Towradgi. The deceased was clean and happy and running around playing. He had a small bite mark on his cheek.

22. K collected the victim from KI about 4.00pm on Sunday 29 July. K said that the deceased was a bit ‘sniffly’ but otherwise well, and had a small bruise on his chin. He did not notice other bruises while bathing the deceased.

23. On Monday 30 July 2012 K took the deceased with him to collect the accused from hospital. CCTV footage shows the deceased to be walking, and (K’s mother) says the deceased was walking around and eating well. DT, the mother of the accused, spoke to the accused on the phone and the accused told her that the deceased was well and eating food.

24. On Tuesday 31 July 2012 JT went to the accused’s house. She saw the deceased, he looked alright and was walking and leaning on the lounge.

25. The deceased’s condition began to deteriorate on Wednesday 1 August 2012. K looked after the deceased for two hours whilst the accused went shopping. The accused says that the deceased was fine when she returned home.

26. Between lunch time and mid-afternoon JT visited the accused at xxx; the accused did not know that she was coming. The deceased was crying and unhappy, his eyes were red and puffy and he looked weak and lethargic; there was a bruise on his forehead.

27. Later that evening the deceased vomited after eating dinner; this is the last time he consumed food. The accused told police that she thought the deceased had a ‘tummy bug’; he was bathed and put to bed, and was ‘whingey’ and unsettled during the night.

28. The accused had a doctor’s appointment at 9.40am the following day. That evening she sent a text message to RC asking if she could mind the children; RC replied that she could not because she was sick.

29. On Thursday 2 August 2012 the deceased woke with a dirty nappy. He had diarrhoea that smelt strongly like ammonia and was tired and lethargic.

30. K urged the accused to take the deceased with her to the doctor’s. Instead, the deceased and JE were taken to KI’s house at xxx. KI saw that the victim was pale, had blue lips, was shivering and shaking, and was very lethargic.

31. At 9.40am the accused attended Dr Bernard Lee’s surgery for her appointment. She told Dr Lee that the deceased was sick but she didn’t want to wake him, and made an appointment for the deceased for the following Monday.

32. At 12.30pm the accused and K went to xxx to collect the deceased. KI told the accused that the deceased was ill and that unless they took him to the doctor’s he would. The accused said she would look after it. The accused and K took the deceased and JE for KFC at the beach and went home. The deceased refused lunch however had a drink.

33. (The accused’s father) visited the accused around lunchtime. The deceased, accused and K were sitting at the front of the house. He did not see any marks on the deceased who looked tired and lethargic.

34. The accused put the victim to bed at 7.30pm; he still had diarrhoea

35. On Friday 3 August 2012 the accused drove E to school and JA to KI’s house; KI was to take JA to day care. The accused told KI that the deceased was too ill to attend day care.

36. The deceased woke at about 9.40am; he still had strong smelling diarrhoea. The accused arrived home and gave him some toast which he did not eat. The accused and K played computer games whilst the deceased sat on the lounge watching television until about 12.30pm. The deceased was put in his cot about 12.30pm.

37. JT visited the accused at about 11.30am on Friday 3 August. She saw the accused bent over in the kitchen, then carrying the deceased down the hallway; he was crying. The accused returned, she told JT that the deceased had a stomach bug. JT offered to get some hydrolite however the accused declined. The accused did not look herself at this time.

38. About 1.40pm the accused left the deceased, asleep in his cot, in the care of K whilst she ran errands. She returned to the house briefly before leaving again to collect E from school. She is unsure when she checked on the deceased, and did not “have a real good check of him.”

39. The accused checked on the deceased at 4.20pm and found him grey and unresponsive. She called out to K who came into the house, called an ambulance, and commenced cardio pulmonary resuscitation on the deceased with telephone assistance from the “000” operator.

History of prior injuries

(a) swollen right foot and 1x3cm scabbed healing abrasion on right upper abdomen 8 June 2012

40. On 7 June 2012 K took the deceased to see Dr Banijamili because of a swollen right foot; this had been present for one month. The deceased then saw Dr Goodhew on 8 June 2012 and was referred to the Emergency Department for an xray. Dr Binks saw the deceased in emergency; his right foot was moderately bruised and swollen and was diagnosed as a soft tissue injury. Additionally there was a 1x3cm scabbed healing abrasion on the deceased’s right upper abdomen. Dr Binks reported the injuries to DoCS.

(b) Injuries noted by staff at (day care) from 29 June 2012

41. The deceased attended (day care) on Fridays from 2 March to 27 July 2012.

42. (On 27 June 2012 KB saw the deceased at her son’s birthday party. She picked the deceased up, with her hands under his arms. The deceased screamed. KB moved the deceased to her hip and he continued to scream. The deceased was pale and had very dark circles under his eyes.)

43. On 29 June staff saw bruising on the deceased’s left abdomen, back, buttocks, forehead and hip. A report was made to DoCS.

44. On 6 July staff saw a large bruise on the deceased’s abdomen. A report was made to DoCS. On the same day staff spoke with KI and a further report was made to DoCS.

45. On 13 July staff discussed the bruises with the accused.

46. There were no further bruises noted on 20 or 27 July. The deceased appeared well and happy on 27 July.

47. On 3 July the centre were informed that the deceased would not attend due to illness.

Lies about the deceased’s health

48. DT, the accused’s mother, spoke with the accused up to three times each day between 30 July and 3 August 2012; the accused did not mention that the deceased was sick.

49. AB, the accused’s cousin, spoke with the accused about five times in the week before the deceased died. The accused did not tell her that the deceased was unwell.

50. On 2 August 2012 the accused had an appointment with Dr Bernard Lee. She told Dr Lee that she was intending to bring the deceased to the appointment however he was asleep at home and she decided not to wake him. The previous night the accused had tried to arrange for RC to mind the deceased, and that morning the accused had dropped the deceased with KI.

51. On 3 August 2012 the accused told JT that she would buy hydrolyte and glucose for the deceased. Despite attending shops after that conversation the accused did not do this.

Hiding of the deceased’s injuries

52. The deceased developed a noticeable limp in the weeks prior to 8 June 2012. JC noticed the injury and told K to take the deceased to the doctors. He was taken by K and the accused for medical treatment.

53. The accused did not seek medical treatment for the deceased after being informed by the day care centre that he had multiple bruises.

54. The accused did not seek medical treatment for the deceased for multiple fractures incurred on at least two occasions. The deceased did not have fractures in his lower limbs.

55. On Wednesday 1 August the accused, K and JE were walking in xxx; the accused was pushing (the deceased) in a pram. K stopped to speak with RH; the accused did not stop to talk but kept walking up the street

56. The accused tried to organise for RC to mind the deceased rather than leaving him with KI or taking him to see Dr Lee. The accused failed to take the deceased to see Dr Lee, or any doctor, despite being urged to do so by KI.

57. In her record of interview on 8 August 2012 the accused told police that she did not take the deceased to KI’s house on Friday 3 August because she was sick of the deceased coming home with bruises. In her record of interview in 20 August 2012 the accused told police that she did not take the deceased to day care on Friday 3 August 2012 because he wasn’t well enough. However she said that he had improved on that day and talked and danced. However, she did leave the deceased with KI the previous day. A strong inference to be drawn is that the deceased suffered further injuries after being collected from KI on 2 August and the accused was hiding those injuries.

58. The deceased was visibly unwell and upset when seen by JT on the morning of 3 August 2012. Rather than comforting the deceased the accused quickly took him to his bedroom and put him in his cot.

Evidence that the deceased was an unwanted child

59. When ambulance personnel attended xxx on 3 August 2012 the accused was more interested in what police were doing than the deceased. Police and ambulance personnel noted her behaviour as odd. Hospital staff found it unusual that the accused was not interested in the resuscitation attempts on the deceased.

60. The accused referred to the deceased as a haemorrhoid.

61. KB, sister in law of the accused, heard the accused say that she wanted JA and JE; she never heard the accused say that she wanted the deceased.

After others had assisted the deceased the accused took him and tried to put him to sleep.

73. KA noticed that the accused did not look after the deceased or show much interest in him. She saw the deceased fall down a flight of stairs.

THE EVIDENCE

Evidence of neglect of the deceased


	
	The first area of evidence relevant to the present application is contained in those parts of the statements set out below.
	


SM


	
	In statement dated 14 August 2012, SM said the following:
	


“7. In my opinion I would say that the children were neglected by both (the accused) and KI. The kids were very unclean and always hungry. KI would often say to me that there was no food in the house. I recall at the time he said this to me he had a beer in his hand. I also remember (the accused) having two dogs and a rabbit in the lounge room of her house, There were faeces from these animals in the lounge room and you could smell the stench come from the house. You didn't even need to go inside to smell the odour. At one time the Department of Housing Contractors attended their home and refused to carry out any work due to the state of their living conditions. One of the contractors actually vomited when he walked from their house.

8. I have complained to the Department of Housing about the conditions of (the accused)'s home. I made many calls to them about the house and the poor condition of the premises. There was never anything done about it. I made numerous reports to the Department of Community Services relating (the accused)'s children. I reported to them about the conditions of the house and the neglect of the children and the pets (the accused) and I had at the house.

9. KI and (the accused) split when (the accused) began having a relationship with K. K lived down the road with his Mother and his son, E in xxx. I often spoke with his mother and delivered groceries to their home. KI didn't have much to do with K. When (the accused) began the relationship with K she kicked KI and JA out of the house. This was about in November last year. At this time (the accused)'s neglect of her children became even more severe. It got to a stage where she would leave (the deceased) at home alone. JE would roam the streets. As a result of this I telephoned (the accused's mum) about (the accused) leaving (the deceased) home alone and about her dog that continually barked because it was starving. I told her that (the accused) was leaving (the deceased) at home alone while she was down visiting K. By this time W and Y had gone to live with D in Queensland and JA was living with KI. (The accused) had custody of JE and (the deceased). I recall that one report I made to the Department of Housing in December, 2011. One of the Welfare Workers attended my home and interviewed me about (the accused) and what was going on in her house and with the children. I gave her the information that I believed that the children, animals and the house were being severely neglected. I have also made a report to the Police about (the accused)'s dog being locked in the house for about three weeks without food or water. The Police came to the house and informed the RSPCA of the neglected animal. They could see that it was locked in the house and it appeared to have a broken leg. The Police didn't break into the house and the RSPCA were supposed to attend the house. They didn't turn up and at some stage (the accused)'s brother came and took the dog.

…

11. I also recall one evening before Christmas, JA was staying at (the accused's) house. (The accused) was at K's house and J was staying at her house. About 10-30pm my daughter, Stacey telephoned me and told me that she was on her way home. I waited on the front verandah of my house. When the cab pulled up I saw what appeared to be a person lying under a blanket on the concrete slab next to (the accused)'s house. J came walking from across the road towards (the accused)'s house and as he walked past the blanket he pushed it and then I saw JA pop up from under the blanket. I heard J say to JA, ""What are you doing here you are supposed to be down at your mothers."" He said, ""I went down bashing on the door and mum won't let me in."" J said, ""Come on mate come in here."" J and JA walked past me and J said, ""This is ridiculous, he's supposed to be staying at his mothers house."" I reported this to the Department of Housing as DOCs hadn't really done anything about my previous reports.

12. I also recall another incident that occurred on the stairs opposite my townhouse. It was during the day when I was upstairs and looked out the window into the cul-de-sac. It was this year sometime before the accused moved to xxx with K. I saw a few of my neighbours gathered in the street on the concrete slab next door to (the accused)'s house. I saw (the deceased) walking towards L’s house. Her place is located next door to W's house. There are steps which lead down to her house. There are about 10 stairs and it is quite steep. (The deceased) walked to the top of the steps and I saw him fall from the top of the stairs to the bottom. L and W ran over to him and picked him up. I saw he was screaming. They took him over to (the accused) and asked for her to take him to get checked out. (the accused) said, ""No, I'll take him home to bed, he will be fine."" I believe that other people who witnessed this fall reported it to DOC's.

…

14. (The accused's) personality and demeanour changed when she started her relationship with K. Although the children were neglected when she was with KI her treatment and responsibility to the children decreased remarkably when she began seeing K. I recall that (the accused) was so happy to have a daughter and that JE went everywhere with her. She was her pride and joy. It was the same with the accused's dog. When K came into her life it was if (the accused) just didn't care about JE, (the deceased) or the dog. it was if they all never mattered anymore and that (the accused)'s entire focus was just on K.”

KB


	
	In a statement dated 13 August 2012 KB said the following:
	


6. I've known (the accused) for about twelve months. I met (the accused) through a neighbour named W. W lives directly across from where (the accused) used to live. I don't know W's surname. At first I wasn't aware of the way (the accused) is. But after I got to know her and going into her home and visualising her as a mother, I thought yuck. Her house was pretty dirty. Not fit to bring children up in.

…

9. JE and (the deceased) were her two children that I had concerns for. I was concerned because I think (the accused) was neglecting them.

…

11. I used to see (the deceased) walking around in a nappy and a singlet. Sometimes, the nappy was down to his knees. He hadn't been changed from the night before. JE looked like she hadn't had her hair brushed. She didn't look like she had been washed, or had her teeth brushed. JE wore the same clothes that she had worn the day before.

…

21. This was when I started noticing the children being more neglected than usual. A couple of times I had to go over to watch (the deceased) and JE. (The accused) was with K and KI had to go somewhere.

22. I noticed (the accused) was more neglectful with the kids because she was with K. (the accused) was more interested in K than the kids. She was always looking for someone to palm the kids off to. That was the way it was for a while. At a time when (the accused) might as well have been living with K, KI got his own place. (The accused) was letting KI have JE and (the deceased).”

LA


	
	In a statement dated 10 August 2012 LA said the following:
	


“7. It seemed to me that (the accused) was a very lazy person. Most of the time she would sit out and drink coffee with the neighbours all day and not doing anything around the house and did very little to care for the children. When she was with KI he would do most of the stuff around the house and look after the children. If one of the children was doing something or if (the accused) needed something she was always ""KI do this"" or ""KI do that"".

…

10. (The accused) did not care for her children very well. In winter the kids would be running around with hardly any clothes on. Often the kids would be in the same dirty"" clothes for days on end. (the deceased) always had a runny nose, I never saw him without a runny nose. Quite a number of times I saw (the deceased) in a dirty drooping wet nappy that he had been in all night and day. About 12 months ago, possible around August 2011, I remember (the accused) and KI having an argument about who was going to change (the deceased)'s nappy. He had been in a saggy nappy, totally drenched, all day and neither of them would change the nappy. In the end W … piped up and said ""Stop arguing and someone just change it"". I think it was KI that ended up going and changing the nappy. In the two years that I lived there, I never saw them come home with a load of groceries.

…

12. Quite often the children would roam around the streets, unattended and unsupervised for hours, at all hours of the day and night. The children, including JA and JE, would be running around the streets and playing on the road unsupervised. Since (the accused) started a relationship with K, it got worse. (the accused) would spend most of her time at K's house. I would see her coming and going from her house just to get changed and then she would be off again.

…

17. More recently, (the accused) and I have not so much had a falling out but I have just been fed up with the way she looks after her children and I just don't want anything to do with her. When (the accused) gave up the custody of her two eldest boys last year I was just disgusted. She gave them up all because of her relationship with K and I just thought that was so wrong so basically I just stopped talking to her. Since she got together with K, (the accused) cared less for her children and they became more and more neglected. She didn't seem to care anymore where they were or what they did. Her personality changed once she got with K. Even with JE who (the accused) used to treat as her little princess because she was the only girl, she just didn't care about her anymore once K came along.”

ST


	
	In a statement dated 21 August 2012 ST said the following:
	


“ 5. I recall that (the accused)'s kids were always dirty and unclean, especially (the deceased). He was always walking around with a dirty nappy. I would sometimes change his nappy. They were never really dressed appropriately for the seasons. He had bites from the fleas and mosquitoes over his body. A couple of times I had seen bruises over (the deceased)'s body. He would sometimes have them on his legs and arms. (the accused) would always say that he had fallen over. I remember seeing that he had an infected finger a couple of months ago before they moved to ... I recall it may have been his left index finger. I recall (the accused) said to me that he had slammed it in the door. I looked really bad and sore. I told (the accused) that she should take him to the Doctors about it. She never did as far I know. I never saw (the accused) hit the kids or discipline them. They were basically neglected by not living in a clean and tidy home.”

CS


	
	In a statement dated 21 August 2012 CS said the following:
	


“7. The condition of (the accused)'s house was reported to the Corrimal Office of the Department of Housing several times by me and other residents. I did make one report to Kerry Cooper-Smith at the Corrimal Office and informed her that t (the accused)'s house was being kept in an extremely poor state. I recall it was last year sometime. I also told her that the children were being neglected as I had heard from other neighbours that the children had gone to them to get food. When I saw the children they were always dirty and unclean. I don't believe that anything was done by the Department of Housing relating to my report as nothing changed at (the accused)'s house.

…

9. I have made two reports to the Department of Community Services, last year. My report was about the condition of the house and the way the children were being looked after. I was worried that they were being neglected and not looked after properly by (the accused) and KI.”

KB


	
	In statement dated 6 September 2012 KB said the following:
	


“35. I still hadn't met K. To me he was just another of (the accused)'s guys to neglect the kids over. This is how it seemed to me. It was a repeat of her relationship with KI. When she met KI, she ran off with him, her main concern was him, not the boys. This is how I ended up with WT and YT.

…

39. At the Christmas party, (the deceased) constantly wanted his mum. (the deceased) was crying for his mum. He just wanted his mum. I tried to pick him up to pacify him but it wouldn't last long, and he wanted his mum again. My mum tired, Debbie tried, but all he wanted was his mum. (the accused) just kept walking away from him, saying that she had had enough. She made it out like it was so hard. All (the deceased) wanted was to be picked up. (the deceased) was crying hysterically. He wanted his mum or nothing else. I was really shocked that (the accused) didn't grab him. I would have thought she would have wanted to pick him up. To me, it was like she couldn't be bothered. She was lazy.

…

43. I'd see (the deceased) walking around the centre going from one parent to another with his arms up crying and whinging. I could tell he wasn't happy. Both parents would ignore (the deceased), so he would walk back to the other parent. Both parents continued to ignore (the deceased). Eventually I said to KI, ""(the deceased) is there. He wants you. He sounds like he is a real daddy's boy hey."" (the deceased) was standing at KI’s feet. KI picked (the deceased) up and held him for a little while. (the deceased) was still whinging when I picked him up. I seen (the deceased) walking around again. This time he was happy.

…

55. I now have custody of JA and JE. I have asked JA why he didn't go and visit his mum. JA said, ""I don't go there, mum is mean to me.

56. When JA, JE and (the deceased) were living with (the accused) and I they were always dirty. They never wore new clothes; they were always wearing clothes with holes in them. JE's hair didn't ever look like it had been brushed. The clothing they wore didn't even fit them. When JE came to me her hair was full of nits. I've had to treat her hair three times since she came to me. I had to cut JA's hair to remove the nits.”

AMB


	
	In a statement dated 31 August 2012 AMB said the following:
	


“25. Their children were poorly looked after. They would eat, but I wouldn't consider the types of food they were eating as being nutritious or healthy. They would be unbathed, and getting around in unclean clothes. JA was allowed to do whatever he wanted and generally they exercised no supervision of their children. I distinctly recall on one occasion, JE came to our house. I remember, I found JE knocking on our front window. She was 2 to 3 years of age. I saw her dressed in a nightie with Disney princess print on it, and a nappy, and the clothes seemed appropriate for the weather conditions, but it didn't seem appropriate for the time of the day. She had no shoes on and her hair was very messy. It was about 11 'ish in the day. I thought that it was odd, because to get to our house, JE would have had to cross a road, which is quite dangerous because it has a blind spot. I remember Aaron asked JE, ""Where's your mum?"". I recall I her saying ""Aunty Anne"". I approached her and said, ""Where's mummy?"" She said, ""At home.""

26. We kept JE at our house for about an hour to see how long it would take for (the accused) and KI to realise that JE was missing. I don't think that (the accused) or I even knew she was gone. Aaron and I took JE home and I explained to her that JE had walked herself to our house. I expressed some concern at the fact that JE had been wondering the street, but over all they didn't even know that she was missing, which is what really troubled me.

29. Following the birth of my children, I suffered from Post Natal Depression. I saw how (the accused) interacted with (the deceased) and I strongly feel that (the accused) suffered from post natal depression. There was minimal nurturing, he wasn't been properly cared for. He would be dressed in the same clothes for a few days. He wasn't bathed that often, on occasions I would take him to my place and bath him. (The accused) never seemed to nurse (the deceased).

30. (The accused) seemed to spend a lot of time with her neighbours and (the deceased) would be left unattended in a bouncer or inside the house. She would often bring (the deceased) out in a camper, whilst she would talk to the neighbours, paying no attention to (the deceased). Otherwise most of the time, (the deceased) would be left inside the house.”

JT


	
	In a statement of 29 August 2014 JT said the following:
	


“19. I saw KI hand (the deceased) to (the accused). (The deceased) was smiling at me because I was being silly towards him and my son. I offered to make (the deceased) a bottle. I was rolling a smoke and (the accused) had asked KI to make it. I sat my son in his pram with his toys. (The accused) agreed. I asked (the accused) how (the deceased) took his bottle. I can't remember what (the accused) told me. I walked back in to the house and went to the kitchen. I remember I was disgusted with the fact that I couldn't put a bottle together for (the deceased). I couldn't get the right teat, cap or bottle together because it was so messy. (The deceased) had no clean bottles. I yelled out to (the accused), ""Does this boy have any clean bottles or what?"" (The accused) then came in. She had (the deceased) on her hip, with (the deceased) facing outwards. (The accused) then showed me what teat went with what bottle. I then washed the bottle as best I could with a bottle brush. I made the bottle. KI this time, (the accused) had put (the deceased) down on the lounge inside.”

JA


	
	In a statement dated 17 August 2012 JA stated the following:
	


“8. Initially the accused…JA…and JE and baby (the deceased) lived together at the address. I didn't start to stay with them until 2009, and I was only there on and off. Whilst I was staying with my sister and her family, I would say that the house was rarely maintained or cleaned regularly and the overall presentation was dirty and unkempt. (the accused) had rabbits and dogs living inside the house with them and the animals had free reign of the entire house. The laundry floor would always be full of clothes, I could never see the floor. There was always food scraps and grot (combination of dust, dog hair and mould) all over floor and walls in particular the skirting boards. (I am still trying today to clean this grot etc from the walls to an acceptable standard, and (the accused) has not lived there for 8 months)

9. All the children were dirty and unkempt and I don't think that (the accused) would get them to have regular showers. (I had regularly commented to (the accused) ""Do you ever give the kids a shower) The babies would walk around with full wet nappies and they were not changed on a regular basis. (There were times while I was there that I would find a clean pair of pants for JE or nappies for (the deceased) because they were still walking around in their night time nappy or pants which were full of urine).

10. The little children used to permanently smell unclean and had a smell of urine and dog which clung to them. (the accused) would not care about they're appearance and JE never ever had her hair brushed or done. She was never dressed like a little girl and (the deceased) was rarely dressed in anything but a shirt and soggy nappy regardless of the weather or time of day.

…

13. On one occasion, I remember turning up at the house with my mother and found WT was left babysitting all the younger kids. I asked him at the time, where his mum and KI were and he told us they had gone to the Pub. This was about 6.30pm at night. My mother got straight onto the phone at the time and called (the accused) to yell at her about it. WT was only 13-14 at the time.

14. I would describe JE and (the deceased) as undernourished and underdeveloped children. They were both small for their age and (the deceased) was only just starting to walk recently and he did not know how to talk yet. I could pick up JE and (the deceased) in one arm because they were light weights. (If I try to pick up my own sons, who are the same age, they are noticeably a lot heavier). (The deceased) practically lived in his cot. (The accused) would use his cot as a prison, so she didn't have deal with him. He spent so much time in there that I think that impacted on his ability to learn to walk. He used to cry and cry and (the accused) would not do anything about it, WT or I would usually be the ones to feel sorry for him and get him out, even though he wasn't our responsibility. I couldn't help feeling sorry for the kids, because (the accused) was not interested in them. I would say things to her about her lack mothering skills and she used to just laugh at me or look at me with a stupid grin on her face. Even at night, when I was staying at the house, JE or (the deceased) would wake up crying and (the accused) and KI would just leave then cry for long periods of time, until I went and got them and sent them into their parent's room to sleep. (These occasions were only as recent as 6 -8 months ago)

…

20. During the first few weeks of this year, (the accused) would put the kids to bed upstairs between 7.30-9pm. She would then say to me, ""I'm going down to K's, the kids are in bed"". She would then leave and stay at K's the entire night. Most of the time, the kids would cry out as soon as she left or JE would come downstairs and I would get them up and look after them with YT. Many times, (the accused) would never even come home from K's the following morning. I would have to get the little kids out of bed and take them down to her at K's so she would feed them and look after them.

…

26. I do not know how (the deceased) died, or who is responsible for his death but I do know that for a long time, my sister (the accused) has not been invested in spending anytime looking after her own kids or making sure they are well cared for. They have really been neglected. She has been palming them off to whoever would take them off her hands. I hope (the deceased) hasn't died because they didn't want him, or so she can be with K and not have any responsibilities. I would like to know why he was killed, he was only a little boy and he was such a good little kid. He just used to sit with you or be near you and smile. He was not very hard to look after at all. He just wanted to be around people.”

The nature of the evidence


	
	Before considering the submissions of the parties it is appropriate to make some general observations about the evidence.
	
	
	Firstly it will be apparent even from a brief perusal of the passages identified by the Crown and set out above, that many parts of the evidence are plainly inadmissible as to form. Other parts of the evidence fall outside the purposes for which the Crown relies upon it, namely to establish:
	



	
	the accused’s general neglect of the deceased;
	
	
	the general conditions under which the deceased lived;
	
	
	the general lack of care of the deceased by the accused; and
	
	
	the deterioration in that level of care after the accused commenced a relationship with K.
	



	
	Secondly, the Crown has anticipated that it will be put on behalf of the accused that she was, for want of a better description, a “good mother” who was appropriately attentive to the deceased’s needs, both medical and otherwise. The evidence is relied upon by the Crown as context evidence to meet such an argument and, in particular, to meet the proposition that the circumstances leading up to the deceased’s death were somehow isolated. Senior counsel for the accused did not take issue with the proposition that an argument of the kind which is anticipated by the Crown will, in fact, be made to the jury. On the contrary, senior counsel indicated that evidence will be placed before the jury which, if accepted, will establish that over a defined period the accused took the deceased to a medical practitioner for medical treatment on more than 30 occasions. The obvious purpose of such evidence is to provide the basis of a submission that the accused was, generally speaking, a responsible, as opposed to a neglectful, parent.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence in question was properly admissible as “context evidence”. Bearing in mind what the Crown has correctly anticipated will be put on behalf of the accused, it was submitted that the evidence was highly probative of the condition in which the deceased lived his life.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused accepted that evidence of the circumstances in which the deceased lived, specifically photographs depicting the state of his home, had been admitted without objection and were therefore already before the jury. In these circumstances, senior counsel appeared to accept that the additional evidence now sought to be adduced by the Crown met the test of relevance set out in s. 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”). However, he submitted that such evidence was highly prejudicial and should be excluded.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed) made the following observations (at [72]) in relation to evidence of the kind now pressed by the Crown. Although his Honour’s observations were made in the context of a case involving allegations of sexual assault, they are nevertheless apposite to a consideration of the present issue:
	


“The admission of evidence of a sexual relationship between a complainant and an accused other than evidence of the particular acts charged has caused difficulties in many cases. The origin of those problems lies in the difficulty which is sometimes experienced in categorising the purpose for which the evidence is tendered. Is it evidence tendered only for the purpose of throwing light upon the relationship at the time of the events which led to the offence (i.e. relationship evidence) or is it admitted as evidence of the sexual desire or feeling of the accused for the complainant (i.e. tendency evidence)? It is necessary to clearly identify the purpose of the tender so that its admissibility can be properly considered and appropriate directions given.”


	
	His Honour went on to observe (at [80]) that when considering whether to admit evidence which may suggest prior illegal acts by an accused, it is essential to firstly identify the evidence, and the purpose of its tender. His Honour observed that if the evidence is tendered merely to provide context to the charge(s), it is necessary to consider whether any issue has been raised in the trial which makes that evidence relevant. He concluded that if the evidence is admitted, the trial judge must carefully direct the jury, both at the time at which the evidence is tendered and in the summing up, of the confined use that the jury may make of it. In this regard he emphasised the necessity to direct the jury, in clear terms, that the evidence has been admitted to provide background, so that other evidence can be understood and evaluated with a complete understanding of the nature and extent of relevant relationship(s). Finally, his Honour emphasised that the jury must be told that they cannot use the evidence as tendency evidence.
	
	
	His Honour (with the concurrence of Hidden and Fullerton JJ) confirmed these observations in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272 at [28]:
	


“Whatever be the position under the common law, the accepted position in New South Wales is that evidence of “relationship” may be admitted unless excluded after consideration has been given to s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act: Qualtieri; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702; R v Fraser (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 August 1998). However, it will only be admissible if it is relevant because it may assist in the evaluation of other evidence going to a fact in issue. In particular it may provide the “context” in which to understand a narrative in the sense suggested by Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in the passages above. Unless the other evidence in the trial and the issues which it raises make it relevant to prove the “context” in which the alleged offence or offences occurred, it will be almost inevitable that the discretion should be exercised to exclude the evidence. In most cases relevance will be occasioned by an apparent lack of complaint by a complainant whose will has been overborne from a young age or who has feared the consequences of making a complaint about a family member. Fear of not being believed or family breakdown may explain a lack of complaint when a charged act occurs. If the evidence is admitted the dangers of its misuse are significant and the judge’s directions to the jury must be clear so that the jurors understand the limited purpose for which they may consider that evidence.”


	
	Observations to a similar effect were made by Simpson J (with whom Campbell JA and Whealy J agreed) in RG v R [2010] NSWCCA 173 (at [31]-[37]) and again by McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Simpson and Fullerton JJ agreed) in KTR v R [2010] NSWCCA 271 (at [90]).
	
	
	More recently in Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230 Macfarlan JA (with whom Price and McCallum JJ agreed) said (at [26]):
	


“… relationship evidence may be admitted on the basis that, without it, the jury would be faced with a seemingly inexplicable or fanciful isolated incident. To enable complainants to give their account of events comprehensively, they must be permitted to place the incidents of which they complain in a meaningful context.”


	
	Having cited the observations of Barwick CJ and Menzies J in Wilson v R [1970] HCA 17; (1970) CLR 334 at 337 and 344 respectively, his Honour went on to say (at [29]):
	


“On a number of occasions this Court has however emphasised that it is necessary to consider carefully the basis upon which ""relationship"" evidence is relevant in a particular case (see Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 at [112]; DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 at [28] - [30] and RG v R [2010] NSWCCA 173 at [36] - [37]). In RG, for example, the basis of relevance was described as follows:

""The evidence of which complaint is now made, if believed, established a pattern of behaviour in which the complainant was relatively unsurprised by the conduct the subject of the charge, and made no response, nor any subsequent report. In that respect, it explains her behaviour, which may otherwise have appeared surprising and therefore implausible to the jury"" (at [38]).”


	
	Finally, in KJS v R [2014] NSWCCA 27 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Adams and RA Hulme JJ agreed) made the following observation (at [38]) regarding the admission of context evidence:
	


“There is another way of looking at the evidence which strengthens the conclusion that it was properly characterised as context evidence. Were the evidence to have been excluded, the jury would have been left with an unrealistic and entirely misleading picture of two apparently unconnected sexual assaults, separated in time by some three or so years, which occurred in startling isolation. This was in the context of an otherwise ordinary father-daughter relationship about which ISS made no complaint. That would have placed the Crown case in a position of considerable unfairness.”


	
	In the present case the Crown has made it clear that it does not rely upon the evidence as tendency evidence, but as evidence of what is submitted to be the correct context in which the relevant events took place. Bearing in mind that stated purpose, and in accordance with the approach set out in Qualtieri (supra), it is firstly necessary to consider whether any issue has been raised in the trial which makes that evidence relevant.
	
	
	As I have previously observed, the submissions of senior counsel for the accused concentrated upon what was said to be the prejudicial effect of the evidence. Such an approach effectively assumes that the evidence is relevant and I am satisfied that this is so. Further, and as I have previously noted, senior counsel for the accused proposes to place before the jury evidence of the accused having repeatedly taken the deceased to medical practitioners for treatment. The obvious purpose of eliciting that evidence is to provide an evidentiary basis for a submission that the accused was a loving and caring, as opposed to neglectful, mother. The evidence now sought to be tendered by the Crown is clearly relevant in these circumstances. Absent such evidence, the jury could be left with an unrealistic and misleading picture of the relationship between the accused and the deceased (see KJS (supra)).
	
	
	Accepting that the evidence is relevant there is, in my view, no proper basis for its exclusion pursuant to the provisions of s. 137 of the Act. Given the purpose for which it is tendered, there is no danger of it being unfairly prejudicial in the sense described in R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252] per Wood CJ at CL (RS Hulme J and Buddin J agreeing). In particular, and bearing in mind the directions that I will give to the jury both at the time of the admission of the evidence and in the summing up, there is no danger of the jury using the evidence in a way which involves the adoption of an illegitimate form of reasoning, nor is there a danger of the jury giving the evidence undue weight.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I propose to allow the Crown to lead the evidence on the basis outlined. However in reaching that conclusion, two things must be made clear.
	
	
	Firstly, and as I have already observed, much of the evidence is in an inadmissible form. It will obviously be necessary for the Crown to carefully lead the evidence in a form which is properly admissible.
	
	
	Secondly, I make it clear that the evidence that I propose to allow is restricted to evidence of the accused’s treatment of the deceased, and is not to extend to the treatment of any of the accused’s other children of the accused.
	


Evidence of previous alleged assaults upon the deceased


	
	The Crown also seeks to lead evidence of previous assaults said to have been perpetrated by the accused on the deceased. This evidence comes from two sources, the first of which is paragraph 6 of the statement of SM:
	


“There was a lot of yelling and verbal abuse from KI and (the accused) towards the children. (the accused) would also yell abuse at KI. They consistently swore at each. 1 recall (the accused) yelling at JE when JE had gone outside the entrance to their house, ""Get your f'""n self back in here."" Or she would yell at KI, ""Get you f""""n daughter back in here."" I heard her yell at KI, ""Feed the f'""n baby or change the f """"n baby's nappy."" She would yell at the kids if they were crying and yell, ""Shut your f""’n crying."" I never witnessed (the accused) or I hit the children. I did see (the accused) grab (the deceased) by the arm one day when there was a car coming into the complex. (the deceased) was crawling on the road. (the accused) walked over to (the deceased), she had a cigarette in one hand and picked (the deceased) up by the arm and threw him over the front fence of their home. The fence is about three bricks high and (the deceased) landed on the dirt. I remember him whimpering a bit. He then got up and crawled away. It was probably about a metre in distance that (the accused) would have thrown him. I also recall hearing JE screaming for hours of a night. This was constant. I only saw JE with a few bruises on her legs. I just put this down to her being active and running around the complex and playing.”


	
	The second source of the evidence is in paragraph 8 of the statement of CS:
	


“I have never seen (the accused) or KI hit their children. I did see (the accused) grab hold of (the deceased) on one occasion. At this time a car was coming into the complex and (the deceased) was on the driveway and as the car approached, (the accused) walked towards (the deceased) and grabbed him by the arm, picked him up and threw him over their front fence. He fell to the ground. It didn't appear that he was hurt. He got up and walked. I have heard (the accused) swearing at the kids on many occasions.”

Submissions of the parties


	
	The Crown made it clear that the evidence was not relied upon as tendency evidence, but as further evidence of the relationship between the accused and the deceased. The Crown submitted that such displays of violence were probative of the attitude and feelings of the accused towards the deceased. It was submitted that what had occurred between the accused and the deceased at an earlier point in time was relevant to what had occurred at the time of the commission of the alleged offence and that this provided a basis for admissibility.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused submitted that the evidence was not relevant. In this regard, he pointed, in particular, to the fact that the accused was no longer charged with murder, such that it was no longer alleged by the Crown that she had deliberately caused the deceased’s death. In the event that I concluded that the evidence was relevant, senior counsel submitted that it warranted exclusion pursuant to s. 137 of the Act.
	


Consideration and conclusion


	
	In my view, given the way in which the Crown now puts its case, the evidence is not relevant. The Crown case is one of manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. It is no part of the Crown case that the accused engaged in any deliberate act, as a consequence of which the deceased was killed. In these circumstances, the decisions in R v Toki [2000] NSWSC 999; (2000) 116 A Crim R 536 and FDP v R [2008] NSWCCA 317, both of which were relied upon by the Crown, are distinguishable.
	
	
	Even if I had concluded that the evidence was relevant, I would have excluded it pursuant to s. 137 of the Act. There would, in my view, be a real risk that the evidence, if admitted, would be used by the jury in a way which involved the adoption of an illegitimate form of reasoning.
	
	
	Accordingly, the evidence in excluded.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765850,Sakr v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWDC 25,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for rulings on 12 February 2015.
	
	
	The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation for a broadcast of “Media Watch” on 24 March 2014 and subsequent publications through iView and on the ABC website. The defendant challenges the four imputations pleaded and the particulars of aggravated compensatory damages. Both sides also seek early production or retention of electronically stored information (ESI) and other transient records which are considered relevant to the proceedings and which might otherwise, by reason of the ephemeral nature of such records, not otherwise be retained.
	


The imputations pleaded


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the matter complained of are as follows (at paragraph 4 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	She is a supporter of the brutality of the Assad regime in Syria;
	
	
	She protects the brutal Assad regime in Syria by refusing to admit that it has used chemical weapons;
	
	
	She has received special favours from the brutal Assad regime in Syria in return for her support;
	
	
	She has tried to create favourable propaganda for the brutal Assad regime in Syria.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The test to apply to challenges to the capacity of imputations is a generous one (Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 at [6]), particularly where having regard to the ephemeral nature of a television broadcast (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158). In Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135] – [136], the court held that the determination of capacity is an issue of generosity and not of parsimony, as well as being a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”.
	
	
	The correct approach to objections to the form of imputations is explained in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135, where Gleeson CJ pointed out that if the matter complained of said “X is disgusting”, an imputation in those terms did not require further glossing. The NSW Court of Appeal has further explained these principles in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20]. Objections to form in this application included the familiar complaint that the imputations repeated the words of the matter complained of. That is permitted as long as those words accurately encapsulate the sting (Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52] – [54]) and while concerns were raised in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255, there have been changes in legislation and rules, and the decision does not in any event stand for the principle that the words of the matter complained of cannot be used.
	
	
	Having noted these principles I now consider the parties’ submissions as to the form and capacity of the imputations. Mr Molomby SC indicated that brief reasons would suffice, by reason of the familiarity of the principles in question.
	


Imputation 4(a)


	
	The defendant’s objection to the capacity of imputation 4(a) is well founded. The matter complained of does not assert that the plaintiff is a supporter of the brutality of the Assad regime; to the contrary, she refuses to admit that brutality is occurring, in that she does not accept that chemical weapons are being used and blames foreign invaders, not the Assad regime, for what is occurring (lines 25 – 40).
	
	
	While an imputation of supporting the regime (which is portrayed as brutal) is conveyed, an imputation of supporting the brutality must fail in limine.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead, to enable the plaintiff to identify the sting more accurately.
	
	
	Objections were also raised in relation to the use of the words “support” and “brutality”, which are dealt with in more detail below.
	


Imputations 4(b) and 4(c)


	
	The objections to imputations 4(b) and 4(c) relate to the use of the word “brutal” (which occurs in the matter complained of) and, further, to the use of the word “support” in imputation 4(c) (which does not occur in the matter complained of, although “backs”, “express solidarity” and “powerful PR for a brutal regime” appear). The defendant also objects to the use of the word “protects” in imputation 4(b).
	
	
	While pleadings which contain the actual words of the matter complained of must be carefully scrutinised, the repeated references to the brutal Assad regime capture the sting so well that the plaintiff ought not to be obliged to consult a thesaurus for an alternative phrase.
	
	
	Mr Lewis submitted that these terms were so ambiguous and general in terms that his client did not know the case it had to meet. For the reasons explained by Hutley JA in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688B - C, in relation to the same complaint, this is not an objection of substance.
	
	
	The meaning of “support” has been helpfully explained by Mr Molomby SC with reference to the relevant portions of the matter complained of and no further gloss is needed. The imputations should be read in the context of the matter complained of, not as a stand-alone particular that is construed without the benefit of context.
	
	
	The defendant’s objection to the use of the word “protects” in imputation 4(b) is similarly without foundation.
	
	
	A submission that the imputations 4(a) and 4(b) did not differ in substance was abandoned when Mr Molomby SC pointed out that imputation 4(a) is an imputation of condition while imputation 4(b) is an imputation of an act. The alternative submission that they are fallbacks to each other must fail for the same reason.
	
	
	These imputations will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 4(d)


	
	The difficulty with this imputation is the importation of a concept that the plaintiff “tried to” create favourable propaganda for the brutal Assad regime, when the matter complained of stated in unambiguous terms that the story in which she participated was “powerful propaganda”; similarly, her participation in the delegation to Mr Assad resulted in “useful propaganda” in the form of a social media post on Instagram.
	
	
	Mr Molomby SC explained the use of “tried to” as being that the plaintiff was not the principal actor. Additionally, the disapproving tones of Mr Barry and the references to widespread criticisms of these activities conveyed the impression that the attempts at propaganda had been unsuccessful.
	
	
	The imputation of creating propaganda does not require that it be received with approval. The nature of propaganda is such that, in fact, the reverse is often the case, hence the pejorative nature of the meaning of this word.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead.
	


The particulars of aggravated damages


	
	The particulars of aggravation are pleaded at paragraph 6 of the statement of claim as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s knowledge of the falsity of the imputations;
	
	
	The defendant’s refusal to place the plaintiff’s reply to the matter complained of on the Media Watch website linked to the matter complained of in the same manner as the responses by the journalist Chris Ray;
	
	
	The defendant’s contemptuous action in placing the plaintiff’s reply to the matter complained of among viewers’ comments, separated into two parts, and with part of it omitted;
	
	
	The defendant’s failure to answer letters of protest from the plaintiff, including to its Managing Director Mark Scott;
	
	
	The defendant’s distortion of the Good Weekend article by representing that it did not include mention of the political position of the delegation of the plaintiff joined, whereas the article said that the delegation was “opposed to Western intervention in the conflict”, and by representing that the article did not acknowledge that she had met President al-Assad, whereas the article said so.
	



	
	The general objection to these particulars is made on the basis that the only claim which it is possible to make is for failure to apologise, in circumstances where such failure goes beyond a general damages issue (Clark v Ainsworth (1996) 40 NSWLR 463), which basis has not been identified here.
	
	
	To accept such a submission would be to ignore the profound changes in publication arising from the establishment of interactive websites such as that maintained by the defendant for the purpose of publishing not only the persons referred to in the broadcast, but to interested members of the public wishing to express a view. The plaintiff’s complaint is that while the reply from the journalist who travelled with her was treated with deference, her reply was cut into pieces and part omitted. Mr Barry explains, in the matter complained of, that these replies may be seen on the website, and the transcript contains links to the journalist’s reply (but not to the plaintiff’s long letter).
	
	
	The challenges to defamation law from the fast-changing nature of electronic publication are constant. When considering the nature of conduct traditionally considered as giving rise to aggravated compensatory damages, it is important to take these changes into account. I am satisfied that, in general terms, wrongful refusal to publish an apology of the kind identified by the plaintiff, in circumstances where the defendant maintains a website for such publications, is capable of amounting to a wrongful failure to publish, which is relevant as being aggravating conduct at the time of publication.
	
	
	However, there is no obligation on the defendant to answer “letters of protest” from the plaintiff. Failure to answer correspondence is not of itself an aggravating factor, and particular 6(d) will be struck out.
	


The plaintiff’s Notice to Produce


	
	The plaintiff called on a notice to produce on the defendant in the following terms:
	



	
	Documents sufficient to show the size of the audience for Media Watch, as surveyed or estimated, on 24 March 2014, or if not available for that date, on the date or for the period nearest to that date, in each capital city and any other areas for which there are such surveys or estimates.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the size of the audience for Media Watch, as surveyed or estimated, on 25 March 2014, or if not available for that date, on the date or for the period nearest to that date, in each capital city and any other areas for which there are such surveys or estimates.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the size of the audience for Media Watch, as surveyed or estimated, on 26 March 2014, or if not available for that date, on the date or for the period nearest to that date, in each capital city and any other areas for which there are such surveys or estimates.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the number of occasions on which persons have obtained access to the Media Watch programme of 24 March 2014 through iView.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the number of occasions on which persons have obtained access to the matter complained of through iView.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the number of occasion on which persons have obtained access to the Media Watch programme of 24 March 2014 through the Media Watch website.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the number of occasions on which persons have obtained access to the matter complained of through the Media Watch website.
	
	
	Documents sufficient to show the number of occasions on which persons have obtained access to the transcript of the matter complained of through the Media Watch website.
	
	
	All correspondence, whether on paper or electronic, received about the matter complained of.
	



	
	While it is desirable that the defendant be put on notice to retain such documents now, the purpose for requiring production of these documents now was unspecified. I was informed by Mr Molomby SC that the documents were sought to enable the plaintiff to answer a request for particulars of who downloaded the matter complained of (Dow Jones & Co v Gutnik (2001) 2010 CLR 575), which the plaintiff is obliged to provide in all cases involving electronic publication: see the cases discussed in Lighthouse Forward Planning Pty Ltd & Anor v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd & Ors [2014] QSC 217.
	
	
	However, Mr Molomby SC agrees that the obligation lies on the plaintiff to provide these particulars. It is not appropriate to require the defendant to provide this information. He has withdrawn the call on the Notice to Produce, but confirms that such documents will be required when discovery and interrogatories take place.
	


The defendant’s notice to retain documents


	
	The defendant in these proceedings has followed the commendable process of identifying certain discoverable documents now, rather than waiting for discovery and interrogatories, when it may be met with the answer that documents of this transient nature were not retained.
	
	
	One of the most significant impacts that electronically stored information (ESI) has had on discovery is the increasing complaint that vital electronic records are no longer available because they have been deleted or destroyed. In Brookshire Brothers Ltd v Aldridge 2014 W L 2994435 (Tex) (3 July , 2014) at p. 12, Lehrman J of the Texas Supreme Court noted that:
	


“[b]ecause of the prevalence of discoverable electronic data and the uncertainties associated with preserving that data, sanctions concerning the spoliation of electronic information have reached an all-time high: Dan H Willoughby Jr et al., “Sanctions for E-discovery Violations: By the Numbers”, 60 Duke L J 789 at 790 (2010).”


	
	In a letter dated 27 November 2014, the sought the plaintiff to retain documents in the following terms:
	


“Without limiting your client’s general obligation to preserve documents of relevance to these proceedings, we hereby put you on notice that we regard documents falling within the following categories as being of potential relevance to the matters in issue in these proceedings and require that they be preserved:

1. All documents recording or referring to communications between your client and the Syrian government or any agency, department, ministry, employee or other representative thereof;

2. All documents issued or given to your client on behalf of the Syrian Government or any agency, department, ministry, employee or other representative thereof;

3. All other documents concerning or relating to your client’s visit to Syria in later 2013 and early 2014 and the organisation thereof, including travel and accommodation arrangements associated with the visit;

4. All documents recording or referring to communications between your client and the Wikileaks Party or any office holder, employee, official or other representative thereof;

5. All documents recording or referring to statements by your client regarding the conflict in Syria, the Syrian government, the use of chemical weapons and Bashar al-Assad; and

6. All documents recording or referring to communications between your client and Chris Ray arising out of or relating to Mr Ray’s journalistic coverage of your client’s visit to Syria.

For the avoidance of doubt, a reference to “document” includes:

- Anything on which there is writing;

- Anything on which there are marks, figures or symbols or perforations having a meaning to persons qualified to interpret them;

- Anything from which sounds, images or writing can be reproduced, with or without the aid of anything else; or

- A map, plan, drawing or photograph;

and includes such a thing which is stored or recorded electronically, including on a computer, a mobile telephone or any other device or which consists of an email, text messages or internet posting.”


	
	For the present, it is necessary only for the defendant’s request to be noted. It is, however, a wise step for the defendant to have taken, and a practice which should receive wider currency, particularly in defamation proceedings, in order to avoid the difficulties which subsequently occurred in Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd & Anor (2012) 84 NSWLR 523 and Palavi v Radio 2UE Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264.
	


Costs


	
	The parties have each enjoyed success and failure. The appropriate order is for the costs to be the defendant’s costs in the cause.
	


Orders


	
	Strike out imputation 4(a) with leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputations 4(b) and 4(c) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Strike out imputation 4(d) with leave to replead.
	
	
	Strike out particulars of aggravation 6(d).
	
	
	Strike out particulars of aggravation 6(e) with leave to replead.
	
	
	Note the plaintiff’s call on the notice to produce is withdrawn and that the defendant has requested the plaintiff to retain the documents set out in paragraphs 1 to 6 of the defendant’s letter dated 27 November 2014.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s amended statement of claim is to be filed and served in 7 days.
	
	
	Stand the matter over to Thursday 26 February 2015 at 2:00pm before Gibson DCJ.
	
	
	Costs are to be defendant’s costs in the cause.

		11 March 2015",2015-02-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765853,R v XY [2015] NSWDC 87,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Children are entitled to expect their parents to protect them from harm, to look after them, and to guide them. So when a parent harms a child in a criminal way, especially over a long period of time and merely for his own sexual gratification, the breach of trust involved is enormous and lengthy sentences must result. It would be hard to imagine a more serious breach of trust than that involved in the offences I will shortly describe. I should note of course that in some of these offences there is an element of the child being under the authority of the offender but the concept of under the authority is a wide one and it is relevant to note the particularly grave breach of trust in these offences.
	
	
	The offender is the natural father of the complainant. I will not name him or her for obvious reasons. The offender was in a relationship with the mother of the complainant but that ended before the complainant’s birth. Thereafter he would see her from time to time, usually on the weekends as part of some access arrangement. In mid-2013 the complainant moved in with the offender and the offender’s then partner along with the partner’s three daughters. She moved out later on and went back to live with her mother. It was at about 8.45pm one Friday evening late in January when the offender’s then partner located a movie file on his mobile telephone. Obviously concerned at what she saw she contacted police. They came to the premises, looked at the movie file and immediately arrested and cautioned the offender. They seized another mobile phone. The offender was taken to the police station and then participated in an interview. He made admissions in relation to a number of offences. Further enquiries included the police interviewing the complainant. She disclosed that offending had occurred but without any particulars. Police also seized various electronic storage devices and a computer from the offender’s home. They revealed further offending.
	
	
	The accused has now pleaded guilty to 12 counts on an indictment. Although that indictment was presented in court today, it is acknowledged that the offender’s pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity.
	
	
	The first count is an offence of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10, that child being under the authority of the offender. That, a very serious offence, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. That offence was based on something that was seen on one of the offender’s mobile phones. A movie file on the phone depicts the offender performing cunnilingus on his daughter, then apparently about three years of age, for two minutes and 43 seconds.
	
	
	The next two offences are offences of attempting sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age. There is no standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty is 25 years’ imprisonment. Also on the mobile phone were images in which it appeared that the offender was attempting to penetrate the complainant’s vagina with his penis. In his interview with police the offender admitted to attempting to so do. It is hard to work out precisely when these offences were committed. The best that can be done is that on one such occasion the complainant was four years of age and on the second occasion she was about a year older.
	
	
	The next offence, count 4 on the indictment, is another offence of sexual intercourse with a child under 10, the complainant being under the authority of the offender. Again it is based on the video file found on the offender’s mobile phone. In it a further sexual act of cunnilingus is shown. This time the complainant appears to be about five years of age and the recording goes for about 11 minutes.
	
	
	Count 5 is perhaps one of the most serious offences faced by the offender. It is another offence of sexual intercourse with a child under 10, the child being under the authority of the offender, but it concerns penile/vaginal intercourse. The charge was based on two images found on the mobile phone in which that form of sexual activity was made apparent. The offender told police that he did not believe he penetrated the child. He said something similar to a psychologist who interviewed him for the purpose of today’s proceedings but by his pleas of guilty he admits that he in fact did penetrate the child’s genitals with his penis. At attempt was made during submissions to suggest that the penetration may have been minor but there is no evidence one way or the other.
	
	
	The next offence, count 6 on the indictment, is yet a further offence of the same type but this concerns a different form of sexual activity, another act of cunnilingus. This was an act that the accused admitted to despite there being no evidence on his phone. He told police that he had performed oral sex on her until they both fell asleep.
	
	
	Count 7 concerns yet another offence of the same type but, as before, a different form of sexual act to those I have earlier described. This was based on an image located on one of the electronic storage devices found in the offender’s home. It shows the complainant performing oral sex on the offender. The electronic data suggests that his daughter would have been six or seven at the time of this offence.
	
	
	Another act of cunnilingus forms the basis of count 8 on the indictment. Again as with count 6, it is an offence that the offender admitted to despite there being no image or video file on his telephone.
	
	
	Count 9 is another act of cunnilingus. This one is based on a movie file found on a mobile phone which shows, over a 15 minute period, the offender kissing his daughter, performing cunnilingus on her and moving his penis around the area of her vagina and anus. He is also seen to be masturbating himself in the presence of the complainant and lifting her into various sexual positions.
	
	
	Related to the circumstance that he has filmed and photographed his daughter in the course of sexual activity is count 10, an offence of using a child under 14 for pornographic purposes. It has a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The images and video files all show the offender performing various sexual acts upon his daughter or at least her posing naked or semi-naked for him to photograph. There were particularly disturbing images revealing just how young the offender’s daughter was when he began abusing her. An image which the offender said would have been taken when she was either 12 or 13 months, (not years but months), showed her touching his penis and at age 14 months there was an image that showed the offender and his daughter naked with her sitting on his genitals. Other disturbing images were found on an SD card.
	
	
	We now come to count 11, an offence of using a child under 14 to produce child abuse material, again based on the contents of the mobile telephone and electronic storage devices. The images and the videos are of varying acts and poses. The offender kept them for his own sexual gratification. In most of the images the complainant is about four years of age.Of course it is important not to double count here because some of the images showed offending already covered by an earlier offence.
	
	
	The final count to which the offender pleaded guilty is of a different type in that he has photographed a different person. Whilst the 13 year old daughter of his then partner was having a bath, the offender managed to take video footage of her naked. He cut a few stills out of that video footage and then deleted the footage. These images were taken only a few months before his arrest.
	
	
	The result is that the offender has been shown to have used his daughter in a sexual way for a significant length of time, commencing from when she was very, very young indeed. As I mentioned, the first occasion in which it is apparent that he has abused his daughter occurred when she was barely one year of age and those offences continued until she was seven years of age, still a remarkably young girl. The offences of course did not stop because the offender chose to stop doing what he was doing. They only stopped because he was discovered.
	
	
	There are thus five offences involving cunnilingus from when the complainant was three to when she was seven, one offence involving fellatio when the complainant was six or seven, one offence of penile/vaginal intercourse when the complainant was six and two attempted acts of penile/vaginal intercourse when she was four and five. Nor were these offences fleeting on occasions. I have mentioned already the length of time that some of the offending took. In count 4 it was 11 minutes and count 9 it was 15 minutes.
	
	
	So what resulted from this? Well entirely as should be and could be expected, significant harm. That harm to the offender’s daughter is enormous and ongoing. The victim impact statement prepared by her mother and read by the Crown Prosecutor today spoke eloquently of the damage that the accused wilfully caused his daughter simply, to repeat a point I have made earlier, for his own sexual gratification.
	
	
	The offender is, apart from a relatively minor matter involving a failure to lodge a tax return, a man with no previous convictions. He was born in Sydney and reported a happy early childhood. His father worked in construction and surveying, was often away from home and his mother was a full-time housewife who loved and supported him. His school experience was not a happy one. He said that he was bullied. His academic performance was average but managed to finish Year 12 and enter TAFE. He did an apprenticeship and has worked in a number of positions. At the time of his offending he was a nursing assistant in the aged care industry.
	
	
	He had a history of suicide attempts in 2001 in the context of a depressive episode and in 2007 in the context of interpersonal conflicts with his ex-partner and work related stress. Very tragically in April of last year, while the offender was in custody, his father committed suicide.
	
	
	A significant part of the offender’s childhood, at least insofar as it concerns its effects upon him, was the fact that he himself was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of his older brother. This abuse was non-consensual, recurrent and involved both anal and oral sex. That is of course - I know I am stating the obvious - a noteworthy circumstance in the upbringing of any child. Evidence as to whether there was a causal link between the experience of the offender as being the victim of sexual abuse and in being the perpetrator of sexual abuse was called. As I understand the evidence, the psychologist says there is a link which is difficult to quantify. By that, I think the psychologist means that the offender was more likely to become a child abuser because he himself had been abused. That of course is a long way short of establishing causation. Enormous numbers of people who are abused do not go on to become abusers themselves. Certainly the offender is entitled to sympathy for having been abused as a child but I make an obvious point: he, more than most, should have been fully aware of the harm that he was causing his own daughter.
	
	
	I will take into account as a mitigating feature in the offender’s favour the circumstance that he was abused himself but it does not make a great deal of difference to the ultimate result. I note also that the offender has expressed his remorse to the psychologist who interviewed him for today’s proceedings. It would have been better if of course the offender had repeated these expressions of remorse in the witness box but despite that, I accept that the offender, perhaps belatedly in the light of what he told police at his first interview, understands the gravity of his misconduct and is sorry for it.
	
	
	There is other evidence of remorse to be found apart from what is contained in the psychological report. His plea of guilty came at the earliest opportunity as I have already mentioned and his voluntary disclosure of the two offences, those being in count 6 and 8, do suggest that the offender is genuinely sorry for what he has done to his daughter. I should indicate of course that the plea of guilty entitles the offender to a discount on the sentence that would have been imposed otherwise to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. The sentence, because it will be an aggregate one, will thus be 25% less than it would have been in the absence of such a plea.
	
	
	24    One circumstance relied on by Mr Krisenthal, who appears for the offender, is that there was no violence or threats involved in any of the offences. I suppose that is true that these offences would have been more serious if they were but as was clear, the offender was well able to achieve his objective without violence or threats. He was able to completely sexualise the relationship between himself and his daughter. He did not need to use violence. He did not need to use threats. By starting at such a young age, his daughter came to believe that what was happening between them was entirely normal. She participated in the events I have described because, contrary to what was required, the offender did not protect his daughter. He did not guide her. He abused her for his own purposes.
	
	
	I should note that I have taken into account the maximum penalties. Life imprisonment in some cases and the standard non-parole periods where appropriate in determining the indicative sentences which go up to make up my aggregate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	As far as the prospects of rehabilitation are concerned, well they are hard to assess accurately, especially given the length of time before the offender will have the opportunity to reoffend. Cautious optimism is perhaps indicated as the offender does appear to be motivated. He will be treated whilst in custody and he will be a much older man when he is eventually released. There are no special circumstances in this case. I consider that the length of the parole period that I will shortly announce is adequate, indeed more so, to allow any rehabilitation once the offender is released back into the community and in any case the aggregate non-parole period I will announce very shortly represents the minimum time that the offender should spend in custody given the objective gravity of his offending.
	
	
	I will indicate the indicative sentences that I would have imposed were it not for the imposing an aggregate sentence as follows.
	


Count 1 - six years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of four.

Counts 2 and 3 - on each it would have been four years’ imprisonment.

Count 4 - imprisonment for six years with a four year non-parole period.

Count 5 - imprisonment for seven years with a five year non-parole period.

Count 6 - imprisonment for five years with a three year non-parole period.

Count 7 - imprisonment for seven years with a five year non-parole period.

Count 8 - imprisonment for five years with a three year non-parole period.

Count 9 - imprisonment for six years with a four year non-parole period.

Counts 10 and 11 - four years’ imprisonment.

Count 12 - one year’s imprisonment.


	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of 12 years and a head sentence of 16 years. The sentence commenced on 31 January 2014. The non-parole period will expire on 30 January 2026, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	I remind everyone that there is to be no publication of any evidence which will identify or tend to identify the complainant in these proceedings. That of course would include the name of the offender, given the relationship between them.

		05 June 2015",2015-02-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765857,R v Habib [2015] NSWDC 167,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Ishrat Habib appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and which plea she adhered to in this Court in respect of an offence committed on 26 February 2014. That offence was contrary to section, or subsection as it is sometimes called in Crown written submissions, 307.2(1) Criminal Code Act (Cth). The offence she committed was importing a substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity contrary to that section. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years’ imprisonment and or a fine of $850,000.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since the date of her arrest, 26 February 2014 at all times spending custody up till the present time will be taken into account by the backdating of the sentence.
	
	
	Although the Crown sought to assist the Court with its detailed written submissions in relation to all aspects of the matter, there were extensive submissions in relation to the issue of whether a discount ought be given for the plea of guilty and its facilitation of the course of justice. I appreciate that assistance from the Commonwealth Crown but it seems to me, with respect, that when it is all said and done, any examination of any decision of a superior Court in this State, dealing with the plea of guilty, particularly on a committal for sentence in respect of Commonwealth offending, would reveal that in New South Wales it is accepted practice for a Judge to exercise his or her discretion to provide a discount in accordance with the range set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in a guideline judgment relating to State offending, Thomson and Houlton v R determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1999.
	
	
	Bearing in mind all the material available to me I propose to accord the offender discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to be imposed which I will come back to at the end of my remarks on sentence. I have already advised the offender of the sentence that will be imposed which represents recognition of that discount and I would ask in due course that my introductory remarks directed to the offender being incorporated into these remarks on sentence.
	


(Ms Habib, can you stand up for me please? My practise is to tell people what sentence I am going to impose at the start, not at the end, because you’d be just sitting there waiting to find out what was going to happen to you. That wouldn’t be very fair for any prisoner unless that prisoner was a security risk and I don’t believe you're a security risk, for me at least. Then I am going to give my reasons and I have to refer to a number of things. There is a bit of territory to cover and take some little time. When I finish my reasons I’m going to ask you to stand up again - you don’t have to stand up the whole time. You can sit down in a minute, in fact you can sit down now.

I propose to sentence you to five years three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years six months, to date from the date you came into custody. So that’s a minimum period of two and a half years in custody and then the authorities will need to determine whether you are released and on what conditions - you will probably be released to be deported back to Great Britain. Do you understand that? Thank you.)


	
	The facts of the matter are set out in a statement of facts which are not in dispute. I am aided also with a very brief chronology that has been prepared by learned counsel for the offender. The offender is a citizen of Great Britain. She was born on 4 December 1991 and thus at the time of the offending with which I am concerned she would have been, on my calculation, 22 years of age. She is now 23 years of age. She had no prior findings of guilt, charges or convictions at the time that she came to Australia. She came to Australia via Singapore and when she arrived in Australia - having arrived here I hasten to say on 10 February 2014. She attended upon some type of travel centre at the East Gardens shopping complex at Pagewood, in order to book and pay for a South Sea Island cruise with the P and O Cruise Line. She was accompanied by a male person who, from the statement of facts, said something which appears in the facts, presumably noted by the booking agent, that suggests that she was not known to him. From what I understand are the facts he was barely known to her. I take this man to be some form of “handler” to assist the offender to facilitate the travel arrangements that she was then undertaking. This conclusion is consistent with the ultimate conclusion I have reached as to the role of the offender.
	
	
	She booked the cruise in her own name and she paid for the cruise partly in cash and partly by credit card. She departed on a cruise ship called the “Pacific Pearl” on 17 February 2014 arriving back in Australia on 26 February 2014. Amongst other places that the ship visited was the port of Port Villa in Vanuatu, formerly the New Hebrides. When she disembarked from the ship she was carrying, or had under her control, a cardboard cylindrical packing tube in which was what was described as a “lava lamp” with frosted glass containing a brownish yellow liquid - this type of artefact is commonly purchased by tourists in Vanuatu and islands nearby. She told customs officers that the lamp had cost her $110. Tests were undertaken and the presumptive testing of the liquid returned a positive result for cocaine. The AFP was contacted, naturally enough. The offender was conveyed to the AFP Centre but after receiving legal advice declined to be interviewed and has really said nothing else about the matter beyond some hearsay representations made to a psychologist whose report is available to the Court. One thing she did say to the AFP was, “How do you know how much is there? Do you mean the liquid? Don’t you have to cook it first?” This reveals at least some ignorance of the method of extraction of the cocaine within the liquid.
	
	
	In her possession when she was arrested she had a total of $5,059 and a few odd cents in cash, $4,110 within a white purse and the balance on her person. She also had three Visa cards, one MasterCard, all in her name and two mobile phones. There is no evidence as to what investigations were undertaken in relation to what was recorded on the mobile phones. The ‘lava lamp’ was examined in the appropriate way and the gross weight of the cocaine suspended in liquid form was 2.072 kilograms. The examination by the National Measurement Institute confirmed that the border controlled drug cocaine was within the liquid, its purity was estimated at 51.8% with a conclusion that the weight of pure cocaine was 1.073 kilograms. Fingerprints of the offender were found on the bubble wrap surrounding the lava lamp.
	
	
	The defence case did not involve any oral evidence from the offender. Of course, that cannot be held against her. She may exercise her right to silence. I appreciate given the role that she had she may well be in a very difficult position. But I am not informed as to the extent to which she may or may not be in jeopardy from providing evidence about those that recruited her or those who handled her. How she became recruited into this exercise, as self‑evidently she was, is a mystery.
	
	
	The material produced to the Court included a psychological report from Mr Lennings which ultimately wound up being a form of pre‑sentence report with very little in the way of psychological testing results or analysis. There is a letter from a Program with the Corrective Services of New South Wales who have had her care. There were references from a Stephanie Edwards, an officer of Birmingham City Council, whose reference I will refer to in a moment and a letter from the sister of the offender. Those documents are dated late December 2014 or January 2015. There was also a bundle of what were described as financial documents which I read in great detail, including rent accounts relating to the offender’s mother’s residence, notices for possession of property instigated by the Birmingham City Council, statements relating to tax owed and advice regarding court proceedings for repossession of the property rented by the offender’s mother, documents relating to rent arrears and other material relating to debts owed by either the mother or the offender.
	
	
	Some of the evidence within this bundle of financial documents related to debts that have accrued or arisen, for example, in the case of the tax levied by the Council, after the offender came into custody. I take the evidence of the financial circumstances of the offender’s mother, particularly, after the prisoner came into custody as being relied upon as evidence of the effect of the offender’s incarceration as a result of her arrest in relation to this matter. Other evidence relating to events occurring before the offender’s arrest and at the time of her arrest I took to be, from the submissions made, evidence relevant to understanding the motivation of the offender to involve herself in this scheme. The offender might now realise from her experience in Australia that Australian Customs officers are somewhat more vigilant than those in Great Britain that Australian tourists may experience as they wander their way out of the terminals of Heathrow to the city of London.
	
	
	There is also a copy of extracts in a note book found in the offender’s possession providing details of expenditure that she had incurred during the course of her travels as well as some statistics which I will refer to.
	
	
	Dealing with Dr Lennings’ report, as I said, there is little in the way of psychological analysis. The truth is that whilst the psychologist states that the offender is a “psychologically vulnerable young woman” the psychologist does not identify any symptoms of the offender reflecting either a psychiatric or psychological condition other than those that were consistent with her “reaction” to her current situation arising from her arrest and being in custody for the first time. He noted at paragraph 29,
	


“Ms Habib remains a vulnerable woman who has significant difficulties in adjusting to her current situation.

I particular she presents as experiencing a great deal of anxiety and sadness and would currently meet criteria for an adjustment disorder with low mood and anxiety in response to her incarceration. It is possible she might meet criteria for depression given the sustained nature of her symptoms”.


	
	It is clear from this report and the submissions conceding the effect of the report that no issue arises in this case that would indicate a relevant psychiatric or psychological condition that had a causal relationship with the offending, even allowing for the view expressed by Justice McClellan in the decision of DPP (Cth) v De la Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, at [177]-[178] that “The mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they be relevant to the sentencing process”, and that the circumstances may “indicate when an offender has a mental disorder of a modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence”.
	
	
	There is no condition identified by Dr Lennings, assuming that he was qualified to identify it at least so far as the symptomology is concerned, that explains the offending behaviour.
	
	
	Naturally, I take into account as generally relevant, as many matters are in this case, the fact that the psychologist has identified symptoms expressed by the prisoner reflecting upon the adverse reaction she is suffering from being in custody in a foreign land a long way from her family. But it must be said at the outset that nothing in the evidence demonstrated that her circumstances or the effect of her incarceration upon her family were exceptional. Although, as the Crown properly pointed out in its written submissions, “ … even having regard to a wider authority that states that the impact upon third parties, particularly dependants, must be quite exceptional” to invoke s 16A(2)(p) Crimes Act (Cth), there is accuracy in the submission that the effect of the sentence upon the prisoner’s family and “dependants” remains a relevant factor to take into account as part of the offender’s general mix of subjective features, citing two decisions from 2004 of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, R v X and R v Girard.
	
	
	I have read a number of reports from Dr Lennings and I accept that he is a man of integrity and I have seen reports from him that I have accepted in no uncertain terms. I am prepared to accept the account given that he sets out in the psychological report is the account given by the prisoner. I am mindful of the fact, of course, the Crown has not had an opportunity, if it so desired, to cross‑examine the prisoner about the hearsay representations she has made so far as her background or even her involvement in the offence with which I am concerned. However, it seems to me, that there are a number of matters that she asserts that are to some extent supported by material from independent people, particularly Stephanie Edwards, allowing for the fact that those people, that is Stephanie Edwards and the prisoner’s sister, have not been cross-examined. But then again, it would have been difficult to produce them for the prosecution to do so having regard to the fact that they live 12,000 miles away.
	
	
	The history given by the prisoner to Dr Lennings was that she had had an unhappy childhood. She is the third eldest of seven children. There was a suggestion in the history she gave that she was living at home with her mother, her seven year old brother and her five year old sister. There is other material available from the references to suggest that she was in fact renting a flat. But, in fairness, that material also said that even though she had a flat of her own she was spending a great deal of time at home with her mother. I am not aided with any particular geographic information about the location of the respective residences in Birmingham, England, to work out the extent to which those two residences were in fact separate.
	
	
	The family, apparently, was abandoned by the father at some stage obviously after seven children were born. As I said the prisoner according to the report has a five year old sister. Given the prisoner is 23 now and she is the third oldest of seven children I would have to assume that the father has had some connection with the mother up until five or six years ago at least. The father had a gambling and drinking problem but the prisoner did not report any particular abuse against her in the form of sexual abuse. He was, however, physically violent, she said, to herself and other members of her family. She reported, I think in fairness to her it would seem quite honestly, that she had a deal of difficulty at school, truanting a lot and was somewhat rebellious of the standards at least of her mother and, I would assume without knowing any more, of cultural standards of her family’s country of origin outside Britain.
	
	
	She had some employment. Before being arrested she worked on a production line in a factory and was a stock controller, it was said, before she was arrested. She had no particular medical problems. She has never been treated for depression or taken any antidepressant or antipsychotic or psychotropic medication and denies any self-harm behaviour. She has no dependence on drugs although she does smoke cigarettes. She has no long term relationships and no children. She told Dr Lennings that she committed the offence because of “difficulties that her family were in when she was living in England”. She said that it was not her own financial situation that led her to her “desperate act” but the difficulties facing her mother, which I will come to shortly from the evidence available.
	
	
	There is one other aspect of the matter that is to my mind established, that is she has two younger siblings, as I said earlier, one of which has significant difficulties with autism. This is the younger sister who I take to be five years of age. I will pause for a moment to quote from Stephanie Edwards’ letter to the Court. She is a teacher who has had direct contact with the younger siblings of the prisoner,
	


“Malika is a young child with autism. In line with a child with her diagnosis she has difficulties with social communication and interaction (she) has no speech and is completely reliant on her family to provide all of her care needs. (She) has a very poor sleep pattern and is frequently awake until the early hours”.


	
	Ms Edwards said that the experience she had was that the family was heavily reliant upon the prisoner for Malika. The mother is in poor health and much of the care of the younger sister has fallen to the prisoner. It also says the prisoner has worked closely with professionals involved with Malika to put into place a package of care. She had found the prisoner reliable and easy to communicate with and the prisoner had been generous with her time in attending appointments and the like. The prisoner also acts as an interpreter for her mother who speaks very limited English. She also has some responsibility for the care of the seven year old brother who is of school age. The prisoner was described by Ms Edwards as,
	


“A young woman who shoulders a great deal of responsibility within a complex family unit. She had given her timely freely and with good humour working with professionals to try and ensure the best possible outcome for her severely autistic young sister”.


	
	The prisoner was described as being, on what was described as “psychological assessment” without reference to the source of the assessment other than clinical observation, to be a “rather dependable and typically happy person who was happy to do anything with the family” and the psychologist reflected upon her responsibility for her siblings and her “parental roles” confirmed by Ms Edwards. She also reflected upon feelings of anxiety before the offence that she claimed and concern about her family although she denied any major symptomology consistent with any form of mental illness of disability.
	
	
	She has had no previous engagement with health professionals in relation to psychological or psychiatric matters. She relies heavily upon her capacity to work in Great Britain because of her obvious need for money. I have already read part of the formulation of the psychologist. The psychologist noted her regret of her involvement in the offence and according to the psychologist “appears to experience genuine remorse for her behaviour”. I accept that is the impression the prisoner made upon the psychologist and for the purposes of sentencing that is as far as the matter can be taken.
	
	
	The psychologist expresses opinions about the character of her offending which seem to me to be a matter of personal opinion of the psychologist which might not accord with the objective facts. He states that she acted in a “moment of irrationality”. In my view that clearly is not the case. It may have been a “moment of irrationality” to initially to agree to this enterprise, but the truth of the matter the prisoner had travelled from Great Britain to Australia via Singapore. She would not have travelled to Australia at a moment’s notice. Even giving her the benefit of a day’s notice she had time to reflect upon this enterprise, although she has not assisted us with details as to when she was specifically approached in relation to the matter. The financial circumstances of the family are also noted by the psychologist as an explanation for her conduct. I accept that that is a contributing factor.
	
	
	I have the report from the Young Adult Satellite Program of Corrective Services. She had participated in a program between 28 October to 5 November 2014. Her participation was rated as above satisfactory. The program is designed to assist inmates with personal growth and develop plans within custody and beyond custody. The opinion of the authors of the report, Ms Moor and Ms Geddes, is that the prisoner has the “propensity to change”, is prepared to undertake programs whilst in custody, has plans for her future and clearly needs some professional assistance in this regard and they speak positively of her in that regard.
	
	
	In relation to the financial circumstances of her family there was some discussion about the detail of the material tendered and that will obviously appear in whatever transcript is produced if a transcript is created in relation to this matter at a later time. I have no transcript. I simply state that as at 10 February 2014 the debt of the mother to the council in respect of rent outstanding was £1203.39. I am also aware that there had been action taken in relation to seizure of goods that required payment, as I understand it, of in excess of £200 for redemption of that property. Part of the material provided to the Court is a demand for what is described as “council tax” for the period 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 in the sum of £862.78. It seems that demand by the Council was made by a bill that was forwarded on 11 March 2014. The prisoner might have anticipated that the council tax was due, however, there is no evidence that she would have known the exact amount.
	
	
	The prisoner herself, just dealing briefly with some of the material available to the Court, had significant debt. She is the subject of recovery proceedings instituted on 17 December 2014 in respect of the sum of £398.96. One might not have categorised that as a crushing debt. Likewise, in relation to the mother there were proceedings commenced on June 16 by the Birmingham council for the recovery of £2654.59. Again, some of that debt was accrued after the prisoner was arrested.
	
	
	This material that I have briefly summarised, other parts of it I have referred to earlier, was at the heart in one respect of part of the submissions made on behalf of the prisoner by counsel concerning her motivation.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner naturally referred to the weight to be given to the plea of guilty and particularly the discount, the expression of remorse by the prisoner, the fact that in the context of no prior criminal convictions and her progress in custody she had good prospects of rehabilitation. It was also noted there was no issue as to the facts. All these matters I accept.
	
	
	What was submitted to the Court was, however, that her crime was committed out of financial ‘need’, not ‘greed’ in the context of course of it being conceded there were no medical issues that arose in relation to the offending. I have already dealt with some of the detail of the money that was owed at the time that she travelled to Australia.
	
	
	In relation to the debt of the mother for the council property that she was renting I have noted from the records that were produced, which are apparently account records showing the balance owed at any particular time up until late 2014, that the rent debt primarily arises from a continuing shortfall between the rent that was due and regular’ payments by authority’ made on behalf of the prisoner’s mother. These payments by authority it would seem, given their regularity and the exact amount each time paid, would suggest a source for payment under the control of the mother, although I am not assisted by any evidence to help me in this regard, such as some form of Government benefit. What we would call in Australia social security benefit.
	
	
	The real picture of the financial circumstances of the family is really impossible to identify with precision because I have not been provided with any evidence as to what was the income of the prisoner, if any, at any relevant time, or what income or benefits were paid to the mother or other members of the family by reason of Government benefit or “social security source”. There is no evidence as to the means of other members of the family, no evidence as to what specific support is provided to the family unit living within the mother’s home, that is, the mother, the two children that I have referred to, and possibly the prisoner, by other siblings. It is clear on the evidence I have available to me that there are four siblings not living at home who I assume are adults.    There is no evidence of what benefits or support is available through either the National Health Service, a relevant health authority or a local government authority such as the Birmingham Council. I think I can take judicial notice of the fact, being a relatively frequent visitor to Great Britain in recent years because I have a child who lives there, that local government authorities in Britain generally have a range of services available in the context of the fact that, as we know, there is a national government in Great Britain but no state government or state governments as we have here. Although I appreciate of course there has been a devolution of some powers to Scotland, Wales, et cetera. In fact, the material presented on behalf of the prisoner in the form of the reference from Ms Edwards confirms the fact that she is a teacher employed by Birmingham City Council and has some active knowledge and involvement in the care or supervision of the children in some way.
	
	
	I accept the general proposition that there were financial pressures upon the prisoner in part because of an obligation she had to her mother who had a number of financial difficulties, some of which were not of her making. I accept that the mother needed assistance in supporting her own children both materially in terms of financial assistance and physical assistance which the prisoner provided. I am prepared to accept the evidence that is available shows the primary pressure of financial obligation on this prisoner was not personal, in the sense of her own debts, but financial difficulties of other members of her family, particularly her mother for whom she felt some responsibility. This in part explains her motivation for being tempted to commit the crime that she has pleaded guilty to. It is obviously no excuse and certainly the evidence falls short of the Court accepting that this was a crime committed for “financial need”, not greed.
	
	
	The reality is, as the cases decided in this and other courts at first instance and the appellate courts show, that drug mules as they are sometimes described, or “couriers”, importing drugs into this country are recruited because of the lure of money or other financial benefit primarily because at the time of recruitment they have difficult financial circumstances, on many occasions not of their making, either arising out of their own personal financial circumstances, family obligations, drug dependency or some other addiction. Perhaps on occasions just generally arising from circumstances of poverty in which they have grown up and all live. If one reads the analysis of Justice McClellan in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, for example at [223] where he summarises some of the subjective features of some of the so-called “comparative” cases to which he refers, one can see these features emerging again and again and again.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept in the context of dealing with the submissions put by counsel for the prisoner that the prisoner took some responsibility for the family. But the truth is in the context of the objective evidence she must have also been lured by the benefit financially to her given the fact firstly that when she was arrested she had in her possession over $5,000 in cash which is completely unaccounted for. One must take into account that she must have had her air fare paid to fly in and out of Australia and that ultimately she was able to pay for the cruise in part with $600 in cash which I have to assume came from a source other than herself, bearing in mind, of course, as her own counsel demonstrated, she was keeping a record of her expenses presumably for later reimbursement. I am appreciative of the fact that in paying for the cruise in part the $600 cash and the balance, a greater amount, by credit card that out of the cash that she had in her possession when arrested she may have been required to pay the credit card debt. But the truth is that what she had in her possession was on my calculation in excess of what at 10 February 2014 would have been the debt owed by her mother to the council or even herself to third parties. As I said, the prisoner does not assist us in this regard. Even if she was to provide part of the money that she was to receive to the benefit of her family given their straightened circumstances I am satisfied on all the evidence that there must have been some money that she was going to use for her own purposes, that went to uses beyond simply outstanding indebtedness.
	
	
	I have already indicated my conclusion that exceptional circumstances, if I might describe them as that, do not apply to the prisoner to explain her motivation for the offending. It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that critical issues for the Court to take into account were her youth, the prospects of rehabilitation to which earlier reference was made and her role. I have already indicated of course that I have determined that I categorise her role in this matter as a “courier”. It should be pointed out of course that it is an unusual case. I see many cases of couriers coming into the country. I have sentenced some dozens of people over the last 14 years for coming into the country from China and Vietnam and South America with drugs concealed upon their person or within their luggage. This is the first case I have struck where a person has come into the country from a foreign land never having been here before and then gone out of the country ostensibly for a holiday on a cruise and then come back into the country a second time endeavouring to import prohibited drugs. It may be a novel method of importation that should be stamped out.
	
	
	The conclusion I reached in relation to her role in the matter, bearing in mind I have taken into account the helpful submissions of the Crown, arise from a number of aspects of the matter. The prisoner would not have had any financial capacity to finance this enterprise. The financial records that have been produced on her behalf whilst, as I have pointed out, relevant on the defence case to explain her motivation and other related matters that may be seen of a subjective character, also to my mind conclusively establish that she had not the means to buy a return air fare to Australia, let alone finance the importation of a substantial quantity of cocaine, the value of which is denied me in the facts, on a wholesale or retail level. She had no material apparently within her mobile phones or in any documentary form to show that she had information as to the contacts that she would need to have in order to unload the importation or provide it to those who could distribute it in Australia.    It seems on her own statement she had little understanding of how the cocaine could be extracted. This was quite a sophisticated operation of course. She had a handler who could look after her in Sydney. She obviously was given the package I assume somewhere along the way on the cruise. It was professionally disguised to look like an innocent item. The ingenuity of people importing particularly cocaine into Australia is outstanding. I did a trial involving the importation of over 300 kilograms of cocaine hidden in pavers in circumstances where the cartel or group that was responsible for the importation had previously, under the stewardship of the accused, imported seven or eight importations of pavers all innocent with no cocaine before they chose the moment to send to Australia the pavers in which were very cleverly imbedded quantities of cocaine. It was a tribute to the professionalism of Customs and the AFP that that importation was identified.
	
	
	The Crown has not seriously contested the submission of the counsel for the prisoner that the prisoner could be categorised as a “courier”. I appreciate in passing of course that labels can sometimes be misleading and people can have multiple roles. I appreciate the fact that was discussed in Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, a High Court judgment dealing with matters required to be proven by the Crown or proven by the defence in this regard and the evidential standards that apply in that regard, that a courier is in fact a principal importer. That having been said, to the extent that any burden falls upon the prisoner, the objective facts in totality satisfy me, at least on balance, that the prisoner was not the principal of this importation, did not finance it and was a paid hireling who was ultimately disposable.
	
	
	In relation to the prisoner I note that the prisoner appears before me as a young woman, small in stature and to my very untrained eye in appearance a shy, retiring person seeming much younger, or at least younger, than her stated years. I accept from the submissions that were made there is nothing either about her prior conduct or her character that suggests that she is of herself a danger to the community and that in her own country she is anything other than a loving family member. But the truth is, as we often see, that people such as herself, with an absence of criminal convictions, innocent appearance, a lack of any criminal antecedents, are very attractive to those who would recruit her.
	
	
	In relation to her role in this matter it is to be pointed out of course that everything she did she did in her own name. She was readily identifiable and like all couriers ran the greatest risk of exposure. There is no evidence to link her to any criminal organisation by family relationship or inclination save for her role in this matter. Of course, by falling to the temptation offered to her ultimately she sought to facilitate the aims of an organisation that very professionally was seeking to import into this country a border controlled drug that can do considerable damage to those that use it. Of course, she was part of, as I said earlier, a very clever arrangement to import these drugs somewhat imbedded one would have thought amongst a complement of Australian tourists who to all intents and purposes had nothing other than the innocuous object of travelling to Vanuatu, Noumea and other islands of the South Pacific for the purposes of enjoying themselves.
	
	
	As I said earlier, the Crown’s written submissions are helpful and some aspects of them I have already referred to. The Crown agreed that a discount of 25% ultimately was appropriate but in assessing the prisoner’s role the Crown submitted it was clear that her role was integral to the commission of the offence and I have already acknowledged that that is so. She also submitted, and I accept that the offending was not unplanned. It obviously had been deliberated over for some period of time by the prisoner, although I am prepared to accept in the scheme of things without any assistance from the prisoner that once she got on the plane to fly to Singapore there was no turning back for her. The Crown submitted, and I accept, that the financial circumstances of the prisoner were not exceptional. The Crown took the Court to some comparative sentencing which I will deal with in a moment. Apropos the Crown’s helpful written submissions in the usual way the Crown took me to a range of matters that are required to be taken into account in sentencing an offender for an offence of this type.
	
	
	In the written submissions of the Crown the Crown specifically referred the Court to Pt 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It dealt with a number of aspects of the matter including the nature and circumstances of the offence, the relevant considerations of the maximum penalty serving as a yardstick and basis for the comparison of this case between this and what is described in the Crown’s written submissions as “the worst case”. I remember appearing in the High Court as junior to Peter Hidden QC then, now Justice Hidden, when the High Court Judges in the case of Veen No 2 v The Queen in 1987 invited him to identify the status of case at bar by comparison with “the worst case”. When some illustrations were given to the learned Judges of the High Court of cases that could be regarded as worse than the crime committed by Robert Vincent Veen, the response was, well “one can always conjure up a worse case than the one at bar”. I accept that the maximum penalty indicates this is a serious offence and the maximum penalty provides the relevant yardstick. This is not the “worst case” of its type.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the fact that the amount of the border controlled drug was a relevant matter, notwithstanding the decision of Wong v R, and it is of significance in the context of the quantities that are required to establish a marketable quantity of cocaine. A minimum quantity of cocaine for the purposes of establishing a marketable quantity is two grams. The maximum quantity, as I understand it, for cocaine is two kilograms.
	
	
	Is that correct Madam Crown?
	
	
	THOMPSON: It is, your Honour, for cocaine.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I do not know whether a mathematical calculation of the extent to which a particular quantity is in excess of a minimum quantity of a border controlled drug for the purposes of the Act establishes a great deal, but I certainly accept that the importation is a substantial importation within the range of a border controlled drugs that would attract the maximum penalty for this offence.
	
	
	It is clear the prisoner sought to commit the offence for financial gain and I have already dealt with the aspects of that that I need to consider and that general deterrence is a relevant matter to be taken into account in sentencing the prisoner.
	
	
	The Crown took me to some subparagraphs of s 16A(2) of the Act including the fact that the guilty plea must be taken into account and what follows from that under New South Wales law, the need for adequate punishment in accordance with subpara (k), the character, antecedents and background of the prisoner which I have already spoken to.
	
	
	So far as the “hardship to offender” aspect, I have already dealt with that. The hardship of the prisoner being in custody in Australia is ultimately a hardship that she had wrought upon herself. But I would not be human if I did not acknowledge the fact that she, with a family of limited financial means, will serve a sentence with little direct contact with the family. Although I gather she appears to have regular contact, even daily contact, with her family or some members of her family by telephone.
	
	
	With regard to other matters that are not included in the Crown’s written submission, I take into account of the degree to which the prisoner has shown contrition. I note of course the contrition is not absolute. She has expressed contrition to others and I accept that her expressions of contrition are genuine. Her presence in custody of course will have a salutary effect on her and of course that is a matter relevant to another aspects of the matter, that is, what is required to be considered under 16A(2)(j) as to the deterrent effect that the sentence I impose will have on the prisoner.
	
	
	I have to take into account of course the prospects of the rehabilitation of the prisoner. I believe, in the understanding that the prisoner is not naturally of antisocial persuasion or inclination, that in conjunction with the salutary effect of imprisonment and progress made whilst in custody that she does have good prospects of rehabilitation. I note of course that she has not cooperated with the authorities although she is under no obligation so to do.
	
	
	I also note that this offence does not form part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts. I appreciate of course that of itself is not a “mitigating factor”. What I understand the purpose of subpara (c) to mean is that when a person is being sentenced for an offence which does form part of a series of criminal acts of a similar or same character that course of conduct must be acknowledged in the matter.
	
	
	The Crown made submissions about hearsay representations that are untested in related matters and I have taken them into account. I have taken into account of course the helpful outline of relevant matters to setting the sentence including the terms of s 17A and the fact that if a sentence of greater than three years imprisonment is imposed there must be a non‑parole period, the backdating requirements of the Act which are a matter of self-evident fairness and the other issues that were identified.
	
	
	I come back just for a moment, however, to the issue of comparative cases. The Crown provided me both with a summary and transcripts of decisions of a number of judges of my court including decisions in, decisions of Strode of 6 May 2011 from his Honour Judge Finnane QC, Crouch of 19 August 2011 from her Honour Judge Woodburne SC, the judgment of Teros of 20 January 2012 from his Honour Judge Toner SC, the judgment of R v X of 17 February 2012 from his Honour Judge King SC, the decision of McCulloch(?) from 18 October 2012 of his Honour Judge Frearson SC.
	
	
	I appreciate those judgments provide some assistance. They are all different amongst themselves in a range of ways. I do not need to go through that analysis at the moment.
	
	
	As I said earlier I drew the parties attention to a slightly earlier decision to the decisions in the District Court, bearing in mind of course the judges of the District Court subsequent to the decision of De La Rosa might reasonably be expected to have some regard to, at least, certainly great respect for, the view of the Chief Judge of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in his very detailed analysis of sentencing for offences of importing cocaine, which was the case at bar.
	
	
	In the matter of De La Rosa which was a Crown appeal from a decision of his Honour Judge Zahra the importation occurred in 2008 and the quantity imported was a marketable quantity of 1.87 kilograms. The prisoner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight years with a non-parole period of five years. The prisoner as I understand the facts of the matter having, before coming to Australia, a conviction which required a term of imprisonment in a foreign country.
	
	
	The prisoner was categorised as a courier. He had previously spent three and a half years in custody, as I understand it, in Argentina. Certainly overseas for the crime of robbery and he claimed support for his family and a debt he owed accrued in gaol as being motivations for his crime. The facts of the matter I need not dwell upon, but his sentence included a discount of 25%.
	
	
	In De La Rosa, as I said, his Honour sought to examine comparative cases and ultimately from his very extensive researches undertook a categorisation of offending in relation to offences of both import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, particularly cocaine, and importing a marketable quantity of that drug. Mistakenly counsel for the prisoner took my attention to paras [214]-[215] as being relevant to an assessment of comparative cases. Unfortunately, the submission was somewhat misconceived because those paragraphs are concerned with the commercial quantity of the relevant border controlled drug. His Honour’s analysis of the import of a trafficable, or marketable quantity, as it is now known appears at [216]-[223].
	
	
	It seems to me, without dilating upon the matter, that there are aspects of this matter that are common to what his Honour ultimately described in his table which appears at [224], that this offending fits somewhere between group 2 and group 3 of the groups identified demonstrating, I must say of course, to the fact that generalised categorisation of offending will always have exceptions and is sometimes problematic. It might be said that there may be more common features with group 3 discussed at [223] than that discussed at [221].
	
	
	I have had regard to his Honour’s analysis in the comparative cases provided by the Crown, but what I have had regard to, particularly in undertaking that exercise, is the consideration of reference to comparative cases that are discussed in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of R v RCW (No 2) ([2014] NSWCCA 190).
	
	
	It was held to be an error for the sentencing judge to fix upon a particular comparative sentence as some sort of starting point or definitive yardstick for the case that his or her Honour had before him. The merits of the appeal I need not concern myself with for the purposes of this judgment, but I particularly refer to [47]-[49]. Inter alia in the judgment of this matter that was delivered for the Court by Justice R A Hulme, his Honour pointed out that the case,
	


“demonstrates an approach that has all the appearance of being driven by a single so called comparable case. The focus was very much confined to a comparison of the criminality in (the other case) with that in the present case. There was no process of instinctively synthesising all the relevant objective and subjective facts and circumstances to arrive at a proposed sentence and then looking at the outcome of other similar cases that may have provided a check or yardstick (citing Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 and Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45).”


	
	His Honour went on to say in the following paragraph, “Arithmetical quantification of the mitigating effect of a single feature of the case...was erroneous.”.
	
	
	Thus, as his Honour points out in the judgment, comparable cases provide some assistance in setting out a relevant range, but a trial judge has to undertake the very difficult task of synthesising all the relevant materials to try and arrive at a just result for both prisoner and the community.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the statistics that were provided to me by counsel for the accused. They again provide a range of sentences that have been imposed. They provide little in the way of detail, far less so than comparable cases, of relevant objective and subjective matters, particularly when one has regard to the fact that the statistics I was provided with did not deal with the range of sentences for those with no prior convictions entering guilty pleas. I am also very mindful of the limitations of statistics that were easily and immediately identified by Spigelman CJ in 1998 in R v Bloomfield. I have taken those statistics into account.
	
	
	I have settled, ultimately, all things taken into account, upon the conclusion that the appropriate starting point of any sentence to be imposed is seven years’ imprisonment. I have also concluded, in the context of the decision of Hili and Jones to which I earlier referred, that having regard to this prisoner’s circumstances and the ostensible need for professional assistance to her on her release, assistance to adjust to community living, although she will be deported, and having regard of course to the need to ensure that the minimum term of imprisonment is proportionate, to reflect the criminality involved, that the non-parole period should be two years and six months, my calculation being of course that the total sentence should be five years and three months with a discount of 25%.
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years and three months. That term of imprisonment will commence on 26 February 2014 and expire on 25 May 2019. I fix a non-parole period of two years six months which will commence on 26 February 2014 and expire on 25 August 2016.
	
	
	I should explain the effect of the sentence upon you. The minimum period of time you will spend in custody will be two years and six months. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released or not on that date. If you are of good behaviour in custody it is likely that you will be released, but you will be deported, I will assume, from the country. Do you understand that? Is there anything else I need to explain to the prisoner, Madam Crown?
	
	
	THOMPSON: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else, Mr Abbott?
	
	
	ABBOTT: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Ma’am, I don’t know what to say to you, I’m not a guardian of morals in this country, I’m merely a person who’s given the responsibility of sentencing people for committing crimes. In your case your conduct was quite foolish, of course. I think you and your colleagues may have under‑estimated the skill of Australian customs officials in detecting illegal imports that might otherwise attract suspicion. I understand what you’ve explained to me, the circumstances of your offending. It can’t offer any excuse. But I trust that you are able to return to your family in due course and you will be able to get on with your life. If you had committed this crime in some other South East Asian countries you would be facing far heavier penalties for comparable offending than would be imposed upon you in Australia. I would imagine if you committed this crime in Great Britain, without having any specific expertise in British sentencing practice, you would be serving a sentence as long as that that I have imposed upon you, do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.

Judgment

The Plaintiff’s Claim


	
	By Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 9 December 2013 the plaintiff claims damages for personal injury suffered by her on 8 September 2009 when she fell in the car park of premises situated at 77 John Street Singleton, which was her place of work. Those premises were owned by the defendants and comprised three shops, one of which was used by the defendants. The other two were leased to Mission Australia, the plaintiff’s employer. The property leased was “part shops 2 and 3, 77 John Street, Singleton and Car Spaces numbered 5 to12”.
	
	
	The car park was situated at the rear of the premises and was concreted, with marked car spacing on either side of the car park. Seven of those car spaces were allocated for use by Mission Australia and its employees. On the day of the accident the plaintiff had reversed her vehicle into one of those car spaces, being the second from the rear of the premises, on the right side as one exited the premises.
	
	
	Between the boundary of the property and the edge of the concrete car park was an area (referred to as a “garden bed”) measuring less than a metre in width which was filled with crushed terracotta tiles, which were referred to in the evidence as either rocks or pebbles. The purpose of this material was to act as a type of mulch. The garden bed bordered the car park and there was one on each side of the car park area.
	
	
	Access was gained to the car park from a lane at the rear of the property. At both sides of the entrance there was an area of garden which contained the same material, namely crushed tiles as a mulch.
	
	
	On 8 September 2009 the plaintiff left work with a colleague. She walked to her car which was parked in the second marked space (the first being marked for disabled parking). Her work colleague got into the front passenger seat and the plaintiff walked around the rear of the vehicle to enter the driver’s door. As she approached the driver’s side of the vehicle from its rear, she felt her left ankle roll as she placed her foot on some of the pebbles and she lost her balance and fell. She placed her right arm out to break her fall and came into contact with the vehicle parked next to hers. She fell heavily and suffered a comminuted fracture to her right humerus.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims that the defendants, as owners and occupiers of the premises, were negligent. She claims that the pebbles, which were roughly spheroidal in shape, were a danger on the concrete surface of the car park, of which the defendants knew or ought to have known.
	


Particulars of the Defendant’s Negligence


	
	The plaintiff sets out in paragraph 9 of her Further Amended Statement of Claim the following particulars of negligence:
	



	
	Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the Plaintiff’s safety;
	
	
	Putting the Plaintiff in a position of peril in the circumstances;
	
	
	Providing a car park area which was unsafe;
	
	
	Failing to periodically remove the said pebbles from the car park surface;
	
	
	Locating next to the concrete car park surface a small garden bed filled with pebbles which were likely to become detached or to migrate so that they ended up on the car park surface;
	
	
	Failing to erect a low timber or brick wall at the edge of the concrete car park so as to retain the said pebbles;
	
	
	Failing to remove the said pebbles from the bed in which they were located;
	
	
	Failing to warn or adequately warn the plaintiff that the said pebbles were slippery and dangerous;
	
	
	Failing to prevent by means of ropes, barricades or otherwise the plaintiff from walking into the area where the said pebbles were located.
	


The Defence


	
	The defendants deny the plaintiff’s claim. By their Defence to the Further Amended Statement of Claim they have pleaded that they were in joint occupation of the premises with Mission Australia, which had exclusive occupation of the relevant part of the premises, including the car park area where the plaintiff fell pursuant to their lease.
	
	
	The defendants deny that they owed the plaintiff a duty of care, and further deny that they breached any relevant duty of care in that they were not negligent for failing to take precautions against any relevant risk of harm pursuant to the provisions of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (“CLA”).
	
	
	Further, the defendants deny they owed the plaintiff a duty to warn the plaintiff of any relevant risk of injury. Relying on s 5H of the CLA, they plead that the risk was an obvious risk to which the plaintiff is presumed to have been aware of pursuant to s 5G of the CLA.
	
	
	Alternatively, the defendants allege that any injury suffered by the plaintiff was occasioned by reason of her own contributory negligence by failing to keep a proper look out.
	
	
	Further, and in the alternative, the defendants have pleaded s 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (“WCA”) by alleging the plaintiff’s employer, Mission Australia, owed her a non-delegable duty of care to provide her with a safe place of work, and that Mission Australia breached that duty of care and was negligent. The particulars are pleaded in paragraph 11 of the Defence as follows:
	


“Particulars of Negligence by Mission Australia

(a)   The first and second defendants repeat and rely upon the particulars of negligence alleged against Mission Australia, the then first defendant in paragraphs 9(a) – (i) of the original statement of claim filed 7 September 2012, the particulars of negligence alleged against the then second and third defendants in paragraphs 9(a) – (i) of the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim filed 15 March 2013 (which are denied) and the particulars of negligence alleged against the first and second third defendants in the plaintiff’s further amended statement of claim filed 9 December 2013 at paragraphs 9(a) – (i) (which are denied).

(b)   Failing to provide the plaintiff with a safe place of work.

(c)   Failing to undertake any or any adequate risk assessment and/or risk response to the presence of pebbles on the pavement, including the area under lease and/or licence to the employer by the first and second defendants.”

The Issues


	
	The issues raised on the pleadings are therefore as follows:
	



	
	Did the defendants owe the plaintiff any relevant duty of care?
	
	
	If so, did the defendants breach that duty of care?
	
	
	If the defendants did breach their duty of care, was that breach causative of the plaintiff’s injuries?
	
	
	Were the plaintiff’s injuries occasioned by her own contributory negligence by her failure to keep proper look out for her own safety?
	
	
	Was the plaintiff’s employer in breach of its non-delegable duty of care to provide her with a safe place of work?
	
	
	How should the plaintiff’s damages be assessed?
	
	
	How should any damages be apportioned, if at all?
	


The Evidence Relating to Liability


	
	The plaintiff gave the following evidence about what happened:
	


“Q: I understand you left work, can you tell the court what happened from the time you were leaving work? First of all, were you carrying anything?

A: Yes, I was actually carrying a Woolworths green bag which had my wallet and some other items in it, in my left hand. As well as I had my keys in my right hand. I’ve unlocked the car, Scott was already in the car.

Q: How did you unlock the car?

A: Okay, so it’s a remote, so just press the button and, yeah, Scott was in the car. I walked around the back of the car and to place my bag in the backseat behind the driver’s side.

Q: Now how far was the back of your car from where the rock garden bed started?

A: Yep, it was probably a metre. It was probably a metre gap between my car and the edge of the concrete.

Q: So when you walked around the back of the car did you remain on the concrete or did you walk on the rocks?

A: I remained on the concrete.

Q: Then what happened after that?

A: As I walked around the back of the car I’ve walked on some rocks that were on the concrete. My left ankle has rolled and I’ve just gone down. Natural reflex I put my arm out and I’ve known straight away that something was wrong, I’ve just called out to Scott who was already in the car, he’s coming out and I said, ‘I think you need to call an ambulance’, which is what he did.

Q: Do you recall exactly where you were when this happened?

A: Okay, I was laying on the ground and I would have been at approximately between the back door and the front door of the car.”


	
	The plaintiff gave further evidence that she fell at the side of the car. It was her left ankle that rolled. She gave the following evidence:
	


“Q: So can you describe what happened when it rolled?

A: Okay, so just yep, I’ve stood on some rocks, my ankle just rolled to the left and I’ve just fallen towards the right to just try and balance myself, could not stop myself from falling so I’ve just, you know, tried to brace myself and just fall – just fell.

Q: When you were walking around the car where were you looking?

A: I was looking towards the back door to open the door.

Q: Did you see those rocks on the ground?

A: I did see rocks on the ground, however, there’s rocks there on the majority of cases, I did not, you know, I did not see anything.”


	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that she generally parked in the same car space which was closest to the door of the premises. She had been parking there for a period of approximately two years. She was asked whether she knew how the rocks got on to the car park area:
	


“Q: How do you say that happened?

A: The car park is open and at times there are people that come in on the weekends or of an afternoon. I’ve seen kids that do come in and ride their skateboards so perhaps that is how they got there.

Q: Did you actually see people riding, kids riding their skateboards in the car park area?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you see them riding either into the rocks or having anything to do with the rocks?

A: No.”


	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that the rocks that she stepped on were the same as the rocks in the garden bed. She gave further evidence that she had seen children riding skateboards around the entire car park.
	
	
	In cross-examination the plaintiff gave evidence that she reversed into the same car park every day. She was very familiar with the layout of the car park and went into the car park area approximately four times each day to smoke, as well as using it for parking. She had not been in the car park on weekends prior to September 2009 and was aware that her employer had an OH & S officer. She understood that she could raise any concerns or worries about her workplace with her employer, however, she raised no concerns in relation to the car park prior to September 2009.
	
	
	She agreed that she had seen rocks or pebbles from the garden bed on the concrete area of the car park on the majority of occasions she used it, however, she had never had any problems or concerns with the pebbles on that area. She did report the presence of pebbles on the concrete area to her employer, Mission Australia, or the defendants.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that she had never walked through the garden bed in the car park but that she had seen the rocks and pebbles on the concrete near the back driver’s passenger side door of her car before her accident. She agreed that the pebbles were orange or red in colour and were easy to see. She gave evidence that they were approximately half a dozen of them.
	
	
	It was suggested to the plaintiff that in walking around the back of her car it was necessary for her to walk through, and that she did walk through, the garden bed area, which she said was incorrect. It was put to her that she rolled her ankle as a result of the difference in height between the garden bed and the concrete car park. The plaintiff said that that was not correct.
	
	
	A number of people came to the plaintiff’s assistance after she fell including her manager, Naisse Dermott and Kathy Almond. An ambulance was called and she was taken to Maitland Hospital. It was put to her that she told a doctor at Maitland Hospital that she had tripped on concrete onto her outstretched hand, however, she did not recall that. It was suggested to her that at no time at Maitland Hospital did she mention anything to do with rocks or pebbles being involved in her accident, however, she said she did not recall that. It was further suggested to the plaintiff that she told the business manager at Mission Australia, Marie Spokes, that the reason she suffered her accident was because she rolled her foot off the edge of the concrete and lost balance. The plaintiff said that that was not correct. Further, a Workers Compensation Claim Form was completed by her at hospital which was completed by a work colleague, Mr Aurisch. The plaintiff gave this evidence:
	


“Q: Did you tell Mr Aurisch at any time in answering those questions that the reason you fell over was because of pebbles or rocks on the concrete area?

A: I can’t recall. I believed I had. It states that “walking around car, rolled ankle on concrete”. It didn’t say on edge of concrete. I believe that I mentioned rocks to Scott and filled this out.”


	
	There was no mention in the claim form of any involvement of rocks or pebbles in the plaintiff’s accident, with which she agreed.
	
	
	The plaintiff was asked about a further claim form entitled “Workers Compensation Journey Claim Form” in which she gave the following history:
	


“Walking around car, rolled ankle, lost balance, fell on concrete and broke my arm.”


	
	She agreed that was the history given and that there was no mention of pebbles or rocks being involved in her accident. It was put to her that as of 11 September 2009 she did not know that pebbles or rocks were involved in her accident, to which she replied:
	


“A: No. It is not the case.

Q: Then why didn’t you tell the person in completing the form to record anything about rocks or pebbles?

A: I did tell them.”


	
	The plaintiff was also asked about an Employee Injury Claim Form completed by Mrs Kathy Buckley on 15 September 2009. The plaintiff agreed that she had been asked questions by Mrs Buckley about her accident. She also agreed that there was no mention in the description of her accident in that document of the involvement of rocks or pebbles.
	
	
	The plaintiff was also cross-examined on another document referred to as an OH&S Online Incident Report which recorded the following history:
	


“It is believed that Julie may have rolled her foot off the edge of the concrete and lost balance. Concrete edge is around 4cm high.”


	
	The plaintiff agreed that the document did not record anywhere the involvement of rocks or pebbles in her accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff was also asked about the history taken by a physiotherapist at Maitland Physiotherapy Sports Injuries. She gave evidence that she didn’t feel that she had to tell them the whole details of the accident and she left out details of what she had fallen on. Similarly, it was put to the plaintiff that she did not tell an Orthopaedic Surgeon, Dr Watson, who examined her at the request of the Workers Compensation Insurer, anything about rocks or pebbles being related to her accident. She said she had complained to Workcover about the content of Dr Watson’s report.
	
	
	It was further put to the plaintiff that she had had a conversation following her return to work in January 2010 with Mr Aurisch in which she told him that she was not sure how she fell on 8 September 2009. The plaintiff said “That’s incorrect”. She said it was incorrect that she fell on the edge of the concrete because of the difference in height.
	
	
	Finally, the plaintiff was asked about a history given by her to Dr Bodel, who examined her on a number of occasions. It was put to her that in his report dated 26 July 2012 there was no record of the plaintiff falling as a result of pebbles or rocks, to which she replied “I’ve not seen the document”.
	
	
	It was put to the plaintiff that the first time that she mentioned the involvement of rocks or pebbles in relation to the incident was when she saw the liability expert, Mr Adams, in March 2012. The plaintiff said that was incorrect.
	
	
	The plaintiff called her mother, Maureen Florence Blakemore, who gave evidence that she saw the plaintiff in hospital in September 2009. She asked the plaintiff what happened and the plaintiff said to her:
	


“I was walking to my car. I had, my ankle twisted on some stones and I fell down and I hit my arm as I fell to protect myself.”


	
	The plaintiff relied on a report of Mr Neil Adams dated 8 September 2012 which, subject to a number of objections, was admitted as exhibit E in the proceedings. That report included a number of photographs which depict clearly the concrete car park with bordering garden bed comprised of crushed tiles. At paragraph 3.2.2.2 Mr Adams stated:
	


“Ms Blakemore’s experience over the preceding period of about 18 months of having walked within the car park at least twice a day, without slipping, tripping or falling, and of quite regularly observing pebbles on the car park surface generally, is likely to have resulted in her having a relatively low level of concern that she might experience an injurious fall as a result of encountering some of that material on that surface. This low level concern is likely to have been contributed to by the phenomenon known as habituation, whereby long exposure to a known risk leads to a reduced concern for that risk (see relevant material in the appendix).”


	
	Mr Adams was of the opinion that there would have been a very significant risk that a slip and fall might occur unless the presence of contaminants such as pebbles or gravel were effectively excluded from it. He set out the following preventative measure which could have been implemented:
	


“(i) The mulched beds could have been eliminated, either by extending the concrete surface fully to the boundary or paving the unpaved strips in some other appropriate manner;

(ii) Suitable borders could have been installed between the concrete car park and the unpaved areas. However, I would note that any such borders would need to be carefully selected and installed to ensure that they did not constitute permanent trip hazards to users;

(iii) The presence of contaminants could have been substantially reduced if children using skateboards and scooters etc, could have been prevented from gaining access to the car park. For example, the eastern border of the car park could have been fenced and a suitable gate installed. The installation of suitable signage, and perhaps security cameras might also have contributed to a reduction in the use of the car park for recreational purposes;

(iv) The car park could have been swept regularly, to ensure that the concrete surface was appropriately free of potentially slippery contaminants;

(v) The employer could have initiated the provision of additional cleaning services (eg. sweeping) within the car park, or required same of the owner/manager of the premises;

(vi) Workers such as Ms Blakemore could have been provided with advice, and reminded from time to time, in relation to safe paths of travel to and from the car park having regard to the predictable presence of pebbles/gravel on the car park surface.”


	
	Mr Adams’ opinion was that it was readily foreseeable that a user of the car park might experience a loss of balance and fall when attempting to walk across the car park surface when it was contaminated with pebbles or gravel. By implementing the preventative actions outlined above, the plaintiff’s exposure to the risk of injury “could have been very much reduced, if not entirely obviated”.
	
	
	Mr Adams was not required for cross-examination.
	


Defendant’s Evidence on Liability


	
	The defendant called Mr Steven Moore, who is the first defendant and a builder by occupation. He was, at the time of the hearing, the owner of the property but had purchased it in 2003 with Mr Clements, the second defendant, as a joint owner. Their joint ownership was terminated in about 2012. On 1 July 2009 the owners had leased part of the property to Mission Australia. That lease included part of the car park being the car spaces numbered 5 to 12.
	
	
	Mr Moore’s business was known as Golden Edge Homes. It was conducted from one of the three units on the property.
	
	
	As of 8 September 2009 Mr Moore was at the property every week day. He used car space number 1, and would come and go each day at anything up to a dozen times a day. Prior to that date he was not aware of any problems or concerns raised by any person in respect to the car park.
	
	
	Of the car spaces leased by Mission Australia, between “three and five” of those spaces would have used on a daily basis. Otherwise, occasional clients would use the car park, and employees of his business.
	
	
	Mr Moore gave evidence that the garden beds were not there when he purchased the property in 2003. The original property was totally demolished and a new building was constructed along with new car parking and landscaping areas. Consulting engineers, TJ Thomas & Associates, were retained to design the building and car park areas in 2004. Between 2004 and 2009 no changes were made to the layout of the car park or garden beds. He described the pebbles or rocks in the garden beds as a “crushed tile, terracotta or red in colour”. There had been no changes or additions to the amount of rocks or pebbles in the garden bed on the Mission Australia side of the premises between 2004 and 2009.
	
	
	As at 8 September 2009 the owners employed managing agents who were David Williams Real Estate to manage the property. They collected the rents, and looked after, organised and paid for any maintenance carried out on the property.
	
	
	Mr Moore also employed a gardener for the property in September 2009. That was Mr Craig Miles, who attended monthly to do any weeding and maintain the property in general tidiness.
	
	
	As to children using the car park either to skateboard or in any other way, Mr Moore gave evidence that the owners had “issues” in the very early part when the property was first developed and that would have been around 2004/2005. When asked what those issues were, he gave this evidence:
	


“A: Look we had children would come in there skateboarding and so forth in the area where you’ve got a nice new concrete area. It became a bit of a spot there for a little while which – look, it didn’t last long because we got rid of them relatively quickly and I suppose they really – we’ve developed another site within 100 metres, a larger site, so they relocated down there, I spose at the end of the day.

Q: To your knowledge, when was the last time in terms of a point of time, that any children used the car park area, skateboard or do anything else in that area?

A: I’ve not seen any children in that area on a skateboard or anything similar for quite some years.”


	
	When asked to nominate how many years, Mr Moore was unable to do so, but said that it would certainly be before 2009 since children were a problem there.
	
	
	Mr Moore gave further evidence that he had seen the plaintiff in the car park prior to 8 September 2009 on a daily basis, up to six times a day, when she was at the rear of the building smoking.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Moore gave evidence that his company built the premises. Mr Moore acknowledged that he had a knowledge of the safety requirements for commercial premises and safety standards that needed to be satisfied for building approvals.
	
	
	Mr Moore was asked how many people worked in his office and he gave evidence that two people worked there every day and clients would attend occasionally. Sub-contractors may enter the premises from the rear car park, however, they would number half a dozen in a month.
	
	
	Mr Moore gave evidence that he had been a smoker until he had his hips replaced some years beforehand, but he could not identify the date. He gave evidence that the gardener kept the garden beds tidy and pulled weeds. When asked what else he did, he gave this evidence:
	


“A: That would have been his main job there. Obviously any loose pebbles on the edge where people walk through the rear of the – through the garden beds, pebbles then get kicked out. I believe he would have broomed or got those, put those back in when he was there.

Q: So you were aware then, prior to this accident in 2009, September 2009, that sometimes the crushed tiles made their way onto the concrete?

A: Yes, I was, yes.

Q: Are you saying that you told the gardener that that was part of his role?

A: No I never told him that was actually a part of his role, no.

Q: Do you know how long the gardener was there when he came to your premises prior to September 2009?

A: Look, I would have to go back through the invoices to verify that. I’m thinking generally probably only a quick 30 minute stop, I would think.

…

Q: So you knew during that time leading up to September 2009 that for a whole month it could be there were pebbles on the car park?

A: I obviously can’t recall whether there were any pebbles there or not, no, and I’ll add, if there were at times when there were a number of them, I would actually broom them back into the garden beds.

..

Q: You also knew where those pebbles came from, didn’t you?

A: With people walking through the garden beds predominantly, yes.

Q: But you knew they were the garden pebbles because of their colour, that’s right isn’t it?

A: Yes, most definitely.

Q: Did you, prior to September 2009, tell anyone not to walk through the garden beds?

A: No I did not.

Q: Did you tell anyone, prior to September 2009, that they needed to be careful of rocks on the concrete?

A: No I did not.”


	
	Mr Moore was asked what would be involved in erecting a low timber or brick wall along the garden bed to contain the rocks. He gave this evidence:
	


“A: ... Righto; 1. You would – you mentioned brick or whatever; you could lay a brick on edge through the front of that area – very simple; no real issues there. The other alternative would be a timber and peg barrier against that area.

Q: The cost would be insignificant?

A: Minimal; minimal.

…

Q: Prior to September 2009 I suggest to you that you swept the pebbles back into the gardens because they knew they could be dangerous on the concrete?

A: No, I don’t believe so, no. It was an ascetic’s point of view, the appearance was more the point with me.” (sic)

Q: It was, was it – you were more concerned about the appearance, is that right?

A: No, I never looked upon it as a danger as such, no.”


	
	Mr Moore was asked whether the rocks on the surface of the car park were a contamination and acceded that they were possibly a minor contamination. He gave this evidence:
	


“Q: So in your experience do you know that the rocks on concrete create a risk, don’t you?

A: I still don’t believe so, no, not really, no. If that car park is a risk, every car park in New South Wales; every road in New South Wales is a risk – becomes a risk.

Q: Sir, so let’s assume that is the case. Do you then agree with me that these pebbles on that car park were a risk – were a risk to someone walking on them?

A: Walking and falling – I wouldn’t have thought so at the time, no.”


	
	Mr Moore denied that the rocks posed a risk. Mr Moore gave evidence that he had never thought about a risk being posed to people with a disability using the car park, knowing that rocks were on the surface. He gave this evidence:
	


“Q: That’s the point, isn’t it, Sir, you’ve never actually turned your mind to the risk of these rocks on the car park surface, have you?

A: I’ve always been conscious of them. I’ve never really considered them a risk, no.”


	
	It was put to Mr Moore that the rocks were everywhere and he agreed by saying “each side, yes and across the front, exactly”. He gave evidence that when the rocks were on the car park in large numbers he would sweep them off but not because he was concerned about the risk. He did not feel it was his place to tell other people not to walk through the garden beds, nor did he instruct his managing agent to tell Mission Australia not to do this as it was causing problems. Finally, he gave evidence that to remove the rocks would not cost much money.
	
	
	In re-examination Mr Moore said that when he referred to “large numbers” of rock, he meant if there were 10 to 20 rocks in the car park he would sweep them off. They were usually along the side of the car park, meaning the side used by employees of Mission Australia to park their cars and the stones had never been an issue on the owners’ side.
	
	
	The defendant called Mr Scott Aurisch. He first met the plaintiff when he worked with her at the Maitland office of Mission Australia in 2003. In 2007 they transferred up to the Singleton office and thereafter he drove to work on a shared basis with the plaintiff. They would park in the first marked space at the back of the office in the car park and he generally reversed in, as did Ms Blakemore if she was driving. He was asked to describe what happened leading up to the plaintiff’s accident and said:
	


“A: Yep, we went out the back door and go to the car. She’s unlocked the car, I’ve gone straight to the passenger’s door, opened the door, got in. She’s walked around the back of the car. … Yeah, so then she’s walked around the back of the car, I’m sitting in the passenger seat, I didn’t see her walk around the back of the car. I’m just waiting for her to get in the car.”


	
	Mr Aurisch said there was between 30 and 50 cms from the back bumper of her car to the concrete edge along the garden bed. He went on to say that he heard a noise and the plaintiff called out his name. He got out of the car, walked around the front and saw her on the ground. The plaintiff said to him “Call the ambulance I’ve fallen over, I think I might have broken my arm”.
	
	
	Mr Aurisch noticed a dint in the wheel arch of the vehicle next to the plaintiff’s vehicle, which belonged to Kathy Almond. He was asked:
	


“Q: At that time that Ms Blakemore was lying on the ground what, if anything, did she say to you about the reason why she had fallen over?

A: I don’t know if she actually said anything at the time was the reason. I can’t remember that. I think, yeah, was just in too much pain actually sort of, I think – yeah, I can’t remember exact if she said anything like that.”


	
	Mr Aurisch gave evidence that the following day there was a staff meeting and as a mandatory OH&S requirement for that meeting, the staff were told that the plaintiff had fallen over and that they were to walk around the front of the cars.
	
	
	Following the plaintiff’s return to work in January 2010 he had a discussion with the plaintiff as to the cause of her accident. He gave this evidence:
	


“Q: What was the effect of the words that were said to you, Sir?

A: We looked at the area where she went over and the edge of the concrete with the rolled sort of similar to the sort of the front of the bench here, just like normal sort of rolled edge of the concrete and then the stoned area before the fence and we said there’s a little bit of difference there, but she might have went over there, which led to the thing about saying going around the front of the cars.”


	
	In cross-examination Mr Aurisch said that he’d first had reason to recall this incident towards the end of 2013. He agreed that his evidence that the car was between 30 and 50cms away from the edge of the concrete was a guess and that he didn’t actually remember that. When he examined the edge of the concrete it was probably the day following the day after the accident. There was a little bit of difference between the edge of the concrete and the garden surface.
	
	
	Craig Miles was called by the defendant. He was the gardener employed by Mr Moore to go to the car park at the rear of his premises and spray the weeds in the garden beds. He said:
	


“While I’m there, if there are any papers I’ll pick them up and remove them, and also just to make sure the place looks tidy because it reflects bad on me.”


	
	He was employed to go there once a month but it could vary between three weeks and five weeks.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he observed the crushed tiles on the concrete surface and said there might be three or four, sometimes none. They were adjacent to the flowerbeds. He described them as “a red tile, crushed concrete, with jagged edges”. He would flick them back into the bed with his boots. Prior to 8 September 2009 no one had raised any issues or concerns with him about the crushed tiles on the car park surface. He said there was a gap between the garden bed and car park surface but the roof tiles were crushed and gripped very well. He had never seen children on skateboards using the car park area. He said the crushed tiles stood out in terms of visibility.
	
	
	In cross-examination he was asked whether he saw the rocks along both sides of the car park or all over the car park and said “No, in the garden beds on both sides of the car park. They could have been on either side.” There was no re-examination.
	


Defendants’ Submissions on Liability


	
	The defendants submitted that they owed no duty of care to the plaintiff on two bases. First, the area where the plaintiff alleged that she suffered her injuries was exclusively leased to Mission Australia and pursuant to its lease, that organisation had obligations in respect of the car park. There was no defect in the car park when it was leased, nor did the defendants have any knowledge of any risk resulting from the pebbles on the concrete car park as no problems had been raised with either the defendants or their agent.
	
	
	The second basis for not owing a duty of care was that the plaintiff was not exercising reasonable care for her own safety, relying on Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 514. The defendants submitted that the plaintiff knew of the presence of rocks on the car park, that they were easy to see and that she had seen rocks or pebbles on the car park previously. Earlier that morning the plaintiff had chosen a different route when she alighted from her car, around the front of her car, which caused her no problems, and it was a conscious decision by her to walk behind the car when she was aware of the presence of the rocks.
	
	
	In the event that I did find the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care, the defendants submitted there was no breach of that duty. The duty was to take reasonable care in the circumstances, not to make the premises as safe as “reasonable care and skill on the part of anyone can make them”, relying on Stojan (No. 9) Pty Limited v Kenway [2009] NSWCA 364. No previous instances of injury or accidents had been reported to either Mission Australia or the defendants in respect of pebbles or rocks on the car park surface.
	
	
	In applying s 5B of the CLA, the defendants submitted the duty did not extend to eliminating all risks, relying on Shoalhaven City Council v Pender [2013] NSWCA 210 at [52] to [54]. Learned Counsel for the defendants originally formulated the risk of harm as “the risk of falling as a result of rocks or pebbles that had migrated from the garden bed onto the car park surface”. He accepted that it would be more accurate to state it as “the risk of falling as a result of stepping on rocks or pebbles that had migrated from the garden bed onto the car park surface”.
	
	
	Learned Counsel submitted that the risk was not foreseeable pursuant to s 5B(1)(a) as there was no evidence of actual knowledge on the part of the defendants as to the risk of harm. Further, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff had not discharged her onus pursuant to s 5B(1)(b) to demonstrate that the risk of harm was “not insignificant”. The plaintiff’s case was not assisted by the evidence of Mr Adams contained in his report, exhibit E, because his opinion was not explained. Further, the plaintiff’s own evidence was important in that she did not consider the pebbles on the concrete car park surface to be a problem and did not report it to either her employer or the defendants. The car park was used by numerous people including the employees of Mission Australia and Golden Edge Homes, as well as members of the public. Also, the number of pebbles or rocks on the surface were not large numbers. Mr Moore had given evidence that there may be up 10 or 20, but otherwise it was just one or two stones, and Mr Miles gave evidence that there occasionally might be three or four, sometimes none.
	
	
	In respect of s 5B(1)(c), Counsel for the defendants submitted that the system adopted by the defendants was reasonable and sufficient to address any risk of harm. The starting point was that they employed engineers, TJ Thomas & Associates to design the building and car park. They employed real estate managers to manage the property and both Mr Moore and Mr Miles, the independent contractor employed to maintain the property, cleared the car park of rocks and pebbles at least once a month. The defendants submitted that that system was sufficient to address any issues up until 8 September 2009. The preventative measures advocated by the plaintiff’s expert Mr Adams at paragraph 4.1.3 of his report were not a reasonable response to the risk of harm. In applying s 5B(2), the likely seriousness of the harm of someone stepping on the rocks and falling was questionable in that it could result in no injury at all (see s 5B(2)(b)). Further, the elimination of the garden beds was not a precaution that a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have taken. There was no costing provided by Mr Adams in respect of extending the concrete car park over the garden beds and no detail given as to what “suitable borders” around those garden beds so as not to create a trip hazard.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there was no evidence that the pebbles were caused by children playing or skateboarding and hence, Mr Adams’ comments at paragraph 4.13(iii) of exhibit E were irrelevant. Because the plaintiff was aware of the presence of the pebbles, there was obvious risk and no warning was required. Thus, the plaintiff had not satisfied any of the three elements in s 5B(1) to establish breach of any relevant duty of care.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendants submitted that in terms of causation pursuant to s 5D and 5E of the CLA, the plaintiff had not established on the balance of probabilities that the presence of the rocks or pebbles caused her to fall. The defendants had a system in place here that was reasonable. There was no other evidence about what other system should have been employed or implemented, unlike in Strong v Woolworths Limited (2012) 246 CLR 182 where there was evidence that a reasonable cleaning system was every 20 minutes. In any event, the contemporaneous documentary evidence did not support that the plaintiff stepped on rocks and that that was what caused her to fall. Those included the ambulance report (exhibit M), the phone call to the ambulance made by Naisse Dermott (exhibit 10), Workers Injury Claim form (exhibit 3), the Journey Claim form (exhibit O), the Employer Injury Claim form (exhibit 4), the OHS Online Incident Report (exhibit 5), the Maitland Hospital Discharge Referral dated 11 September 2009 (exhibit 13), Dr Bilkey’s record of her attendance on 17 September 2009 (exhibit K), and the Maitland Physiotherapy Spinal Assessment form (exhibit 6). Nor did the medical reports of Dr Watson dated 14 January 2011 and the reports of Dr Bodel dated 26 July 2012 and 11 March 2014 refer to her falling as a result of standing on rocks or pebbles.
	
	
	The alternative finding, namely, that she fell for some other reason, for example, the difference in height between the garden bed and the concrete car park surface, was supported by evidence, namely, what was discussed at the staff meeting that occurred on 9 September 2009 at Mission Australia and the documents that were generated by Mission Australia (exhibits 5 and 7). Nor did the plaintiff tell Mr Aurisch that it was rocks or pebbles that caused her to fall. Rather, he inspected the concrete edge as the cause of her fall the following day. While the plaintiff’s mother’s evidence does support her claim, the defendants submitted that the first history of involvement of rocks or pebbles was contained in the report of Mr Adams dated 8 September 2012. As the plaintiff has failed to establish that she fell as a result of the rocks or pebbles on the car park surface, her claim must fail.
	
	
	It was further submitted that if it was established that the plaintiff’s foot came into contact with the rocks or pebbles, she would need also to establish how long they had been there in order to prove that any system that the defendants had in place was not satisfactory or that a reasonable system would have prevented her accident, relying on the High Court’s decision in Strong v Woolworths Limited at [32], supra.
	
	
	Nor did the evidence establish how the rocks or pebbles migrated from the garden bed onto the car park. The expert evidence relied on by the plaintiff did not establish what reasonable system, had one been implemented, would have prevented her accident.
	
	
	As to “obvious risk”, the defendants submitted that a finding of obvious risk eliminates any common law duty to warn. Further, obviousness of the risk may be relevant to the question of breach, and the plaintiff’s knowledge prior to her accident is relevant to determining the obviousness of the risk. Here the evidence establishes that she well knew of the presence of the rocks and pebbles on the concrete car park. It was submitted that the definition of “obvious risk” incorporates an objective test, but one that is to be applied by reference to the position of the person concerned, referring to Glad Retail Cleaning Pty Limited v Alvarenga [2013] NSWCA 482 at [59]. That grounded a submission that there was a complete defence to particular (h) of the particulars of negligence and a complete answer to Mr Adams’ comments at paragraph 4.1.3(vi) of exhibit 8(e).
	
	
	As to contributory negligence, the defendants submitted that this was not a case of mere inadvertence. The plaintiff knew of the presence of the rocks. Previously, she has walked around the back of the car instead of the front of the car which would have provided a perfectly safe means of access and her evidence is that she stood on the rocks and saw them prior to stepping on them. If I got to that stage, in making a finding pursuant to s 5R of the CLA, having regard to the actual knowledge of the plaintiff of the presence of the pebbles and rocks, the reduction for the plaintiff’s contributory negligence should be a reduction of 100%.
	
	
	Finally, pursuant to s 151Z of the WCA, the plaintiff’s employer, Mission Australia, owed her a non-delegable duty of care and was the exclusive lessee of the car park. It was the plaintiff’s employer therefore who had care and control over the relevant area where the plaintiff fell. No risk assessments were carried out by her employer, notwithstanding that it had an OH&S policy in place and the plaintiff had undergone OHS training. As the plaintiff’s employer took no steps to provide a safe system of work for her and safe access to and egress from her place of work, it was submitted that the plaintiff’s employer was negligent and should completely indemnify the defendants.
	


Plaintiff’s Submissions on Liability


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Court would accept the plaintiff’s evidence that she walked behind the back of the car where there was about a metre gap between the car and the edge of the concrete, that she proceeded around to the side of the car and rolled her ankle on rocks on the concrete car park which had come from the garden bed. Following the accident, the plaintiff was in a lot of pain and given strong medication, namely, morphine, for pain relief. It was never suggested to the plaintiff that there were no rocks on the concrete, and both the defendant, Mr Moore and the gardener, Mr Miles, supported the presence of rocks on the ground from time to time. Counsel relied on the complaint on the plaintiff’s evidence that she told the doctor at the hospital, and her partner Mr Meehan, in a phone call that she had fallen over on some loose stones as she walked behind her car. She did not recall telling her mother, but her mother gave evidence that she told her that she fell on the loose pebbles or stones.
	
	
	The defendants put to the plaintiff a positive proposition that she had rolled her ankle as a result of the difference in height between the garden bed and car park surface. Her manager, Ms Marie Spokes, in fact measured the difference in height, after having a conversation with the plaintiff. It was submitted that Ms Spokes was not called and no explanation was given for that by the defendants and therefore her evidence would not have assisted the defendants’ case.
	
	
	As to the inconsistent histories recorded in clinical notes of the hospital, physiotherapist and various doctors, the plaintiff relied on Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 to base a submission that such inconsistencies must be approached with caution.
	
	
	The plaintiff further submitted that the first defendant, Mr Moore’s evidence was neither credible nor reliable and should be viewed with caution. For example, he gave evidence that his company was involved in residential home building and said nothing about operating other companies that undertook industrial or commercial work, nor that they operated out of the same premises. Secondly, his evidence about the engagement of a gardener to do some weeding, maintain the property in general tidiness and sweep the rocks into the garden, was not supported by documentary evidence which comprised an invoice which showed he engaged the gardener to spray the gardens. Mr Miles did not corroborate the first defendant’s evidence and said that it was his job to weed the gardens and he did not sweep. He would occasionally flick a rock with his boot.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the defendant did, however, make a number of admissions which she set out as follows:
	


“


	
	He was ‘always conscious’ of the rocks being on the car park surface.
	
	
	That the rocks were ‘all on that side, the stones have never been an issue to our side’.
	
	
	Though this was contradicted by Mr Miles who gave evidence that the rocks were observed ‘adjacent to the flower beds’ which were on both sides of the car park; and he agreed they could have been on either side
	
	
	Being aware the pebbles were coming from the garden predominantly as a result of people walking through the garden beds.
	
	
	Sweeping the pebbles into the garden bed prior to the incident in 2009.
	
	
	Being aware the pebbles came from the garden bed.
	
	
	He did not tell anyone not to walk through the garden beds.
	
	
	He did not tell anyone to be careful of the rocks on the concrete, didn’t feel it was his place but didn’t tell the managing agent to do so.
	
	
	It would be very simple to erect a low timber or brick wall at minimal cost.
	
	
	Admitted he could have changed the plans by going to council.
	
	
	Agreed it would not have taken a great deal to remove the stones and put something else in its place and nor would it cost much.
	
	
	Agreed rocks were a ‘minor’ contamination on the surface.
	
	
	Said he never thought the rocks were a ‘great risk’ though he then denied he thought they were a risk. But then when it was put to him that it never occurred to him that the rocks were a risk the defendant said ‘other than when there were large numbers at which time he would clean them off.”
	



	
	The plaintiff submitted that the defendant was an experienced builder and was aware of the necessity of ensuring that surfaces complied with their relevant standards and were safe. It was submitted that a builder of 40 years standing would be aware that rocks on a concrete surface would pose a risk for those walking on it, and if he did not, he should have. It was submitted that his evidence that he swept the rocks into the garden for aesthetic reasons was not credible.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that by virtue of Clause 11.3 of the lease, the defendants retained the obligation to maintain the car park, even though it had leased the car parking spaces numbered 5-12. The first defendant, Mr Moore, confirmed that in his evidence when he said that the car park was shared between his business and that of Mission Australia. Consistent with that, he and the gardener maintained the car park. That gave rise to a duty of care to the plaintiff.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the defendants breached that duty of care for a number of reasons. First, they knew about the problem with rocks or pebbles on the car park. They created the problem by allowing the garden beds to be there, and they knew the rocks were migrating onto the car park and they did nothing about it. The first defendant did not tell anybody about the problem, including his agent. Further, as a builder, he had numerous options available to him at very little cost to fix the problem.
	
	
	Counsel agreed with the risk of harm articulated during the defendants’ submissions. She submitted that that risk was significant, and relied on the evidence of Mr Adams at paragraph 4.9 of his report, namely, that:
	


“The site controller as well as the employer should have considered that the potential for people to experience disturbances to their balance of types that could lead to falls at the premises generally, and specifically when walking within the car park.”

Then at paragraph 4.12:

“Considering the fact that the car park was publicly accessible and that pebbles and gravel were routinely present on the surface – a very significant risk that a slip might occur unless the contaminants were effectively excluded.”


	
	Counsel submitted that the risk of harm was foreseeable. The plaintiff relied on the precautions as set out by Mr Adams which could have been taken easily and at minimal cost by the defendants. They are set out in [35] above.
	
	
	In relation to causation, Counsel submitted that the defendants had no system in place at all, relying on the evidence of Mr Miles.
	
	
	As to obvious risk, Counsel submitted that the presence of the rocks or pebbles on the concrete car park surface was not an obvious risk to the plaintiff from her position. She was an office worker with limited education and this was an area where she walked regularly with no previous problems.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there could be no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff because this was a case of mere inadvertence. If the Court did not accept that finding, then any negligence of the plaintiff would be a relatively small proportion.
	
	
	With respect to s 151Z WCA, Counsel submitted that the employer had a lease with the defendants and it was their obligation pursuant to that lease to maintain the car park. The defendants had not brought to the employer’s attention any problem. Further, the evidence established that as soon as the employer became aware of a risk, they put into place a risk prevention strategy (exhibit 7), even though they got it wrong, that is, they determined that the gravel area should not be used. It was submitted that the employer of the plaintiff therefore did not contribute to the accident.
	
	
	Counsel responded to the defendants’ submissions that there was a reasonable system of cleaning in place by submitting that was just not made out on the evidence. The clearing of the rocks was done for aesthetic reasons. Further, it was simply wrong for the defendants to submit that the evidence did not establish how the pebbles got onto the car park. The case of Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Limited v Meneghello [2013] NSWCA 264 could be distinguished on its facts. In this case, the plaintiff gave evidence that she walked on some rocks and rolled her ankle. She was not challenged about how she knew that she stood on rocks. The evidence of her mother that she reported that to her was unchallenged.
	


Determination of the Facts


	
	In determining liability in this matter, I find that the following facts are established on the evidence:
	



	
	On 8 September 2009 the plaintiff left her place of work with a colleague, Mr Aurisch, and walked into the car park at the rear of her work premises situated at 77 John Street Singleton.
	
	
	Her employer, Mission Australia, had leased those premises from the defendants on 1 July 2009. The property leased was identified as “Folio Identifier 11/1046653 being part shops 2 & 3, 77 John Street, Singleton and car spaces numbered 5 to 12”.
	
	
	Car spaces numbered 5 – 12 were on the right hand side of the car park at the rear of the premises as one faced to the rear of the premises. That car park was accessed from a rear lane. Car spaces 1 to 4, which were reserved for the use of the defendants in the course of their business, were on the left hand side of the car park.
	
	
	The first defendant operated a business from part of the premises being shop 1 at 77 John Street, Singleton.
	
	
	The defendants had purchased the property in 2003 and demolished the existing building. They had built the premises and car park which were designed by a local engineering company.
	
	
	The car park had around its border what was referred to in evidence as a garden bed between the edge of the concrete car park and the boundary of the property. The bed was filled with crushed terracotta tile which was red in colour.
	
	
	For some time, the plaintiff and her colleague, Mr Aurisch, had been travelling to work together as a car share arrangement. On 8 September 2009, the plaintiff drove to the premises, entering the car park from the rear lane and reversed her vehicle into the second car space from the rear of the premises. That car space is nominated as number 8 on the plan annexed to the lease. When she arrived at work in the morning, she alighted from the driver’s door, and walked around the front of the vehicle and into the offices.
	
	
	When she left work that evening, the plaintiff walked behind her vehicle to gain access to the driver’s side. That involved her walking between the boot of the vehicle and the edge of the concrete car park, adjacent to the garden bed.
	
	
	Her passenger, Mr Aurisch, walked straight to the front passenger door and got into the vehicle.
	
	
	The plaintiff was aware of the presence from time to time of material from the garden bed, namely, crushed tiles referred to in the evidence as rocks or pebbles, being on the concrete car park. They were easily discernible being red in colour, by contrast to the concrete surface of the car park.
	
	
	The plaintiff was looking where she was going and saw the rocks or pebbles on the ground.
	
	
	In the process of walking behind her vehicle, and approaching the driver’s side of her vehicle, the plaintiff’s left foot rolled and caused her to fall. In doing so she came into contact with a vehicle parked next to hers, on its right hand side in the car parking space marked 9 on the plan attached to the lease.
	
	
	The plaintiff fell heavily and suffered a fracture of her right humerus.
	
	
	The plaintiff was aware of the presence of the crushed rocks or pebbles on the car park, both on previous occasions and on the day of her fall.
	
	
	The defendant, Mr Moore, was also aware of the presence of rocks or pebbles from the garden beds migrating onto the car park surface from time to time.
	



	
	It is clear that it was very much in dispute between the parties as to how the plaintiff fell. The resolution of that factual issue is set out below.
	


Determination – Did the Defendants owe the Plaintiff any Relevant Duty of Care?


	
	By her Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff pleaded that the defendants were the owners and occupiers of the premises, that the surface of the car park was contaminated with pebbles from the adjacent garden bed, the said pebbles were roughly spheroidal in shape and when located on the hard concrete surface posed a danger to pedestrians and that the defendants knew or ought to have known that such danger existed. In those circumstances the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff which it breached by failing to take precautions by sweeping the pebbles regularly from the concrete surface and installing a simple means of preventing them from accumulating on that surface, or alternatively, removing them entirely.
	
	
	In Northern Sandblasting v Harris (1997) 188 CLR 313 the High Court held that a landlord owed a duty of care to tenants and those to who its knowledge were intended to occupy the premises under and for the purposes of the tenancy, in respect of defects known to the landlord that the landlord knew of or ought to have known of at the time of letting the premises.
	
	
	In Lapcevic v Collier [2002] NSWCA 300 the Court of Appeal held, referring to Northern Sandblasting v Harris and Jones v Barlett & Anor (2000) 205 CLR 166 that a landlord of commercial premises owed a duty of care to a tenant’s employee working on those premises where the landlord let the premises with a dangerous defect of which not only it knew, but it undertook contractually in the lease to repair.
	
	
	The question arises here, whether, at the time of letting the premises to Mission Australia, the defendants knew, or ought to have known that it was letting the premises (including the car spaces) with a dangerous defect, namely, that crushed tiles would migrate from the garden beds bordering the car park onto the concrete surface of the car park, giving rise to a risk that employees using the car park would stand on the rocks or pebbles and thereby suffer injury. The determination of this question concerns a consideration of the terms of the lease first, and an examination and analysis of the evidence as to the state of the defendants’ knowledge at the time of the lease.
	
	
	Exhibit 1 was the lease which commenced on 1 July 2009. However, the plaintiff had been working at the premises for Mission Australia since 2007 and the premises were clearly leased from the defendants for a period of time before that. In 2004 the premises were new, having been designed by consulting engineers and presumably built in accordance with a relevant development consent issued by the local council. Exhibit 1 clearly included the area comprising the car spaces number 5 to 12, which included the area of the car park where the plaintiff fell. This area was not a “facility or service shared in common with other persons in the same building” and therefore did not attract the application of Clause 11.3.2 of the lease – see Clause 3.4. At the time of commencement of the lease, namely, 1 July 2009, the lessor had never received any complaint or comment about the presence of the crushed tile material migrating from the borders of the car park onto the car park surface itself. In those circumstances, the presence of such material could not be said to be a dangerous defect in the property known to the defendants so as to give rise to a duty of care owed by the defendants to the plaintiff as an employee of the tenant, Mission Australia. However, the defendants remained responsible for the garden beds surrounding the car park, and did owe a duty, as occupiers of that part of the property, to take reasonable care to avoid unnecessary risk of injury to persons arising from that part of the property.
	
	
	As to the factual issue referred to above, I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff did step on some of the crushed tile material which caused her left ankle to roll, and led to her falling. I make this finding on the basis that the plaintiff was essentially a witness of truth, despite her failing to tell Mr Aurisch at the time of the accident that that was the mechanism of her fall, and the absence of that explanation in the reports she made to her employer and to those who examined her at the hospital and subsequently, referred to in [73] above. However, I accept that she did tell her mother that evening at the hospital that she had stepped on the pebbles which had caused her to fall, and that evidence of her mother was not challenged by the defendants.
	
	
	I find, however, that in doing so, the plaintiff was not taking reasonable care for her own safety. She was aware of the presence from time to time of the crushed tile material on the surface of the car park. I accept her evidence that she had seen such material on the car park on numerous occasions before the day of her accident. I further accept her evidence that she saw the material on that day. As she walked around the rear of her vehicle which was adjacent to the garden bed, she must have been aware of the presence of that material, and in stepping on it, she failed to take care for her own safety. The evidence establishes that a person taking reasonable care for himself or herself would have no difficulty at all in walking on the car park. I therefore accept the defendants’ submission that by failing to take reasonable care for her own safety, no relevant duty of care was owed to her by the defendants – see Council of the City of Sydney v Hunter [2014] NSWCA 449 at [33] as a recent example of the application of this principle, as decided in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council, supra.
	


Breach of Duty of Care


	
	Notwithstanding my finding that there was no relevant duty of care owed by the defendants, I must consider, if I am incorrect in that finding, whether if the defendants did owe the plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care for her safety, was that duty breached? The first issue to determine is whether the presence of the crushed tile material which had migrated from the garden bed to the surface of the car park constituted an obvious risk. This has to be determined objectively for the purpose of Division 4 of Part 1A of the CLA. “Obvious risk” is defined by s 5F(1) as being a risk that “in the circumstances would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person”. A finding of obvious risk will obviate any common law duty to warn pursuant to s 5H CLA – see Angel v Hawkesbury City Council [2008] NSWCA 130.
	
	
	The crushed tile which migrated onto the car park surface was clearly an obvious risk. It was a red terracotta colour, and therefore contrasted to the concrete surface of the car park. Further, its presence was well known to the plaintiff, who had never complained about the presence of the material to her employer or, for that matter, to the defendant, Mr Moore, who she saw often at the rear of the premises. I accept that his may have led to a low level of concern on her part, as opined by Mr Adams, (see [34] above), however, that does not affect the obviousness of the risk. Pursuant to s 5H of the CLA, the defendants did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff to warn of an obvious risk to her. Therefore, that part of the plaintiff’s claim which relied on particulars of negligence relating to warning the plaintiff (see [7(h)] above) must fail.
	
	
	In applying s 5B of the CLA, the risk of harm to the plaintiff was the risk of falling and injuring herself as a result of stepping on the crushed tile material which had migrated onto the surface of the concrete car park. In accordance with s 5B(1)(a), that risk was foreseeable, and in accordance with s 5B(1)(b) the risk was not insignificant, given the undemanding test that that involves – see Shoalhaven City Council v Pender, supra at [65]. The real question that would have arisen in determining breach of of any relevant duty of care was that pursuant to s 5B(1)(c), namely, whether a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have taken precautions advocated by the plaintiff against the risk of harm as identified above. Those precautions amounted to either demolishing the garden beds and extending the concreting of the car park to the boundaries of the property, or erecting a barrier around the garden bed. In my view, a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would not have undertaken either of such measure or precautions. The car park was designed and built in accordance with the design by consulting engineers and no doubt approved by the council. The ingress of the tile material onto the car park surface had occurred initially because of children using the new car park for recreational purposes such as skateboarding. That activity had not taken place for some years. Otherwise, the material migrated as a result of people who used the car park area walking on the garden beds. It was not a problem that had ever warranted any complaint by any user of the car park, including Mission Australia and its employees.
	
	
	Further, to construct a border to prevent the ingress of the material would have merely introduced a trip hazard to those using the car park. Mr Moore, who gave evidence on behalf of the defendants, was an impressive witness whose evidence I accept. The car park itself was not an area that required a system of cleaning. Rather, the defendants employed Mr Miles to come on a regular basis to weed the area and in doing so, he would removed the few pebbles he observed from time to time from the car park surface back onto the garden bed. Similarly, Mr Moore himself would remove the pebbles from time to time.
	
	
	I therefore find that a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would not have taken the precautions advocated by the plaintiff and therefore the defendants were not negligent as pleaded by the plaintiff. In so finding, I reject the opinion evidence of Mr Adams set out in [35] above, so far as the preventative measures (i) to (v) applied to the defendant.
	
	
	The question of causation does not arise in this case but clearly, the “but for” test required by s 5D of the CLA could not be satisfied in this case.
	


Contributory Negligence


	
	As I have found that the plaintiff was not taking reasonable care for her own safety, that there was no relevant duty of care owed to her, and that if there was, no relevant breach of that duty of care occurred, the question of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence does not need to be determined. However, on the basis that I found that she was not taking reasonable care for her own safety, in the event that I am incorrect in my findings in relation to the plaintiff being owed a relevant duty of care, and breach of that duty of care, a finding of contributory negligence would necessarily follow pursuant to s 5R and 5S of the CLA. Given the extent of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the presence of the crushed tile on the car park surface from time to time, a finding of contributory negligence of 80% would have followed.
	


Employer’s Breach


	
	As my findings above mean that the plaintiff’s case must fail, the issue as to whether the plaintiff’s employer breached its non-delegable duty of care to provide her with a safe system of work does not arise. Nor does the application of s 151Z of the WCA arise and any apportionment of liability.
	
	
	Given my findings above, I would have found that whilst the employer clearly owed the plaintiff a duty of care to provide her with a safe system and safe place of work, that duty would not have been breached by a reasonable person in the place of the employer in the circumstances outlined above. I am therefore of the view that there would have been no finding that the plaintiff’s employer was negligent.
	


Damages


	
	The plaintiff was born on 29 November 1971 and left school in year 10. She worked for some years in unskilled positions as a sales assistant and then completed a family management course in 1993 at the Hunter Institute of Technology and thereafter worked with the Maitland Baptist Church as a child care worker. After her traineeship she became unemployed for some years until the year 2000 when she undertook a Certificate II in Business (Office Administration) at the Hunter Institute of Technology.
	
	
	The plaintiff then worked as a casual checkout operator and in August 2003 commenced employment with Mission Australia as an administrative assistant on a fixed term contract. Her position became permanent in May 2004.
	
	
	The plaintiff had a relationship with James Meehan and they lived together at Ashtonfield. From about 2007 she commenced working at the Mission Australia premises at Singleton, and she commuted there by way of a car pool with Mr Aurisch.
	
	
	Following the accident on 9 September 2009 she was transferred from Singleton Hospital to Maitland Hospital and underwent surgery on her right arm the following day. She was discharged from hospital on 12 September 2009 with her arm heavily bandaged and on painkillers.
	
	
	The plaintiff underwent revision surgery on the fracture at Lake Macquarie Private Hospital on 23 November 2009 as a result of non-union of the fracture. She was discharged on that occasion on 26 November 2009. She returned to work on 14 January 2010 two days per week working on modified duties and on 1 March 2010 her position was changed to that of employment advisor.
	
	
	She required a lot of assistance with bathing, drying herself, dressing and her toilet. That was provided by Home Care, her mother and her partner. She also required domestic assistance in terms of the housework which was provided by her partner and mother.
	
	
	The plaintiff remained under the care of her General Practitioner and following the surgery in November 2009, developed pain in her knee. That pain eventually recovered. The plaintiff, however, suffered a psychological reaction to her injury and was referred for counselling for approximately six months. She was also prescribed Alfoxil, an anti-depressant medication for approximately six months, and Effexor.
	
	
	Following the second surgery, the plaintiff was still suffering pain in the region of her scar and around the fixture.
	
	
	On 28 June 2010 the plaintiff underwent further surgery by Dr Harbury involving trimming of the plate and removing a K-wire. She was off work for several weeks and returned to work on modified duties on 12 July 2010 and then to her pre-injury duties in August 2010. She was still taking Endone for pain relief when she returned to work. She has been left with a burning sensation down her right forearm and numbness in her fingers.
	
	
	122 The plaintiff’s relationship with her partner broke down in October 2011. She gave evidence that, being depressed and in pain constantly, she found it very hard to have physical contact and had a fear of being re‑injured. There was no intimacy between them and she moved out. She moved in with her parents and her mother did all of her housework including washing clothes, ironing clothes, vacuuming the house and cooking. She spent seven to eight hours a week doing those chores up until the time of trial.
	
	
	The plaintiff had been offered further surgery by way of ulna nerve transposition and would undertake that surgery if advised it would benefit her. She has been left with scarring on her upper arm as a result of the surgery (exhibits A, B, C and D). The plaintiff was still depressed from time to time, gained 30 kilos in weight and gave evidence that she did not expect to be able to continue with her full time duties.
	
	
	In cross-examination the plaintiff acknowledged that in November 2009 she had posted on her Facebook account a report that she had been out all night and dancing. She agreed that her relationship problems also stemmed from her partner drinking and that she had not told her doctor anything about having intimacy problems as a result of her accident. At a time when she was claiming domestic assistance of 10 hours per week, she agreed that she was working eight hours a day and that she took an hour to travel each way to work. She denied that she had returned to doing her domestic duties herself by November 2009 and she denied that she had told Dr Watson in January 2011 that she was able to carry out all of her activities of daily living. The plaintiff also agreed that she had had problems with her weight since 1996 and that she had sought psychological treatment in her mid-twenties for that.
	
	
	Mr James Meehan gave evidence of the division of household and domestic duties between himself and the plaintiff up until the time of the accident. They shared the internal chores, but he did most of the outside work. He corroborated her evidence that she was unable to look after herself when she was discharged from hospital and he had to assist with her personal care including toileting, showering, washing her hair and dressing. He did that all day every day for two weeks as well all of the housework. He then started full time work and provided personal care for her after work for the next four to five weeks. He looked after her as well following her two subsequent surgical procedures. On the first occasion that was for four or five weeks. He described her as being very emotional and he described her as having “A lot of downs. A lot of tears”.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s mother, Mrs Maureen Blakemore, also gave evidence of the assistance she provided her daughter. When she was discharged from hospital, the plaintiff’s mother would clean her house and take her to doctors and specialist appointments, do her shopping as well as her washing and ironing. She estimated that she would spend nine hours per week doing housework and shopping for her. In addition, she spent a lot of time driving her to appointments. She observed her daughter to be constantly in tears from pain. She was now not as bad as she was, but she was still pretty emotional.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mrs Blakemore agreed that her daughter suffered stress as a result of her partner drinking and also when, in October 2011, they were asked to leave the place they were renting. Since her daughter moved in with her in 2011, she continued to do the same household chores that she had been doing to clean her house prior to the plaintiff moving in.
	
	
	There was little issue on the medical evidence relied on by both parties. The plaintiff’s medical reports (exhibit F) included serial reports from Dr Harbury on the surgical treatments she underwent for a comminuted fracture of the humerus. In his report dated 24 August 2010 he reported the fracture had fully healed with occasional features of epicondylitis. She had ulna nerve dysaesthesia which was still causing her significant problems, however, nerve conduction studies carried out at the request of her GP Dr Bilkey revealed no ulna neuropathy at the right elbow. Notwithstanding that study, Dr Bilkey was of the opinion that the plaintiff had neuropathic pain affecting the ulna nerve in her right arm as a result of her fractured right humerus.
	
	
	Dr James Bodel was of the opinion that whilst there was no absolute indication to remove the plate and screws in her right upper arm, if they commenced to cause local irritation, then the cost of that surgery would be between $6,000 and $7000. Dr Parmegiani was of the opinion that she had suffered an Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood and that she would require ongoing counselling with a specialist psychiatrist and anti-depressant medication.
	
	
	The defendant’s medical evidence (exhibit 2) included a report from Dr D O’Keefe which opined that the plaintiff may require an ulna nerve transposition at a cost of $6,500. Dr O’Keefe agreed with Dr Bodel that the plaintiff would require four hours per week domestic assistance. Dr Spittaler, Consultant Neurosurgeon, was pessimistic about the plaintiff having any improvement in her ulna neuropathy. He agreed that she required four hours a week domestic assistance. Dr Vickery, Psychiatrist, was of the opinion that there was no diagnosable psychiatric disorder, however, that the plaintiff would benefit from a further six counselling sessions with a Clinical Psychologist to continue her recovery.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted the following schedule of damages which was marked MFI 8:
	



	
		
			
			Non-economic loss 33%
			
			
			$189,000.00

	The defendants’ schedule which was MFI 9, was as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Non-Economic Loss 22% - 25%
			
			
			$25,500.00 - $37,000.00

			$225,578.05
			
		
	



	
	133 The plaintiff did suffer a significant injury to her left upper limb, being a comminuted fracture of her right humerus in the fall. She had immediate surgery by way of open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture, and several further surgical interventions to achieve union of the fracture. I find, pursuant to s 16 of the CLA that she would have been entitled to damages for non‑economic loss equivalent to 28% of a most extreme case. Applying the Table in s 16, that means damages calculated at 14% of the maximum amount of $572,000.00, i.e. $80,000.
	
	
	Past treatment expenses are agreed at $67,270.00, and I would have allowed for the future $20,000.00, including an amount for the chance of her requiring further surgery for her ulna neuropathy or removal of the fixtures.
	
	
	For past domestic assistance I allow the following:
	



	
	28 weeks x 14 hours x $25 = $9,800.00.
	
	
	258 weeks x 4 hours x $25 = $25,800.00.
	
	
	Total - $35,600.00.
	



	
	For future domestic assistance there is no issue that the plaintiff is entitled to 4 hours commercial care per week. The question is for how long should that assistance endure. The defendant has allowed for 10 years, which, given that she is now 40 years of age, is in my view reasonable. I therefore allow the sum of $66,064.00 for that head of damages.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s past economic loss is agreed at $26,958.00, and payments pursuant to Fox v Wood are agreed at $5,391.00. The plaintiff has returned to work and there is no evidence that her injuries may be, or are, productive of any financial loss at the moment. However, if she were to lose her present employment, she may be at a disadvantage on the open market place for labour as a result of her ongoing neuropathic pain in her right upper limb. I would therefore award her, as a buffer only, the sum of $25,000.00 for this head of damages.
	
	
	I therefore would have assessed the plaintiff’s damages as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Non-economic loss
			
			
			$80,000.00
			
		
		
			
			Past Treatment expenses
			
			
			$67,270.00
			
		
		
			
			Future Treatment expenses
			
			
			$20,000.00
			
		
		
			
			Past Domestic Assistance
			
			
			$35,600.00
			
		
		
			
			Future Domestic Assistance
			
			
			$66,064.00
			
		
		
			
			Past Economic Loss
			
			
			$26,958.00
			
		
		
			
			Fox v Wood
			
			
			$5,391.00
			
		
		
			
			Future economic loss
			
			
			$25,000.00
			
		
		
			
			Total
			
			
			$326,283.00
			
		
	


Conclusions


	
	For the reasons outlined above, the plaintiff’s claim must fail against the Defendants and I therefore enter a verdict for the defendants. In the event that I am incorrect in my findings of fact, my application of the relevant legal principles or my ultimate findings, I have assessed damages as set out above in the sum of $326,283.00.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Verdict for the Defendants.
	
	
	The Plaintiff to pay the Defendants’ costs.

		16 February 2015",2015-02-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765869,State of New South Wales v King [2015] NSWSC 74,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The State of New South Wales (""the State"") has applied for an extended supervision order for a period of five years in respect of Mr Ronald Dean King (""the defendant"") pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""the Act"").
	
	
	The State commenced proceedings by the filing of a summons in this Court on 24 October 2014. A preliminary hearing was held by Hidden J on 21 November 2014. His Honour appointed two psychiatrists, Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Jeremy O'Dea, to conduct examinations of the defendant and furnish reports. Her Honour also made an interim supervision order. Such order has been continued by other judges of the court until now.
	
	
	The defendant does not consent but he does not contest the making of an order. The dispute in the matter is confined to the length of the order and the appropriateness of certain conditions proposed by the State. Notwithstanding the concession, it is necessary for me to be satisfied that all of the statutory pre-conditions for the making of an order are established.
	
	
	A number of affidavits and a substantial volume of documentary evidence was read and tendered without objection and none of the deponents and authors were required for cross-examination.
	


The defendant and his criminal history


	
	In deciding whether or not to make an extended supervision order the Court must have regard to certain matters: s 9(3). I do not intend to go into detail about each of those matters but will confine myself to those that are more prominent in this case. One of them is the defendant's criminal history and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by it: s 9(3)(h).
	
	
	The defendant was born in 1984 and so is now 30 years of age. He has a criminal history which goes back to when he was 15 years old. Offences for which he was dealt with in the Children's Court include break, enter and steal; damaging property; stealing; entering prescribed premises without lawful excuse; taking and driving a car without the owner's consent; car theft; assaulting and resisting a police officer in the execution of the officers' duty; and stealing from the person. There are multiple entries for many of these offences, particularly for break, enter and steal. The defendant was sent to juvenile detention on a number of occasions.
	
	
	As an adult, the defendant's criminal history continued unabated with convictions for similar types of offences. There are a number of drug possession offences and it seems clear that substance abuse was an underlying factor in relation to much of the offending.
	
	
	The defendant received a variety of sentencing outcomes: fines, probation, community service orders, control orders and imprisonment. In February 2009 he received a suspended sentence good behaviour bond in respect of the index offence but the Crown appealed. The Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and re-sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months with effect from 28 November 2007: R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117.
	
	
	The defendant was released on parole on 20 August 2012. However, his parole was revoked and he returned to prison on 14 December 2012 and served the remainder of his sentence until 30 November 2014. Parole was revoked because of his breach of an alcohol abstention condition.
	
	
	The custodial history record indicates a number of punishments were imposed on the defendant for inmate disciplinary offences (including fighting; failing to comply with routine; drug or drug implement possession; intimidation; failure to supply urine sample for drug testing; and disobeying directions).
	
	
	The index offence was one of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10. Offences of committing an act of indecency with a person under 16, stealing property in a dwelling-house, and taking and driving a conveyance without the owner's consent were taken into account in sentencing. The facts, as summarised in the written submissions by counsel for the State, were:
	


""On 22 November 2007, when aged 23, the offender entered a residence and walked into a bedroom where a four year old female was asleep. The offender turned off the night-light and removed his pants and underwear. He then removed the child’s clothes and underwear and penetrated her vagina with his finger. The child woke up and told him to go away. The offender masturbated while leaning over the child, and ejaculated onto the bedclothes. He then left the room leaving behind his underpants. DNA evidence ultimately identified the offender in the offence. The offender was said to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence.

In addition to being charged with Sexual intercourse with person under the age of 10 years, the offender was also charged with Commit act of indecency with person under 16 years, Steal property in dwelling house, and Take and drive conveyance without consent of driver. In this, it will be seen that the index offence took place in the context of breaking and entering a home, and in the context of theft.”


	
	There was evidence that the defendant was affected by alcohol at the time but the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, Grove and Howie JJ) said this about that fact (at [47]):
	


""It is clear that the Judge gave substantial weight to the respondent's intoxication as reducing the seriousness of his conduct. In light of the respondent's history of alcohol abuse and the commission of crimes while intoxicated, there was no mitigation in the fact that he was intoxicated. It may explain what was out of character conduct so far as the sexual assault was concerned but it did not excuse it. By reason of his record and his failed chances at rehabilitation, his intoxication was aggravating so far as his entering the house in order to steal property was concerned.""


	
	The Court also had the following to say about the defendant's prospects of rehabilitation:
	


[60] … The overwhelming likelihood was that the respondent would continue to re-offend. He had been given opportunities in the past and refused to accept the restrictions of rehabilitation or parole. Efforts by his parents and professionals to address his drinking and hence his offending had proved fruitless. His Honour's finding flew in the face of the psychiatrist's assessment of the likelihood of the respondent's further offending without treatment.

…

[62] … As we have noted, the respondent had been given ample opportunities to reform including being given two suspended sentences shortly before the current offence was committed. He had flouted them all.

…

[64] … There was insufficient regard paid to the fact that the respondent was subject to suspended sentences at the time of the offending and the impact of that fact and his earlier parole violation on his prospects of rehabilitation.


	
	The submissions for the State point out that whilst this matter was the only occasion of the defendant committing a sexual offence, two of the break and enter offences on his record involved him being in the bedroom of female children. In January 2001 he entered a home at about 2.00am and went into a bedroom where two children aged two and seven were sleeping. He removed the two year old from the bed and placed her on the floor. He then got into bed with the seven year old female. She woke to find him in the bed and ran out to tell her relative. The defendant had left by the time the child returned to the bedroom.
	
	
	Earlier that same evening, the defendant had entered another home but was detected and fled before anything happened. These offences were committed in breach of a bail curfew condition. The Children's Court imposed a fine of $150 fine for the offence of entering prescribed premises without lawful excuse.
	
	
	In March 2005 the defendant entered a home and went into a bedroom where an 11 year old girl was sleeping. This home was in the same street as where the index offence occurred. The child woke to find the defendant standing over the top of her face. She called out to a relative and ran from the room but he chased and grabbed her. Fortunately she was able to break free and find her relative. The defendant was confronted by family members and was apprehended by police a short time later. He was charged with a break and enter offence and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.
	
	
	Generally as to the defendant's criminal history I accept the submission of counsel for the State that it indicates ""an ongoing and entrenched pattern of poor self-regulation and ongoing substance abuse.""
	


Compliance with obligations whilst on parole (s 9(3)(f))


	
	An offender's compliance with any obligations while on parole is a relevant matter to be taken into account. It seems that the defendant struggled to comply with his obligations when on parole in 2012. He lived for a short time with relatives in Dee Why but then moved to a half-way house (a ""COSP"" centre) at Malabar administered by Corrective Services NSW. It is a requirement that residents at a COSP centre comply with strict rules but the defendant struggled to do so; he ceased taking his Suboxone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence without medical advice; failed to comply with requests to engage with professional support to assist him to maintain abstinence from alcohol and other drug use; admitted to cannabis use on one occasion; deviated from his mandated schedule; was warned about bullying other residents; failed to attend appointments; and was found in possession of synthetic cannabis.
	
	
	The defendant was evicted from the COSP centre in late November 2012 and began living in a boarding house in Marrickville. A few days later he was observed to be inebriated at La Perouse and police found him in possession of two bags of cask wine. He breached a rule at the boarding house about having overnight visitors. Then, on 11 December 2012 when reporting to his parole officer, he was breathalysed and returned a blood alcohol reading of 0.181. His parole was soon revoked for breach of the alcohol abstention condition.
	
	
	The defendant continued to exhibit non-compliant behaviour following his return from custody. Notes from the Corrective Services' computerised file include references to him lacking co-operation with nursing and custodial staff; being dismissive and arrogant; adopting a belligerent attitude; being verbally aggressive; showing contempt for officers, procedures and local routine; and being manipulative and aggressive if denied a request. He was dealt with for two disciplinary offences (""fight or other combat"" and ""possess drug implement"").
	


Participation in rehabilitation programs (s 9(3)(e))


	
	The defendant completed the CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Therapy) program prior to being released on parole in 2012. His participation was described as ""satisfactory"". He is said to have ""demonstrated insight into issues relating to his offending behaviour and appeared committed to addressing these"". He was also said to have ""demonstrated high motivation to implement behavioural changes"".
	
	
	On a negative note, however, Mr Samuel Ardasinski, a senior psychologist with Corrective Services who prepared a Risk Assessment Report, noted that the prior break and enter offences in 2001 and 2005 in which the defendant was found in the bedrooms of underage female children, were not raised in CUBIT. Accordingly his therapist did not challenge him about that prior behaviour. Whether or not the defendant would have acknowledged a sexual motive for those offences or not, less weight might have been given to his proclivity for such deviant criminal behaviours in the future.
	
	
	The defendant engaged with a Community-Based Maintenance Program during his period on parole. Mr Ardasinski's review of the records led him to say, ""his participation would best be described as superficial, and the tenor of his progress notes is indicative of an individual who was attending group because it was expected of him, but who failed to engage adequately in the program to assist him with his reintegration"". He also observed that the defendant seemed not to have incorporated what he learned about risk management in CUBIT into the real world: he engaged in excessive alcohol abuse, as well as recreational drug use (in breach of his parole); associated with unhelpful peers; displayed sensitivity to criticism and rejection; and demonstrated a sense of entitlement and unhealthy attitudes towards sex. The defendant admitted to all of this, only denying the ""last warning sign"" of having sexual thoughts about children.
	
	
	The defendant participated in the Custody-Based Maintenance Program following his return to custody. His progress was mixed. It was noted that he ""presented as generally unmotivated to participate in custody-based maintenance sessions as evidence by his unexplained absences and keenness to finish sessions prior to their scheduled time"". However, he was also described as an active member who was generally engaged within the sessions. He indicated an intellectual understanding of concepts presented within past therapeutic groups and was able to relate this knowledge to his own life and circumstances. This prompted Mr Ardasinski to opine that the defendant appeared able, in the custodial setting, to articulate the issues he has had in the community and yet he still engaged in those risky behaviours when at liberty.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski expressed concern about whether the defendant had the capacity to self-manage his real risk of re-offending in any future release to the community without intensive supervision and ongoing support.
	
	
	The defendant has engaged in other programs in relation to his substance abuse issues but the results have been mixed. When most recently in the community (on parole) he failed to undertake any form of AOD intervention, despite being directed to do so.
	


Risk of future offending

Mr Samuel Ardasinski


	
	Mr Ardasinski referred to various assessments which have been made concerning the defendant's risk of re-offending. Administration of the ""Level of Service Inventory - Revised"" actuarial instrument (described as ""a robust predictor of future offending"" but it ""omits numerous risk factors specific to sexual violence"") in October 2013, showed his ""risk/needs falling in the High range, relative to other male offenders"".
	
	
	Another actuarial instrument specific to sexual re-offending, STATIC-99R, indicated that he was in the ""High risk category relative to other male sexual offenders"". Another measure known as STABLE-2007 also scored the defendant in the ""high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders"". A combination of scores under both these instruments ""yields a High overall risk level"".
	
	
	The Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol was administered by Mr Ardasinski and also brought a result of ""High risk of committing further sexual violence"".
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski identified the following dynamic factors that were potentially relevant to the defendant's risk of sexual re-offending:
	


●   Substance abuse

●   Relationships and unhealthy peer associations

●   Possible deviant sexual interest

●   Impulsivity and poor capacity to plan

●   Poor stress coping and cultural disconnection

●   Poor work ethic and self-esteem issues

●   Compliance with supervision

●   Lack of community support and suitable accommodation


	
	Under the heading ""Overall Risk"", Mr Ardasinski concluded:
	


""The overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr King falls in the High risk category of sexual and other criminal offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders. It is not clear to what extent any future sexual violence or other criminal offending would approach the threshold of a “serious sexual offence” as defined in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006.”

Dr Jeremy O'Dea


	
	Dr O'Dea examined the defendant on 8 December 2014. He provided Dr O'Dea with a detailed family, developmental, alcohol and other drug and forensic history which included the following.
	
	
	The defendant was expelled from high school for cannabis use. He moved to another school but never completed high school. He told Dr O'Dea about his ""extensive"" use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs from a very early age. He first used cannabis in primary school and his use quickly escalated to daily. The defendant reported a heavy dependence on alcohol, describing himself as an alcoholic from the age of 18. He would regularly experience ""blackouts"". He also experienced withdrawal symptoms from alcohol and subsequently developed a reliance on prescription drugs. He had also experimented with illegal drugs including ""eccies"", speed, ice and heroin.
	
	
	The defendant's account of the index offence to Dr O'Dea was piecemeal. He said that he was intoxicated from alcohol and Serepax and was looking for a car to drive himself home. He remembers assaulting the victim but could not explain his motivations for the assault.
	
	
	The defendant told Dr O'Dea he had access to pornography as a child. He viewed pornographic videos and magazines of adult heterosexual activity that he found at his home. He began masturbating in Year 7 or Year 8 and had his first sexual partner when he was 16 or 17. The defendant has not had a steady girlfriend at any time. He described his female sexual partners ""more like friends with benefits"".
	
	
	While the defendant did not report a particular sexual interest in female children, Dr O'Dea noted the prior convictions for what he termed ""potentially sex related offences"" which, like the index offence, involved female children. The defendant told Dr O'Dea that he did not remember anything about these offences. When questioned about the possibility that he might have a sexual attraction toward children the defendant said to Dr O'Dea, ""I find women of my age more attractive"", however Dr O'Dea noted that the defendant became guarded and flustered when discussing this topic.
	
	
	Dr O'Dea referred to the defendant's progress in custody, noting that he committed ""a number of institutional rule violations"" prior to his release on parole in 2012. When he returned to custody in December 2012, the defendant ""attracted less institutional misconduct charges"".
	
	
	The defendant claimed he was currently ""coping OK"". He reported experiencing some anxiety in public and told Dr O'Dea that he was ""too nervous to be around people"". He said that he was ""ashamed"" to be identified as a child sex offender.
	
	
	Dr O'Dea diagnosed the defendant with a Substance Use Disorder. He emphasised the importance of the defendant's abstinence from alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substances in order to minimise his risk of re-offending. He recommended drug counselling and rehabilitation, referral to a forensic psychiatrist and testosterone lowering medication.
	
	
	Dr O'Dea assessed the defendant's risk of re-offending as follows:
	


""Whilst Mr King has been convicted of one serious sex offence … on the basis of his history of repeated offending, including at least 2 prior sets of offences of a potentially similar nature, his history of substance use disorder yet to be assuredly under control, his personality, and his progress in custody and on parole in the community, it would seem reasonable to assume that he has a significant risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence …

…

Indeed, if Mr King were to continue to use alcohol or illicit psychoactive substances in the community, then his risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community, at least in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence, as defined in [the Act] may be considered to be unacceptably high.""

Dr Andrew Ellis


	
	Dr Ellis examined the defendant on 19 January 2015. The psychosexual history provided by the defendant included additional information about his previous sexual encounters. He recalled that he was heavily intoxicated during his first sexual experience. The defendant and his partner were both aged 16. Each of his subsequent sexual partners (approximately seven) were female and of the same age as the defendant. The defendant told Dr Ellis that he masturbates around three times a week to video pornography and thoughts of an old girlfriend.
	
	
	The defendant reported an awareness of sexual attraction to younger females. He said that when he was 18 he would masturbate to thoughts of a thirteen year old female school friend. He told Dr Ellis that he still has these thoughts but feels that he is now able to ignore them. The defendant did not report masturbating to images of female children around the time of the index offence.
	
	
	Dr Ellis's diagnosis of ""primary concern"" is a paraphilic disorder (Paedophilia). He noted that paraphilic disorders are ""chronic relapsing conditions"". He also diagnosed an Antisocial Personality Disorder and a Substance Use Disorder. Dr Ellis described the defendant's psychiatric disorders as ""chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision"".
	
	
	In the section of his report dealing with the assessment of risk of re-offending, Dr Ellis included:
	


""Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual reoffence. Mr King’s offence history indicates this pattern of arousal preceding the offences, and escalating from fantasy to masturbatory activity, to entering houses without sexual offending, culminating in an index offence of sexual activity with a minor. There is a direct nexus, although not recognised by Mr King between his masturbatory fantasy, early offending and later criminal action. Invasive action and some physical coercion was employed in order to gain access [to] the young victims. His pattern of offending has been present over years and gradually escalated. He displays a specific stereotype of victim attuned to his fantasy. Anti-libidinal medication is the best treatment to address deviant arousal. Behavioural techniques may reduce deviant arousal.

Antisocial personality orientation is another factor consistently identified with sexual reoffence. He is diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. … There is therefore need to continually address personality function as part of any ongoing treatment process.

…

Substance use is prominent in this case with dependent levels of consumption of at least three difference substances. He reports being intoxicated for the offences. Substance use may serve to disinhibit underlying deviant sexual arousal. The offences are not consistent with intoxication alone due to the similarity across time and for the index offence the level of sexual arousal displayed.""


	
	Dr Ellis concluded that the defendant ""would fall into a group of persons with a risk for serious sexual offending that is statistically high in frequency and of a type with serious consequences and greater than a theoretical average offender"". Dr Ellis recommended ""specific treatment and supervision"" in order to reduce this risk.
	


Conclusion as to making an order


	
	Having reviewed all of the material I am satisfied that Mr King is a ""sex offender"" within the meaning of that term in s 4 of the Act: he is over the age of 18 and he has been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction for a ""serious sex offence"", namely sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10, contrary to s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	I am satisfied, that he is also a ""high risk sex offender"" within the meaning of that term in s 5B. I accept the unchallenged expert opinions and am satisfied that there is a high degree of probability that Mr King poses an unacceptable risk of committing a ""serious sex offence"" (as defined in s 5(1)) if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Having regard to the experts’ support for the making of an extended supervision order I propose to accede to the application. It remains to determine the following issues.
	


Duration


	
	Detailed submissions were made by both counsel as to the suitable duration of an order. The State's position was that a period of five years was appropriate and was supported by the two court-appointed psychiatrists. The defendant contended that a determination should be made as to what was the minimum period to achieve the objects of the Act. It was submitted that the outcome should be an order of 3 years duration.
	
	
	I accept that subjecting a person to an extended supervision order is to impose severe restrictions upon his or her personal liberty. However, I do not accept that the question is one of determining the ""minimum period"" but rather one of determining a period which is reasonable and appropriate, based upon the evidence and bearing in mind the objects of the Act set out in s 3: to ensure the safety and protection of the community (""the primary object"") and to encourage offenders to undertake rehabilitation (""another object"").
	
	
	The evidence included the following opinion expressed by Dr O'Dea:
	


“Mr King’s risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community, and of committing a further serious sex offence in the community, is likely to be long term, and of at least 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate risk management program implemented should be long term and at least of 5 years duration, and should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”


	
	Dr Ellis' view of the appropriate term of an order was as follows:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective a period of five years is considered reasonable in order to improve function in the community, and refine the appraisal of risk. Paraphilias are chronic, relapsing conditions and resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts. His comorbid psychiatric conditions of personality and substance use impact upon likely treatment and supervision response. It is most likely that a period of 24 months will be required to secure stable independent accommodation, maintain a stable mental state and regular meaningful activity both occupational and social in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. A further 36 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with regular review of medication, such as antidepressants, anticraving medication and antilibidinals should they be prescribed would be necessary. The psychological program should focus on methods for controlling deviant sexual arousal. This period is estimated based on his current mental state, paraphilia, personality disorder and current attitudes to supervision that will be unlikely to change in the short term.”


	
	I accept those opinions. I propose to make an order for a period of five years.
	


Conditions


	
	Mr Johnson, counsel for the defendant, made submissions addressing the appropriateness of a number of conditions proposed by the State. The State agreed that some of them could be deleted. It remains for me to determine the appropriateness of those which were pressed by the State.
	
	
	Beech-Jones J recently observed in State of New South Wales v Burns [2014] NSWSC 1014:
	


""[59] In determining whether it is appropriate to include a particular condition, it is necessary to have regard to the fact that the effect of their inclusion is to expose the relevant offender, in this case Mr Burns, to criminal sanctions if they are breached. It follows that a proper basis needs to be demonstrated for including the conditions in the first place (see State of New South Wales v Ali [2010] NSWSC 1045 at [88] per Johnson J). Usually it will be necessary for such a condition to be related to the mitigation of the unacceptable risk that led to the formation of the conclusion of the relevant offender as a high risk sex offender.""


	
	Mr Johnson, counsel for the defendant, reminded me of what I had said in State of NSW v Green (Final) [2013] NSWSC 1003:
	


""[36] Ms Mathur submitted on behalf of Mr Green that any conditions attaching to the order ought to specifically address issues relevant to currently identified risk factors in relation to future offending. Further, it was submitted that the conditions should be limited to addressing conduct regarding the risk of future serious sex offences as opposed to criminal offending generally.

[37] It was acknowledged that the primary object of the Act was concerned with ensuring the safety and protection of the community. But the other object of the Act specified in s 3 was to encourage offenders to undertake rehabilitation. Accordingly, it was submitted that conditions ought not be imposed that are unjustifiably onerous or simply punitive.

[38] I accept those submissions.""

Unauthorised persons not permitted in defendant's home


	
	The State proposes a number of conditions under the heading ""Part B Accommodation"". They include that he must live at an address approved by his Departmental supervising officer; obey all reasonable instructions if he is in a residential facility; not stay overnight elsewhere unless with prior approval; permit visits by supervisors; and, if directed, obey a curfew. The condition to which objection is taken is:
	


3. The defendant must not permit any person to enter and remain, or to stay overnight, at the defendant's approved address, without the prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer.


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that this should be limited to persons under the age of 18. There is little, if any, cause for concern about the defendant's potential for offending against adults. This condition would impede his ability to form pro-social friendships with adults, such as neighbours. For example, it would prohibit an impromptu invitation to a neighbour to come into his home for a cup of tea.
	
	
	Counsel for the State indicated the condition was directed at reducing the potential for unhealthy peer associations, particularly in the context of concerns about the connection between the defendant’s drinking, substance abuse and sexual activity generally.
	
	
	Mr Johnson's rejoinder was that there are already conditions prohibiting alcohol and drug use as well as a condition prohibiting contact with any person nominated by his supervisor.
	
	
	There was some discussion at the hearing of the matter last week about whether this condition could be relaxed after some passage of time in circumstances where the concern that prompted the State to press for its inclusion had sufficiently abated. The upshot was a proposed ""Note"" included after condition A4: that the defendant's supervisors had discretion to adjust the manner in which conditions are implemented and enforced.
	
	
	At least theoretically, criminal sanctions may follow breach of a condition and someone may take a different view to a supervisor as to whether they should be pursued. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the inclusion of the ""Note"" will suffice. I accept the submissions of the State as to the need for condition B3 to be included but I propose including the following words, found in a number of other proposed conditions, to have the effect that the condition applies only for so long as it is deemed necessary, namely ""if directed by the Departmental supervising officer"".
	


Adult accompaniment when attending certain places


	
	Part C of the proposed conditions provides for place and travel restrictions. Condition 4 prohibits the defendant attending places such as schools, cinemas, children's playgrounds and the like without prior permission and without an approved adult accompanying him. The defendant opposed the requirement for an adult to accompany him because, apart from an aunt and uncle, he has no support network in Sydney (he derives from a country location). Counsel also pointed to the general requirement for the defendant to give notice and obtain prior approval for his movements.
	
	
	In response, the State proposed an amendment to this requirement by adding the words ""if directed"". Counsel maintained that the condition was necessary but that this amendment would give the supervising officer some discretion after an assessment of any risk that might attach to the place the defendant sought to attend.
	
	
	There is proposed a general requirement (in Part A condition 3) that the defendant must comply with all reasonable directions given by a supervisor. I do not see that the condition that he be accompanied by an adult if his supervisor directs is any more onerous than compliance with that overarching condition. The condition, as amended, should be included for the sake of clarity.
	


Control over business and financial affairs


	
	Conditions 5 to 7 in Part D relate to a variety of financial and business affairs in which the defendant might engage and prohibits any such engagement ""without prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer"".
	
	
	The defendant opposed these conditions upon the basis that they were unnecessary as they did not address issues relevant to currently identified risk factors in relation to future serious sex offending.
	
	
	Counsel for the State submitted that these conditions were ""part of the mechanism of holistic rehabilitation of the offender"" and were aimed at assisting him after a lengthy period of incarceration. More specifically, they were included in recognition of the risk of alcohol and substance abuse when surplus income was available, noting the link between past offending and such abuse. It was also submitted that these conditions would assist in monitoring the defendant's relationships and associations.
	
	
	I accept the concern that prompts the State to press for inclusion of these conditions. But there is also merit in the submissions for the defendant. I have come to the view that the purposes of the State would be served, and the rather draconian nature of the proposed conditions ameliorated, if they were modified so as not to prohibit the nominated activities but require the defendant to inform his supervisor with 48 hours if he engages in any of them and provide such details as the officer may require.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	


1.   Pursuant to s 5C and s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 the defendant is subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order for a period of five years expiring on 16 August 2020.

2.   Pursuant to s 11 of the Act the defendant is directed for the period of the order to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule to the order.

3.   The plaintiff is permitted to provide the reports of Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Jeremy O’Dea in these proceedings to:

(a)   any psychiatrist and psychologist involved in treating and/or counselling the defendant;

(b)   Community Corrections officers involved in the defendant’s supervision.

		17 February 2015",2015-02-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765871,R v Beattie [2015] NSWSC 394,"Judgment


	
	By way of a notice of motion of 16 February 2015, the solicitor for the accused sought to have the trial date of 2 March 2015 vacated. An affidavit in support of that motion, sworn to by the solicitor for the accused on the same date, explained the basis and the background of that application.
	
	
	The matter came before me for the usual pre-trial mention that I conduct in all pending trials yesterday. The agent of the solicitor for the accused then appeared and filed that motion and affidavit in Court. Because of the urgency of the matter, I had the matter listed before me at 9.30 this morning, and also ensured that the accused could be present.
	
	
	I received helpful oral submissions from the solicitor for the accused explaining the background in more detail. As well as that, the Crown Prosecutor explained, having read an affidavit of his instructing solicitor, that the Crown position in a nutshell is that the trial should proceed, subject to the Crown's interests not being prejudiced.
	
	
	It became clear that the basis of the motion was three matters. First, that at this stage no counsel has been briefed, and that preferred counsel, who has had some involvement in the matter over many months, appears to be unavailable.
	
	
	Secondly, that the trial could well give rise to an issue of the effects of intoxication on the accused, in particular with regard to the formation of one of the requisite mental elements for the offence of murder, and no toxicologist has been qualified.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was explained that there could well be an issue about medical causation, and so far no forensic pathologist or physician has been qualified.
	
	
	In discussions between Bench and Bar table, it came to be the joint position that, although difficult, it would be possible (if it be the case that preferred counsel is truly unavailable, and enquiries will be made in that regard urgently) to obtain either a silk or a senior junior, experienced in criminal law, and sufficiently qualified to conduct a murder trial within the time remaining.
	
	
	It also became the view of the solicitor for the accused that again, although difficult, he would be able to obtain a report from a forensic pathologist or physician with regard to the question of medical causation. That would especially be the case if, first, the Crown assisted in that regard; and, secondly, if I were open to ordering short service of any subpoenas with regard to medical records of the deceased. I expressed my readiness to do so in appropriate circumstances, and the Crown Prosecutor made it clear that, of course, his office would do everything it could to assist the solicitor for the accused in finding the appropriate expert.
	
	
	The third and final question again was accepted as having been resolved, in that the affidavit of the instructing solicitor of the Crown Prosecutor has made it clear that her own enquiries reveal that two toxicologists, who are appropriately qualified, are available to provide a report in time for the trial. The solicitor for the accused is content with the proposition that he could qualify one and, if necessary, the Crown would qualify the other.
	
	
	It was after that discussion, and after he had had a chance to confer with his client confidentially, using the courtroom as an informal AVL conference room, that the solicitor for the accused indicated that the motion was no longer pressed.
	
	
	For those reasons I do not think I need to set out the chronology of the matter. Nor do I need to say anything about the importance of it being appreciated by the profession that, when a murder allegation is listed for trial, in my view unless something exceptional occurs it will proceed on that trial date.
	
	
	I accept that the resolution of this matter that has been reached today will undoubtedly place urgency and pressure upon the solicitor for the accused over the next two weeks. But it is common in the weeks leading up to important litigation for one to be busy and pressured.
	
	
	As well as that, the solicitor for the accused has been involved in the matter for some months. He is an accredited specialist in this area and, of course, he is a member of the Legal Aid Serious Crime Panel, and experienced in criminal law as a result. I am respectfully confident that, working diligently, the solicitor for the accused will be able to have the matter ready for trial, and to represent the interests of the accused quite appropriately. I think the same may be said of the Crown Prosecutor, who is an experienced member of the Bar, and a specialist in criminal law of longstanding.
	
	
	For abundant caution, in light of the fact that counsel will be briefed very shortly, and he or she may identify legal issues that were not identified yesterday and that should be determined before the jury is empanelled, I think it appropriate that the trial date's listing for the Monday be confirmed, but that the jury panel be called not before Tuesday 3 March 2015.
	
	
	In light of the motion not having been pressed, I simply make the following orders:
	



	
	The notice of motion of the accused of 16 February 2015 is dismissed on the basis that it is no longer pressed.
	
	
	The trial date of 2 March 2015 is confirmed.
	
	
	The jury panel will not be called before 3 March 2015.

		09 April 2015",2015-02-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765874,R v Matthews [2015] NSWSC 49,"Remarks on sentence


	
	On 3 October 2014 the offender pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Scott Miller on 22 February 2011. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Before dealing with the facts surrounding the death of the deceased it is necessary to say something about the history of the matter.
	
	
	The offender was first charged with the murder of the deceased. The indictment was laid on 2 April 2013. The offender stood trial before Matthews AJ and a jury at a trial that commenced on 2 April 2013 and concluded on 16 April 2013. On that latter date the offender was found guilty of murder.
	
	
	On 27 May 2013 the offender was sentenced by Matthews AJ to a non-parole period of 11 years commencing 19 September 2011 and expiring 18 September 2022 with a balance of term of five years expiring 18 September 2027: R v Matthews [2013] NSWSC 659.
	
	
	An appeal against his conviction was brought to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 8 August 2014 that Court allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction for murder, directed a verdict of acquittal on the charge of murder and directed a new trial on the charge of manslaughter: Matthews v R [2014] NSWCCA 151.
	
	
	On 17 September 2014 the offender was indicted that he did unlawfully kill the deceased. At the first Arraignments List after that date on 3 October 2014 the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
	


Background facts


	
	The following facts concerning the offence are largely taken from a Statement of Agreed Facts.
	
	
	On 19 February 2011 the offender went to the Courthouse Hotel, at Taylor Square, at about 8.30am or 9.00 am. He was joined an hour or so later by Jayson Bell. He left the hotel later that morning and took his son for lunch at Chinatown. In evidence at the trial before Matthews AJ the offender estimated that he would have drunk three or four schooners of beer during the course of the morning. After lunching with his son, he returned to the hotel, at about 2.00 pm, and remained there until 6.30 pm. During that time he was again talking to Jayson Bell. He was also gambling on the horses, and consumed six to eight schooners of full strength beer. He described himself as ""drunk, but not overly drunk"". At 6.30 pm Mr Bell told him that he was going home for a meal, and the offender also decided to leave and go to his own home.
	
	
	Scott Miller, the deceased, came to the Courthouse Hotel earlier that afternoon. He was sitting in the courtyard area at the front of the hotel when Mr. Bell and the offender passed him on their way home. Mr Miller and Mr. Bell were close friends, and lived in the same apartment block in Surry Hills. Mr. Bell told the offender that he was going home, and suggested that he come too.
	
	
	In Hoeben CJ at CL’s judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal his Honour noted an incident the prior evening which helps to put what follows into some context. His Honour said at [6]:
	


The following matters appear to be uncontroversial. The applicant and the deceased were acquainted with each other as they had a number of mutual friends. There seems to have been underlying tension between them. The evening before the killing, an incident took place at the Courthouse Hotel at Taylor Square. The deceased apparently had “issues with money“, having previously been a problem gambler. On this occasion, the applicant was openly displaying a large amount of cash. The deceased said to him “Stop throwing it around. I don’t need to see it“. The applicant responded “Mind your own business, I can do what I want“. The incident ended there but it seems to have left an impression on both of them.


	
	After they left the hotel, Mr Bell and the offender then continued to walk south along the pedestrian extension of Bourke Street, until they were near the front of Kinsella's Hotel. At about that point Mr Miller came up to the offender and, according to Mr. Bell, said words to the effect of, ""What is your problem? What have I done? I've done nothing to you."" He then moved a short distance away. The offender said to Mr Bell: ""I don't like this bloke.""
	
	
	Shortly after that verbal confrontation a physical fight started between the offender and Mr Miller, with punches being thrown on both sides. The fight moved from the initial location near the front of Kinsella's Hotel, east towards Flinders Street, and then south, along the side of a building known as ""T2"". During the course of the fight Mr Miller was seen to punch the offender to the ground. As the fight progressed the offender punched Mr Miller to the head several times. Mr Miller fell back, hitting his head on the iron railing of a pedestrian fence before falling to the ground.
	
	
	Friends of the men, who had seen the fight from their positions at Kinsella's Hotel and the Courthouse Hotel, intervened and tried to break up the altercation. Some people who had intervened, dragged the offender away from where Mr Miller was lying on the ground. Mr Miller was bleeding from an eye, the mouth and ears. Witnesses called out for the assistance of police and an ambulance.
	
	
	Police officers happened to be in the vicinity, attending to an unrelated incident at the intersection of Bourke and Campbell Streets. These police responded to the call for help. Police chased the offender down a laneway but he avoided them and ran away from the area.
	
	
	An ambulance attended the scene and assistance was rendered to Mr Miller. The ambulance officer could not locate a pulse. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation was commenced on Mr Miller and he was conveyed to St Vincent's Hospital at Darlinghurst. On admission to the hospital, he was found to be suffering from a Grade 5 subarachnoid haemorrhage.
	
	
	Mr Miller’s condition deteriorated and he was pronounced ""brain dead"" on 21 February 2011. On 22 February 2011, ""life support"" was withdrawn and he died on 22 February 2011.
	
	
	Dr S Wills, Forensic Pathologist, found that the cause of death was acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. He found that there was a ruptured vertebral artery aneurysm. A CT scan revealed a 7mm diameter vertebrobasilar aneurysm. Subsequent neuropathological examination confirmed a basal subarachnoid haemorrhage originating from a ruptured saccular aneurysm at the dorsal aspect of the junction of the left vertebral artery with the basiliar artery.
	
	
	Dr Wills gave evidence at the trial that Mr Miller died from an acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. He said that an antecedent cause was a ruptured vertebral artery aneurysm. He explained that an aneurysm is a weakness in the wall of an arterial vessel which can burst, causing a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Some people are born with a propensity to them. They are also referred to as a 'berry aneurysm'. The vast majority of these spontaneous ruptures can happen in someone's sleep. They can be caused by straining to go to the toilet. Most of the time they occur without any particular preceding event. In the vast majority of cases the subarachnoid haemorrhage has nothing to do with assault or trauma, but in a small proportion of cases there is a link to trauma. In this case Dr Wills said that he could not separate how much was caused by direct physical trauma and how much was caused by changes to blood pressure.
	
	
	On the morning of 23 February 2011, police executed a search warrant at the offender's home. He was not at the premises. On the afternoon of 23 February 2011, the offender surrendered himself to police at the Sydney Police Centre. He declined to be interviewed by the police, and was later charged in relation to the matter.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The offender submitted that the basis for the manslaughter should be an unlawful and dangerous act in the context of a congenital weakness of the deceased unknown to the offender. I accept that submission.
	
	
	It is not clear how the fight started nor who was responsible for it. The accounts of the various witnesses are set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in the Court of Criminal Appeal. No finding can be made, even on the balance of probabilities let alone beyond reasonable doubt, about who punched whom first and what provocation may have preceded the fight beyond the exchange I have set out at [11] above. What does seem clear, however, is that the offender had the opportunity to walk away after he had been knocked to the ground by Mr Miller. He chose, however, to continue the altercation in circumstances where (as I shall refer presently) he should never have consumed alcohol nor been in the position of assaulting someone.
	
	
	The fight took place in a public place where other people were in fact present. That is a matter of some seriousness as has been emphasised in cases such as R v Grenenger [1999] NSWSC 380 at [13], Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [47] and approved recently in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [101]. Against that is the fact that, unlike Loveridge and similar cases, the deceased here was not the victim of a random attack. He and the offender were known to each other, there were obviously issues between them, and it is not clear who started the altercation which led to punches being thrown.
	
	
	I note further the observations of Matthews AJ at [17] that without the peculiar vulnerability Mr Miller had it is probable he would have suffered no permanent injuries from the fight. Her Honour noted that, apart from the effects of the brain haemorrhage, the injuries suffered by Mr Miller consisted of three areas of facial bruising consistent with the application of blunt force, as well as bruising on the upper limbs, particularly the hands and fingers. Those latter injuries are consistent with punches inflicted by him on the offender.
	
	
	Taking these matters into account I consider that the objective seriousness of the offending was a little below the mid-range.
	


Plea


	
	On 5 December 2011 counsel then appearing for the offender wrote to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions indicating that he had instructions that the offender would plead guilty to manslaughter. That offer was declined on 16 December 2011. A committal hearing took place on 13 June 2012 and the offender was committed for trial.
	
	
	I have noted already that the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the first Arraignments List after the matter had been sent back for trial on that charge by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	It seems to me, therefore, that the offer to plead guilty to the present offence charged was made at the earliest opportunity, and the offender is entitled to a discount of 25% for its utilitarian value.
	


Subjective features


	
	The offender was born on 10 October 1974. At the time of the offence he was aged 36 years and he is now 40 years old.
	
	
	He had a very disadvantaged upbringing. He never knew his biological father. His mother was an alcoholic who was frequently violent towards him. He was sexually abused at the age of 14 years by an older woman which was a source of shame and embarrassment to him.
	
	
	He claims to have been assaulted by the principal of Fort Street Public School where he attended to Year 5. He had learning difficulties at school including struggling to read and write. He moved from Balmain Christian Brothers to Glebe High School in Year 8 because of behavioural problems. He left school at Year 8 having been kicked out of home. He associated with negative peers who influenced him to drink alcohol and smoke cannabis. He was an angry child who was prone to aggression.
	
	
	He has had a lengthy history of heavy drinking from the age of 16-17 years. In his mid to late 20s he was drinking what he described as “massive amounts” to the point of being very intoxicated. He was dependent on alcohol between 2008 and 2010. He knew that drinking made him more prone to being “triggered”. It made him angry and aggressive and led to fighting. He had been under the care of Dr John Roberts, a psychiatrist and Mr Peter Walker, a psychologist, in an endeavour to address his alcohol and mood problems. He had been treated with Campral, Naltrexone and Antabuse for a few months but had relapsed into drinking.
	
	
	He had also engaged in heavy cannabis use from the age of 14 until 25 years of age. He also used cocaine on a recreational basis.
	
	
	He has had three serious relationships and has had children with each of his former partners. At the time of the offence he was, and now, is in a relationship with his third partner who has a severely disabled daughter.
	
	
	After he was placed into custody for the present offence his 16 year old son committed suicide. Prior to that the offender had only recently become close to his son.
	
	
	In 2001 he was hit with a bottle in the face and stabbed in Woolloomooloo during an attempted armed robbery. He suffered a punctured lung.
	
	
	When he was drinking at the Shakespeare Hotel in Surry Hills in 2007 a man picked up a knife and stabbed him in the neck. Both of these incidents have caused him to suffer from high levels of anxiety as well as symptoms of depression.
	
	
	Both Dr Furst and Dr Olav Nielssen, who also examined him, considered that the offender suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arising from the incidents in 2001 and 2007. Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as suffering from Substance Abuse Disorder with Dr Furst considering he suffered alcohol dependence and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal record commences in December 1988 when he was 14 years of age. Although a number of offences on his record are property offences and relatively minor drug offences, his record in New South Wales also contains a number of offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a number of contraventions of Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders. In respect of three convictions for offences of personal violence he has been sentenced to periods of imprisonment. His record in Victoria also contains convictions for assault in respect of which he was imprisoned. That he has been convicted of these offences involving personal violence is a matter of aggravation. His record generally disentitles him to leniency.
	
	
	Of some significance is the fact that at the time of the present offence the offender was subject to an Intensive Correction Order that commenced on 16 December 2010 for two offences of shoplifting and an offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence. It was a condition of the Intensive Correction Order that the offender was not to consume alcohol. That order was imposed only two months before the events which led to Mr Miller’s death.
	
	
	It is a matter of aggravation that the offender was on conditional liberty and the more so when alcohol was clearly of significance in the present offending and his conditional liberty forbade him from consuming alcohol. The matter is compounded because, as Matthews AJ found at [28] of her Remarks on Sentence, the offender’s capacity to control his anger is directly and negatively linked with the amount of alcohol he has consumed. That is also my conclusion from reading the reports of the psychiatrists and psychologist who have examined him. For example, the offender told Dr Furst that he knew that drinking alcohol was more prone to make him angry and aggressive.
	


Remorse and rehabilitation


	
	The Crown submitted that the offender showed no remorse at least at the time of the offence because he fled the scene. The offender’s Senior Counsel submitted that there was no evidence that the offender had any idea when he left the scene that Mr Miller had suffered life-threatening injuries. However, the agreed facts state,
	


Some people who had intervened, dragged the offender away from where the deceased was lying on the ground. He was bleeding from an eye, the mouth and ears.


	
	Moreover, the offender was chased by the police but evaded them. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew at that time that Mr Miller had been seriously injured in the fight as a result of punches thrown by the offender which caused Mr Miller to fall to the ground. He knew, therefore, that he had likely committed an offence. Yet, he did not go to the police station until four days later and after police had executed a search warrant at his home.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. I accept the Crown’s submission that he showed no remorse at the time. The first time I can find any remorse is when he went to the police station.
	
	
	The offender has, however, subsequently expressed remorse for his actions to both Dr Furst and the psychologist Dr Milic. Although I am able to give less weight to expressions of remorse given to doctors and others but not to the Court directly (see Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [18] and Pfitzner v R [2010] NSWCCA 314 at [33]), I do not think that in the present case I should do that. Having read what he said to the doctors in the context of the loss of his own son shortly after these events, I consider that the offender has for some time been genuinely remorseful for his actions because he understands the loss which Mr Miller’s parents must have experienced and continue to experience.
	
	
	Each of Mr Miller’s parents read a victim impact statement to the Court. It is clear that each of them enjoyed a close relationship with their son. Their sense of loss is considerable. That loss was made worse because a decision had to be made to turn off the life support he was on when in St Vincent’s Hospital following the fight. The Crown asks me to take these statements into account pursuant to s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I consider that I should do so. I express again to Mr Miller’s parents and his family the Court’s sympathy for his untimely death.
	
	
	As far as the offender’s rehabilitation and his likely future offending is concerned, there was some evidence from Dr Furst and a counsellor Tracey Radford, who was seeing him during 2014, of improvement in the offender’s insight into his behaviour and particularly the relationship between his anxiety, his consumption of alcohol and his aggression. He acknowledged to both Dr Furst and Dr Milic that abstinence from alcohol after his release may be a challenge, and both of them thought that he would need professional help for some time after completion of his term of imprisonment. He said that he could not promise not to drink again. Whilst that might be a frank assessment by him it emphasises the likely problem with rehabilitation when he is back in the community.
	
	
	Dr Furst thought that the offender had a moderate risk of reoffending but that this could be safely managed in the community provided that he was abstinent from alcohol and drugs, and continued to participate in counselling and rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted in the light of decisions such as R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [55] and R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [58] that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation were poor and that protection of society militated against a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	From the reports of those who have examined and counselled the offender, I consider he has some realistic prospects of rehabilitation. I note his progress whilst in custody. I find special circumstances to justify a small adjustment to the statutory ratio, bearing in mind the offender’s criminal record to date and the need for protection of the community. He will require a greater period to deal with his need for alcohol when back in the community and to have his psychiatric problems adequately managed.
	
	
	I have read a number of references from people who speak positively of the influence he has had on young people through the Police and Community Youth Club and boxing. He is clearly capable of making a good contribution to the community if he can get a control on his drinking and drug-taking.
	


Deterrence


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal in Loveridge emphasised the significance of both general and specific deterrence in cases such as the present which involve a death after alcohol-fuelled violence. The Court said:
	


[214]   Two particular points emphasised in the United Kingdom cases have currency in this State as well.

[215]   Firstly, it is not meaningful to speak of one-punch or single-punch manslaughter cases as constituting a single class of offences. The circumstances of these cases vary widely and attention must be given to the particular case before the sentencing court.

[216] Secondly, the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place, is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence. The United Kingdom decisions involve statements of serious concern by the courts of the type expressed in this State in Hopley v R; R v Carroll and Pattalis v R concerning a similar form of violent offending.

[217] General deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the crime in question is a serious one, has been committed in a particularly grave form and its contemporary prevalence is the cause of considerable community disquiet: R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299.

[218] Additional considerations arise where an offender has a history of alcohol-fuelled violence, and where further offences of this type are committed whilst the offender is subject to conditional liberty. In such circumstances, specific deterrence is magnified as a factor to be taken into account on sentence.


	
	Further, in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 87 ALJR 1022 the majority said at [44]:
	


…[T]he inability [of the offender] to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.


	
	I have also had regard to what was said in Loveridge concerning the role of other sentencing decisions on sentence at [221]–[227].
	
	
	It is necessary to have some regard to the sentence imposed by Matthews AJ, although that sentence was imposed on the basis of the offending being “in the lower range of objective seriousness for murder”.
	
	
	The matters which make the present offence a serious one are the fact that it resulted from alcohol-fuelled violence committed in a public place by a person who had a most unsatisfactory record for violence in circumstances where he had recently been placed on conditional liberty with a requirement not to drink alcohol. Against that is the fact that the combatants were known to one another with prior issues between them rather than Mr Miller being an unsuspecting stranger, that it is not clear who started the fight, and that were it not for the fact that Mr Miller had the aneurysm the offender would probably have only been facing sentence for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	The offender’s senior counsel drew my attention to cases (Donaczy v R [2010] NSWCCA 143 and R v O’Hare [2003] NSWSC 652) which were said to provide some guidance as similar cases. He also drew my attention to Judicial Commission statistics for manslaughter sentences. Of all offences, statistics for sentencing for manslaughter are the least useful because of what Spigelman CJ referred to in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [133]-[134], that manslaughter is of a protean character, that a wide range of circumstances may constitute the crime and that matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter.
	
	
	Although of some assistance both Donaczy and O’Hare need to be read in the light of the statements in Loveridge to which I have made reference.
	
	
	I consider that the appropriate starting point is a sentence of 10 years. Taking into account a 25% discount for the early offer of a plea the offender should be sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 2 years 6 months. The offender has been in custody since 19 September 2011 related to this offence. The sentence should be backdated to that date.
	
	
	Mr Matthews, for the unlawful killing of Scott Miller on 22 February 2011 I sentence you to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 19 September 2011 and expiring 18 September 2016 with an additional term of 2 years 6 months expiring 18 March 2019.

2765876,R v Najem [2015] NSWSC 2108,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Michael Najem makes application for bail in relation to an offence of driving whilst suspended, a number of offences of break enter and steal, and a goods in custody offence. Those matters are due to be mentioned before the Sutherland Local Court on 3 March 2015.
	
	
	At the time of the alleged commission of those break and enter offences, and indeed the driving offence, the applicant was subject to conditional bail. He had been admitted to bail in relation to an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, and it appears that he was also subject to bail in relation to two counts of possessing a prohibited drug and one count of dealing with property the proceeds of crime. Those latter matters have now been dealt with by the imposition of s 9 bonds for a period of 18 months but at the time of the alleged commission of these matters they were outstanding and there was a grant of bail. It appears that there were at least two separate orders for bail that governed the applicant’s conduct, together with conditional liberty pursuant to sentence orders.
	
	
	On 12 September 2014 the applicant was convicted of an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, indeed two counts of that, and he was placed on s 9 bonds with respect to each for a period of 18 months. So there are, thus, two bonds and two sets of bail which applied as at the date of these alleged offences. This gives rise to the application of the show cause provisions under the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) and obliges the applicant to show cause why his detention is not justified.
	
	
	The applicant raises in support of that contention that the Crown case is not a strong case. It appears to rest, at least in part, upon the discovery of some items in a car associated with the applicant, certainly a car that he should not have been driving given the current suspension.
	
	
	The applicant asserts, through his lawyer, that the things found in his possession by the police had been in his possession prior to the commission of the alleged offences. That information, he says, is within the knowledge of police and that he had been stopped prior to these matters and the property in his vehicle noted by police officers. Additionally, he says that some of the property was physically marked with the initials of his son and he is in a position to prove his ownership of the items that the police have seized.
	
	
	Those competing versions of events are simply unable to be resolved by this Court, it is just not possible to know what the position is in relation to that property.
	
	
	The Crown says that there is some other evidence, including closed-circuit television footage, which places the applicant in the vicinity of the location of the crimes and thus strengthening the Crown’s case, but it is simply something that I cannot determine on the basis of the material before the Court and the competing claims as to that property.
	
	
	The applicant, additionally, relies upon his ill health. There is evidence before the Court in exhibit 1 to establish that he had a serious motor vehicle accident in March of last year and sustained very significant injuries including fractures to the spine and the ulna. He had surgical repair of those injuries by the insertion of metal pins but he is in a position, he says, where he has ongoing pain and he has had no pain relief since his admission to custody on 12 January 2015, and indeed he has not even had the provisions of items of bedding such that his pain might be alleviated.
	
	
	That, obviously, is a matter of significant concern. Any person in the care of the Corrective Services Department, whether they are a sentenced prisoner or a prisoner held on remand, has to have access to appropriate and proper medical treatment and if that is not occurring then that would appear to be a dereliction of the duty that the Department has to adequately care for inmates. That would be a matter of concern to the Court. It is certainly a matter which is capable of being relied upon to discharge the onus in relation to showing cause why the applicant’s detention is not justified.
	
	
	If that information is accepted at face value, again it is not information that the Court can verify that I assume the Crown has had an opportunity to test. But if one assumes that that information is correct and the applicant is being held in circumstances where he is being denied access to necessary medical treatment, and denied access to appropriate conditions having regard to his medical issues, then it seems to me that that is something which would displace the discharge of the onus and show cause why his detention may not be or is not justified.
	
	
	If one then goes to the question of risk and whether there are risks that are not acceptable, or are unacceptable in the language of the statute, risks that may or may not be able to be addressed by conditions, one turns to the applicant’s criminal history.
	
	
	He was, as has been noted, on both a number of s 9 bonds and at least two sets of bail at the time of the alleged commission of these offences. He has a relatively lengthy criminal history dating back to 1999. There are offences relating to drugs, driving-related offences. More troublingly, there are offences which establish that the applicant has in the past, and indeed in the recent past, ignored court orders issued against him to regulate his conduct with respect to named individuals. He has convictions for the contravention of apprehended domestic violence orders and that is demonstrative of an attitude of disregard for an order of the Court.
	
	
	The applicant is able, if released to bail, to live with his family at an address at Hurstville. That is the address at which he was living at the time of the alleged commission of these matters and, in light of that, it does not greatly address the issues as to the commission of further offences whilst at liberty. The applicant is hampered in being unable to offer any particular security to the Court by his custodial status. I infer from that that there is no person who is in a position, from the community, to act as a surety in relation to bail for the applicant. He could, of course, report on bail and that would provide at least some measure of supervision to any bail awarded the applicant.
	
	
	Weighing up the competing issues that the Court must consider, the applicant’s need to be at liberty, the likely delay in bringing these matters to a final disposition, which if they are dealt with summarily, and that is not certain but if they are, could be expected to be perhaps some months, if they are dealt with on indictment it could be as much as a year, one must consider that possible delay, coupled with the applicant’s interests to be at liberty principally so that he can obtain appropriate medical treatment, against matters connect with, on the objective evidence, his criminal history which suggests that he has in the past shown a level of disregard for the orders of a court.
	
	
	Whilst I think the applicant has discharged the onus and I think he has thus brought the Court to consider the question of whether risks are unacceptable or can be mitigated adequately, I am not persuaded that the risks can in fact be mitigated by the bail conditions that are proposed. It seems me that there is a significant risk of the commission of further offences whilst at bail and, having regard to the applicant’s criminal history, something more would be required to adequately address those risks.
	
	
	Accordingly, bail is refused.
	
	
	I ask that the Registrar take out a copy of my remarks and forward them to the superintendent of the facility at which the applicant is held, and additionally to the director of the Justice Health service, noting the applicant’s complaints as to the absence of any medical treatment afforded him and requesting and recommending that he be immediately given access to a doctor and assessed for such treatment and pain relief as he may need.

		13 September 2016",2015-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765890,Brown v R [2015] NSWCCA 11,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On the evening of 12 October 2010 Mr Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez was in his home at Russell Street, Mount Pritchard, together with his partner and another woman. He was accosted at his front door by the applicant, Carl Brown, and four other men. A fight ensued in the course of which Mr Ruiz-Sanchez was hit over the head by Samuel Lockett, with a shortened firearm. The gun was loaded and discharged when being used to belabour Mr Ruiz-Sanchez. The shot hit him in the head, killing him instantly. All five men were arrested and tried separately. Mr Lockett was convicted of murder; two other co-offenders entered pleas of guilty to manslaughter and a fourth co-offender was tried separately for manslaughter and acquitted. Mr Brown entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of murder, but was convicted. He was sentenced by Price J to imprisonment for 20 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years, 9 months.
	
	
	Mr Brown (the applicant) sought leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence. The appeal against conviction was pressed on two grounds. Ground 3 was a specific complaint concerning the direction given to the jury with respect to the availability of a verdict of guilty of manslaughter as an alternative to murder. It will be convenient to address that ground first. Ground 1 requires this Court to assess the evidence available to the jury which the applicant challenges as insufficient to justify a conviction for murder. In the language of the Criminal Appeal Act [1]  it is said that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. This ground requires leave. [2] 
	
	
	The sentence is challenged on the basis that the culpability of the applicant was less than that of Mr Lockett, who was directly responsible for the death of Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, but who was sentenced to a lesser term of 18 years imprisonment with a 13 year non-parole period. That appeal ground (ground 4) also requires leave.
	
	
	Given the seriousness of the offence, the fact that the grounds pressed are arguable and given the length of the sentence, the applicant should have leave to appeal with respect to grounds 1 and 4 and, to the extent necessary, ground 3. (Ground 2 was not pressed.) Nevertheless, for the reasons set out below, the appeals against both conviction and sentence should be dismissed.
	


Background circumstances


	
	About a week before his death Mr Ruiz-Sanchez sold a handgun to the applicant for $600. The applicant took the gun, promising to pay the following day. When he did not do so, the deceased rang him on a number of occasions and left a number of messages on his voicemail, which the applicant considered insulting. The applicant had two sisters, Donna, who lived in Canley Vale, and Jasmine, who lived next door to the deceased. On the day of the assault, the applicant and a number of friends were drinking at Donna’s home. In his police interview the applicant said that he had spoken to Jasmine’s husband who told him that there were “10 blokes” drinking next door with Mr Ruiz-Sanchez. He stated that, “As the day’s progressed we’ve got a bit fucken, got a bit of alcohol into us…”. [3]  They decided to drive to the home of Jasmine. On the way the applicant collected a shotgun from the house of another friend. The applicant carried the gun in the car. [4]  He then took the firearm into Jasmine’s house, placing it on a table in the lounge room. [5]  He said it was wrapped in a jumper. [6]  After a failed attempt to obtain the drug MDMA, the applicant gave the gun to one of his friends and said “… hold this, I want to go over next door and fucken have a couple of words with this bloke.” [7] 
	
	
	The five men walked across to the deceased’s home, the applicant calling him by name, at which stage Mr Ruiz-Sanchez came out of his front door. At some stage the man who was carrying the shotgun, identified as Ritchie, transferred it to Samuel Lockett. A fist fight commenced with one of the applicant’s friends hitting Mr Ruiz-Sanchez in the face. The autopsy revealed cuts and contusions on his face. He fought back, at one stage securing one of his assailants in a head lock. The applicant described Lockett as hitting the deceased about three times on the top of the head with the barrel of the shorn-off shotgun. [8]  (Although there was evidence from another witness – a woman inside the home – supporting the account of multiple hits, and from the applicant who said he told Mr Lockett to desist in the course of belabouring the victim with the gun, the trial judge sentenced on the basis of only one hit to the top of the head with the barrel.) The gun discharged accidently, killing Mr Ruiz-Sanchez instantly. The five men ran; the gun was returned to the person from whom it had been obtained.
	
	
	The applicant told police that the gun was jointly owned, was “always loaded” and further that he checked to see that the gun was loaded when he collected it. [9]  When asked, “Did any of your friends know that it was loaded” said that “everyone knew it was loaded.” [10] 
	
	
	The applicant was asked “What was your reason for having a loaded firearm there?” [11]  The following response and exchange then took place:
	


“A   If, if shit happened, if shit happened with Wally, if shit happened.

Q371   What would you have done with it if it did happen?

A   I would have fired it, I suppose. If, if it happened, what, that’s, you’re going beyond the point, like, you’re going beyond, like it’s, it wasn’t, wasn’t intentional, I did not go there intentionally to shoot Wally.

Q372    My question to you is, why would you take a loaded firearm to that house? That’s why I’m …

A   Because Wally was being making threats to me on the phone about not paying him. Damo [the applicant’s brother-in-law] called me up earlier that day, he said, ‘Ten people are there, watch out.’ But like I said, I had nothing to do with that, I went there to go buy drugs. But on the same time as I was going through I thought, all right, I’m going to go buy drugs, I better take that with me just in case the ten people at Wally’s house which I, where that I know, I know they had firearms. If they fucken try do anything, I’m not going to be fucken sitting there, like, with no firearm when I’m just going to visit my sister next door over six hundred bucks, you know what I mean.”


	
	The applicant’s description of the fight to the police included the following elements, namely (a) the first punches were thrown by Mr Lockett; (b) the applicant himself was actively involved in punching the deceased; (c) there was a pause in the punching and it was following the resumption that Lockett hit the deceased on the head with the barrel of the shotgun and, (d) it was in the course of Lockett hitting him over the head that the shotgun went off and the deceased was killed.
	
	
	Although the applicant said that the deceased had been “making threats to me on the phone about not paying him”, the only evidence of the content of the telephone messages was given by the deceased’s partner, Ms Knaggs, who overheard the deceased leaving voice messages and speaking on the phone. She gave evidence to the following effect: [12] 
	


“Wallace tried to call several times. He wouldn’t answer. Wal would leave voice messages and text messages. It was early in the morning, because me and Wallace were getting ready for work and it was Wal who rang and Carl answered – I guess it was between five and six in the morning. We were in the bedroom, because Wallace was on the phone and I could only hear his responses … and Wallace was saying things like, ‘You want to be a gangster, you can’t even answer your phone,’ and I heard Wallace say, ‘I don’t want to fight you, that will get me into trouble. I only want the money.’ ”


	
	In her account of the confrontation, which she witnessed from inside the screen door, she said: [13] 
	


“Carl Brown had a drink bottle in his hand. He was pointing at Wallace and he was saying, ‘You want to leave smart arse … messages on the phone, I’ll show you who a gangster is.’ … They were all – Carl kept saying, ‘You want to leave smart arse messages.’”


	
	Ms Knaggs then gave evidence that she left the door and went to get a phone to call for help. Her evidence continued:
	


“As I left the door, Carl said, ‘Who’s your missus going to call? If she calls anyone I’ll shoot you.’ He said, ‘If your missus calls anyone I’ll shoot her.’”


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at his trial. The evidence of Ms Knaggs allowed for an inference that the applicant treated the phone messages as insulting, but not threatening. Counsel for the applicant did not suggest otherwise in this Court. [14] 
	


Directions with respect to joint criminal enterprise


	
	It was not the prosecution case that the applicant used the gun in the course of the confrontation, nor that he took part in the confrontation intending to kill the deceased. Rather the prosecution said that the applicant was party to an agreement that the deceased be assaulted. So far as the scope of the agreement was concerned, the prosecution case was put in the alternative. The first alternative involved an agreement to assault the deceased and to inflict on him grievous bodily harm, Lockett’s act in striking the deceased with the gun being done with such an intention. The alternative formulation was that the agreement did not extend to assault with intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, but a contemplation on the part of the applicant that such harm might occur.
	
	
	Directions were given to the jury with respect to the legal principles involved in joint criminal enterprises, including, in relation to the latter alternative, an “extended joint criminal enterprise”, in accordance with McAuliffe v The Queen. [15]  Although the directions were challenged by ground 2 in the notice of appeal, that ground was abandoned. A challenge was maintained, however, with respect to the availability of a manslaughter verdict, in the alternative to murder.
	
	
	It was not in doubt that the trial judge gave directions with respect to manslaughter where the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all the elements of murder. [16]  The direction commenced as follows:
	


“Where an accused is charged with murder, but where the Crown has failed to establish that Samuel Lockett’s act of hitting Mr Ruiz-Sanchez on the head with the gun was done with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, there is an alternative verdict available, and that is one of being guilty of manslaughter.”


	
	The judge then provided the jury with a written document setting out the elements of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, and took the jury through the document. [17]  It is not necessary to set out the full extent of the direction because the challenge is limited to a quite specific omission from what was said. In brief, the judge correctly directed the jury that the assault on the deceased would be an unlawful act and it would be a dangerous act if a reasonable person in the position of the assailant would have realised that the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. The direction continued:
	


“…if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Samuel Lockett deliberately hit the accused on the head with a gun, then the Crown has established an unlawful act. Whether it was also dangerous is for you to determine.

The Crown does not have to establish that Samuel Lockett’s act was done with any particular intention to injure. The offence of manslaughter is complete even if no injury was intended by him and even if Samuel Lockett had not realised he was exposing the deceased to such a risk of injury. The question is whether a reasonable person in the position of Samuel Lockett would have realised that he was exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury.”


	
	The applicant’s complaint was that the first paragraph of the direction [18]  failed to note that the applicant could be convicted of manslaughter, not merely if the prosecution failed to establish Lockett’s intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, but even in circumstances where the prosecution did establish such an intention. The direction as to manslaughter, the applicant submitted, was therefore deficient and misleading, resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	It is true that the selected paragraph referred to a failure to establish one specific element necessary for a conviction for murder. The alternative verdict could also have been available where, for example, Mr Lockett had had the necessary intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, but the act was not part of the joint criminal enterprise, nor within the contemplation of the applicant as a party to the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	In the course of the submissions on appeal it was put to counsel that the directions would have been adequate if they had either omitted any reference to the elements of murder which might not have been satisfied or if they had specified all of the elements, the complaint being that only one element was identified as a possible missing element. Those propositions were rejected, but it was by no means clear what alternative direction was proposed in either of those events. This was a matter of some importance, as no alternative direction had been proposed in the course of the trial. It appeared, however, that counsel sought a direction that even if the jury were satisfied that Mr Lockett were guilty of murder, the applicant could nevertheless be guilty only of manslaughter. That was true, but followed from the unchallenged directions as to the elements of the murder directions.
	
	
	How the additional statement would have clarified the situation was by no means clear. Immediately following the passage complained of, the trial judge had stated: [19] 
	


“I emphasise, members of the jury, that you cannot find the accused guilty of murder or manslaughter unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise and Samuel Lockett was also a party to that agreement. When you look at summing-up documents 2, 3 and 4 [being the written directions in respect of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise] – you will see that the first three essential legal elements set out in each document require the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a joint criminal enterprise with the accused and Samuel Lockett being parties to the agreement. If you consider that it is a reasonable possibility that a joint criminal enterprise did not exist, or that the accused was not a party to the agreement with Samuel Lockett, you must find the accused not guilty of both murder and manslaughter.”


	
	There followed specific directions with respect to the elements of manslaughter, about which no complaint is made.
	
	
	The applicant sought to derive support for his complaint from the reasoning of the High Court in The Queen v Nguyen. [20]  Nguyen involved a prosecution appeal from a judgment of the Victorian Court of Appeal setting aside the respondent’s conviction on the basis that it was “unsafe or unsatisfactory”. While upholding that ground, the Court of Appeal had rejected Mr Nguyen’s challenge to the directions given to the jury. The High Court overturned both aspects of the decision below. It found the Victorian Court of Appeal in error in concluding that verdicts of guilty were not reasonably open to the jury, but also in error in rejecting the ground alleging mis-direction. It is the latter aspect of the judgment which is presently relevant. The High Court stated: [21] 
	


“The effect of [the instructions to the jury] was to leave manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict against Dang Quang Nguyen [the applicant] only if Bill Ho [the person who shot the deceased] was guilty of that crime. If Bill Ho was found guilty of murder, no case of manslaughter was left for consideration by the jury in respect of Dang Quang Nguyen.”


	
	The relevant directions were complicated by the fact that Mr Ho had shot two victims, one of whom survived, while the other did not. With respect to the survivor, he was charged with attempted murder; with respect to the deceased, he was charged with murder. Dang Quang Nguyen was similarly charged. In the High Court, the prosecutor argued that “there was no viable case of manslaughter to be considered in relation to the count of murder”, but that depended upon the jury first deciding that Dang Quang Nguyen was guilty of attempted murder. [22]  The Court pointed out that the jury were not directed to consider the charges in any particular order. The reasons then stated:
	


“If Dang Quang Nguyen was party to an agreement, or had a contemplation, or provided assistance directed to some lesser assault than one intended to kill, it would have been open to the jury to conclude that, although he was not guilty of the charge of attempted murder, a verdict of manslaughter should be returned in respect of the count charging him with murder. The trial judge's directions did not admit of that possibility.”


	
	The legal principles are not in doubt: it is their application in the circumstances of the particular case, including the terms of any direction given, which needs to be addressed. In the present case, the alternative verdict of manslaughter was expressly left to the jury in terms which were unexceptionable. The alternative verdict was said to be available if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt “of all the elements of the murder – joint criminal enterprise or murder – extended joint criminal enterprise” in which case the jury were required to acquit the applicant on the charge of murder. That aspect of the direction was not challenged. What followed was the challenged paragraph which suggested that an alternative verdict of manslaughter might be available only in one circumstance, namely where the element of intention on the part of Mr Lockett was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The directions on manslaughter then identified the essential elements of that offence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant conceded that a lawyer would not be confused by the directions, but nevertheless a jury might be. That is a danger of which any trial judge must conscious; however, in the present case the possibility of confusion only arises by taking one sentence of the directions and viewing it in isolation. That is not the way the jury would hear the directions: the sentence should be read in context. Once that step is taken, there is no real possibility of confusion, or of the jury being misled. Ground 3 should be rejected.
	


Verdict unreasonable or not supported by the evidence


	
	Again, the legal principles are not in doubt: in considering this ground of appeal, this Court must consider whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant on the evidence before it at the trial. If this Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, it should acquit unless satisfied that the doubt is one which a jury could reasonably have resolved on the basis of their assessment of the witnesses. [23] 
	
	
	In the present case, the jury had the benefit of listening to the recording of the applicant’s interview with the police and heard the description of the events given by Ms Knaggs, in particular. It also had the benefit of listening to the evidence unfold in a manner not available to this Court. Nevertheless, for the reasons which follow this Court should be satisfied that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the relevant elements of the offence of murder, based on the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The circumstances of the confrontation, including its background, have been outlined above. The ultimate conclusion for which the applicant contended was that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt that the applicant contemplated one of the other men using the gun to hit the deceased, with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The basis of such a doubt was, it was submitted, to be found in the following propositions:
	


(a)   the applicant had no motive to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased;

(b)   the agreement was limited to the deceased being punched, even by a number of men, which would not involve contemplation of an act inflicting grievous bodily harm;

(c)   the gun was taken only for possible purposes of self-defence, and not to be used as a weapon of aggression.


	
	It was not explicitly suggested that, if the use of the gun as a weapon of aggression did fall within the contemplation of the parties, and particularly of the applicant, its accidental discharge would not have been contemplated. Given that the applicant knew that the gun was loaded and knew that it would be taken to the confrontation, such a submission would not have been plausible.
	
	
	It should be accepted, as the applicant submitted, that although he had identified in his police interview Mr Lockett hitting the deceased over the head three times with the barrel of the firearm, there was other evidence that he had only hit the applicant once and the trial judge in sentencing the applicant was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Lockett had struck the deceased more than once with the shotgun. [24]  The applicant was entitled to have the facts assessed on that basis.
	
	
	The assertion that the applicant (and presumably Mr Lockett) had “no motive to inflict grievous bodily harm” on the deceased is not a factor which should be accepted as carrying significant weight. The background to the incident was known: the applicant was angry about supposedly insulting messages received from the deceased, which appear to have called in question his willingness or ability to pay the price of the firearm he had purchased, or perhaps some other aspect of his self-image. There was no basis to doubt that he and his four supporters went to the deceased’s house intending to assault the deceased. Although it was said that the punching caused the deceased only minor injuries, the possibility that serious injury would be caused was undoubtedly contemplated as a real possibility and probably intended. The jury was entitled to infer from the presence of the five men that significant resistance was contemplated and that the gun was taken with the intention that it would be used if that were thought necessary. When the applicant collected the gun, there may have been a greater expectation that it would be used because the applicant then believed that Mr Ruiz-Sanchez had some 10 friends at his house. By the time that the five men decided to confront him, they believed that most of the deceased’s friends had departed and that there may have been only two men and two women present, in addition to the intended victim. Nevertheless, the loaded gun, which could have been left in the applicant’s sister’s house, was taken to the confrontation. When questioned by the police as to why he had the gun with him, he gave the somewhat confused answers set out above. [25]  The gun was not taken inadvertently, as shown by the applicant’s threat to Ms Knaggs, indicating an ability to shoot her.
	
	
	The applicant’s submission was that the gun was only taken to use in self-defence and the occasion to use it in self-defence did not arise. This analysis was not that which a reasonable jury would carry out in considering the scope of a joint criminal enterprise. Nor does the event in question bear a nice analysis as to whether what occurred was “self-defence”, as a matter of legal principle. The conclusion which was open to the jury was that the gun was taken to be used as a weapon in the event that significant resistance was encountered; the person carrying the gun being expected to know if and when it should be used and the manner in which it might be deployed. In my view, all that fell within the scope of the common purpose to which the applicant was a party; it was therefore contemplated that the gun might be used in the course of the attack on the deceased and that, if it were used, the possibility that it would be fired, whether deliberately or by accident, was expressly contemplated. It was well open to the jury to reach that conclusion on the criminal standard, on the material before them.
	
	
	The question is ultimately one of fact for this Court: I would have reached that conclusion, without entertaining a reasonable doubt as to its correctness. Accordingly, ground 1 should be rejected. The appeal against the conviction for murder must be dismissed.
	


Sentence appeal


	
	There was no suggestion that the sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive: rather, the submission was that the trial judge erred in assessing the relevant culpabilities of the applicant and Mr Lockett as equivalent.
	
	
	The trial judge, Price J, sentenced both the applicant and Mr Lockett. He gave explicit and contemporaneous consideration to the question of parity, both when sentencing Lockett [26]  and when sentencing the applicant. [27] 
	
	
	The trial judge reasoned that both were “equally culpable for the murder” and that the subjective circumstances justified a lesser sentence for Lockett. He explained the latter conclusion in the following terms: [28] 
	


“[Lockett's] criminal history does not disclose any previous convictions for offences involving violence whereas Brown had committed two offences of reckless wounding whilst in company in 2009. I have assessed Lockett to a limited extent to be remorseful, whereas no finding of remorse is made for Brown. Furthermore, I found that Lockett is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation whereas I was unable to make such a finding for Brown. In Lockett's case personal deterrence did not have a significant role to play, whereas for Brown more weight is given to personal deterrence and the protection of the community.”


	
	The focus of the applicant’s submissions was both the conclusion of equal culpability and the proposition noted by the trial judge that his counsel had not “submitted otherwise”. No doubt for that reason, he did not address the issues going to culpability in comparative terms in sentencing the applicant. However, when dealing with Mr Lockett, the trial judge stated: [29] 
	


“[35]   Both Mr Crown and Mr Smith submitted that when considering the parity principle, Brown's role in the commission of the offence was more than Lockett's. Mr Crown submitted that Brown was ‘the controlling mind’ who recruited the others into a violent and cowardly endeavour because of his ‘personal offended pride’ …. Mr Crown argued that his lesser degree of actual physical involvement was outweighed by his role that was instrumental in the deceased's death. Mr Smith referred to Brown's role as the leader of those engaged in the criminal enterprise.

[36]   Brown is to be sentenced on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise murder.

[37]   I am not persuaded that Brown's culpability for the murder is greater than Lockett's. Although it is true that Brown obtained the shotgun that he knew was loaded, had the relationship with the deceased and initiated the confrontation with him, it was the offender's extreme act of violence in striking the deceased on the head with the shotgun that caused the deceased's death. I assess them as being equally culpable for the murder.


	
	In addressing on sentence, counsel for the applicant noted that counsel for Mr Lockett and the prosecutor had canvassed “the unusual nature of the objective facts, generally.” [30]  He then said:
	


“What I have to address in relation to Mr Brown, the fact that he has a prior for violence and that he was on bail for that at the time of this offence. He’s on conditional liberty … certainly the fact he is on conditional liberty would have to be seen by your Honour as an aggravating feature. I can’t resile from that.”


	
	At what appeared to be the end of his submissions, the trial judge raised the question of parity. He stated in response: [31] 
	


“In relation to the question of parity, it is a matter with respect as to what differential your Honour finds, I would say in relation to two matters only; that is, the fact Mr Brown’s original dealings with Mr Sanchez that lead to this event, and whether, as one matter to be considered by your Honour, was strictly identical sentences or strict parity. And the other matter, obviously, that he was on conditional liberty at the time.”


	
	Although counsel made some further submissions, they did not expressly attempt to differentiate between Brown and Lockett on the question of moral culpability for the offending. Similarly, the submissions for the prosecutor were less than lucid on this point. The closest the prosecutor got to distinguishing the two was, having noted that Mr Lockett struck the blow which proved fatal but that a co-offender may be morally culpable for other reasons, in stating: [32] 
	


“He’s had greater culpability than Mr Lockett, despite the fact Mr Lockett directly inflicts the harm and the pain that went with what he did, but both of high order of culpability together.”


	
	Apparently in response to that submission, counsel for the applicant returned to a comparative description of the roles of the respective offenders. In this Court, it was said to be “implicit” in those submissions in reply that the applicant’s culpability was below that of Mr Lockett.
	
	
	It is not necessary to recount the submissions; there was no express submission that Mr Brown’s culpability was lower than Lockett’s. Read in context, the submissions are better understood as a response to the suggestion that Brown’s culpability may have been above that of Mr Lockett. It is quite likely that the trial judge obtained limited assistance from the submissions. There was certainly no express submission that Mr Brown’s culpability was lower. As is self-evident, the men played different roles: it was entirely open to the trial judge to conclude that they should be sentenced on the basis of an assessment of culpability which did not materially differ.
	
	
	In the absence of any identifiable error of the kind relied upon with respect to parity, the appeal against sentence must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant the applicant leave to appeal against his conviction for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez on 12 October 2010.

(2)   Dismiss the appeal.

(3)   Grant the applicant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for the murder.

(4)   Dismiss the appeal.


	
	McCALLUM J: As to ground 1, I share the conclusion reached by Basten JA as to the verdict. I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA, for the reasons stated by his Honour.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Basten JA.

		18 February 2015",2015-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765892,Taylor v R [2015] NSWCCA 12,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 11 April 2014 the applicant, Tracey Karen Taylor, was sentenced by Judge Frearson SC in the District Court on four counts of assault, two being common assaults and two being assaults occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Following a trial on five counts, to which the applicant pleaded not guilty, she was acquitted on count 2 but convicted by a jury on counts 1, 3, 4 and 5. The victim of the assaults, Louise O’Brien, was the daughter of a friend of the applicant. She lived with the applicant and her family for approximately three years and eight months from February 2005 until the last day she was seen alive, being 12 October 2008.
	
	
	It is appropriate to refer to Ms O’Brien by name. Although the law is generally protective of the identity, and hence the privacy, of children involved in criminal proceedings in any way, in some circumstances that protective purpose may have unacceptable consequences. As will be noted below, Ms O’Brien was subjected to degrading and humiliating treatment as a child, which continued after her death. To refer to her in this judgment merely as “the victim”, or otherwise anonymously, is to perpetuate the denial of her humanity. While there is a statutory prohibition on the publication of the name of a child to whom criminal proceedings relate, [1]  which applies even if the person is deceased at the time of the publication or broadcast, [2]  that prohibition does not apply to “an official report of the proceedings of a court” [3]  and hence does not apply to this judgment. The application of the statutory prohibition to further publication or broadcasting of details of this proceeding need not be addressed.
	
	
	Following the trial and convictions, the applicant was given an aggregate sentence of two years and five months with a non-parole period of 15 months, commencing on 6 September 2014. The judge identified indicative sentences as follows: Count 1, 9 months; Count 3, 7 months; Count 4, 12 months; Count 5, 18 months. The notice of appeal, filed on 11 November 2014 alleged a single ground, namely that the sentence was “manifestly excessive.”
	
	
	When the matter came on for hearing, counsel for the applicant indicated that she proposed to argue, in addition to the general ground, that the judge had failed correctly to apply principles relating to accumulation and totality. Whether such principles can properly apply with respect to an aggregate sentence may be doubted, but the applicant was granted leave to file an amended notice of appeal and nothing turns on that question for present purposes.
	
	
	In fact the grounds of appeal travelled more widely than the matters so identified. Four further factors were relied upon, including failure to give proper consideration to (a) the possibility of a non-custodial sentence, (b) the fact that the applicant suffered from a depressive illness, (c) that the assaults could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court rather than on indictment and (d) the delay in bringing the charges.
	
	
	A fifth additional matter requires some further elaboration. It arose from the fact that the victim died while living with the applicant in circumstances where the applicant was charged with being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. The trial judge, in sentencing her for that offence, said that the applicant and another person had removed the victim’s body from her house and taken it to premises in which Patricia Goddard, the applicant’s mother, was then living and had placed the body in a bin and buried it in a hole. This was said to have been done to assist Ms Goddard, “so that she might escape responsibility and punishment for the death of [the victim].” (These facts are taken from the judgment of this Court on the applicant’s unsuccessful challenge to the sentence imposed on her for that offence: TT v R. [4] ) Although the trial judge in the present matter had knowledge of these facts, they were not recounted in the judgment on sentence, nor was the trial transcript made available to this Court. The parties were content, however, for this Court to place such reliance as was required on the findings set out in the judgment in TT v R.
	
	
	That offence was relied upon by the applicant in the present proceedings on two bases. One was that that offending was, according to counsel, inextricably intertwined with the facts of the present case. There was, therefore, a need to consider totality by reference to the overall sentence imposed for the present assaults and for the accessory to manslaughter conviction. Secondly, it was said that the trial judge erred in declining to give leniency to the applicant with respect to the assault charges because, at the time of sentence, her criminal record included, amongst other offending, the offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. That course, it was submitted, was not open to the trial judge, who should have restricted his consideration of the applicant’s criminal record to offending prior to the assaults: by its nature, the conduct underlying the charge of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter post-dated the assaults for which she was being sentenced.
	
	
	As it is relevant to the submissions made with respect to “totality”, it is necessary to record the applicant’s sentence on the accessory charge, namely imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of three years. That was, as this Court noted in TT v R, a “stern” sentence, given that the maximum penalty for the offence was five years. [5] 
	
	
	Before turning to the question of manifest excess, it is convenient to deal with the more specific complaints. First, there is the complaint of delay. As explained in R v Todd [6]  questions of delay may require a degree of leniency, as a matter of fairness to the offender, for a range of reasons, including the progress of the offender’s rehabilitation during the term of an earlier sentence, the fact that he or she has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen and because the crime may properly be characterised as “stale”.
	
	
	These factors do not apply in the present case. Although the charges identified a period of some three years during which the offences were committed, the period of time which had elapsed in respect of any particular offence was not known. During the whole of that period, Ms O’Brien was in the care and control of the applicant, who was, therefore, in the place of a parent. The fact that Ms O’Brien did not complain to authorities of the treatment by her substitute mother is not a factor which the applicant can call in aid in support of leniency. The offences came to light as a result of police investigations following the death of the victim and the discovery of her decomposed and dismembered corpse. The lapse of time from the date of her death until the discovery of the offending resulted from conduct which Hamill J in the earlier appeal described as “remarkably deceptive and callous” and continuing over “a lengthy period of time”. [7]  She maintained the pretext that Ms O’Brien remained alive until 20 February 2011, being the day when the police discovered the victim’s decomposed remains. [8]  Thereafter, charges were promptly laid, originally in the same indictment as that including the charge of accessory after the fact to manslaughter. (The assault charges were later severed from the more serious charge.) Finally, this is not a case in which the fresh sentences will interfere with the process of rehabilitation: the trial judge found that “there is no remorse, there is no acceptance of any responsibility at all”. In these circumstances, reliance upon supposed “delay” was misplaced.
	
	
	Secondly, complaint was made that the trial judge declined to take into account the fact that the applicant had “suffered from a major depressive disorder for most of her life.” That putative diagnosis was made by Mr Gerry Wenzel, a clinical psychologist, on the basis of “her presentation and the history provided during her clinical psychological assessment”. The trial judge noted that the applicant “has never been formally diagnosed for or received treatment for depression.” [9]  By contrast, the trial judge accepted the psychologist’s opinion that “because of the offender’s background there was a lack of impulse control”, not amounting to a psychiatric or psychological condition that would “preclude the offender from fully appreciating the consequences of her actions and the wrongfulness of her actions.” [10] 
	
	
	Mr Wenzel’s report was prepared in September 2013 for the purposes of use at the sentencing hearing on her conviction of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. The assessment was undertaken “by a video linkup” two days earlier. Although the psychologist noted that there had been a “one hour wait before approval could be obtained to assess her via video link”, there was no record of the length of the consultation. Ms Taylor apparently reported that she had experienced “labile shifts in her mood including episodes of depression”, but had considered this to be normal and had not at any time spoken to a doctor or psychologist about her “mood disturbance”.
	
	
	Against this background, the trial judge was entitled to reject the putative diagnosis. The complaint appears to be that Conlon DCJ, when sentencing for the accessory charge, had accepted that she suffered from such a condition. All that was said on her appeal from that sentence appeared in the following passage: [11] 
	


“While there was evidence before the sentencing Judge that a psychologist (Gerry Wenzel) was of the opinion that the applicant suffered from a serious depressive illness and had done so for many years, there was nothing in the evidence that required some ‘automatic consequence [to follow]’ from the presence of that condition ….

… [T]his was not a case where there was a causal link between the condition and the offending such that the objective gravity of the crime, or the applicant's moral culpability, was diminished.”


	
	Even if the trial judge ought properly to have accepted the diagnosis (which is not the case) the same assessment should be made: it would not have materially affected the sentence.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was suggested that the assaults could have been dealt with summarily by a Local Court, which would have been limited to a maximum sentence of imprisonment for two years. That is a factor which may properly be taken into account when sentencing for such offences dealt with on indictment, and indeed it was. The judge accepted that “in this case the availability of the summary jurisdiction is a relevant consideration and it will provide some amelioration of the sentences” [12] , but noted, correctly, that the factor will have a varying operation from case to case. He dismissed the submission that the matters were not serious examples of the particular offences.
	
	
	All of the sentences were comfortably below the two year maximum available in the Local Court. The suggestion that they should in some manner have been dealt with as if a two year maximum were applicable is wrong in principle: the available range of sentences was not so limited: R v Doan. [13]  The judge did not err in this respect.
	
	
	Fourthly, it was submitted that the trial judge gave no consideration to a non-custodial option, merely concluding that there was “no alternative to gaol”. [14]  The trial judge had in fact noted the submission that “no additional penalty should be imposed in terms of an extension of the current non-parole period”, but had rejected that submission on the basis that there was “serious criminality” that required punishment. He expressly referred to the factors required to be considered pursuant to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”). The requirement that the Court not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless satisfied that no lesser punishment is appropriate [15]  did not require further explication in the circumstances. In any event, the substance of this challenge must stand or fall with a consideration of whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Fifthly, it is necessary to consider each of the challenges based on the antecedent sentence for being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter.
	
	
	There was no inappropriate element of double counting involved. In noting the earlier sentence, the judge also noted the submission that the sentence was “of no relevance at all”. He dismissed that submission, saying that it deprived her of “having an unblemished record at the time of sentence”, but further stated, “that is the only relevance of it.” [16] 
	
	
	Despite that, the judge was careful to note the date on which the extant non-parole period expired, namely 5 December 2014. The new non-parole period was not made entirely cumulative upon the existing non-parole period, but commenced three months prior to the expiration of the existing non-parole period, namely on 6 September 2014. In these circumstances, there can be no complaint either of double counting or failure to have regard to the effect of the existing sentence.
	
	
	The remaining specific complaint is that the trial judge took account of the conviction for accessory after the fact to manslaughter as a basis for “denying leniency that a person otherwise would receive for having an unblemished record.” He recognised that the conviction was, in his words, “a subsequent conviction”, but identified the relevant issue as whether the offender had an unblemished record “at the time of the sentence.” The phrase “subsequent conviction” referred to the fact that the circumstances on which the conviction was based post-dated the circumstances for which he was imposing a sentence.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act identifies “a record of previous convictions” as an aggravating factor in sentencing. [17]  That language is silent as to the temporal element. However, a purposive approach would suggest that it is the time of the offending which is often the significant time. For example, an offence committed first in time cannot reveal a “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.” [18]  On the other hand, the order in which particular offending conduct takes place may not be critical in other respects: a later offence may demonstrate that the earlier offence was not an uncharacteristic aberration, but revealed a propensity, thus diminishing the scope for leniency, even in respect of sentencing for the earlier misconduct.
	
	
	In describing the circumstances of the offending, the judge stated: [19] 
	


“There is a common thread throughout the incidents; they all involved unacceptable bullying, humiliation and oppression. They all involved a situation in which the victim was demeaned, degraded, physically attacked for no sensible reason at all. The trigger related in each case to some perceived deficiency in the victim in the performance of some extremely menial task. The evidence reveals that the victim was vulnerable by reason of her age and her personality. She offered no resistance; she cowered to the offender and her response to the inappropriate punishment was not to complain and often to apologise.”


	
	Just as the judge would have been entitled to take into account the circumstances of one assault as revealing the culpability of an earlier act, or psychological testing undertaken after the offending but prior to sentence, the judge was entitled to take into account the character of the offender as revealed by the subsequent events. That he did so merely to deny her a degree of leniency does not demonstrate error. Being relevant in this way, it is not necessary to determine the limits of s 21A(2)(d). [20]  This ground of challenge should be rejected.
	
	
	There remains the question as to whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The first basis for reaching such a conclusion was said to be found in the available statistics. Accepting, as counsel properly did, the limited assistance which can be obtained from bare statistics, they do not assist the present argument. Counsel summarised the statistics for common assaults prosecuted in the higher courts, noting that 40% of offenders received fulltime imprisonment, with sentences ranging between six months and 24 months, with 80% of all offenders receiving a sentence of between six months and 18 months. With respect to assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, prosecuted in the higher courts, 45% of offenders received fulltime prison sentences, with 80% receiving a sentence between 12 and 36 months. Treating the indicative sentences on this basis, and accepting that a custodial term was called for, the sentence for each offence was either in the middle of the range for 80% of offenders, or below that figure.
	
	
	The characterisation of the sentences by the sentencing judge has already been noted. It remains to say a little more about the facts of each case. The judge described the assault the subject of count 1 as involving the applicant “belting into” Ms O’Brien, meaning that she was “punching her with a closed fist to the stomach, arms and head.” The event occurred in the kitchen: Ms O’Brien was saying “she was sorry and she was crouched and cowering down in the corner.” One of the applicant’s daughters apparently tried to pull her mother from the victim and tell her to stop but the applicant told her daughter to “fuck off”.
	
	
	Count 3 involved an assault in the kitchen of a home at Mount Druitt, which appeared to be the home of a friend of the applicant. The applicant instructed Ms O’Brien to go into the kitchen and make cups of coffee, which she did. She got milk out of the fridge, but the applicant came in, took a two litre milk carton saying, “well what the fuck is anyone going to do with this” and began striking Ms O’Brien across the head in a “forehand and backhand motion.” The witness described three or four hits to the left side of the head, continuing:
	


“The movements was quite quick and you could hear the milk bottle compressing and decompressing. You could hear the plastic bending and [the victim] put her hands up and there were about four or five more hits after that. All up about 10.”


	
	Count 4 occurred in the family home and involved the applicant wiping her index finger along a coffee table, lifting it and looking at Ms O’Brien, saying “what the fuck do you call this”. The applicant then took a vacuum cleaner tube and struck Ms O’Brien with a downward motion, hitting her on the forehead just above the bridge of the nose. The witness said that Ms O’Brien “had a bit of a yelp or a wince which came out and there as a mark and a bit of blood trickled down, so it did cause a bit of injury.” There was an attempt at a second blow and the witness put her hands up and said words to the effect of “‘that’s fucking enough’ and thereupon the [applicant] stood straight up and said [apparently to the witness] ‘well get out of my fucking house’ or words to that effect.”
	
	
	Count 5 involved the applicant having an argument with Ms O’Brien, grabbing her by the head and slamming her head through a glass panel of a wooden door. The evidence, as recounted by the judge, continued:
	


“And this argument was taking place in the lounge room and the result was a cut on the top of the head, a deep cut above her eyebrow and the [applicant] said ‘well put a band aid on it and get over it’.”


	
	The objective seriousness of this conduct towards a child, not being her child but the child of a friend, is apparent from these brief summaries given by the trial judge of the facts of the cases. So far as the personal circumstances of the applicant were concerned, the judge accepted that she had frequently been confronted with violence in the family home when she herself was a child. He said:
	


“Her mother would frequently punish her and the other children by beating them with a stick, and when the violence was not directed at the [applicant], she often witnessed it towards her siblings. There was a particular incident where her brother was punished by the mother with a hot electric iron by burning his hand, after he had been accused of stealing.”


	
	The judge accepted that the applicant had “endured socio-economic hardship during her childhood, during her formative years, and she had started working in showgrounds throughout her adulthood.” Referring to Mr Wenzel’s report, he stated: [21] 
	


“The report goes on to say:

‘It appears that her early deprived childhood and exposure to violence in the home resulted in her becoming a chronically compensating person throughout her adulthood.’

In view of this it is likely that she had a reduced capacity for dealing with stress, but rather than recognise problems would simply push on, and she thought it was normal to feel this way and these feelings have been present throughout her life.”


	
	The favourable effect of the subjective circumstances of the applicant was diminished by the finding that there was no remorse, nor acceptance of responsibility, and the further finding that “it is unlikely the offender would not reoffend if in the same situation or a similar situation because of a lack of impulse control.”
	
	
	There is no basis for this Court to interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge. The indicative sentences were not beyond an appropriate range; nor was the aggregate sentence shown to be excessive. The substantive effect of the sentence imposed was to increase the period of mandatory custody which the applicant was already serving for the unrelated offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter by a period of 12 months.
	
	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal.

(2)   Dismiss the appeal.


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Basten JA.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Basten JA.

Introduction


	
	This is an application pursuant to s 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and r 13.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) for summary dismissal for proceedings for defamation, commenced by the plaintiff in the District Court of NSW at Parramatta prior to transfer to the Sydney Defamation List.
	
	
	The defendants rely upon the affidavits of Natalie Buck affirmed 16 and 19 February 2015. The plaintiff, who has been called outside the court on two occasions, has not been represented and has not led any evidence, despite these proceedings being given a special fixture for this application on 19 December 2014.
	
	
	When this application was before the court on that date, the plaintiff was represented by a Mr Trent Malcolm Bourne. Despite Mr Bourne being advised by the defendants in correspondence of his obligations pursuant to r 7.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)), the relevant documentation to permit him to represent the plaintiff has not been provided. Mrs Barnett notes that I directed Mr Bourne that he should attend in person for this application, but there has been no appearance by Mr Bourne today, and the corporation which brings these proceedings has not been represented by any other person. Nor has there been a request to attend by way of telephone link.
	


The basis of the application


	
	Although the principal reason for the application is the plaintiff’s ineligibility to sue by reason of s 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), the defendants bring this application on four bases:
	



	
	The plaintiff has admitted, both of a consequence of failure to dispute a Notice to Admit Facts (Exhibits A and B) and in correspondence (Exhibit C), that the plaintiff employs 10 persons, and cannot therefore satisfy the “excluded corporations” exemption in s 9(2) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW);
	
	
	There is a total failure to comply with UCPR r 14.30 in terms of the content of the matter complained of, the imputations pleaded and the relief and damages claimed;
	
	
	Mr Bourne’s failure to file the relevant affidavit material pursuant to UCPR r 7.2; and
	
	
	The conduct of the proceedings to date, including an application by the plaintiff for default judgment which was electronically filed on 18 December 2014 but not served.
	



	
	I shall deal with each of these grounds in turn.
	


Section 9 and “excluded corporation”


	
	Section 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“9 Certain corporations do not have cause of action for defamation

(1) A corporation has no cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the corporation unless it was an excluded corporation at the time of the publication.

(2) A corporation is an excluded corporation if:

(a) the objects for which it is formed do not include obtaining financial gain for its members or corporators, or

(b) it employs fewer than 10 persons and is not related to another corporation,

and the corporation is not a public body.

(3) In counting employees for the purposes of subsection (2) (b), part-time employees are to be taken into account as an appropriate fraction of a full-time equivalent.

(4) In determining whether a corporation is related to another corporation for the purposes of subsection (2) (b), section 50 of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth applies as if references to bodies corporate in that section were references to corporations within the meaning of this section.

(5) Subsection (1) does not affect any cause of action for defamation that an individual associated with a corporation has in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the individual even if the publication of the same matter also defames the corporation.

(6) In this section:

“corporation” includes any body corporate or corporation constituted by or under a law of any country (including by exercise of a prerogative right), whether or not a public body.

“public body” means a local government body or other governmental or public authority constituted by or under a law of any country.”


	
	Section 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) was based on s 8A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which came into effect in February 2003. It is a threshold bar to any corporation that is not “excluded” from bringing defamation proceedings, and since the enactment of s 9 in the uniform legislation applies to the bringing of proceedings in relation to any cause of action arising from publication in the States and Territories of Australia.
	
	
	The evidence is as follows. The plaintiff was served with a Notice to Admit Facts on 30 January 2015 as follows:
	


“1. As at 15 October 2014 the Plaintiff employed 10 persons.

2. As at 15 October 2014 the Plaintiff employed 10 persons on a full time basis.”


	
	The defendants draw the following to my attention:
	



	
	No notice disputing fact has been filed and it must be taken that such an admission is made.
	
	
	The plaintiff has in any event failed to comply with its obligation to specify in the statement of claim that it is in fact an excluded corporation.
	
	
	Additionally, as Exhibit C makes clear, the plaintiff, in a letter of 9 December 2014 (part of which is a “without prejudice” communication and which, following Mr Bourne’s objections on 19 December, has been masked by the defendants), volunteered the information that it had 10 employees. The relevant extract from this letter is as follows:
	


“As preciously [sic] advised Time for Monkeys Enterprises currently has 10 employees at the time of broadcast of the “offending” material. I have attached at attachment two and three copy’s [sic] of the employee listing for the company as of the date of the “Offending” material being broadcast [sic] (15th October 2014). Please note that for employee privacy only the first and last letter of the employees name has been provided. If the defendants wish to view that attached document in full then they should make arrangements to view the documents in person. It is our number one priority to abide by the privacy act [sic] and ensure our employee’s [sic] details are kept securely.”


	
	The evidence that the plaintiff is not an excluded corporation is very strong. While an admission in correspondence may not be as binding as an admission in a pleading or a Notice to Admit Facts (Attorney General of New South Wales v Homeland Community Ltd [2015] NSWCA 15), the plaintiff has in fact volunteered that it has 10 employees. This admission was made under cover of a letter of 9 December 2014 in circumstances where the letter from the solicitors for the defendants dated 4 November 2014 (Exhibit A, p 4) clearly drew the following provisions to the attention of the plaintiff, in response to earlier correspondence, which stated, in relation to a previous representation to this effect:
	


“Further, we note your advice that the Plaintiff has exactly 10 employees and it is necessary that the relevant particulars be provided pursuant to UCPR Regulation 15.20 of the corporation’s capacity to assert a cause of action for defamation.”


	
	These proceedings should therefore be summarily dismissed on this basis alone. I shall, however, set out my findings in relation to the other bases upon which this application has been brought.
	


Inadequate pleading


	
	The statement of claim is hopelessly pleaded. I particularly note the following:
	



	
	The matter complained of is not attached. What little information appears in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the statement of claim as to what was said by the defendants’ radio presenters does not indicate that it was identified by name;
	
	
	No imputations are pleaded, although it would appear that the plaintiff asserts that it was “called frauds and scams [sic]”;
	
	
	A claim is made for $80,000 as well as “associated fees, including lost wages and income”. The nature of these damages, and whether they are special damages, is not identified.
	



	
	While these are substantial defects, they could be cured by granting leave to replead. However, there is no point in considering a grant of leave to amend given the inability of the plaintiff to bring these proceedings by reason of s 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	


Failure to comply with UCPR r 7.2


	
	Rule 7.2 UCPR provides:
	


“7.2 Affidavit as to authority to commence and carry on proceedings in Supreme Court or District Court

(1) A person who commences or carries on proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court:

(a) as the director of a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, or

(b) as the authorised officer of a corporation (other than a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth),

must file with the originating process, notice of appearance or defence, as the case may be, an affidavit as to his or her authority to act in that capacity, together with a copy of the instrument evidencing that authority.

(2) The affidavit made by the director of a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth must contain:

(a) a statement to the effect that:

(i) the director is a director of the company, and

(ii) the director has been authorised by a resolution of the directors duly passed at a meeting of directors held on a specified date (which must not be earlier than 21 days before the date of the affidavit) to commence and carry on the proceedings, as the case requires, and

(iii) the authority has not been revoked, and

(iv) the director is aware that he or she may be liable to pay some or all of the costs of the proceedings, or

(b) a statement to the effect that:

(i) the director is the managing or governing director of the company and has authority to exercise the powers of the directors, and

(ii) the director is aware that he or she may be liable to pay some or all of the costs of the proceedings.

(3) The affidavit made by the authorised officer of a corporation (other than a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth) must contain a statement to the effect that:

(a) the officer is the holder of a specified office within the corporation, and

(b) the officer has been authorised by the corporation to commence and carry on the proceedings, and

(c) the authority has not been revoked, and

(d) the officer is aware that he or she may be liable to pay some or all of the costs of the proceedings.”


	
	These documents have never been filed, and the company is effectively unrepresented.
	
	
	While, of itself, failure to comply with UCPR r 7.2 is not a matter that would warrant the dismissal of proceedings, it does not reflect well on the plaintiff’s conduct of the matter to date that there has been failure to comply with this requirement, despite these matters having been drawn to the attention of Mr Bourne previously.
	


The plaintiff’s conduct of the litigation


	
	These proceedings were commenced in the Parramatta Registry. They were listed before Assistant Registrar Evans on 18 November 2014, who discontinued proceedings pursuant to a Notice of Discontinuance the plaintiff filed on 15 November 2014. The Registry then decided that this discontinuance had to be set aside, as consent to the discontinuance was not provided by the defendants as required by UCPR r 12.1, (but c.f. Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486). Whatever the basis for the making and unmaking of these orders (which appears to have taken a considerable amount of registry time), the proceedings were discontinued by mistake in that, while the plaintiff had mistakenly sent a Notice of Discontinuance to the court, both parties had written to the registry seeking a consent order for the proceedings be transferred to the Sydney Registry.
	
	
	On 9 December 2014, the Registrar made a further order in chambers transferring the matter to Sydney, at the request of the parties. This order was made despite the Registry discovering, in the interim, that the plaintiff’s cheque for the filing fee was dishonoured, and being uncertain what to do about this. The Registry staff then placed a signed post-it note in the file requiring the court to remind the plaintiff that payment was required “plus the dishonour fee”.
	
	
	This raises the question of whether the proceedings had ever been “filed” in the first place. In Brierley v Reeves (2001) 51 NSWLR 689, the appellant appealed from an order dismissing his application for costs to be assessed, which had been made on the basis that the costs assessor had no jurisdiction to assess the bill of costs, as the filing fee was unpaid. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that, on a proper construction of s 203(4) Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW), the fee had to be paid, or alternatively an application for waiver or postponement must be made before the period expired, neither of which had occurred. Other courts have similarly held that they have no jurisdiction where the filing fee required for lodgement of a court document is not paid: Druett v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FMCA 568; Kirk v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 87 FCR 99; Khan v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 443 at [17]; Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 109 FCR 364.
	
	
	The explanation for failure to pay in some cases has been that the applicant had sought, or was seeking, a waiver of the filing fee. In Thurston v Thurston [2011] FamCAFC 250, the appellant was informed he needed to pay a filing fee, or to seek a reduction, and failed to do either; the appeal was dismissed, although on the basis that it was without merit in any event (see also Daniels v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] SASC 114; Jordan v Van Schoubroeck (2003) 34 SR (WA) 325; but c.f. Caltabiano v Electoral Commission of Queensland (No 2) [2009] QSC 138 at [66]). However, no application for waiver of the filing fee was made in these proceedings.
	
	
	Whether an extension of time to pay the fee can be granted may depend upon the legislation. In Aristocrat Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2009) 112 ALD 363, the agent of a party misunderstood advice contained in a letter and formed the view that no filing fee was payable. An extension of time was granted on the basis that it would not prejudice the applicant. However, that was a case where the relevant legislation was flexible, in that the failure to provide a fee amounted to an “error” for the purposes of s 232(2)(a) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth).
	
	
	The relevant rule in these proceedings is UCPR r 4.10(5), which provides:
	


“(5) An officer of the court may refuse to accept a document for filing in the following circumstances:

(a) in the case of originating process:

(i) if the location specified in the document as the venue at which the proceedings are to be heard is a location at which the court does not sit, or

(ii) if the person on whose behalf the originating process is sought to be filed is the subject of an order of the Supreme Court declaring the person to be a vexatious litigant,

(b) in the case of a document for which a filing fee is payable, if the fee has not been paid or arrangements satisfactory to the officer of the court have not been made for its payment.”


	
	This rule is infelicitously drafted, in that it appears to differentiate between “originating process” and “a document for which a filing fee is payable”, but clearly the statement of claim would be an example of such a filing fee. I could not find any cases, or statutory provision, dealing with the possibility that a cheque for a filing fee would be dishonoured. It is unheard of.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, as the cheque has been dishonoured, the filing fee has not been paid, and that this would constitute a basis for holding either that the court has no jurisdiction or that the proceedings have never been validly commenced. It would have been open to the Parramatta Registry to reject and return the statement of claim, or refuse to make further orders, but busy court registries should not have to concern themselves with such issues.
	
	
	In my view, having regard to the principles discussed in the authorities set out above, the statement of claim should be struck out on this basis as well.
	
	
	A further matter relied upon by the defendants is the filing by the plaintiff of an application for default judgment on 18 December 2014 in circumstances where this application was snapped on, with no prior notice to the defendants. Mr Bourne, on behalf of the plaintiff, sent the following email to my associate at 7:04am on 19 December 2014:
	


“Mr Mok,

For the ease of the court I have lodged an [sic] Defult [sic] Judgement [sic] Motion yesterday though the online portal on the Justice Link Website.

I have not served this on the Defendants as I am not required to do so IAW the UPCR’s.

I have attached a copy of the motion to this email and I would appreciate that her honour is provided a copy of the motion for the directions hearing today.

If you have any further questions please let me know on [Mr Bourne’s mobile number], this is also the number I will be on for the Phone Hearing today. If I am able to ask that Parramatta to be heard first I might be able to appear in front of Her Honour today (as preferred). I will contact your office if this is the case otherwise I will attend by phone.”


	
	The absence of a defamation list in suburban and country registries exposes defendants in defamation proceedings to risks of this kind, as default judgments are not available in defamation proceedings only if they are in a specialist list: Altarama Ltd v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188; District Court Civil Practice Note 6 does not apply to proceedings outside the Sydney registry and many of the protections afforded by a specialist list, including the entitlement to take objections to pleadings before having to file a defence, may not be considered to apply (Boros v Swann [2014] NSWDC 227).
	
	
	However, it was improper for the plaintiff to have filed such an application without notice or service, particularly given the time of year, in that it was the last day of term; any default judgment entered over the Christmas vacation could have caused considerable inconvenience to the defendants. In my view, this would amount to “sharp conduct”: Ipex ITG Pty Ltd (ACN 007 433 623) (in liq) (receivers appointed) v Victoria [2014] VSCA 315 at [22].
	


Final orders and costs


	
	The plaintiff is not entitled to bring proceedings for defamation by reason of s 9 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), and these proceedings accordingly fail in limine.
	
	
	The defendants seek costs orders not only against the plaintiff for these proceedings, but also against Mr Trent Malcolm Bourne, pursuant to s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The defendants draw to my attention a consideration of the relevant principles in May v Christodoulou (2011) 80 NSWLR 462. In those proceedings, a director of a company who had not strictly complied with procedural requirements set by r 7.2 UCPR was ordered to be jointly and severally liable with the company to pay the plaintiff’s costs. On appeal that order was set aside, on the basis that the director in question had done no more than represent the company in proceedings (albeit somewhat ineffectively), and that in those circumstances the discretionary power to make an order for costs had miscarried.
	
	
	The circumstances in these proceedings are very different. The plaintiff was at all relevant times on notice, as was Mr Bourne, that these proceedings were hopeless. The potential for such an order to be made is discussed in FPM Constructions Pty Ltd v Council of the City of Blue Mountains [2005] NSWCA 340, and the evidence before warrants the making of such an order. I note in this regard that despite my request to attend, Mr Bourne has not attended today, and that he appears to be the author of the unserved application for default judgment. It is my view that the costs should be payable by Mr Bourne personally. Additionally, while it is uncertain that Mr Bourne is himself responsible for this conduct, the filing of proceedings in the District Court by payment of a cheque which is subsequently dishonoured is a practice to be discouraged.
	
	
	Further, the manner in which these proceedings were commenced and conducted in the Parramatta Registry caused inconvenience to that court’s Registry and staff (see, similarly, Boros v Swann), the snapping on of default judgment applications in defamation proceedings should be prevented, and no litigant should expect the court to incur cheque dishonour fees. I accordingly propose to forward a copy of this judgment to the Rules Committee.
	


Orders


	
	Plaintiff called three times at 2:10pm – no appearance.
	
	
	Plaintiff called a second time three times at 2:35pm – no appearance.
	
	
	Grant leave to the defendant to file in court the Affidavit of Natalie Buck affirmed on 16 February 2015 and the Affidavit of Natalie Buck affirmed on 19 February 2015.
	
	
	Pursuant to r 13.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), the proceedings are dismissed.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), Mr Trent Malcolm Bourne, a director of the plaintiff, is jointly liable for the costs of the proceedings.

		25 February 2015",2015-02-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765898,R v A (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 95,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)


	
	The trial of the accused has reached the stage where both the Crown and the defence cases closed on the 17 February, 2015.
	
	
	On the morning of the 18 February 2015, when final addresses were to commence, I was advised by the Sheriff that one of the members of the jury had telephoned to say that he was ill and could not attend. In accordance with a direction from me, the Sheriff asked the member of the jury to provide a medical certificate setting out the condition from which he was suffering, and the likely period of his incapacity.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 18 February 2015 I was informed by the Sheriff that a medical certificate had been received indicating that the juror in question would not be able to attend on the 18th February. The obvious inference from that certificate was that he was likely to be able to attend today, 19th February. Counsel were informed accordingly.
	
	
	At that point I had not actually viewed the medical certificate in question. I had an opportunity to do so when I arrived at court this morning. The certificate (which has been marked MFI 20) states that the juror was suffering from “migraine” and would be ""unfit for work from 18.2.2015 to 18.2.2015 inclusive"".
	
	
	I pause to observe two things: Firstly, the juror in question is the foreperson of the jury. Secondly, he was also absent due to illness on 11 February, 2015. The medical certificate pertaining to that absence, issued by a doctor within the same Medical Centre as that from which the most recent certificate was issued, indicated that he was suffering from viral gastritis, a condition obviously different to that which has caused his absence today.
	
	
	Earlier this morning I was informed that notwithstanding the contents of MFI 20, the juror telephoned the Sheriff at about 9.30am and indicated that he remained unwell, and was not able to attend. He has been directed to attend upon his doctor to obtain a further medical certificate so as to provide some indication of when he will be fit to return. He apparently informed the Sheriff that he was confident that he would be able to attend tomorrow. All of these matters were communicated to counsel in the presence of the accused when the Court was convened this morning.
	
	
	Seized of that information, the Crown sought a discharge of the juror. In support of that application, the Crown submitted that there was ""no magic"" in the figure of 12 and that it was important, in order to preserve the fairness and integrity of the trial, that there be not too great a gap between the closure of the evidence and the addresses. The Crown submitted that any greater gap than that which had already occurred would impact upon the jury's ability to properly analyse the evidence, and to properly have regard to such submissions as might be put to them.
	
	
	The Crown also placed some emphasis on the nature of the condition from which the juror is presently suffering. It was submitted, in particular, that it is a condition which necessarily has a bearing upon a person's ability to (inter alia) concentrate.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused submitted that at this stage I should decline the application, and should resume the trial tomorrow on the understanding that all 12 jurors would be present. In making that submission however, he made it clear that if the present situation prevailed tomorrow he would join in an application that the juror be discharged.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused submitted that there was ""magic"" in the number 12, both historically and stemming from the provisions of the relevant legislation. In terms of the increasing gap in time between the conclusion of the evidence and the commencement of addresses, senior counsel pointed out that on the assumption that the member of the jury is fit to resume tomorrow, the gap (being two days) is equivalent to a weekend. He also pointed to the fact that occasions invariably arise in trials where far longer breaks are taken to accommodate occasions such Easter and Christmas.
	
	
	Finally, he submitted that it is of some significance that the juror in question is the foreperson. He pointed out if he was discharged, the jury would necessarily have to elect a new foreperson.
	
	
	The events which have arisen are obviously unfortunate. The prognosis in terms of the foreperson's condition seems somewhat speculative. The certificate (MFI 20) had indicated that he would be fit today. Clearly, on the information I have available, he is not. He has expressed (it seems with some degree of optimism) that he will be fit tomorrow. Whether or not that optimism is soundly based is not something I can determine with any certainty.
	
	
	However at this stage I regard it as premature to accede to an application that he be discharged. It is preferable in my view, to continue with a jury of 12 if it is possible to do so. The situation has not, in my view, reached the point where the gap between the conclusion of the evidence and the commencement of addresses is likely to be prejudicial, in any way, to either party.
	
	
	If it transpires that despite the foreperson's optimism he remains unfit tomorrow, I may be inclined at that point to accede to the Crown's submission. Senior counsel for the accused made it clear that he would support the Crown’s application in that event. However at this stage I propose to allow the foreperson a further 24 hours to try and regain his health. I therefore refuse the application that he be discharged.
	
	
	I will permit the remaining 11 members of the jury to leave today, on the understanding that we will resume tomorrow morning. Needless to say I will not communicate my views as to the possibility of the foreperson being discharged to the 11 members of the jury who remain.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765905,R v Devlin [2015] NSWDC 181,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 17 December last year, Craig Devlin appeared for sentence after having pleaded guilty to an offence of indecent assault. He had also faced trial before a jury for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent but was found not guilty of that offence.
	
	
	On that occasion I dealt with the objective gravity of his offending and his subjective circumstances. I imposed a sentence but ordered that he be assessed as to whether he was suitable to serve that sentence by means of home detention.
	
	
	On that occasion I made brief reference to the eligibility requirements for home detention and held that an indecent assault upon an adult did not disqualify him. I referred to section 76 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and section 61I of the Crimes Act, where the heading to that section, “Sexual assault”, makes it clear that, at least in the Crimes Act, a sexual assault does not include an indecent assault.
	
	
	A home detention report has been prepared. It indicates his suitability, but the Crown has raised a number of arguments in support of a submission that Mr Devlin is, in truth, not eligible for home detention.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown points out that the Interpretation Act makes it clear that the heading to 61I is to be disregarded. That is what I was relying on, on 17 December last year.
	
	
	The Crown points out that, had Parliament wished to make home detention available for those to be sentenced for indecently assaulting an adult, it would have used the same language to be found in section 66 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which sets out the eligibility for an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	The Crown also points out, accurately, that a perusal of the sentencing information system available through the Judicial Commission website reveals not a single instance of home detention being imposed for an indecent assault.
	
	
	I accept those arguments, in particular, the submission regarding a comparison between the eligibility requirements for an intensive corrections order and for home detention.
	
	
	Mr Howell did attempt to persuade me that my initial conclusion concerning availability was correct. He pointed out that the words “sexual offences involving children” had to be given work to do, and submitted that if the words “sexual offences” did not include indecent assaults, then there was no work for that term. However, there are sexual offences involving children which do not involve intercourse or indecent assault, incest being a perfect example. So, although those words may not have much work to do, it cannot be said that they have no work to do.
	
	
	Mr Howell also made a submission that because, as I found earlier, his client’s conduct was not for the purpose of sexual gratification, it could not be said to be a sexual assault. I do not accept that submission. The actions of the offender were clearly sexual in nature, even though he may not have got any sexual gratification from them.
	
	
	So, despite Mr Howell’s submissions, I do make a finding that Mr Devlin is ineligible to be given the benefit of a home detention order.
	
	
	I note in passing that it is difficult to discern any policy reason why a person convicted of indecently assaulting an adult could be given an intensive corrections order but not home detention. In the second reading speech when home detention was first introduced as a sentencing option, the then Attorney-General spoke about community safety. It is difficult to discern how an offender given the benefit of an intensive corrections order presents less of a risk to the community than the same offender given a home detention order.
	
	
	What then flows from the situation that now reveals itself? The only alternatives that are available are two widely differing sentencing options, a suspended sentence of imprisonment or full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	An intensive corrections order is not available for two reasons; firstly, a referral for assessment as to the suitability of an offender to serve a sentence of imprisonment by means of an intensive corrections order can only be made “before imposing a sentence of imprisonment” (see section 69 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), but in any case, even if that legislative impediment was not there, as was discussed on the last occasion, the lack of community service options would mean that in any case Mr Devlin would be found to be unsuitable.
	
	
	The starkness of the contrast between the only two sentencing options available is immediately obvious. I need not dwell on the obvious leniency that a suspended sentence of imprisonment upon this offender would bring about, or the obvious consequences to him of being required to serve a full-time sentence of imprisonment for the first time at his age, he being a man of prior good character.
	
	
	In a real sense, what I am required to do is to choose the least worst sentencing option. The sentencing law as it exists in New South Wales currently has resulted in an extremely unsatisfactory position.
	
	
	Mr Howell pressed upon me, in sentencing submissions made last year, and again today, a number of factors which he suggested meant that full time imprisonment was inappropriate. In addition to the ones he mentioned earlier, which I dealt with on the last occasion, he also referred to the circumstance that this matter has now been hanging over the offender’s head for some time.
	
	
	It remains the case, of course, that his conduct that morning was seriously wrong. His desire to humiliate his then wife by exercising his dominion over her, by showing her that he was in charge of such basic matters as to whether she wore underwear or not, was seriously criminal.
	
	
	I have decided, not without considerable hesitation, as is obvious, that the least worst sentencing option is to do what Mr Howell asks me to do. I fully agree that the result is a sentence which fails to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct, and the complainant would be right to think that, as matters have turned out, justice has not been done.
	
	
	To impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment on an offender who conducted himself the way this offender did is by no means an appropriate outcome, to put matters bluntly. He goes, effectively, unpunished for what he has done. But, as I mentioned, it is a choice between two entirely undesirable outcomes, and in my view, especially given the offender’s prior good character, and the circumstance that his offending occurred in the context of a highly emotionally charged state, full-time imprisonment is not appropriate either.
	
	
	The order I therefore make is this.
	
	
	The sentence of imprisonment that I imposed on the last occasion is suspended under section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the duration of that sentence. The non-parole period I announced on that occasion has now become otiose and is to be disregarded.
	
	
	The offender is to enter into a good behaviour bond for the period of the sentence. The conditions of that bond are that he is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, including attendance at psychological services for specialist counselling on domestic abuse as required by the Probation and Parole Service and accept any other referrals for treatment ordered by the Probation and Parole Service, and fully comply with such treatment. The offender is not to consume any alcohol during the period of the bond and is to accept random breath testing and comply with such testing as the Probation and Parole Service requires.
	
	
	Of course, the stay that automatically came into consequence as a result of me referring the offender for a home detention assessment is now at an end.

		26 August 2015",2015-02-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765906,R v O’Keefe [2015] NSWSC 89,"Judgment


	
	On 12 February 2015, Bruce Francis O’Keefe (“the accused”) was arraigned on an indictment before me. It contained a single count alleging that, on 16 October 2013 at Lake Haven, he murdered Jennifer Lynne Dowell (to whom I shall refer as “the deceased”). No jury panel was present because, immediately before the arraignment, I had ordered, pursuant to s 132(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), that the trial on the indictment was to proceed without a jury and by judge alone. I had made that order because a document had been filed that established that the accused elected to have the trial conducted in that way, and the Crown consented to that election.
	
	
	The accused pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness. Thereafter, the Crown Prosecutor opened his case. That opening, I respectfully consider, provided a way for members of the community, and in particular persons who were close to the deceased and persons who are close to the accused, to understand the evidence that was to be tendered in the proceedings. Defence counsel briefly opened in reply to the same effect.
	
	
	It was clear after the openings that each counsel was contending that the appropriate verdict for me to return would be the special verdict that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness. It was also clear that that joint contention was based largely, though not exclusively, upon the unanimous opinion of three highly experienced forensic psychiatrists with regard to the mental state of the accused on 16 October 2013.
	
	
	A large number of documents were tendered in the Crown case. None of them was the subject of objection by defence counsel. It was also made clear by him that, although no document setting out formal admissions was filed, nevertheless there was no dispute about the Crown case. Included in those documents was a report of Dr Adams, forensic psychiatrist, of 6 October 2014, and which became Crown exhibit GG.
	
	
	The defence case was also limited to documents. It featured reports of Dr Westmore of 14 December 2013, of 31 January 2014, and of 16 June 2014, which collectively became exhibit 5; and a report of Dr Nielssen of 15 June 2014, which became exhibit 4. As well as that, defence counsel tendered statements of two civilian witnesses and a number of police witnesses. The evidence of the civilian witnesses was not in contradiction of the Crown case, but rather in supplementation of it. The evidence of the police witnesses was simply to provide a typewritten transcript of some of the handwritten material that was already before me by way of the Crown case.
	


Summary of evidence


	
	It is in those circumstances that I turn to provide a brief chronological summary of the events that the undisputed evidence establishes. I have been very much assisted in my analysis of the evidence by way of a “chronology of agreed facts” with which I was provided by counsel before the final addresses commenced.
	
	
	The deceased was born in January 1951, and accordingly on 16 October 2013 was aged 62 years. The accused was born in February 1960; accordingly, as at the date in question, he was aged 53 years. They had met in the early 1990s whilst working for a large Australian trade union. At the time, they were each married to other persons. In the year 2000, the deceased separated from her partner, and in 2007 she and the accused commenced an intimate relationship. At that time, the accused was still married to his wife, Ms Sharon O’Keefe.
	
	
	In 2007, the accused was in Lismore for work with a female colleague. At the time he was under a great deal of stress, chiefly as a result of his responsibilities at work, and also his personal relationships. It is clear that, whilst in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, the accused suffered an acute mental illness sufficiently serious to be described as a psychotic episode. His work colleague noted a number of aspects of his beliefs and behaviour. They included: imagining things that were, in truth, not there; believing that the government was seeking to murder the two of them; believing that food and drink was contaminated; smashing her mobile phone for fear that it contained a transmitter; placing the television in his motel room outside the door, because it was making “noises in his head”; and ensuring that a car be hired in a false name so that it could not be traced.
	
	
	Eventually, the accused insisted on driving from Lismore to Rockhampton in Queensland, a not inconsiderable distance. At the least, he pressured his colleague to accompany him; at worst, he had kidnapped her. It was in Rockhampton that the parents of the accused resided. Once there, he continued to exhibit some very bizarre behaviour, including insisting that the motor vehicle that had been used on the journey be wiped down with bleach in order to remove fingerprints, and at one stage barricading himself inside a cupboard.
	
	
	The accused ended up living in Rockhampton for six months with his parents. He was incapable of working. A general practitioner referred him to a psychologist, who diagnosed him as having suffered a major mental illness; namely, a psychotic disorder. He also expressed the opinion that the accused was suffering from paranoid, delusional beliefs. The psychologist was of the view that the accused was delusional, irrational, and no longer able to distinguish what was real from what was not.
	
	
	The accused returned to Sydney in around March 2008. Although suffering from anxiety and depression, it seems that he was free from symptoms suggesting that he was divorced from reality. He returned to work.
	
	
	The accused and the deceased moved into a house together in Jamisontown near Penrith. By that time their romantic relationship was well-established. By 2009, the general practitioner of the accused was Dr Dowsett in Cranebrook. The accused and the deceased moved into a house in that latter suburb in 2010. The accused and his wife, Ms O’Keefe, formally divorced in July 2012. The accused and the deceased became engaged that same year.
	
	
	In October 2012, Dr Dowsett diagnosed the accused as suffering from anxiety and depression. As a result, the work hours of the accused were reduced to being a three day week. At around the same time, the accused commenced to see Ms Hatfield, clinical psychologist. She diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. He saw her every two weeks for an extended period.
	
	
	By February 2013, it seemed that the treatment of Ms Hatfield had been effective, in that the depression, anxiety and stress levels of the accused were in the normal range. By March 2013, the accused had returned to work, and a part-time officer had been appointed to assist him in managing his work load.
	
	
	In April 2013, the accused and the deceased purchased a house at Lake Haven on the Central Coast of New South Wales. That was intended to be a home in which they would enjoy their retirement years together. Indeed, the deceased was not far from retirement, and there were no real problems with respect to their financial position. They moved into the home a short time later.
	
	
	In late June 2013, Ms Hatfield closed her treatment file with regard to the accused, because it appeared that his mood disorder had abated. However, in September 2013 Dr Dowsett referred the accused to Ms Hatfield again, on the basis that his anxiety and depression had returned. That seemed to have occurred because he had been informed that there would be no further funding to permit his assistant at work to continue. On 17 September 2013, the accused saw Ms Hatfield again. She diagnosed him as having suffered a return of his adjustment disorder. The accused stopped working.
	
	
	Ms Hatfield saw him again on 4 October 2013, and spoke to him by telephone on 9 October 2013. On the former occasion the accused was reported as thinking that he could not cope. It is also noteworthy that she recorded him as having said “I can’t stop thinking… at pool from childhood something’s going wrong [sic]”.
	
	
	On Friday 11 October 2013, the accused attended upon a general practitioner on the Central Coast. The general practitioner gave the accused a referral to see a psychiatrist, and suggested that he attend Wyong Hospital if his symptoms worsened. Later that day, the accused did indeed attend that hospital, seeking to have his medication changed. It is noteworthy that the accused was open about his previous psychotic episode, and expressed the fear that he may have another one soon. The accused agreed to being referred to the Mental Health Community Treatment Team for follow-up in the short term. He was also advised to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, and to continue with the therapy designed by Ms Hatfield.
	
	
	On Saturday 12 October, the Wyong Home Based Mental Health Treatment Team made contact with the accused. On Sunday 13 October, the same team made a home visit to the accused. The accused was anxious and agitated, and remained concerned about changing his medication. He expressed feelings of helplessness. On the other hand, he denied any thoughts of suicide and any intention of harming others.
	
	
	On Monday 14 October 2013, the accused telephoned his former wife. He was rambling. Ms O’Keefe became concerned about his welfare, and called the work superior of the accused to obtain the phone number of the deceased. Eventually she decided to drive to Lake Haven from Sydney, because she was concerned that the accused could harm himself.
	
	
	On that same day the accused rang Ms Helen Lynch, a close friend of the deceased over many years. He claimed that he was well, but that the deceased was unwell. He said that his own daughter was coming to retrieve him, and asked Ms Lynch to look after the deceased. Ms Lynch and her husband commenced to drive from Sydney to Lake Haven. On arrival, they saw the accused in the front yard. Both of them noted that he appeared to have lost a great deal of weight, and indeed seemed to have the appearance of a demented old man. Once inside the home with the accused they noted that he was highly agitated, twitching, and moving his hands and feet. He spoke of hating the new home, and that he was “living a lie”. He also told Ms Lynch that he was worried that the deceased would not be able to look after him “this time”.
	
	
	Meanwhile Ms O’Keefe and her daughter arrived at the house at about 12:30 pm. Ms O’Keefe also noticed that the accused was very fidgety and twitchy. As well as that he was vacant, and was referring obsessively to problems with the new home. At the time of her arrival, the accused was on the telephone to Ms Hatfield. The psychologist noted that her patient was complaining of very little sleep, and a failure on his part to deal with past issues, including an assertion that he had been sexually assaulted as a child. He told her that that morning he had woken up and felt that he needed to go to hospital. He also remarked to Ms Hatfield that he thought that he was “someone else that isn’t there”.
	
	
	Ms Lynch and her husband had gone to find the deceased, having become concerned about her absence from her home. After they located her, she explained that she had gone to a shopping centre because she needed a break from the accused. She reported that he was imagining things.
	
	
	At about 4:30 pm Mr Lochens, a registered nurse from the Wyong Hospital Acute Care Team, attended for a scheduled home visit with the accused. He found the accused sitting on the front lawn with his ex-wife and his daughter. The deceased was inside. At the time the accused was on the phone to Ms Hatfield. After completing the call, the accused was rambling and wandering around aimlessly. Out of the blue, he asked whether he could return to Sydney with his ex-wife, who expressed her agreement. The accused became excited and began packing. Mr Lochens left.
	
	
	When the accused informed the deceased that he was intending to return to Sydney with his ex-wife, she expressed her surprise. A short time later the deceased was able to tell Ms O’Keefe privately that the accused had been in his current state for quite some months. She also explained that doctors had assured her that the accused would not harm himself, and that she, the deceased, was taking time off work in order to care for her partner.
	
	
	The final noteworthy event of that day is that the accused informed his former wife that he had been molested as a child by a family friend. By this time he had announced that he preferred to stay in Lake Haven. Eventually, Ms O’Keefe and her daughter departed, leaving the accused with the deceased.
	
	
	The following day was Tuesday 15 October 2013. At about 9:40 am, the deceased contacted the Wyong Mental Health Community Treatment Team. She reported that the accused had had a “bad day” the day before, and had not slept well the previous night. She reported that the accused was not making sense, and was expressing concern about children having drowned in the pool of their home. She sought advice about medication that could calm him down. She was referred to a general practitioner in that regard, and was advised to bring the accused to Wyong Hospital or call emergency services if her concerns developed.
	
	
	During that day, Ms O’Keefe was unable to reach the accused on his phone. Again, she was sufficiently concerned about the situation to drive from Sydney to Lake Haven. Their daughters accompanied her. A short time after the arrival of that party at the home, the accused and the deceased arrived. The accused was physically and emotionally unresponsive to his daughters. Nor did the accused respond to his former wife, with whom he had proposed to return to live the day before. He did nothing but fiddle with his clothing and fidget. Ms O’Keefe and the two daughters left shortly thereafter.
	
	
	At 4:42 am on the following day, Wednesday 16 October 2013, the accused phoned emergency services. He made it clear that he had stabbed the deceased and himself. Indeed, he was aware that he had killed her. He stated that he had stabbed the deceased “multiple times”. He requested that a Catholic priest be arranged for him. He stated that those violent acts had by no means occurred immediately before the telephone call; indeed, they had occurred about one hour previously.
	
	
	Uniformed police arrived at about 5 am. They found the accused lying on the floor badly injured. Photos in the Crown case suggest that he had adopted the posture of a person who had been crucified, in that his arms were outstretched, with his legs generally together, but one of them at a slight angle. The police also found the deceased. Her face had been the subject of a brutal assault. There were multiple stab wounds apparent to her body. Her clothes were in a bizarre state of disarray.
	
	
	When spoken to by police, the accused freely admitted that he had stabbed the deceased and himself. When asked why he had done so, the accused replied “I dunno, I just did”.
	
	
	Paramedics arrived but, tragically, the deceased passed away in her own home.
	
	
	The accused was taken to a hospital for urgent treatment. Whilst there, the police had a brief conversation with him at about 6:30 am. He recalled screaming and said “it was like I wasn’t there”. When asked why he had stabbed the deceased, he replied “I don’t know”. He spoke of having had a “vision” of a murder/suicide. On the other hand, when asked “Do you know it’s wrong to stab someone?” the accused replied “Of course”. 
	
	
	The accused was airlifted to a hospital in Sydney. He underwent emergency surgery for what were serious wounds. On 17 October 2013, the accused was found to be so mentally ill that he was “scheduled”; that is, involuntarily detained on the basis that he could constitute a danger to himself or others.
	
	
	During the period that the accused was being treated in hospital immediately after 16 October 2013, he was being guarded by police officers. They made a “Guard Duty Log” containing notes of things said by the accused. Some of them were notably bizarre. They include the following (the extracts are taken from the transcriptions contained in the defence exhibits):
	


“I tried to kill myself and my partner, I am Roman Catholic, I had to because I was going to tell my family…” 

“This is how it started I got hypnotised by a priest paedophile by that woman”.  

“To many brain washes for me, they are all friends now brain washes everywhere too late to be re-programmed again”. 

“I can’t forgive her this time, why won’t they let me go”.


	
	When spoken to by a psychiatrist, the accused made a number of other noteworthy comments:
	


“I thought she was going to kill me over the speakers; the speakers were the paedophile; I felt a connection between the priest paedophile and sepakers [sic] I thought Jennifer was going to cut my head off; I’m frightened I might hurt someone…” 

“A baby drowned in the pool, when I was near the pool I collapsed, it was me I nearly drowned in the pool”. 

“I have been trying to get help for weeks, nobody fucking helped. Too late for help now”. 


	
	On 23 October 2013, the accused was discharged from Royal North Shore Hospital. The discharge summary stated that the accused was “severely psychotic with marked agitation on admission.  His speech was incoherent and he had delusions of guilt, such as a baby’s death in his house and fear of being killed.  He was diagnosed with a brief Psychotic Disorder…”
	
	
	On 24 October 2013, the accused was seen by a psychiatrist at Long Bay Hospital. At that stage he was, of course, in custody bail refused with regard to a charge of murder. Dr Smith, Psychiatry Registrar, observed that the accused had “disorganised thought form, incongruous affect and auditory hallucinations… hearing his thoughts loudly in his daughter’s voice”. Dr Smith diagnosed the accused as suffering from a psychotic disorder with depressive symptoms.
	
	
	On 8 November 2013, Dr Oowise prepared a report for the Mental Health Review Tribunal with regard to the accused. He expressed the view that the accused was suffering from moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and required care in a mental health facility until his symptoms resolved.
	
	
	On 21 November 2013, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that the accused was a mentally ill person who should be detained in the mental health facility at Long Bay Hospital, and an order was made to that effect. On 7 February 2014, Dr Chan expressed the opinion that the accused no longer required inpatient treatment.
	
	
	On 12 March 2014, the accused exercised his right to silence when the police sought to interview him about the death of the deceased.
	
	
	An autopsy had been conducted upon the deceased on 17 October 2013. The cause of death was determined to be multiple stab wounds to her chest and abdomen. She was found to have twenty-one separate wounds to her neck, upper left arm, back and torso. There were also defensive wounds to her hands. Blunt force trauma was seen to a number of locations of her face. The pathologist expressed the opinion that that trauma could well have been inflicted by a fist.
	
	
	Finally, to conclude my review of the evidence placed before me, there was no suggestion that, before the events of 16 October 2013, the accused had ever been aggressive, let alone a person prone to acts of ferocious violence. Indeed, his brother described him as a person who had always been gentle.
	


Psychiatric evidence


	
	Dr Westmore saw the accused on 13 December 2013, having been qualified to do so by the solicitor for the accused. It is to be noted that that date is less than two months after the alleged offence. The accused provided Dr Westmore with a history generally consistent with the evidence that I have outlined above. When asked about the events of 2007, the accused stated that they included “believing that I was Jesus Christ, invasions or something like that”.
	
	
	As for his relationship with the deceased, the accused said “I loved my partner, I’m completely at a loss with what I’ve done to her”. He informed Dr Westmore that, about two days before the alleged offence, he formed the view that the bathroom had leaked, and that he could smell something pungent which, to his mind, confirmed that fact. The following day he came to believe that a baby had drowned in the pool of the home, and that was why the home had been sold by its previous owners.
	
	
	As for the incident itself, he said that he had fallen asleep on the lounge. He recalled the deceased coming out of the bedroom. He reported hearing a voice that said “hit me” and hitting the deceased on the chin with his elbow. He went on to say that “after Jenny fell, I had this panic that she was going to get up and kill me”. He could remember thinking, after having stabbed the deceased, “if you’re going to die, I’m going with you”. He confirmed that, eventually, he had positioned himself on the floor of the home “as if I was going to be crucified”.
	
	
	The accused provided Dr Westmore with an unremarkable family history, though it included his use of cannabis at the age of 17 years, and a suggestion that his father had an issue with alcohol and his mother suffered from anxiety.
	
	
	He claimed that, some days before the incident, he had been told to stop his medication suddenly by a medical professional; I interpolate to say that the other evidence placed before me does not support that assertion.
	
	
	Dr Westmore diagnosed the accused as suffering from a depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms in partial remission. The psychiatrist expressed the view that:
	


“Mr O’Keefe was suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic symptoms at the time he killed his partner. He reports that at the time of the incident he heard voices, specifically his partner’s voice telling him to hit her. Mr O’Keefe would have available to him a mental illness defence. He was suffering from a disease of the mind (Major Depression with psychotic symptoms) at the time of the homicide. His mental illness would have totally deprived him of the capacity to know that what he was doing was wrong, both in a moral and legal sense”.


	
	On 31 January 2014, by way of addendum, Dr Westmore confirmed that he had received further material from the solicitor for the accused, but none of it caused him to alter his opinion.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen saw the accused at the request of his solicitors on 31 October 2013, and again on 23 January 2014. He was provided with a large amount of material. He obtained a history from the accused that was broadly consistent with the evidence that I have summarised earlier in this judgment. Dr Nielssen engaged in a detailed document review that was very similar to that engaged in by Dr Westmore, and which does not require further elaboration by me.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed the accused as suffering from a “major depressive illness with psychotic features”. That diagnosis had a number of bases, including but not limited to “perceptual disturbances and mood congruent delusional beliefs”, and “the history of a typical pattern of treatment for the disorder, including for a previous similar episode”.
	
	
	As for the defence of mental illness, Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion:
	


“Mr O’Keefe was thought to have the defence of mental illness open to him, as at the time of the offence he was affected by a severe form of depressive illness with psychotic features, which is a mental illness that provides a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. At the time of the offence itself he was affected by a defect of reason, in the form of the delusional belief that the house was unsound and that a baby had drowned in the pool. He reported being in a confused state at the time of the offence itself and may have experienced hallucinations he took to have come from Ms Dowell, urging him to hit her. As a result of his acute mental illness, I believe that at the time of the offence he was unable to reason with sense or composure about the moral wrongfulness of his actions”.


	
	Dr Westmore provided a further report of 16 June 2014. It records the receipt of more material above and beyond that which was available to the psychiatrist previously. Dr Westmore placed emphasis upon the bizarre contents of the Guard Duty Log. He also referred to material that suggested that, at the time of the episode in 2007, the accused believed that “supermarket chains” meant to do him harm, and that he possessed “special powers and increased levels of energy”. None of the new material caused Dr Westmore to alter his opinion.
	
	
	Finally, Dr Adams saw the accused on behalf of the Crown on 10 September and 26 September 2014. Again, he obtained a history broadly consistent with that obtained by the other two psychiatrists, and consistent with the evidence that I have summarised above. The accused raised the possibility that his father had suffered from depression.
	
	
	The accused confirmed to Dr Adams that he had formed the belief that a baby had drowned in the backyard pool of the home at Lake Haven. He also explained that he had no evidence for that belief, but “just decided, it just hit me”. He also described an odd phenomenon whilst living on the Central Coast whereby he felt that wind commenced blowing through trees as a result of him opening a car door. At the time, he had brooded about it, and had felt it possible that God was interfering with his situation.
	
	
	In describing the stabbing itself, the accused said “thinking back on it it’s like I was in a trance” and “I can remember looking down and seeing my arm going like that [that is, moving to his side]”. The accused described “watching it happen”. He recounted that he at first believed that the deceased had said to him “hit me”, but by the time of the consultation had come to regard that as an “overbearing thought”. Once the deceased was on the ground, he described experiencing a “wave of paranoia”. He confirmed that he himself lay on the floor “like I was dying on the cross”.
	
	
	In the consultations that took place with Dr Adams in September 2014, the accused said things that amply demonstrated that he had come to appreciate the enormity and wrongfulness of what he had done. Of course, by that stage one is well entitled to infer that he had been appropriately medicated for almost a year.
	
	
	Dr Adams engaged in a thorough review of the documents that is reflective of my own summary earlier in this judgment.
	
	
	Dr Adams expressed the opinion that as at 16 October 2013, the accused was suffering from “a major depressive illness with psychotic symptoms prior to and at the material time of the offence”. Dr Adams expressed the understanding that such a condition is commonly accepted as being a “disease of the mind”.
	
	
	Dr Adams regarded the incomplete amnesia on the part of the accused with regard to the alleged offence as psychiatrically plausible.
	
	
	Dr Adams considered that, at the relevant time, the accused was suffering from an “impaired capacity for rational thought”.
	
	
	Finally, Dr Adams expressed the opinion that “it is reasonable to conclude that the accused would not have been able to reason about the wrongfulness of engaging in the alleged offence with a moderate degree of composure”. As well as that, Dr Adams considered it possible that the accused was not fully aware of the nature and quality of his alleged acts. Having said that, Dr Adams immediately noted the things said by the accused in the 000 phone call, which were to opposite effect.
	


The offence of murder


	
	In ordinary circumstances, in order for a verdict of guilty of murder to be properly returned in this Court, the Crown must persuade the tribunal of fact beyond reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily did an act within the state of New South Wales that caused the death of the deceased and, at the time of the commission of that act, the accused possessed one of three states of mind, or the doctrine of constructive murder applied.
	
	
	However, when the defence of mental illness is relied upon by an accused person, the authorities establish that special rules apply. In particular, the elements that the Crown must prove in the first instance are more circumscribed: see Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; (1994) 179 CLR 500 at 517; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; (2005) 63 NSWLR 490 at [32]. In those circumstances, the Crown must prove merely that the accused voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased. And in determining whether a voluntary act has been established beyond reasonable doubt, the tribunal of fact is to disregard any evidence of mental abnormality that could found the affirmative defence: see Hawkins v The Queen at 510, 512-13, 517; R v Minani at [32]. It is only if that affirmative defence fails to be established that proof of the mental elements of murder need to be considered.
	
	
	In this case, on the evidence placed before me, and bearing in mind the joint position of the parties, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did an act that caused the death of the deceased; namely, stabbing her repeatedly. The evidence is overwhelmingly to that effect, and is, to my mind, incontrovertible.
	
	
	As for the question of whether or not that was a voluntary act, I have already noted the things said by the accused to Dr Adams that were suggestive that perhaps his actions were not voluntary in the sense that the law understands that concept: see Ryan v The Queen [1967] HCA 2; (1967) 121 CLR 205. But I repeat that that question needs to be determined without reference to any evidence of mental abnormality. Because I consider that the symptoms described by the accused to Dr Adams fall into that category, I put them to one side. Having done so, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established that the acts of the accused in bashing and repeatedly stabbing the deceased were willed movements of his muscles. Again, defence counsel did not seek to persuade me to the contrary.
	
	
	In short, I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the necessary elements of murder have been established by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt.
	


The defence of mental illness


	
	I turn to consider the affirmative defence of mental illness. In doing so I remind myself of the contents of s 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), which calls upon me as the tribunal of fact to reflect upon the consequences of a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	
	
	Although referred to in s 38 of the Act, the defence is a creature of common law and not statute. Its elements were set out well over 150 years ago in McNaghten's Case (1843) 8 ER 718 at [722]. The defence is established if it is more probable than not that:
	


“at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.”


	
	In The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182, Dixon J (as his Honour then was) elaborated upon the latter portion of that test. In summing up to a jury, his Honour said:
	


“If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people”.

Since then, criminal courts on countless occasions have accepted that that passage is a correct explanation of the latter part of the defence of mental illness.


	
	It can be seen therefore that, in order for the defence to be made out, the accused must prove on the balance of probabilities that, at the time of the act causing death, he was suffering from a disease of the mind which led to a defect of reason, and that that defect of reason led him to fail to appreciate the nature and quality of his act, or to fail to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act, not only in a theoretical or legal sense, but also in a deeper, moral sense.
	
	
	Turning to the question of whether the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind at the time of his acts, I accept the unanimous psychiatric evidence that the accused was suffering from a major depressive illness with psychotic symptoms. To be clear, it is not merely a matter of accepting that the accused was down, or sad, or unhappy with his new home. The expert opinion of the psychiatrists and the surrounding circumstances established by the other evidence go far beyond that. To my mind, as part of his severe depression, the accused had become divorced from reality. To repeat: the accused had come to believe, thoroughly irrationally, that a young child had drowned in the pool of his home. At the time of his fatal actions, the accused had come to believe that the deceased could harm him. And in the days after the death of the deceased when the accused was detained in a hospital, and detailed notes were being made by police officers of what he was saying, he said a number of things that amply demonstrate that he had become separated from the real world.
	
	
	In short, I consider that the first leg of the affirmative defence has been made out.
	
	
	As for the second leg; namely, whether the accused was suffering from a defect of reason, founded upon the evidence that I have summarised above, and again upon the unanimous decision of three psychiatrists (one of whom was qualified on behalf the Crown) I am amply satisfied that the accused’s thoughts were irrational, and his beliefs were not founded in reality. I am satisfied that that state of affairs constituted a defect of reason.
	
	
	As for the first part of the third leg, I am not satisfied that, at the time he attacked the deceased, the accused did not understand the nature and quality of his act. To the contrary, I believe that the accused well understood, in an objective sense, the nature and quality of what he was doing – that is, attacking the deceased and seriously wounding her – and, immediately afterwards, what he had done. That understanding, after all, informed his decision to try to kill himself. As well as that, it is quite clear from the transcript of the Triple 0 call that he well understood the nature and quality of his attack on the deceased. In that respect, I accept the opinion of Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen that implicitly rejects that leg of the defence. To the extent that the opinion of Dr Adams raises it is a possibility, so much may be accepted; however, I do not consider that it has been established on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The final question is whether the accused has established that, at the time of his acts, the defect of reason from which he was suffering led him to fail to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. Again, all three psychiatrists were unanimous in the opinion that the accused did fail to possess that appreciation.
	
	
	I give those opinions great weight. But there are other aspects of the evidence, not founded upon expert opinion, that support the proposition as well. It is to be recalled that the accused is a man who has not demonstrated violent conduct, or even an aggressive disposition, in the past. And yet it is clear that the deceased was severely wounded multiple times. It is also the case that there was no motive whatsoever for the accused to inflict fatal violence upon the deceased. To the contrary, it seems that she was prepared to tolerate his mental and emotional difficulties, and indeed to do her best to care for him and help him. Whatever other things were going wrong in the life of the accused, his relationship with the deceased was not one of them. The evidence from all sources, including people who were much closer to the deceased than they were to the accused, is that they were a happy, loving couple.
	
	
	I consider that the commission of these acts inherently demonstrates, to a degree at least, that the accused at the time was incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of what he was doing, and indeed did not do so. I repeat that, to my mind, the severity of the attack, its irrationality, and the lack of any motive for it, support the proposition that the person who inflicted it did not appreciate its profound wrongfulness.
	
	
	I have not overlooked what the accused said to the police officer at hospital; namely that “Of course” it is wrong to stab someone. That speaks against the establishment of this leg of the defence. But it needs to be recalled that that was quite some time after the fatal acts, and at a time when the accused was in a hospital and being treated. One also needs to consider the depth of moral understanding that stood behind that curt, almost dismissive, statement. I regard that statement by the accused as significant but not determinative of the question.
	
	
	Speaking more generally about the psychiatric evidence, I have not failed to consider the question of whether or not the accused could have been feigning his symptoms, and lying to the psychiatrists, in order to obtain some sort of advantage, having been charged with murder. After all, the accused is a mature man who has not suffered from a chronic mental illness such as schizophrenia. He had been able to hold down a responsible job, and to enjoy satisfactory intimate and family relationships. As well as that, the time taken by the accused between the attack and calling Triple 0 gives one pause for thought. Those factors have led me to reflect carefully on the question. Having done so, I have satisfied myself that the accused has not been dishonest about his mental state. That is based upon the following aspects of the evidence.
	
	
	First, it is clear that the accused suffered a serious psychotic illness in 2007. That is soundly established by evidence from doctors and laypersons.
	
	
	Secondly, it is clear that, between 2007 and 2013, the accused continued to suffer from mental and emotional difficulties. So much is amply documented in the evidence before me from objective sources.
	
	
	Thirdly, many persons saw the deterioration in the mental (and indeed physical) state of the accused in the weeks leading up to the death of the deceased. Some of those people were closer to the deceased than they were to the accused, and therefore have no motive to give evidence that tends in his favour.
	
	
	Fourthly, none of the highly experienced forensic psychiatrists who saw the accused and expressed expert opinions in this matter came to the view that the accused was feigning his symptoms, or even expressed a note of caution about it. Nor did any of the psychiatrists who saw the accused after he was hospitalised and subsequently incarcerated.
	
	
	Fifthly, there has been very substantial consistency in the histories that the accused has given to a large number of medical experts.
	
	
	Sixthly and finally, the truth is that the disposition of the accused if the special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness is returned – that is, mandatory indefinite detention – is hardly advantageous to an accused person, even one charged with the most serious offence known to law.
	
	
	In short, having considered the question, I accept the truthfulness of the histories that the accused has given, and the symptoms that he has described.
	
	
	Finally, it is true that, as the tribunal of fact, I am not compelled to accept expert evidence, even unanimous evidence from eminent experts in their field, and tendered by opposing parties. But having said that, I should be very slow to reject such evidence unless I have a sound reason for doing so. To my mind, not only are the reports that were placed before me cogent and persuasive, they are also soundly consistent with all of the surrounding circumstances established by the evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied of the second aspect of the third leg of the defence; namely, that at the time the accused committed the fatal acts, he did not appreciate the moral wrongfulness of what he was doing. Indeed, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was incapable of considering the question “with a moderate degree of sense and composure”.
	
	
	In short, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven the necessary elements of murder in the circumstances of this case. But I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused has made out the defence of mental illness. It follows that I accept the joint submission of the parties that the appropriate verdict is “not guilty on the ground of mental illness”.
	


Explanation of meaning and effect of verdict


	
	There are three aspects of that verdict that I wish to emphasise for the understanding of the community generally, and in particular for those who loved the deceased.
	
	
	First, although the accused will not be held criminally responsible for the death of the deceased due to his mental state in the early hours of 16 October 2013, there is no question but that his acts directly caused her death.
	
	
	Secondly, that verdict does not lessen this tragedy for a moment, and the enormity of the taking of the life of a fellow human being, Jennifer Lynne Dowell.
	
	
	Thirdly, nor should that verdict be taken as lessening the recognition by the criminal justice system of the pain that the loss of the deceased has caused. I extend my condolences to all of those who have suffered, and will do so long into the future, as a result of the events of 16 October 2013.
	
	
	Fourthly, although s 39(1) of the Act permits the immediate release in limited circumstances of persons found not guilty on the ground of mental illness, there is not the slightest question of that being appropriate in the case of this frenzied and fatal attack. To the contrary, the effect of my verdict will be that the accused will be committed to the long-term care of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Pursuant to s 43(a) of the Act, that Tribunal must not release the accused into the community unless and until it is satisfied that the accused will not seriously endanger any person, including himself.
	


Orders


	
	On the count of murder, I return a special verdict that the accused, Bruce Francis O’Keefe, is not guilty on the ground of mental illness.
	
	
	The accused is to be detained at the Hamden Unit of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater, or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law.
	
	
	The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court.
	
	
	The Registrar is to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court, and to provide that Tribunal with the following documentation:
	



	
	A copy of these reasons for verdict and orders;
	
	
	A transcript of these proceedings, including of the mentions of 3 February 2015 and 11 February 2015; and

2765915,El-Haddad v R [2015] NSWCCA 10,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Mr El-Haddad, was charged with four counts of importing marketable quantities of heroin, cocaine and ephedrine, contrary to ss 307.2(1) and 307.12(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (‘Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5’), and the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely some 16 kilograms of heroin, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Code (‘Count 4’).

Evidence relevant to each of the counts was admitted without restriction at Mr El-Haddad’s trial although an objection to broadly worded notices pursuant to ss 97 and 98 was flagged at the outset. Shortly before the close of the Crown case, a further notice pursuant to ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act was sent by the prosecutor identifying with precision the evidence that had been adduced in the course of the trial. Immediately following the close of the Crown case, the Crown sought a ruling in accordance with the later notice. The primary judge held that the original notices were insufficient, but that the second notice was sufficiently specific to satisfy the requirements of ss 97 and 98. His Honour held that the evidence in question had significant probative value, and was capable of being perceived by the jury as significantly probative, and found that he should admit the evidence as tendency and coincidence evidence accordingly.

At the close of the Crown case, Mr El-Haddad sought a directed verdict in relation to Count 4. The primary judge rejected this application on the basis that inquiries as to the costs associated with the transportation and storage of drugs were actions which fulfilled the definition of dealing with the substance in connection with its importation in accordance with the expanded definition of “import” inserted by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth).

The jury convicted Mr El-Haddad on all five charges. He appealed against his conviction. The grounds of appeal challenged the admission of evidence with respect to Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 as tendency and/or coincidence evidence with respect to Count 4, and vice versa. Mr El-Haddad also challenged the trial judge’s dismissal of his application for a directed verdict on Count 4, and argued that the jury’s verdict with respect to Count 4 was unsafe and unsatisfactory, and not supported by the evidence.

Held, dismissing the appeal (per Leeming JA, McCallum and R A Hulme JJ agreeing):

Admissibility of evidence

1. Sections 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) do not preclude the admissibility of evidence per se, but rather are rules precluding the admissibility of evidence to prove a “particular matter”, which must be read with ss 94 and 95 of the Act: at [34]-[36], [38].

Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 21; 87 ALJR 668, followed

DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758, considered

2. Section 95 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) constrains the use which may be made of evidence even if it is relevant and admitted and available to be used for another purpose, including where the evidence is not ‘tendency evidence’ or ‘coincidence evidence’. When a trial is by judge and jury, that will ordinarily require a direction to be given: at [38]-[42].

R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504, considered and applied

3. In the present case, s 95 was applicable, such that evidence relevant to Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 which was not relevant to Count 4 except insofar as it might be admissible as tendency or coincidence evidence, could not be used for either purpose unless ss 97, 98 and 101 were satisfied. Conversely, evidence relevant to Count 4 which was not relevant to the other charges except insofar as it involved tendency or coincidence reasoning could not be used for that purpose unless ss 97, 98 and 101 were satisfied: at [43].

4. Consideration of the relationship between the “tendency rule” and the “coincidence rule”, the requirement to give notices, and the content of such notices: at [46]-[56].

KJR v R [2007] NSWCCA 165; 173 A Crim R 226; Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504; Bryant v R [2011] NSWCCA 26; 205 A Crim R 531, referred to and applied

5. Tendency evidence may possess significant probative value depending on the degree of generality or specificity with which the “tendency” is stated. That is, the specificity of the tendency directly informs the strength of the inferential mode of reasoning: at [70]-[72].

Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136; Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306, referred to

Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55, considered

6. Evidence which supports tendency or coincidence reasoning turns on whether there are relevant similarities or differences; relevant dissimilarities may dilute the probative value of the evidence: at [74]-[75].

Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55, applied

Directed verdict

7. The words “import” and “importation” are not co-extensive. The “means and includes” definition of “import” deems the legal meaning of “import” to include “deal with the substance in connection with its importation”. This must be construed to mean something beyond bringing the substance into Australia. There must be a “dealing” and the dealing must be “in connection with” importation. In this context, “importation” refers to a broad process, rather than a physical act which ceases when the substance arrives in Australia: at [100]-[104].

R v Tranter [2013] SASCFC 61; 116 SASR 452; Leff v R (1996) 86 A Crim R 212; R v Nolan [2012] NSWCCA 126; 83 NSWLR 534, considered and applied

Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth), considered

8. A ‘dealing’ with tangible property may involve either a physical process or a legal process. However, a price inquiry is not of itself a ‘dealing’, as it is neither a physical dealing with a thing, nor is it a legal dealing with the thing: at [109]-[110], [112].

R v Tranter [2013] SASCFC 61; 116 SASR 452 ; Van Oppen & Co v Tredegars Ltd (1921) 37 TLR 504; Australian Provincial Assurance Co Ltd v Coroneo (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 700, applied

9. The communications in question were not mere price inquiries but rather were assertions of ownership clearly connected with the importation of the heroin, and as such were dealings with the goods, within the meaning of the Code: at [114]-[117]. The primary judge was correct to dismiss the application for a directed verdict in respect of Count 4, although for different reasons: at [119]-[120].

Challenge to jury verdict

10. Consideration of the circumstances in which leave will be granted to hear an appeal under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, when only limited submissions and materials had been provided to the Court: at [121]-[127].

Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA:  Mr Ghabi El-Haddad was convicted of five drug importation charges under s 307 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (Code) following a trial lasting 16 days before a judge and jury of 12. The grounds of his appeal against conviction are directed to challenging the guilty verdict on Count 4, which was, by far, the most serious charge, and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment for 15 years, dating from 4 May 2013.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal fall into two classes. Grounds 1 and 2 challenge the admission of evidence with respect to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 as tendency and/or coincidence evidence with respect to count 4, and vice versa. In order to explain why I have concluded no such error is made out, it will be necessary to explain some of the detail of the evidence adduced in relation to all five importations, and the course of the trial.
	
	
	Ground 3 challenges the trial judge’s dismissal of the appellant’s application for a directed verdict on count 4, while ground 4 contends that the jury’s verdict with respect to count 4 is “unsafe and unsatisfactory, and not supported by the evidence”. These grounds turn on the Code’s expanded definition of “import”, introduced in 2010. I have concluded that the primary judge applied an incorrect legal test when dismissing that application, but that nevertheless his Honour was correct to conclude that the appellant had a case to answer, and that leave should not be granted in respect of ground 4.
	


The Crown case against the appellant


	
	The indictment contained five charges. One charge, count 4, alleged the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely 16,860.8 grams of heroin, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Code. The other counts alleged the importation of marketable quantities of heroin, cocaine and ephedrine (which is a border controlled precursor), contrary to ss 307.2(1) and 307.12(1) of the Code.
	
	
	Importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment; importing a marketable quantity carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. In the case of heroin, a marketable quantity is 2 grams, and a commercial quantity is 1.5 kilograms: Code, s 314.4.
	
	
	Count 1 was that on about 9 June 2010 the appellant imported 66.8 grams of heroin. Count 2 was that on about 23 September 2010, he imported 310.2 grams of cocaine. Count 3 was that on 3 October 2010, he imported 1,268.6 grams of heroin. Count 5 was that on about 30 January 2011, he imported 968 grams of ephedrine. There was no dispute that drugs were imported inside various packages, nor was there any dispute about weight or purity. As will be seen below, the appellant personally took possession of the packages the subject of counts 1 and 5; the only real issue by the end of the trial on these counts was whether he was shown to have the requisite knowledge of the heroin and ephedrine contained within the packages.
	
	
	There were many similarities between counts 1, 2, 3 and 5, which need not be recounted for the purposes of this appeal. What follows focusses on the similarities and dissimilarities between the evidence adduced in relation to those counts, and that adduced in respect of count 4.
	


(a) Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 – marketable quantities of border controlled drugs and precursor


	
	In the case of Count 1, a package covered in cream coloured hessian arrived at Merrylands post office in western Sydney in late May or early June 2010, addressed to “Pouln Mills”, at 44 Locksley Avenue, Merrylands 2160, Sydney Australia, with contact telephone number given as +61 41X XX 224. The package contained, among other things, mechanical valves in which were concealed 66.8 grams of heroin.
	
	
	The appellant telephoned Australia Post on 2 June and asked for the package to be redirected to GPO Box 3058. The appellant had leased that post office box the previous September. On 9 June 2010, the appellant attempted to collect the consignment personally, but was told he needed a written authority from the addressee. Later that day, he sent an email to the GPO, signed in the name P Mills, stating that he had authority to collect the consignment. The Post Office alerted the Australian Federal Police to the package and federal agents attended. While they were there, the appellant attended again to collect the package pursuant to the authority he had emailed. The officers asked him to participate in a recorded interview. The appellant said that he could not do so then, but an interview took place two days later on 11 June. During that interview, the appellant admitted sending the email (“Look, can I admit on something? Yes they did, and I emailed it myself as it’s his, okay, from my own email address. I just told, Look, blah, blah, blah, blah, authorising, whatever, and then she said to me, Yeah, that’s fine”). He said he was collecting the package at the request of a friend, Paul Mills. The appellant was not charged.
	
	
	The Crown case in relation to counts 2 and 3 may conveniently be summarised together. In September and October 2010, consignments were imported into Australia from Quezon City in the Philippines and New Delhi, India containing (a) 310.2 grams of pure cocaine concealed inside a chopping board and (b) 1,268.6 grams of pure heroin concealed inside mechanical valves. The chopping board which concealed cocaine was in a FedEx box, and was flown as air cargo to Sydney. The carton containing the heroin concealed in mechanical valves appears to have been flown as air cargo by TNT. The consignee for both packages was JG Hancock Pty Ltd, whose address was stated to be Level 1, 57-59 Parramatta Rd, Lidcombe with a contact telephone number of +612 800X X924.
	
	
	The woman who, according to ASIC records, was the sole director and shareholder of JG Hancock Pty Ltd, gave evidence that she was a friend of the appellant but was unaware of the directorship or shareholding. The materials suggest that she appeared to suffer from an intellectual impairment. After the conclusion of her evidence, the judge said words to the effect that she was “obviously considerably disabled”. When interviewed by customs agents, the appellant said “I think she’s mentally not there”.
	
	
	In October 2010, a federal agent attended premises at Level 1, 57-59 Parramatta Rd Lidcombe and met the appellant, who gave him a United Trade Card business card. The deposit on the lease for Suite 2 at the Lidcombe address was paid by a cheque drawn on the account of “G Haddad t/a United Trade Card” and signed by the appellant. The telephone number on the business card was the same telephone number stated on both packages, +612 800X X924. Despite being linked to the delivery address, the appellant did not ultimately take possession of the packages the subject of counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	In relation to Count 5, a DHL cardboard box was imported into Australia on 30 January 2011 from Mumbai, India containing 968 grams of pure ephedrine concealed inside metal rollers. DHL caused the box to be flown from Mumbai to Sydney via Singapore. The consignee was Marcos Steven, of JG Hancock Pty Ltd, Level 1, 55-57 Parramatta Rd Lidcombe (the same consignee and address as in counts 2 and 3). Delivery was attempted, but there was no JG Hancock Pty Ltd at that address. DHL received a telephone call from a man saying he was “Michael” and requesting that the consignment be delivered to JG Hancock Pty Ltd, Level 1, 14 Telopea Avenue, Homebush. At that building, the appellant accepted delivery of the box; as will be seen below, he had rented those premises shortly beforehand, with a United Trade Card cheque signed by him dated 25 January 2011.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, on 4 February 2011, pursuant to a warrant, customs officers seized the package and conducted a search of the premises. The search was filmed and recorded. Customs officers took a computer tower, a 2011 diary and five mobile phones. The computer tower recorded the phone number which “Michael” had provided to DHL and had also been used to access the DHL website, to track the progress of the box. The 2011 diary contained information principally relevant to count 4 which is addressed below.
	


(b) Count 4 – a commercial quantity of heroin


	
	Count 4 was different. Evidence relating to it occupied most of the trial. First, the importation occurred by sea. The vessel MOL Seabreeze arrived in Brisbane on 4 January and Sydney on 8 January 2011. There were two bills of lading in evidence. Both stated that the container was loaded in Karachi, Pakistan, with destination Sydney. The shipper was “Kay-Tee Industries”, Sialkot, Pakistan. One stated that the consignee was the freight forwarder Henning Harders Australia Pty Ltd, of William St in Sydney; it also stated that the agent at destination was Henning Harders, and the actual carrier was ANL Singapore Pte Ltd. The other stated that the consignee was World Star 88 Pty Ltd, 65 Bourke St, North Parramatta with two contact telephone numbers:  +612 405 XXX 202 and +612 298 XXX 766. (Some of the numbers appear to have more or fewer digits than might be expected; throughout these reasons, the numbers are reproduced as they appear in the evidence.) It seems likely that the differences in the bills of lading reflect the freight forwarders’ ordinary processes; in any event, nothing turns on them.
	
	
	Both bills of lading described the goods as “3 pieces of machines”. In the container were two large metal lathes containing 16,860.8 grams of pure heroin; the other piece of machinery was not specified.
	
	
	In evidence was an undated letter sent on the letterhead of the shipper, Kay-Tee Industries, in Pakistan to Henning Harders (a witness said that it had been sent by email) in these terms:
	


“TO,

         ANL

	The letter was linked to the appellant in at least three ways. First, the 924 telephone number was the same telephone number on the appellant’s United Trade Card business card, and had been used on the packages the subjects of counts 2, 3 and 5. Secondly, the appellant signed an application for serviced offices at 309 Kent St on 10 March 2009. Thirdly, the new consignee, Esaan Enterprises Pty Ltd, had been incorporated on 16 September 2010. Its sole director and shareholder was the same woman who had been named as the sole director and shareholder of JG Hancock Pty Ltd. Again, she gave evidence that she was unaware of the directorship or shareholding, and denied that the signature on the ASIC application form was hers. The registered office and place of business of Esaan Enterprises was Level 1, 55-59 Parramatta Rd, Lidcombe, and GPO Box 3058. It will be recalled that (a) the street address was very similar to that given for JG Hancock Pty Ltd, and (b) the post office box had been leased by the appellant.
	
	
	On 24 and 25 February 2011, the mobile telephone number 0420 XXX 986 made calls to Henning Harders enquiring about the storage costs and the cost of sending the container to various African countries. The caller gave carlos2011@live.com.au as the contact email address.
	
	
	Mr Dion Williamson, an export manager at Henning Harders, exchanged emails with carlos2011@live.com.au on 14 and 15 March 2011. Their subject was “CONTAINER EXPORT – EAST AFRICA”. That dated 14 March 2011 said:
	


“Hi Carlos,

I have some rates as requested to East Africa, with a couple of options on shipping lines.

There is the matter of outstanding import storage, detention, oceanfreight and Sydney port charges which we need to raise an invoice. The longer this cargo sits on the wharf the more it is costing you.

Please contact me so we can go through thoroughly .... Recently left 2 messages for you on your mobile.”


	
	That dated 15 March was as follows:
	


“G’day Carlos,

As discussed yesterday attached is a detailed quotation, which includes storage, detention, freight and import terminal fees till the end of March 2011.

The matter of the original bill of lading is still outstanding, please let me know how you are progressing with this.

Please forward your new mobile number when you have a chance.

If you have any problems or queries do not hesitate to contact me.”

Attached was a quotation for carriage from Sydney to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania via Malaysia.


	
	There was uncontroversial evidence that the email address carlos2011@live.com.au was accessed on 12 March and 16 April 2011 from an IP address subscribed to by the appellant’s mother at Chester Hill. The appellant had been arrested on 4 February 2011 following his receipt of the DHL carton which constitutes count 5, and released on bail. A term of his bail was that he reside at his mother’s address.
	
	
	There was also uncontroversial evidence that the email address of carlos2011@live.com.au was created on 26 January 2011 at an IP address subscribed to by the appellant’s father in law at an address in Punchbowl. In his interview, the appellant admitted that he had changed the password for this email address. Another email address, carlos2011@bigpond.com, was created on 27 January 2011, with a billing address which was similar to the revised delivery address for the Count 5 consignment. The name of the subscriber was given as Carolos Haviv, and his date of birth was 3 August 1975 (the appellant’s date of birth was 3 August 1972). On 25 January 2011 a mobile number, 0415 XXX 326 was subscribed in the name of Carlos Haviv with date of birth 13 August 1975. There was also evidence that on 2 February 2011, the appellant signed a contract for the supply of a printer using the false name of Carlos Franken, stating a birth date of 3 September 1972 and a contact email of carlos2011@live.com.au.
	
	
	On 6 April 2011, Henning Harders telephoned the number given for Esaan Enterprises, +612 800X X924. The receptionist of the serviced offices left a message for the appellant which included:
	


“Container arrived from

K-T Industries

Had spoken to Carlos previously.

Rang United Trade Card asking for Carlos.”


	
	Within the 2011 diary which was seized by customs agents when the appellant accepted delivery of the DHL package containing ephedrine, on the pages for 27-30 January 2011, were recorded, in the appellant’s hand:
	


“Carlos Haviv 3/8/75

0420 XXX 911

8662 XXX 800

02 97XX X001

Carlos2011@bigpond.com

Carlos Eduardo Franken

DHL”


	
	A copy of the quote from Henning Harders supplied on 15 March 2011, which had been sent by email to carlos2011@live.com.au, was located on a computer seized from the Chester Hill address. Part of an envelope on which was handwritten “Esaan Enterprises” and “Henning Harders (Aust) PL” was seized in a bedroom used by the appellant in Punchbowl. The envelope contained the appellant’s fingerprints. A letter from the Australian Taxation Office addressed to Esaan Enterprises at GPO Box 3058 was seized from the appellant’s wife’s car. Also in the car was a Telstra receipt and mobile telephone contract in the name of Esaan Enterprises Pty Ltd with “Mr Gaby Haddad” named as the company representative. The SIM card for 0420 XXX 986, one of the numbers recorded as making calls to Henning Harders in February and March 2011, was also seized from the appellant’s wife’s car. The SIM card for 0415 XXX 326, subscribed to in the name of Carlos Haviv, was seized at the appellant’s serviced office.
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was that the appellant used the name Carlos Haviv, and the email address carlos2011@live.com.au. By the time the ruling as to tendency and coincidence evidence was sought, that aspect of the case was overpowering, having regard (inter alia) to (i) the presence in the appellant’s wife’s car of the SIM card for 0420 XXX 986, which was used to contact Henning Harders in the name of Carlos when the carlos2011@live.com.au email address was given, (ii) the fact that the email address had been created at the appellant’s father in law’s house, (iii) the messages for Carlos which were left with the staff at the appellant’s serviced offices, (iv) that whilst on bail, the email address carlos2011@live.com.au was accessed from the address at which the appellant was required to reside, and the computer which contained the Henning Harders quote for carriage of the container to Dar es Salaam was seized at that address, and (v) the names, dates of birth and telephone numbers in the diary seized by customs agents on 4 February 2011.
	


(c) Comparing and contrasting counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 with count 4


	
	It may now assist to summarise some of the differences and similarities between the conduct alleged to constitute count 4 as opposed to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5.
	
	
	The differences included the following:
	



	
	Count 4 involved carriage by sea, by container, using a freight forwarder, of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The lathe containing the heroin was not in fact delivered to the appellant, and it was not established how indeed physical delivery could have been effected.
	
	
	The quantity and purity were much higher (the mixtures concealed in the valves in count 1 weighed no more than 1.33 grams, and contained caffeine, paracetamol and between 4% and 6% heroin; the mixtures concealed in the lathes each weighed 1 kilogram, and contained between 59% and 64% heroin).
	
	
	The importation by sea from Pakistan was in many ways more sophisticated than the other counts which involved small packages sent by post or by air cargo using door to door carriers; the primary judge said that:
	


“it required a metallurgist to detect the anomalies in the lathe equipment that led to the finding of a cavity concealing the drugs. It also required substantial engineering equipment to expose the concealed cavity. This importation is a very serious offence both in its sophistication and in regard to the quantity of heroin imported which is said to be worth in the vicinity of seven million dollars wholesale.”


	
	The similarities included the following:
	



	
	Just as in the case of counts 2, 3 and 5, the consignee for count 4 was a company whose sole director and shareholder was a woman who said she was unaware of JG Hancock or Esaan Enterprises.
	
	
	Just as in counts 2, 3 and 5, where the consignee’s stated address was Level, 1 57-59 Parramatta Road, Lidcombe, the registered principal place of business for the eventual count 4 consignee, Esaan Enterprises, was Level 1, 55-59 Parramatta Road, Lidcombe.
	
	
	Just as in the case of count 1, the new consignee’s address for count 4 was an address linked to the appellant. The appellant had leased GPO Box 3058 (the address to which the hessian wrapped package was redirected), and premises at 309 Kent St (the address of Esaan Enterprises given on the letter from Kay-Tee Industries).
	
	
	Just as in the case of count 1, the Crown case was that the appellant had impersonated the consignee for count 4. The appellant had admitted that he had sent an email pretending to be from Pouln Mills stating that he was authorised to collect the hessian package. Likewise, the Crown said that the appellant created Esaan Enterprises and used Ms Koehler’s name. One of the addresses given to ASIC for Esaan Enterprises was GPO Box 3058, which the appellant had leased.
	
	
	The consignee’s contact telephone number given for counts 2, 3 and 5 was +612 800X X924. The ASIC form to register Esaan Enterprises, the new consignee in count 4, gave as the contact telephone number 02 800X X925.
	
	
	The FedEx account listed the phone number for JG Hancock, used in respect of count 2, as +61 424 XXX 229. The same number was recorded as an incoming call to Henning Harders on 10 March 2011 at 2.30pm. The subscriber’s address for that number was Priam St, Chester Hill, where the appellant’s mother lives. It was a condition of the appellant’s bail that he reside at that address.
	


Grounds 1 and 2 – tendency and coincidence evidence

(a) The statutory provisions


	
	Section 94 provides a series of exceptions from the application of Ch 3 Pt 3.6 (ss 94-101) (to evidence relating only to the credibility of a witness, to a proceeding relating to bail or sentencing, or if character, reputation, conduct or tendency is a fact in issue); it is not presently applicable. Sections 95, 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) relevantly provide as follows:
	


95 Use of evidence for other purposes

(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

(2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.


	
	Section 101 refers to “tendency evidence” and “coincidence evidence”. Those terms are defined in the Dictionary:
	


“‘tendency evidence’ means evidence of a kind referred to in section 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.

‘coincidence evidence’ means evidence of a kind referred to in section 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.”


	
	I return below to the importance of the purpose of the evidence being adduced, which is an element of both definitions.
	
	
	Sections 97 and 98 took their current form following amendments made by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW) with effect from 1 January 2009. The provisions replace the common law tests applicable to “similar fact” evidence. In DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at [46], this Court referred to the High Court decisions prior to 2007 which, although variously formulated, required similar fact evidence to have a sufficiently high degree of probative value. A similar requirement exists under the statute. As Whealy JA, who delivered the leading judgment of this Court constituted by five judges, said at [48]-[49]:
	


“In its terms, the purpose of the coincidence rule is to render inadmissible similar fact evidence unless prior notice of the use of such evidence has been given, and unless the Court thinks that the evidence either by itself or having regard to other evidence to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence will have significant probative value.

In criminal proceedings, s 101, as has been seen, imposes an additional hurdle to the admission or use of coincidence evidence. The probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.”


	
	There is presently a divergence between New South Wales and Victorian appellate decisions on these provisions: see Velkoski v The Queen [2014] VSCA 121 at [164] and Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [35]-[37]. It will not be necessary, in order to resolve this appeal, to address those differences in any detail. There are also subtleties in these provisions which may not be well understood; certainly, they were not mentioned at trial or on this appeal.
	
	
	First, it is important to observe that ss 97 and 98 are rules precluding the admissibility of evidence to prove a “particular matter” (to use the language of s 95). Section 97 provides that “evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind” unless its requirements are satisfied. Section 98 provides that “evidence that two or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally” unless its requirements are satisfied. It is convenient to denote the modes of reasoning precluded by ss 97 and 98 as “tendency reasoning” and “coincidence reasoning” respectively.
	
	
	In addition to the requirements of ss 97 and 98, in a criminal trial, s 101 requires (subject to presently irrelevant exceptions) that tendency evidence and coincidence evidence cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.
	
	
	Neither s 97 nor s 98 precludes the admissibility of evidence per se. The sections make evidence inadmissible for a particular purpose, namely, to prove “particular matters”. Those sections must be read with ss 95 and 94, as the High Court said in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 21; 87 ALJR 668 at [30]. Section 95 constrains the use which may be made of evidence even if it is relevant and admitted and available to be used for another purpose. When a trial is by judge and jury, that will ordinarily require a direction to be given.
	
	
	The importance of s 95 in this context was noticed by Ireland J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Levine J agreed, in R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708. In that trial there was evidence which was admissible as part of “the essential background against which the evidence of the complainant and of the accused necessarily fall to be evaluated” (quoting the language of Deane J in B v The Queen [1992] HCA 68; 175 CLR 599 at 610). Ireland J said that “[o]nce admitted for that purpose, however, the evidence cannot also be used as tendency evidence in the sense that, because the accused had the guilty passion, he did the act in question unless it does comply with [the requirements of ss 97 and 101], and the judge should direct the jury that they may not use it in that way unless it does comply”.
	
	
	Secondly, and consistently with the foregoing, the definitions of “tendency evidence” and “coincidence evidence” refer to a party’s purpose in tendering the evidence. It may be that the primary purpose of adducing evidence is to establish one count, although there is a secondary purpose of relying on tendency or coincidence reasoning to establish another count. That was the position in this case, and was considered by Simpson J in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 at [135] (emphasis in original):
	


“The evidence under consideration was not coincidence evidence strictly so called. That is because ‘coincidence evidence’ is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as evidence that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose of establishing that, because of the improbability of two or more related events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. The evidence that was, in this case, referred to as coincidence evidence was, in reality, evidence tendered by the DPP to support one charge or the other. All of the evidence was admissible in respect of the charge to which it related. It was tendered for that purpose, and not for the purposes of s 98. What the DPP sought to do was to expand the use that might be made of the evidence relevant to one count in order to strengthen its case on the other count. But that was a secondary purpose, and not the primary purpose, for which the evidence was tendered. Had the DPP not sought to rely on the evidence on each count as relevant to the other, s 95 would have precluded the use of the evidence on one count to establish, by rebutting the coincidental occurrence of the two events, the appellant’s guilt on the other count.”

It may be seen that her Honour also referred to the importance of s 95 in this context.


	
	The point is made in S Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (11th ed, 2014) at pp 471-472:
	


“The fact that the evidence in question is admissible for another use and has been admitted into evidence, does not mean that s 97 has no work to do (because it only deals with admissibility). The point is put beyond doubt by s 95(1). If the evidence ‘is relevant for another purpose’ (that is, relevant other than to prove a tendency to act or think in a particular way), the evidence ‘must not be used to prove that matter’ (that is, must not be used to prove such a tendency) if the evidence is ‘not admissible to prove’ such a tendency (that is, if the conditions of s 97 are not satisfied).”


	
	That is to say, s 95 precludes use being made of evidence, even if the evidence is not “tendency evidence” or “coincidence evidence” as defined in the Dictionary because the evidence was not tendered for the purpose of invoking tendency or coincidence reasoning. Unless ss 97, 98 and 101 are complied with, the evidence cannot be used to support a submission based on tendency or coincidence reasoning, and (as Ireland J said in R v AH) the jury should be directed accordingly.
	
	
	The application of those provisions to the present case is as follows. None of the exceptions in s 94 applied. Accordingly, s 95 was applicable. Section 95 meant that evidence relevant to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 which was not relevant to count 4 except insofar as it might be admissible to prove that the appellant (a) had a tendency to act in a particular way, or (b) did particular things because the similarities made it improbable that they were coincidences, could not be used for either purpose unless ss 97, 98 and 101 were satisfied. Conversely, evidence relevant to count 4 which was not relevant to the other counts except insofar as it involved tendency or coincidence reasoning could not be used for that purpose unless ss 97, 98 and 101 were satisfied.
	
	
	Commonly, the occasion for a dispute about whether those requirements have been satisfied is an application for a separate trial: see for example DSJ v The Queen at [43]-[44], DAO v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 63 and JG v R [2014] NSWCCA 138. However, no challenge was made to the prosecutor’s decision to proceed on all five counts (I am not suggesting that a challenge was open). Hence, on any view, the evidence was relevant to matters in issue at the trial. Moreover, no steps had been taken to limit the use which might be made of the evidence as it was adduced during the course of the Crown case. I proceed on the basis that, by reason of the objection having been flagged at the outset, it was open to the defence, at the conclusion of the Crown case, to obtain a ruling on the applicability of s 97 and 98, which would carry with it consequences for the remainder of the case. The prohibition in s 95 can prevent a prosecutor from advancing a particular argument (see for example Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Air New Zealand Ltd (No 1) [2012] FCA 1355; 207 FCR 448 at [33]). Most relevantly in a case like the present, where there was a trial before a jury on all counts, the outcome of the ruling would bear directly upon the directions to be given to the jury.
	
	
	Ultimately, the question which arose at the conclusion of the Crown case was whether the prohibition in s 95 applied, such that no process of tendency or coincidence reasoning could be entertained by the tribunal of fact, or whether that prohibition was inapplicable, because the requirements of ss 97, 98 and 101 had been met.
	


(b) The overlap between tendency reasoning and coincidence reasoning


	
	The “tendency rule” and the “coincidence rule” are distinct, although it is trite that there is an overlap between the two, as was observed, for example, in KJR v R [2007] NSWCCA 165; 173 A Crim R 226 at [46]. More recently, in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [43], Basten JA observed that there is awkwardness in separating “tendency” evidence and “coincidence” evidence where there is no dispute as to the identity of the alleged offender but what is in issue is whether the offences occurred:  in a sexual assault case, evidence of an accused’s conduct on another occasion is apt to support reasoning to the effect both that it is improbable that two complainants made independent complaints of similar conduct and that the offender has a tendency to conduct himself in a particular way. The “overlap” or “awkwardness” comes about because of the generality of the modes of proof described in ss 97 and 98, and because tendency evidence will usually depend on establishing similarities in a course of conduct. As Basten JA said in Saoud at [48], “where relevant and appropriate, a proper consideration of similarities will constitute an essential part of the application of s 97, as this Court has accepted on numerous occasions”.
	
	
	Insofar as the Crown sought to use the evidence relating to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 to support count 4, it was principally based on the coincidence rule. Much of the evidence relating to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 was not relevant to count 4, and vice versa, unless it supported a conclusion that it was improbable that the various similarities mentioned above (for example, the same GPO box, the same Lidcombe address, the use of the same 0420 XXX 986 and 02 800X X924 telephone numbers) were explained by coincidence. If that threshold were overcome, then the coincidence rule in s 98 would nevertheless render the evidence inadmissible, despite its relevance, unless (a) notice had been given, (b) the evidence would have significant probative value, and (c) its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect.
	
	
	In some respects, parts of the evidence relevant to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 could be regarded as relevant to count 4 if it were regarded as tendency evidence, rather than coincidence evidence. For example, take the evidence that telephone and internet accounts associated with the evidence relevant to all charges were entered into using similar names and dates of birth, which included:
	



	
	The email address carlos2011@bigpond.com.au was subscribed to by “Carolos Haviv” with date of birth 3 August 1975;
	
	
	The telephone line at Telopea Avenue Homebush where the appellant accepted delivery of the DHL box was subscribed on 1 February 2011, in the name of Mr Carlos Haviv with date of birth 3 August 1975;
	
	
	0415 XXX 326 was subscribed by “Carlos Haviv” with a date of birth 13 August 1975;
	
	
	A printing contract with Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd was entered into under the name Carlos Franken with a date of birth 3 September 1972 and email carlos2011@live.com.au on 2 February 2011; a Fuji Xerox employee identified the man who signed the contract as the appellant;
	
	
	In his recorded interview with customs officers on 11 June 2010, in answer to question 23, the appellant gave as his date of birth “Third of the eighth, nineteen seventy two” and in answer to the same question when repeated at question 34, “Third of May, nineteen seventy two”.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that those pieces of evidence (and others) supported a conclusion that the appellant was involved in all five counts, because it was improbable that the similarities in names and dates of birth occurred coincidentally. The Crown also submitted that the appellant had a tendency to use false names involving “Carlos” and to give false dates of birth which were similar to his own. The former mode of reasoning attracts the coincidence rule, the latter, the tendency rule.
	
	
	Accordingly, although I would regard this case as being one which predominantly involves coincidence reasoning, the overlapping prohibitions in ss 97 and 98 were each capable of applying, and hence it was appropriate and necessary for the Crown to seek to comply with both. (It seems unnecessarily burdensome, and for no gain, for the Evidence Act to contain overlapping and broadly expressed prohibitions, both of which may be engaged by the same evidence, and to require essentially duplicate notices to issue, and for identical tests thereafter to be applied, unless the party seeking to tender the evidence wishes to run the risk of obtaining a dispensation under s 100, but that is the course adopted by the Act.)
	
	
	Consistently with the foregoing, it seems that little distinction was made between the tendency rule and the coincidence rule at trial. This is relevant to one aspect of the grounds of appeal.
	


(c) Were the protections given by ss 97, 98 and 101 complied with?


	
	Unless dispensation under s 100 is obtained, ss 97 and 98 require reasonable notice in writing to be given. Otherwise, the prohibition on use for a forbidden purpose will apply even if the evidence is admissible for another purpose.
	
	
	Two unsatisfactory notices purportedly pursuant to ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 were given by the Crown on 13 June 2012, 12 days before the case began. Each notice said that the substance of the “tendency” or “coincidence” evidence which the prosecution intended to adduce was “contained within the following documents”. Each notice then listed no fewer than 110 statements which had been served as part of the Crown case (it may be inferred from the Crown opening that they amounted to every statement served in the Crown case).
	
	
	The tendency notice stated that:
	


“the purpose sought to be achieved by the prosecution in adducing the evidence is to establish that the accused had a tendency to import border controlled drugs and precursors.”


	
	The coincidence notice stated:
	


“The purpose sought to be achieved by the prosecution in adducing the evidence is to establish that the accused:

(a) possessed and attempted to possess packages, arriving in Australia from overseas and containing border controlled drugs or precursors;

and/or

(b) knew and/or was associated with details pertaining to such packages including, addressees, persons (or persons’ names), companies (or companies’ names), addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers,

and that because of the improbability of those circumstances occurring coincidentally, the accused imported border controlled drugs and precursors.”


	
	It may be accepted that where, as here, the Crown case is wholly circumstantial, much of the evidence is apt to involve coincidence reasoning, and so the drafting of a notice presents some difficulty. However, the notices in the present case disclosed no attempt to identify what was the particular state of mind or particular act which was sought to be proven, and the circumstances in which those events occurred, which were improbably coincidental. See for example what Simpson J said, with the agreement of Buddin J, in R v Zhang at [131]. This is essential, for at least three reasons. The first is that the Court is required by s 98(1)(b) to determine the probative value of the coincidence-based use of the evidence on which the Crown relies. The second is that the Court is required by s 101 to evaluate that probative value against any prejudice which the accused may suffer. The third is that those requirements on the Court reflect long-standing protections accorded originally by the common law, and now by statute, against the apprehended misuse (especially by juries) of evidence of this nature. The protection conferred by ss 98 and 101 is not obviated by a seemingly mechanical notice in general terms identifying the whole of the Crown case. The same is true to the extent that the evidence was sought to be relied upon for a tendency purpose. As was said in Bryant v R [2011] NSWCCA 26; 205 A Crim R 531 at [50] (Howie AJ, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing):
	


“The importance of explicitly identifying the related events for the purpose of s 98 and the asserted tendency for the purpose of s 97 should be obvious: how else is the court going to be able to make a rational decision about the probative value of the evidence.”


	
	At the outset of the trial, on 25 June 2012, before the jury was empanelled, the defence flagged that there would be an objection to the evidence being admitted as tendency or coincidence evidence. What happened on that front over the next fortnight is not fully disclosed by the materials available to the Court. However, on the weekend before the close of the Crown case, on 7 July 2012, a further notice was sent by the prosecutor identifying with precision the evidence that had been adduced in the course of the trial. Over 14 pages, the document identified evidence which had been adduced relevant to each of the counts, and attached a 9 page “Note on tendency and coincidence”. Some aspects of that note were directed to similarities between counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 (for example, the mechanical valves sent from New Delhi the subject of counts 1 and 3 were identical); this is not relevant to the more refined challenge that is made on appeal. Focussing on the paragraphs that drew connections between count 4 and the other counts, the note contained detailed submissions on the redirection using false names in relation to counts 1, 4 and 5 (paragraphs 8-12) and details of the falsely subscribed mobile numbers and use of the identity “Carlos” (paragraphs 16-39). The notice then stated that the existence and quantities of border controlled drugs and precursor were not in issue, and that the appellant’s (undisputed) conduct in respect of package 1 and 5 satisfied the physical element of importing. The notice concluded as follows:
	


“42. This leaves the facts in issue:

(a) Did Mr Haddad (physically) import packages 2, 3 and 4?

(b) Did Mr Haddad intend each of packages 1 to 5 to contain a border controlled drug (or precursor)?

Tendency

43. The Crown wishes to rely on the evidence outlined above to prove that Mr Haddad had a tendency to:

(a) Have packages directed to companies, viz JG Hancock and Esaan Enterprises, falsely registered in Ms XXXX's name;

(b) Have packages directed to work addresses, changed every couple of months;

(c) (Attempt to) collect and accept delivery of packages, addressed to others;

(d) Use false names to redirect or facilitate collection or delivery of packages;

and

(e) Use falsely subscribed mobile numbers and email addresses (including with details skirting around his own), to facilitate collection or delivery of packages.

Ultimately, the Crown wishes to suggest that Mr Haddad had a tendency to import packages he intended to contain border controlled drugs or precursors, and acted in these ways to avoid detection.

44. The practical effect of the evidence being admitted as tendency evidence would be that the jury would be permitted to reason that, if satisfied of Mr Haddad's conduct on a charge, it could use that when considering its verdict on another charge. For example: if the jury were satisfied Mr Haddad intentionally imported package 5 addressed to JG Hancock, it could use that to be satisfied of charges 2 and 3; or if the jury were satisfied Mr Haddad used a falsely subscribed mobile to redirect package 1, it could use that to be satisfied he used falsely subscribed mobiles dealing with packages 4 and 5.

Coincidence

45. The Crown wishes to rely on the evidence outlined above to prove that Mr Haddad imported packages 1 to 5 intending them to contain border controlled drugs or precursors on the basis that, having regard to the following similarities it is improbable that they occurred coincidentally:

(a) Mr Haddad attempted to collect package 1 and accepted delivery of package 5, both containing border controlled drugs or precursors;

(b) Packages 2, 3 and 5 were addressed to JG Hancock and package 5 was redirected to Esaan Enterprises, both of which were registered to Ms XXXXX but over which Mr Haddad had control;

(c) Package 1 was redirected to Mr Haddad's GPO Box, packages 2, 3 and 5 were addressed work addresses [sic] then used by Mr Haddad, and package 4 was redirected to a work address formerly associated with Mr Haddad;

(d) The addressee telephone number for packages 2 and 3 and redirected address telephone number [sic] for package 5 was Mr Haddad's landline; and

(e) Carlos, who dealt with Henning Harders and (kay-tee) indus@yahoo.com, is readily attributable to Mr Haddad. Also, seized from Mr Haddad or his home or workplaces were:  the 2011 diary containing many Carlos (and other) details:  SIMs used to call Henning Harders, and ones falsely subscribed; and other documents associated with package 4.

46. The Crown further wishes to invite the jury to use this evidence to rebut the assertions made by Mr Haddad in his ROIs (and if he gives evidence to similar effect), that he was merely a hapless player.”

(d) The application before the primary judge


	
	On 9 July 2012, immediately following the close of the Crown case, the Crown sought a ruling in accordance with that note. Objection was taken to the lateness of the original and replacement notice, by reference to the requirements identified by Simpson J in R v Zhang. The primary judge, with respect correctly, held that the original notices were insufficient.
	
	
	The primary judge gave ex tempore reasons immediately, in favour of the Crown. His Honour regarded the second notice as sufficiently specific. No point was taken on appeal that the second notice was issued too late (again, this should not be read as implying that a point was open to be taken). The primary judge set out the material before him, and gave short reasons stating that he was satisfied that the evidence had significant probative value, and was capable of being perceived by the jury as significantly probative. His Honour referred to the test in s 101 but did not expressly apply it. His Honour said merely:
	


“[I]t seems to me that where one has regard to the criteria involved for coincidence and tendency to be admitted and the nature of these offences, that I should admit this evidence as tendency and coincidence evidence.”

(e) The resolution of the challenge to tendency and coincidence evidence in this appeal


	
	There appears to have been a degree of procedural looseness in what occurred. All the evidence the subject of the ruling had already been admitted. Save for the generalised objection advised at the outset of the trial, the evidence had been admitted without restriction. Despite the language used by the Crown, the defence and the Court, the better view is that the evidence was not, strictly speaking, “coincidence evidence” or “tendency evidence” at all – it was evidence tendered primarily to establish the counts to which it related. What his Honour was in truth doing was determining whether and to what extent the prohibition in s 95 upon the use of evidence which had been tendered (and whose admission into evidence had not been objected to) to prove particular matters applied. That determination would affect, inter alia, the submissions able to be made and the directions to the jury.
	
	
	As noted above, the grounds of appeal merely asserted error “in admitting the evidence” as tendency and/or coincidence evidence as between count 4 on the one hand, and counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the other hand. Both parties’ submissions on appeal eschewed any more precise approach to analysis, and accordingly I proceed on the basis that the question is whether appellable error is demonstrated by the way in which the primary judge addressed the question when, finally, it was presented for his determination.
	
	
	The primary judge considered that the evidence had significant probative value. The thrust of the appellant’s attack on these grounds was twofold. First, it was said that in determining that there was significant probative value, the judge had failed to have regard to the dissimilarities. Secondly, it was said that much of the reasoning relied upon was coincidence-based reasoning, not tendency based reasoning.
	
	
	“Significant probative value” has been held to mean “something more than mere relevance but something less than a ‘substantial’ degree of relevance”: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459; DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at [58] and [60]; C V v DPP [2014] VSCA 58 at [14] (there are many other examples). So much may be accepted, and I regard myself bound by what was said in this respect in DSJ, but in my respectful view it is of little assistance.
	
	
	“Significant” and “substantial” are words whose meaning is strongly influenced by their context. Substantial does not always entail significant. As much is clear from the requirement that the use of non-rural land for primary production “has a significant and substantial commercial purpose or character” in order to be exempt from land tax: see Land Tax Management Act 1956 (NSW), s 10AA(2) and see Maraya Holdings Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2013] NSWCA 408; the requirements of “significant” and “substantial” in s 10AA(2) are cumulative. Indeed, Deane J said that “substantial” is a word which is “not only susceptible of ambiguity: it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision”: Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 132; 42 FLR 331 at 348. Accordingly, to say that “significant probative value” amounts to a probative value which falls short of “substantial probative value” is an inquiry which seems unlikely to assist, and may indeed distract. If anything, the comparator “substantial probative value” is less clearly defined than the statutory term “significant probative value”, and it is the statutory language which must be applied to determine the admissibility and valid use which may be made of tendency evidence. I respectfully agree with what was said by Priest JA (with whom Buchanan and Ashley JJA concurred) in Semaan v The Queen [2013] VSCA 134 at [38] that “attempts at reformulation of the statutory language are unlikely to be productive of much in the way of enlightenment”.
	
	
	The question posed by the statute is what is significant probative value in this context?
	
	
	In Zaknic Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1739; 61 FCR 171 Lehane J formed the view that guidance was available from cases decided before the Evidence Act came into force. I respectfully agree. As much is common ground in New South Wales and Victoria (see Velkoski at [162] and Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [38]). The statutory text did not emerge from a vacuum. Where as here the legislative text is patently open-textured, the immediate context – namely, its replacement of common law rules restricting the use of a particular type of evidence – is especially apt to illuminate its legal meaning.
	
	
	Lehane J said:
	


“What is clear is that courts have exercised a considerable degree of caution in admitting similar fact or tendency evidence. They have described the degree of cogency required of such evidence in a number of ways, some at least of which give some guidance, I think, as to the meaning of the concept of ""significant probative value"" which appears in s 97. For example, there are the phrases ""striking similarities"" and ""underlying unity"" seen in some of the criminal cases … It is clear also that where in reported cases evidence of this kind has been admitted, it has been, as a matter of common sense, clearly and strongly probative of the relevant fact in issue …”


	
	To similar effect, in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 485, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said (emphasis added):
	


“the evidence of propensity needs to have a specific connexion with the commission of the offence charged, a connexion which may arise from the evidence giving significant cogency to the prosecution case or some aspect or aspects of it.”


	
	The language which has been used to describe the requisite significant cogency was conveniently explained further in Phillips v R [2006] HCA 4; 225 CLR 303, a decision on the position at common law (see at [8]), by a unanimous High Court at [54]. Their Honours referred to “the need for similar fact evidence to possess some particular probative quality”, the requirement of “a strong degree of probative force” and that the evidence must have “a really material bearing on the issues to be decided”.
	
	
	Accepting as I do that ss 97 and 98 need not equate to the common law test which they replaced, I still regard that background as informing “significant” in s 97. The same appears from DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at [45]-[46]. “Significant” is directed to the probative value of the evidence. One way in which tendency evidence possesses significant probative value turns on the degree of generality or specificity with which the “tendency” is stated. A tendency which is stated with too high a level of generality will prove a handicap to its having significant probative value. Examples may be seen in Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78], Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215 at [264] and R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [53]. Conversely, “generally the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value”: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108].
	
	
	Most recently, in Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [40], Hoeben CJ at CL said that:
	


“One of the difficulties for the Crown in establishing ‘significant probative value’ was the high level of generality of the tendency relied upon. A tendency to have sexual urges was so general as to be meaningless. The additional qualification to that tendency, i.e. to have sexual urges and to act on them in public circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection, refined the concept but not greatly.”


	
	That is to say, the specificity of the tendency directly informs the strength of the inferential mode of reasoning. It is easy to see why. It is, for example, one thing to say that a man has a tendency to steal cars; that says something, but not very much, as to whether he stole a particular car the subject of a charge. It is quite another to say that a man has a tendency to steal black European sports cars and then set them on fire, if the fact in issue is whether that man stole and burnt a black Porsche.
	
	
	The appellant’s submissions focussed on the dissimilarities between the evidence in respect of counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the one hand, and count 4 on the other, and contended that the primary judge had erred in failing to consider those dissimilarities. The appellant identified those dissimilarities as:  (a) a shipping container, (b) which was shipped, not posted, (c) which came from Pakistan, (d) which involved a very much more substantial quantity of heroin, (e) whose re-direction came from the consignor rather than the consignee, and (f) which was much more sophisticated, including in respect of how the heroin was concealed. The appellant gave prominence to the fact that, unlike the other four counts, it was not alleged that the appellant possessed or attempted to possess the container or its contents, or, for that matter, that he had the capacity to do so.
	
	
	I do not accept the appellant’s submission based on dissimilarities per se. Evidence which supports tendency or coincidence reasoning turns on whether there are relevant similarities or dissimilarities. Take for example one similarity:  the use of telephone numbers 02 800X X924 and 02 800X X925. The 924 number was written on the packages in Count 2, 3 and 5, and on the Kay-Tee letter requesting that the container be delivered to Esaan Enterprises. The ASIC form for Esaan Enterprises used the 925 number. It is no answer to the implausibility of the identical or almost identical number being used to point to the fact that count 4 involved carriage by sea, using a freight forwarder, of a container, of a much larger and much purer amount of heroin. The question is whether the similarity is explicable by coincidence, not whether there are other points of difference.
	
	
	True it is that relevant dissimilarities may dilute the probative value of the evidence: see for example the quite different tendency evidence considered in Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [41], where the “marked dissimilarity” was summarised as follows:
	


“On the Crown case, key elements of the offence were a prepubescent victim and no public exhibition. The appellant is said to have latched the door to the change room (inferentially to achieve privacy) and then to have assaulted the complainant. The actions on which the tendency evidence was based had as their hallmark a public display with no prepubescent element in the victim. There was no active assault, rather the appellant's actions were ‘passive’. Far from seeking to conceal his actions, the gist or thrill of the offences was the fact that they could be seen and were intended to be seen.”


	
	But here the dissimilarities to which the appellant points do not detract from the unlikelihood of the same addresses and telephone numbers being used coincidentally.
	
	
	After all, the point of s 98 is to preclude a particular mode of inferential reasoning, as was said by Beech-Jones J, with the agreement of Hoeben CJ at CL, in R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236 at [79]:
	


“[G]iven that s 98 is addressing evidence that is put forward to invite the trier of fact to engage in a particular form of probabilistic reasoning, it necessarily follows that the assessment of whether the evidence of the relevant events has either probative or significant probative value requires a consideration of the combined effect of all the relevant similarities. Unless they are all considered then the ‘basis’ upon which the evidence is put forward, namely that it is ‘improbable that the events occurred coincidentally’ and that instead the events are explicable by reason of the particular act or state of mind sought to be proved, such as the involvement of the same offender or offenders in all the events, cannot be properly addressed.”


	
	The third member of the Court, Schmidt J, reasoned to the same effect at [10]. Likewise, attention was drawn to the inferential nature of these provisions by Simpson J in R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174; 217 A Crim R 487 at [25]:
	


“At its heart, s 98 is a provision concerning the drawing of inferences. The purpose sought to be achieved by the tender of coincidence evidence is to provide the foundation upon which the tribunal of fact could draw an inference. The inference is that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.”


	
	Despite the appellant’s submission to the contrary, the evidence was significantly probative. That is self-evidently so (and accordingly it is unnecessary to pause to consider whether the trial judge’s conclusion is reviewable in accordance with House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 or alternatively Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531:  see Zhang at [45]). The question is whether there is a real possibility of an alternative explanation inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt, based on the evidence together with the other evidence in the Crown case. If there is such an alternative possibility, then that may rob the evidence of its significant probative value, in the manner described by Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA in DSJ at [10] and [78]-[81]. But this was a case where, unless some exculpatory evidence was adduced in the defence case, it was overpoweringly probable that the appellant was involved in the conduct relating to each of the counts.
	
	
	In respect of the second aspect of the appellant’s submissions, there is force in the observation that the trial judge focussed on the coincidence rule. However, that reflected the use to which the Crown sought to make of the evidence. This is primarily a case about coincidence evidence, not tendency evidence. Indeed, even the use of evidence about the use of “Carlos” and the dates of birth to which reference has earlier been made could equally naturally fall within coincidence reasoning. I do not consider that there was appellable error in the primary judge focussing upon the essential nature of the bulk of the evidence, in circumstances where there was little distinction drawn by the parties between s 97 as opposed to s 98.
	
	
	Finally, the appellant submitted that s 101 prevented the evidence being admitted. It is fair to say that this was not at the forefront of the submissions advanced on appeal (or at trial). It was said that there should have been consideration of “the potential of the unfair prejudice that [the appellant] was prepared to adopt fraudulent behaviour of this kind in relation to a helpless woman”. I disagree. The evidence that the appellant used JG Hancock, of which a woman was sole director and shareholder, in relation to counts 2, 3 and 5 was relevant to those charges, and there was no separate application under s 135 based on unfair prejudice. The evidence that the appellant used Esaan Enterprises, of which the same woman was sole director and shareholder, was relevant to count 4, and there was no separate application under s 135 based on unfair prejudice. The prejudice to which s 101 is directed is prejudice based on the availability of tendency or coincidence-based reasoning which otherwise, but for the requirements of ss 97 and 98 being satisfied, would be precluded by s 95.
	
	
	Section 101 will apply with much greater force when the only way in which evidence is said to be relevant is because of tendency or coincidence reasoning (for example, a sexual assault case where evidence is called of another complainant in respect of whom no charges have been laid). Where, as here, the evidence which was sought to be used for coincidence and tendency reasoning was (a) relevant to other charges which were able to be determined fairly at the same trial and (b) not said to be inherently unfairly prejudicial in its own right, then it is apt to be difficult for s 101 to apply so as to preclude tendency or coincidence reasoning based on it.
	
	
	These grounds should be dismissed.
	


Grounds 3 and 4: “deal with the substance in connection with its importation”

(a) The course of the trial


	
	At the close of the Crown case, the appellant sought a directed verdict in relation to count 4. The Crown pointed to the change of consignee from World Star 88 Pty Ltd to Esaan Enterprises, and to the enquiries made concerning the cost of shipping the container to Africa and discharging it from bond storage. The quotation from Henning Harders to Esaan Enterprises dated 15 March 2011 was found on the tower computer seized from the appellant. There was also evidence of conversations between Carlos and employees of Henning Harders and emails between them.
	
	
	The primary judge took an expansive approach to the definition of “import”:
	


“It seems to me that once a substance has been imported, which is no doubt the case here in that the container was removed from the ship to the dock storage, then any actions taken in regard to that shipment would amount to dealing with the substance, even if such actions only related to the re-exporting of the item to a destination outside Australia. ‘Deal with’ is not defined in the Code dictionary, but I have been handed a dictionary extract and under the heading ‘Deal, dealt, dealing,’ the words appear, ‘1. To occupy oneself with. 2. To take action with respect to a thing or person, to conduct oneself towards persons, to trade or do business,’ and a number of other definitions or circumstances that do not really fit the present case.

As I said, the Crown argues that this person, Carlos, referred to on a number of occasions to do with this container is in fact Mr Haddad. Whether they can establish that beyond reasonable doubt will be a matter for the jury to determine. Carlos’s actions in seeking to find out the costs associated with the transportation of the container to Karachi to Sydney, its subsequent storage, and then its re-exportation to an African country, in my view, are actions on his part capable of fulfilling the definition of dealing with a substance. The fact that the dealing is said to relate only to exporting the item is, in my view, neither here nor there, because the item has to be firstly imported before it can necessarily be exported.

Whether an imported item is to finally end up in Australia, or elsewhere, does not matter, it seems to me, as far as the original importation is concerned. In my view, the definition is designed to cover any dealing in a substance once it has reached this country, whether that involves re-exporting it or distributing the substance within Australia.

Whilst Mr Carlos’ actions might only be regarded as inquiries, they are nonetheless actions that in my view fulfil the definition of dealing. Whether or not the jury sees it that way is another thing, and that is for the Crown to prove. But it is not a matter, in my view, that I should take from the jury.”


	
	I respectfully disagree, for the reasons given below, with the generality of his Honour’s construction of “import”. However, I should say immediately that his Honour’s reasons were given ex tempore, without the benefit of written submissions, or (so it would seem) notice that the point was being taken, in circumstances where the Crown case was complete and the jury were waiting. There was understandable urgency. In contrast, this Court has had the benefit of written and oral submissions, and the opportunity to reserve on a point not free from difficulty.
	
	
	Thereafter, the trial resumed. The appellant gave evidence in chief and was cross-examined. He confirmed that the handwriting in the diary was his own. He said that he had, at his friend’s request, applied to register the new company Esaan Enterprises and included an address and phone number linked to him. He confirmed that he had received the messages left at his serviced office from Henning Harders, advising that “Carlos” had rung on around the days they had been left (22 and 24 March and 6 April). He confirmed that he personally had accessed the carlos2011@live.com.au email address, from the serviced office, but only to create a Facebook account and a twitter account. He said that he became aware that there were emails from that account to and from Henning Harders, mentioning Esaan Enterprises, and said:
	


“It was alerted to me, yes, there’s someone using that account without my knowledge obviously.”


	
	The appellant said that he was concerned about it, but did not mention it to Henning Harders. He denied knowledge of the drugs and the precursor the subject of the indictment.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined over some five days. His mother-in-law also gave brief evidence, directed to explaining some files found when a search warrant was executed on her home. She said that she had taken some United Trade Card files home with her to keep them secure.
	


(b) The new definition of “import” and existing authority


	
	The definition of “import” in s 300 of the Code was amended, with effect shortly before the conduct giving rise to the charges, following the decision of this Court in R v Campbell [2008] NSWCCA 214; 73 NSWLR 272. Under the previous regime, it was established that an importation was complete no later than when a consignment had been cleared through customs and delivered to the consignee’s warehouse. Spigelman CJ said at [126]-[128]:
	


“The new statutory context of a criminal code dealing with a wide range of drug offences suggests that a precise, rather than expansive, sense of the word ‘imports’ has been adopted.

Generally, that is how one would approach the interpretation of any criminal statute.

In my opinion, the purpose of the Act requires the border controlled drugs and precursors ‘to arrive in Australia from abroad’ and to be delivered at a point which, in the words of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers, would ‘result in the goods remaining in Australia’. That occurred when the goods were picked up by the appellant’s agent or, at the latest, when the container arrived at her premises and before it was unpacked.”

Weinberg AJA agreed and added at [144] as a further reason for rejecting the Crown’s broad construction of “imports”:

“In the context of this appeal, if the Crown’s contention that an importation continues until the goods reach their ‘final destination’ (an expression of some indeterminacy) were to be accepted, a person could be guilty of importing prohibited drugs by doing an act far removed from the actual landing of the drugs in this country. That act could take place weeks, months or even years after the drugs had been brought into Australia. Such a wide notion of the word would not accord with ordinary usage of language and would be foreign to most people’s understanding of that term. In addition, an interpretation of such breadth would not sit well with the approach normally taken to the construction of penal statutes:  Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576.”

Simpson J agreed with both judgments.


	
	By the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth), a new definition of “import” was inserted in s 300.2:  
	


“‘import’, in relation to a substance, means import the substance into Australia and includes:

(a) bring the substance into Australia; and

(b) deal with the substance in connection with its importation.”


	
	The Crown relied, on first instance and on appeal, on paragraph (b):  “deal with the substance in connection with its importation”. Particular reliance was placed upon the Explanatory Memorandum, which said that the amendment would capture criminal activity “related to the bringing of drugs into Australia and subsequent criminal activity connected with the importation of drugs”. It stated that the terms were “intended to be broad in their application” and that paragraph (b) would capture “unpacking the imported goods” (something expressly excluded by Spigelman CJ in Campbell) and “arranging for payment of those involved in the importation process”. However, the Explanatory Memorandum did not go so far as to embrace the “final destination” construction considered by Weinberg AJA in Campbell.
	
	
	There is a deal of authority on the meaning of “import” as defined in the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) which, in large measure, may be passed over for present purposes. Those authorities do not speak with one voice, as is plain from a consideration of the divergent reasoning of this Court in R v Nolan [2012] NSWCCA 126; 83 NSWLR 534, dealing with inter alia the differences in the earlier decisions of Calderwood v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 180; 172 A Crim R 208 and R v Campbell. Although Nolan was a case under the Customs Act, Rothman J (whose reasoning differed from that of the other members of the Court) mentioned the amended Code definition of “import” at [88], and said at [89]-[90]:
	


“As a consequence of the foregoing analysis, binding authority is to the effect that the term ‘imports’, where used in the Customs Act, includes conduct beyond the landing of the goods and, in the words of Wood CJ at CL in Sukkar, supra at [121], ‘includes recovery of the goods after landing and anything ... done having a direct proximity to the bringing of the goods into the country, and making them available including their clearance and transfer into storage, unpacking, and arranging for payment of those involved in the process, that is suppliers, shippers, customs agents, freight forwarders, and so on’.

It would seem, following the amendment to definitions of ‘import’ in the Code, that an offence involving ‘importing’, even under the Code, would have the same degree of flexibility. It is unnecessary to decide that issue in these proceedings.”


	
	So far as I can see, aside from those obiter statements (which reflected an approach different from that adopted by McClellan CJ at CL and Davies J), there is no authority in this Court on the new definition of “import” in the Code. Certainly, the Court was not taken to any.
	
	
	Paragraph (b) of the new Code definition resembles what was considered by the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Tranter [2013] SASCFC 61; 116 SASR 452. Kourakis CJ agreed with parts of the reasons of Peek J, including that a dealing after importation had been concluded could satisfy the new definition of “import” (at [126]). Mr Tranter had picked up a package which had arrived by sea from Thailand, taken it into his possession, and opened it at premises away from the freight forwarders. Peek J said at [102]-[103] (citations omitted):
	


“While the noun importation should be understood according to the Isaacs J approach, the verb ‘import’ is to be given a wider meaning than might be merely derived from, and confined to, the noun ‘importation’. This is because paragraph (b) provides that the meaning of import is wider than this. It is to include deal with the substance in connection with its importation.

The word ‘deal’ is not defined by the legislation but it is a word of relatively broad meaning.”


	
	His Honour considered, but respectfully disagreed with, Rothman J’s approach in Nolan.
	
	
	The third member of the Court, White J, considered the new definition, and observed that it was sufficient if any of the three alternative forms of conduct contemplated by the definition was established (at [14]). His Honour also noted that the definition of “import” incorporated the word “importation”, so that a person might “import” where there is conduct dealing with a substance in connection with its “importation”, indicating that the meaning of the two cognates of the one word was not coextensive (at [15]); this is to the same effect as what Peek J said at [102]; cf Nolan at [69]-[70].
	
	
	White J also suggested, by reference to parliamentary intention, that “importation” bore the meaning it had been held to have under former s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), of “a process, or a venture, not a physical act which occurs or ceases at the moment of import”. His Honour was also able to decide the appeal without expressing a concluded view on the issue, and without analysing the reach of the expression “deal with the substance in connection with its importation”:  at [16]-[17].
	


(c) Construction of the new definition of “import”


	
	For better or worse, the new definition of “import” in s 300.2 is open-textured, leaving it to the courts to fix its legal meaning. The appropriate approach is that which may be seen most clearly from Tranter, which is incremental and minimal whilst striving to achieve a consistent and coherent construction of the federal law.
	
	
	As will be seen below, I respectfully agree with what was said in the passages mentioned above in Tranter. One aspect of their Honours’ reasoning – that “import” has a wider meaning than “importation” – is difficult to reconcile with parts of the reasoning of Rothman J in Nolan at [69]-[92]. However, even if I did not agree, I would apply the level of deference to the construction given to the federal law by another intermediate appellate court as stated in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492.
	
	
	Even so, in order to explain why in my view the new definition has a narrower meaning than that applied by the primary judge, it is convenient to commence from first principles.
	
	
	Prior to the 2010 amendment, “export” and “import” were defined simply. Section 300.2 provided (and still provides) that “export includes take from Australia”. Prior to 20 February 2010, “import” was defined similarly: “import includes bring into Australia”. Plainly enough, the changes effected by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth) extend the legal meaning of “import”. The question is, by how much?
	
	
	One change was to replace a definition which had only used the word “includes” by one which uses the words “means” and “includes”. Those words can themselves be problematic, as is apparent from YZ Finance Co Pty Ltd v Cummings (1964) 109 CLR 395 at 402. However, there is no such difficulty here. The chapeau of the new definition preserves the undefined meaning of the verb, whilst paragraph (a) replicates the earlier definition. The force of the amendment is to be seen in the new words in paragraph (b).
	
	
	I turn to the words “import” and “importation”. As noted above, two members of the South Australian Full Court in Tranter considered that these words were not co-extensive. I agree. The “means and includes” definition deems the legal meaning of “import” to include “deal with the substance in connection with its importation”. This must mean more than merely bringing the substance into Australia; otherwise paragraph (b) would have no work to do. Paragraph (b) provides that if there is a “dealing” and it is “in connection with its importation”, then that is deemed to satisfy the definition of “import”. Paragraph (b) must be construed, if the language can sustain it, to mean something beyond bringing the substance into Australia. It is natural in those circumstances for “importation” to refer to the broad process, rather than the physical act which ceases when the substance arrives in Australia, as White J suggested in Tranter, consistently with what this Court held in Leff v R (1996) 86 A Crim R 212 at 214 (Gleeson CJ) and 222-223 (James J). However, even so, there must be a “dealing”, and the dealing must be “in connection with” that broad process of importation.
	
	
	The legal meaning of paragraph (b) of the new definition does not turn on the meaning of the word “deal” considered in isolation. Still less does it turn upon two of the meanings contained in a dictionary, although the primary judge accepted the submissions by the Crown that it did. The primary judge considered that the definition was designed to cover “any dealing in a substance once it has reached this country, whether that involves re-exporting it or distributing the substance within Australia.” With that I cannot agree, for three reasons.
	
	
	The first is that, taken on their face, the judge’s reasons would mean that the sale of a Finnish mobile phone, or a bar of Swiss chocolate, or a bag of Kenyan coffee beans by the importer to an Australian retailer, or (on one view) to the ultimate Australian consumer, was itself an “import” of the handset or chocolate bar or coffee, in the sense of being a dealing with the thing in connection with its importation. His Honour’s reasons, with respect, ignore the limiting words “in connection with its importation”. There is nothing in the text, or the legislative purpose, or the extrinsic materials to support the extended “final destination” legal meaning considered by Weinberg AJA in Campbell.
	
	
	The second is that it is necessary to read the section (and the Code) as a whole, and in its context:  Certain Lloyd's Underwriters Subscribing to Contract No IH00AAQS v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [23]-[24], [68] and [88]. Indeed, context can be determinative: see, for example, Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 421 at [69]. Part of the immediate context is the presence of separate offences of exporting a border controlled drug or precursor. It would be wrong to give a broad meaning to “import” which would swallow up the meaning of “export”, even though the former has been amended so as to expand it and the latter has not. Not lightly is there to be imputed an intention for the same conduct to be both an export and an import. Contrary to the primary judge’s reasons, I do not agree that “re-exporting” can fall within “import”. That is not to say that there is not a second offence if there is a re-export following the importation of a border controlled drug or precursor.
	
	
	The third is that the meaning given to “deal” by the primary judge is too broad. I do not regard the dictionary meanings of “to occupy oneself with” or “to take action with respect to a thing or person” on which the primary judge relied to be of any material assistance in determining the legal meaning of the word in this context. The legal meaning is a consequence of the particular meaning the word bears in its particular context, not the breadth of its possible meanings which may be found in a dictionary. As I said in 2 Elizabeth Bay Road Pty Ltd v The Owners - Strata Plan No 73943 [2014] NSWCA 409 at [82]:
	


“It is axiomatic that (a) the words in a sentence are not building blocks whose meaning is unaffected by the rest of the sentence, (b) the sentence is the unit of communication by which language works, and (c) the significance of individual words is affected by other words and the syntax of the whole sentence. Lord Hoffmann stated as much in R v Brown [1996] AC 543 at 561, a passage endorsed in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 397, when observing that the fallacy of treating words as individual building blocks construed in isolation is common among lawyers.”


	
	A “dealing” with tangible property may occur by a physical process (such as concealing it in another chattel so as to avoid detection, assembling it in a palette or container, physically conveying it from origin to destination, or physically delivering it to a purchaser). In the context of the Code, and the immediate textual context of “bring the substance into Australia”, the word should be regarded as including physical acts. For example, removing the substance from a bond warehouse would, in my view, be a dealing, and still remain sufficiently connected with the importation to satisfy the definition. It was said in Tranter that unpacking the package after it had been taken to premises outside the freight forwarder’s warehouse was still a dealing with sufficient connection with the importation to satisfy the definition. But there was no physical dealing with the container proven at the appellant’s trial.
	
	
	It is also natural to describe a legal process (such as a sale or mortgage over the property) as a dealing. Indeed, to my mind, that is the most natural meaning the word bears in many legal contexts. I see no reason to confine the word “deal” in the definition to physical processes, as opposed to legal processes. For one thing, one of the examples given in the Explanatory Memorandum was arranging for payment. For another, very capricious results would follow if “dealing” were confined to physical dealings. On that approach, a sale by payment and physical delivery would amount to a dealing, but a sale by deed would not. Or take the facts of this case. The letter from the original consignor Kay-Tee Industries to the freight forwarder directing it to be held for Esaan Enterprises would, in my view, amount to a dealing, although involving no physical process. The direction to the freight forwarder caused there to be a change in the character of the actual possession, such that a different entity had the right to delivery of the goods. After all, a change in the character in which a person with actual possession of goods holds that possession caused by a defendant is sufficient interference with title to amount to conversion. In Van Oppen & Co v Tredegars Ltd (1921) 37 TLR 504, where goods were delivered by mistake, and a stranger purported to be their owner and sold them to the recipient, there was wrongful dealing sufficient to amount to conversion, even though there was no physical dealing with the goods. That was confirmed by Jordan CJ in Australian Provincial Assurance Co Ltd v Coroneo (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 700 at 717.
	
	
	However, relying on the broad dictionary definitions reproduced above, the trial judge appears to have considered that a price inquiry by itself could fulfil the definition of dealing. With that I must respectfully disagree.
	
	
	A price inquiry is not a physical dealing with a thing. Nor does it readily fall within any accepted meaning of a legal dealing with the thing. Moreover, even after the 2010 amendment, the legal meaning of “import” is necessarily informed by other provisions in the Code: it is axiomatic that the Code must still be read as a whole:  see Environment Protection Authority v Schon G Condon as liquidator for Orchard Holdings (NSW) Pty Ltd (in liq) [2014] NSWCA 149 at [43]. Section 11.1 of the Code includes a separate offence of attempt, and s 11.1(2) provides that in order to be guilty of attempt:
	


“the person’s conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.”


	
	If the extended definition of “import” applied when a person merely made an inquiry about what was required to release a package from a bond warehouse, then although the inquiry would be “in connection with its importation”, there would be little room for (a) the distinct offence of attempting to import a border controlled substance and (b) conduct which is “merely preparatory” which falls short of an attempt. The distinction between conduct which is merely preparatory and conduct which is sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of a crime such as to give rise to an attempt (see Onuorah v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 238; (2009) 76 NSWLR 1 at [30]), ought not be swallowed up by an overly broad approach to “import”.
	


(d) The appellant’s concession


	
	However, the communications from carlos2011@live.com.au were not merely requests for quotations. They were more than that, as senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged. They were assertions of ownership.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant said this in his oral submissions in chief when the appeal was heard:
	


“I wanted to point out a potential consideration of the admission to Mr Williamson that could potentially be argued was he asserting ownership of the goods throughout the course of the importation and if the Court was of that view then this ground would fail. And my submission in elucidating the argument in that regard is on a proper reading of the overall evidence, indeed as it was in essence left to the jury, was that he was making these inquiries on someone else’s behalf and he had lied to Mr Williamson. But I needed to make that point clear as I have further considered the matter so that if the Court was against me at that level, that ground would fail.”


	
	That concession was properly made. Accepting as counsel did that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that the emails from “Carlos” on 14 and 15 March 2011 were sent by the appellant, they were formal assertions of ownership of the contents of the container to the freight forwarder who enjoyed actual possession (and a lien) over those contents.
	
	
	Was there room, as counsel submitted, for a reasonable doubt that the appellant was lying to the freight forwarder and was in fact making inquiries on behalf of someone else? I am doubtful that there was, but it is not necessary to reach a concluded view of the issue. Either the appellant as “Carlos” was asserting ownership of the contents of the container on his own behalf, or as agent for the true owner. In either case, there was a dealing with the goods.
	
	
	In the particular circumstances of this appeal, it was sufficient that there was an assertion of ownership by “Carlos”. It would not matter if the ownership were of Carlos himself, or Carlos as agent for a principal, or indeed if Carlos had no right to the goods (in which case there would be conversion: see the authorities referred to above). It makes no difference for present purposes whether an assertion of ownership is made by the owner, or by a person with ostensible authority on behalf of the owner. The point may be tested by considering a circumstance analogous to Van Oppen & Co v Tredegars Ltd: suppose someone with actual knowledge of the heroin concealed in the container asserted to the freightforwarder that he or she was entitled to have it delivered to him or her, in the same terms as were employed by “Carlos”. Those assertions of ownership would amount to a dealing, and would do so even if (as here) it was not proven that the freightforwarder had acted upon them by physically moving the container.
	
	
	Finally, plainly enough what occurred was “in connection with its importation”. The closeness of that connection may be seen not merely by reference to the communications between “Carlos” and the freight forwarder, but also from other contemporaneous communications made by Carlos. In particular, there was the undated letter from Kay-Tee Industries directing the freight forwarder to release the goods to a company undeniably connected with the appellant. And there was evidence from an employee of Microsoft that an email was sent from carlos2011@live.com.au to indus@yahoo.com stating:
	


“I just got the price for storage only the charges are $37000.00 and the shipment will cost $8000.00 to east africa there is a problem that we have to pay for the storage before we can move these stuff because it has been here for a while now plus the agent fees that has been working on it is $1200.00. I have asked them if you can pay from your side but the answer is no we have to pay for the storage from here or they have to have the fund in the account and you can pay the transport from there ... let me know what you would like me to do.”


	
	Accordingly, I conclude that the primary judge was correct to dismiss the application for a directed verdict in respect of count 4, although for different reasons than were given by his Honour. In light of the concession, it is neither necessary nor desirable to say anything more of the operation of the new definition of “import”. Ground 3 should be dismissed.
	


(e) Ground 4


	
	No separate written submission was made in relation to ground 4. Nor was ground 4 separately elaborated upon orally, although it was maintained that grounds 3 and 4 did not stand and fall together.
	
	
	Although framed in terms of the jury’s verdict being “unsafe and unsatisfactory, and not supported by the evidence”, this ground is to be read as seeking leave to invoke this Court’s power under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The question is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt “which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, emphasis in original, by reference to M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493.)
	
	
	If leave be granted in respect of this ground, it would be necessary for this Court to weigh the competing evidence and to make its own independent assessment as to the sufficiency and quality of that evidence: see SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [24], Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [465] and BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48; 88 ALJR 101 at [31]. That cannot be done, and in any event it should not be done.
	
	
	It cannot be done because much of the documentary evidence was not reproduced in the appeal books. For example, 42 of the 100 Crown exhibits were not reproduced in full, and most of those were not reproduced at all.
	
	
	It should not be done because so to do would be contrary to the way the appeal was prepared and argued. The parties chose not to make submissions based on a wholesale review of the evidence as a whole (which explains why the appeal books were, appropriately, selective in reproducing the evidence). In particular, the appellant chose to treat proposed ground 4 as supplementary upon ground 3, confined to the submissions on construction on the meaning of “import”. It would be unfair to both parties to grant leave in respect of ground 4 and conduct a wide-ranging review of the evidence as a whole, as to which neither had been heard.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the appropriate course is to follow that adopted by this Court in Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [50]-[51]; see also Clark v R [2014] NSWCCA 236 at [65]. For the reasons already given, nothing in the course of the parties’ written and oral submissions has been advanced which gives rise to any concern that the jury must have entertained a doubt. By way of summary, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the “Carlos” who had spoken, repeatedly, to Henning Harders. It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware of the letter from Kay-Tee Industries, had received the emails sent to carlos2011@live.com.au, and had sent the email reproduced above to indus@yahoo.com. Those communications were legally sufficient to amount to a dealing. Although the subject matter of the latter two communications was a proposed shipping of the container to Africa, they included something directly connected with the importation of the container from Pakistan to Australia, namely, paying the fees (including to the freight forwarder) for storage of the container in Australia after it had been unloaded and while it remained in the possession of the freight forwarder, which is on any view sufficiently closely connected with the importation to fall within the expanded definition of “import”.
	
	
	It follows that leave to appeal in respect of proposed ground 4 should be refused.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, I propose that:
	



	
	Leave be refused in respect of ground 4.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.

2765932,Almada v R [2015] NSWCCA 19,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Andrew Nicholas Almada (“the applicant”) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Blackmore SC in the Sydney District Court on 8 August 2014 in respect of an offence of dealing with money in excess of $100,000 with such money being reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 3 years and/or a fine of 180 penalty units.
	
	
	The applicant asked that his guilt in respect of a further offence be taken into account: an offence of attempting to move out of Australia without a report a sum of cash being greater than $10,000, namely $200,000. That was an offence contrary to s 53(1)(a)(ii) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of 500 penalty units.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for 18 months with release after 9 months upon entering into a recognizance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be of good behaviour for a period of 3 years. His Honour specified that the applicant was to be subject to supervision by NSW Community Corrections for a period of 12 months and that there be particular regard to drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced two co-offenders at the same time, Prabal Islam and Cheuk Fai Chan.
	


Facts


	
	There is no dispute about the facts. I draw the following from the summary helpfully provided in the written submissions of counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	On 30 July 2012 Prabal Islam was in telephone contact with another person identified as Abu Saleh. The following day Islam purchased a number of business and first class airline tickets for travel from Sydney to Dhaka, Bangladesh, departing on 1 August 2012.
	
	
	At 6pm on 31 July 2012, the applicant and Islam attended a unit in Ashfield that was leased in the name of Saleh. He and Islam left about half an hour later with Islam carrying a bag which he placed into the boot of a motor vehicle.
	
	
	That same evening, Islam and an unidentified female attended the office of a solicitor in the city and collected another bag.
	
	
	On 1 August 2012, Islam and Cheuk Fai Chan entered the international terminal at Sydney Airport and met with seven other travellers including the applicant. Islam was carrying a number of bags including the two bags he had collected the previous day. They contained a number of designer label cotton shoe bags.
	
	
	Shortly after Islam met with the group at the airport, Chan rearranged the contents of one of the bags containing the shoe bags. Islam removed a shoe bag from the other bag and placed it into the applicant’s suitcase after which the applicant closed the suitcase. Islam placed shoe bags into the case of another man (referred to as “Mohammad”) and then put a further shoe bag in the applicant’s suitcase after which the applicant again closed his suitcase.
	
	
	The group of nine persons then attempted to board a flight to Dhaka. At the Customs primary line they all presented their passports and outgoing passenger cards. The applicant, Islam and Chan had completed their cards by placing an “X” in the box marked “no” in reply to the question, “are you taking out of Australia $10,000 or more in Australian dollars or foreign currency equivalent”. The group were then selected for a baggage check and escorted to the Customs Outward Examination area where their suitcases were retrieved.
	
	
	Islam and Saleh were in telephone contact at around this time during which Islam alerted Saleh to the possibility that the money in the bags would be discovered. When his bags were searched, Customs officers found a total of $359,650 in Australian currency. He admitted that it was his money and that he had also placed money in the bags of the others.
	
	
	The applicant was asked to provide the combination lock on his suitcase. He did not answer but looked to Islam who replied, “its okay”. The applicant then provided the combination code and when his bag was searched the officers uncovered $210,200 in the two shoe bags in his suitcase. He told Customs officers that Islam was responsible for them being in his suitcase and that he had no knowledge of the contents. He explained that he did not ask what was inside the shoe bags because, “he’s my friend, I trust him”.
	
	
	Islam had placed a total of $1,023,900 in the various suitcases. He was charged with the more serious offence of dealing with money intending that it would become the instrument of a crime to a value of more than $1,000,000 (maximum penalty 25 years). The learned sentencing judge regarded his offence as “clearly extremely serious”, and described his role as being “clearly the most significant of the three offenders”.
	
	
	His Honour regarded the evidence as suggesting that the other two offenders, Chan and the applicant, as having been recruited by Islam. As between that pair, he said that, “Almada appears to be more heavily involved based on the facts”.
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant was aged 27 at the time of the offence and 29 at the date of sentencing.
	
	
	He had a prior criminal record for comparatively less serious matters but it included a matter of assault for which on 11 May 2011, on appeal to the Sydney District Court, he was placed on a 18 month good behaviour bond. I note that the fact that he was on conditional liberty, an aggravating factor, appears not to have been noticed.
	
	
	After referring to the applicant’s criminal record as well as that of Chan’s the judge remarked that neither could be described as a person of prior good character, but given the comparatively less serious matters on their record some leniency could be applied in each case.
	
	
	In summarising other aspects of the applicant’s subjective case the judge referred to him having a consistent history of employment; he had attended university to obtain some qualifications in construction management; and he told a Probation and Parole officer that whilst he uses drugs, he does not see his use as a problem as it is only recreational. The judge queried the latter of those matters by noting that when the applicant had explained his involvement in the offence he had said that “the events were somewhat confusing due to the fact that he had been using the drug ice on the day”.
	
	
	The judge referred to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty and accepted that this indicated a degree of contrition. The judge regarded the plea as having been entered at the first reasonable opportunity and allowed a discount of 25 per cent to reflect a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. He noted without question that a psychologist had opined that the applicant appeared to have involved himself in the offence because of his friendship with Islam.
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective criminality of the applicant’s role in the s 400.9(1) offence within the hierarchy of offenders


	
	This ground is concerned with a statement made by the judge in the course of his summary of the applicant’s subjective circumstances that, “this offender was more significantly involved in the offence than Chan”. In written submissions by Ms Beckett, counsel for the applicant, a number of arguments were raised to suggest that there was little, if any, scope to differentiate between the significance of the roles of the applicant and Chan.
	
	
	The written submissions by counsel for the Crown advanced a number of reasons why the judge’s differentiation between the two was justified. In my view it is unnecessary to delve into the detail of these submissions because, as the Crown pointed out, during the proceedings on sentence the applicant’s counsel, Mr Terracini SC, conceded that the roles of the applicant and Chan could be distinguished with Chan being “at the lower end of the range”. Ms Beckett disputed that this concession was made and sought to characterise exchanges between bench and bar as involving some “cross-communication”. I do not see it that way and interpret what was said by counsel as being an unequivocal acceptance that, whilst Islam’s role was clearly well above that of the applicant and Chan, Chan’s role was less than that of the applicant. Having regard to the matters identified by the Crown, that concession was properly made. The contrary contention now advanced on behalf of the applicant should be rejected: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [81] (Johnson J).
	


Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as being “guarded at best” on the basis that his involvement in the offence indicated he had a “propensity to involve himself with this offence”


	
	This ground of appeal focuses upon a single sentence within the learned judge’s sentencing remarks:
	


“In my view his prospects of rehabilitation, given his propensity to involve himself in this offence must be regarded as guarded at best.”


	
	It was submitted that given the offending involved a single episode it was not possible to discern any propensity and none was apparent from an examination of the statement of facts or the applicant’s criminal record. The applicant’s submissions also drew attention to the contrasting finding in the case of Chan that, “he will likely be fully rehabilitated after serving his sentence”. The applicant submitted, in effect, that a similar finding should have been made in his case as well.
	
	
	The Crown’s response was that the single sentence which is the focus of the ground had to be seen in the context of the sentencing remarks overall. It was contended that the judge had taken into account a range of factors in assessing the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects.
	
	
	I would not be prepared to accept that the judge was not mindful of all matters that were relevant to the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects. However this ground can be determined by assessing the sentence upon which the applicant directed attention within its more immediate context. His Honour said:
	


“His psychologist opined that he appears to have involved himself in the offence because of his friendship with Islam.

However the very nature of the offence would have alerted an intelligent man to the seriousness of what he was doing. Very few people have more than a million dollars in cash. The friend he knew had no reasonable basis for possessing that money other than it was likely to be the proceeds of some serious criminal activity. Even a cursory consideration of those facts would have alerted this offender to the danger of becoming involved in this offence, and yet he continued.”


	
	I take what his Honour was intending to convey in this passage as being that the willingness of the applicant to so readily and unquestioningly involve himself in such serious offending raised a question about his rehabilitation prospects. That was a conclusion that was well open to his Honour. There is no merit in this ground.
	


Ground 3 – The sentencing judge erred by finding, and taking into account as an aggravating feature of the offence, that the applicant “knew” Islam had “no reasonable basis [for] possessing that money other than it was likely to be the proceeds of some serious criminal activity”


	
	This ground was abandoned at the hearing of the application.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant relied upon the maximum penalty for the offence of three years in comparison with the undiscounted starting point of two years as well as general sentencing principles, comparable cases and statistics in support of the proposition advanced by this ground which was to the effect that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	I have had regard to the cases and statistics in the limited way such matters are accepted to be useful. On their own, I do not see them as compelling a conclusion of manifest excess. They were not, however, contended to make good the ground on their own.
	
	
	Ms Beckett, in her well-researched and helpful written submissions (as equally were the submissions for the Crown), provided the court with reference to authorities in which there are discussions about the assessment of the seriousness of, and the determination of sentence for, offences of this type: see, for example, R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89; R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195; R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370; R v Guo [2010] NSWCCA 170; 201 A Crim R 403; and R v Ly [2014] NSWCCA 78.
	
	
	It may be readily accepted that the applicant’s offending conduct occurred on a single occasion over a relatively short period of time; his culpability was significantly less than that of the co-offender Islam; and the quantum of money involved was just over double the minimum threshold of $100,000 (in the context of there being no upper limit). There was no evidence of the applicant standing to derive any profit from his endeavours except for a free holiday in Bangladesh with business class travel. There was also no evidence that the applicant knew precisely the amount of money that was within his suitcase.
	
	
	Against matters such as those, however, is the fact that the applicant associated himself with what he should readily have appreciated was a planned endeavour to take out of the country a significant amount of money. He endeavoured to deceive the Customs authorities by falsely declaring that he had no more than $10,000 in his possession.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was clearly correct in holding that a sentence that reflected general deterrence was required. The importance of general deterrence in sentencing for money laundering offences has been repeatedly emphasised, although I accept the applicant’s submission that this is of greater significance in cases of offending over an extended period of time: R v Huang; R v Siu at [36]; R v Guo at [96].
	
	
	The applicant’s subjective case included that he had a prior criminal record of a few relatively minor matters but there was the aggravating feature that he was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time. He also had a longstanding problem with drug use which prompted the judge to make it a condition of the recognizance release order that he be supervised with particular attention to continuing drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	Having regard to all the circumstances, I acknowledge that views might differ about the severity of the sentence imposed, but I am clearly of the view that it cannot be characterised as manifestly excessive. I am not persuaded that this ground has been made out.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against sentence allowed.

2.   Appeal dismissed.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765933,R v Abdallah (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 121,"JUDGMENT

Introduction


	
	Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Nationwide News Pty Ltd (the Media) applied for access to CCTV footage and an audio recording of the Triple-0 call tendered in evidence and played in open court in the trial by jury of Katherine Abdallah for the murder of Suzie Sarkis, which commenced on 4 February 2015.
	
	
	The CCTV footage was recorded by cameras that the accused had arranged to be installed inside her townhouse at Brighton-Le-Sands less than a fortnight before she fatally stabbed Suzie Sarkis on Saturday 9 February 2013. Parts of the CCTV footage were tendered by the Crown, and other parts were tendered on behalf of the accused. The audio recording of the Triple-0 call was synchronised to the visual footage and played in open court in the trial.
	
	
	The Media applied for the CCTV footage and the audio recording to be released. Mr Maltz of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the Media, accepted that any such release be subject to a condition that access to the material be deferred until the Court adjourns following the jury’s verdict and subject to further order prior to that adjournment. On 23 February 2015 the jury returned majority verdicts of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.
	


Parties’ submissions


	
	Mr Maltz submitted that the principles of open justice ought operate to permit the material to be released. He contended that the public had a right to know what evidence had been adduced and that members of the public would have seen the footage had they come to court to watch the proceedings. He submitted that concerns about the dignity of the deceased could be adequately accommodated by limiting the footage that was released to exclude certain scenes, such as the act of stabbing or scenes of the deceased on the ground or where her body was exposed.
	
	
	Mr Maltz contended that concern about the conduct of this trial could be met by ordering that any order for access be stayed until further order and that the making of a release order could be deferred until, depending on the verdict reached, the time for an appeal had elapsed.
	
	
	Mr Maltz cited other instances in which graphic moving images taken by CCTV cameras or other film had been released to the media and submitted that the release was consistent with a robust approach to the principles of open justice. He instanced the following cases where access had been granted to audio-visual material:
	



	
	R v Jovanovic [2014] ACTSC 98: access granted to CCTV footage of infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person at a bus interchange;
	
	
	R v Kerr [2004] NSWSC 75: access granted to a video of a person killed by a moving train after being intimidated by an aggressive juvenile into walking across train tracks: discussed in R v Xu (No. 1) [2005] NSWSC 73 (Xu) at [27]-[31] (Kirby J);
	
	
	Access granted to an electronic record of interview with a 16 year old child, following the jury verdict, and subject to suppression of the image of an unrelated friend in the room: R v O’Grady [2000] NSWSC 1256.
	



	
	Mr Maltz distinguished Xu, where Kirby J refused access to footage that showed Ms Xu and her son disappearing from the end of a wharf in circumstances that gave rise to the inference that she jumped into the Parramatta River below. Ms Xu was subsequently rescued but attempts to revive her child were unsuccessful. Kirby J considered that the public interest in open justice was outweighed by the risk that the accused’s rehabilitation could be compromised by such images being given wide publicity if the footage were released. His Honour considered at [44]:
	


“Compared to that potential harm, the sacrifice to open justice is, in my view, small.”


	
	Mr Maltz submitted that the facts of Xu were wholly exceptional and distinguishable from the instant case. He contended that a refusal to release the material would tend to reduce confidence in the system and render any verdict returned by the jury the subject of ill-informed discussion. He submitted that to refuse release would leave a void in the discussion about the case which would inevitably be filled by speculation.
	
	
	Mr Stanton, on behalf of the accused, opposed any access being granted. He submitted that release of the material would tend to affect this trial and any retrial because it would have the effect of converting the public into judges, who would judge the guilt of the accused and assess any conduct of the deceased by reference to the footage rather than to the evidence as a whole. The presence of this second tier of triers of fact might place undue pressure on any future jury or expose those who constituted the jury at trial to adverse comment or debate of a personal kind. He submitted that the playing of the footage would have the effect that the images of his client’s conduct in the hours prior to the stabbing of the deceased would remain in the public domain for longer than such images could be expected to remain in the memory of those who saw them in open court. He contended that this would have an unduly adverse and wholly disproportionate effect on his client’s future. He also submitted, on behalf of the accused, that although the Media could be expected to report the matter responsibly and fairly, no such assumption could be made about others who would have access to the material once it was available on the internet.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the release of the footage. Madam Crown adopted Mr Stanton’s submission about the potential prejudice to the members of the jury, and submitted that the pressures on the jury would tend to be amplified by the release. She also relied on the following three bases.
	
	
	First, she said that the Director of Public Prosecutions had classified the footage as “sensitive” because it showed the moribund body of the deceased and also revealed an exposed breast. By reason of this classification, the footage had been released to the accused’s legal representatives and to experts only upon their giving undertakings not to copy or disseminate it.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown submitted that the interests of the deceased’s family ought be taken into account. The deceased’s parents had not seen the footage and had no desire to do so. I was informed by Madam Crown (who was unable to obtain evidence to establish this, having regard to the shortness of the notice given of the application) that the deceased’s sister, who is in her twenties, suffered a stroke as a result of her sister’s death and her psychological condition is unstable. She submitted that the deceased’s family opposed release of any such footage and that the mental and physical well-being of members of the deceased’s family could be compromised by its release.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the interests of open justice could be amply accommodated by the fact that the footage has been shown in court at least once and, in respect of some clips, a number of times. The Crown observed that it is open to the Media to describe the images and construct a narrative of how the images fit with the other evidence.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 314 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provides for media access to court documents, including the indictment, witness statements tendered in evidence and transcripts of evidence. It was common ground that the CCTV footage and audio recording do not fall within the document identified in s 314(2). The Media relied on Practice Note No. SC Gen 2, which applies to both divisions of this Court as well as the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Court of Appeal. Accordingly it covers a wide range of situations. It relevantly provides:
	


Access

6.   Access to material in any proceedings is restricted to parties, except with the leave of the Court.

7.   Access will normally be granted to non-parties in respect of:

-   pleadings and judgments in proceedings that have been concluded, except in so far as an order has been made that they or portions of them be kept confidential;

-   documents that record what was said or done in open court;

-   material that was admitted into evidence; and

-   information that would have been heard or seen by any person present in open court,

unless the Judge or registrar dealing with the application considers that the material or portions of it should be kept confidential. Access to other material will not be allowed unless a registrar or Judge is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.


	
	As the material sought was played in open court, access ought be granted unless I consider that the material, or portions of it, should be kept confidential.
	
	
	There are, in my view, several reasons why access to the CCTV footage and the audio recording of the Triple-0 call ought not be granted.
	
	
	Although the interests of open justice are particularly important in criminal trials, so too is the need for some circumspection with respect to the release of information, having regard to the need to protect the administration of justice. Judges who make decisions alone in civil trials are thought to be capable of putting out of their minds extraneous matters and of suspending judgment until the time for decision arrives. However, press coverage and commentary may influence those members of the public who may be called upon to be jurors and give rise to pressure being placed on those who are jurors, notwithstanding the safeguards built into the system to prevent this occurring.
	
	
	It is an important aspect of open justice that the press be permitted to report on court proceedings. The media become the eyes and ears of the public, who are entitled to be in the court room, which is why fair and accurate reporting of court proceedings is protected and why, as Spigelman CJ said in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [20]:
	


""Nothing should be done to discourage fair and accurate reporting of proceedings.""


	
	There is, of course, no impediment to the Media describing the CCTV footage or the tone of the accused’s voice on the audio recording of the Triple-0 call, since these were played in open court and could be the subject of report.
	
	
	Although the CCTV footage and audio recording formed part of the evidence in the trial, those who saw the footage and heard the recording can be expected to carry only a fleeting recollection of them. A person paying a visit to the courtroom in the course of the trial, including one who remained throughout, would have seen most of the footage but once. Even the crucial 10 minutes before the deceased was stabbed and the 10 minutes afterwards have been played at most 5 times in the course of a trial that lasted in the order of three weeks.
	
	
	If the material were released, it would put the public who viewed it in a substantially different position to someone who has been in the courtroom throughout the trial. The images would be posted on the internet and could be captured and replayed. This circumstance, when coupled with the graphic nature of the evidence, would tend to place undue significance on it. In my view, release of the footage and the audio recording would have a tendency to distort fair reporting of the trial and reduce the assessment of the accused’s conduct to what can be seen on the CCTV footage, rather than to the whole of the evidence.
	
	
	Trial by jury is an integral part of the administration of justice in New South Wales. For the duration of the trial, twelve members of the community, randomly selected and not identified, become, collectively, judges of the facts. They deliberate and return a verdict on behalf of the public. The public has a right to know of what occurs in the trial because of the system of open justice. The release of this material would tend, in my view, to compromise this process by facilitating, if not encouraging, the making of quick, ill-informed judgments by viewers of the internet who have neither heard the whole of the evidence nor read reports of the trial. Members of the jury might feel that they have to justify any verdict which does not accord with the summary judgment to which the public has come by reference to a momentary perusal of moving images of the conflict. I regard these potential consequences as inimical to the proper administration of justice.
	
	
	I also consider it to be a relevant matter that the footage was taken in a private residence. There is no evidence that anyone but the accused knew that the cameras were operating. Other persons, including the deceased, are depicted in the footage. Such footage was exposed to public gaze in the courtroom because of the public interest in open justice. However, in my view, to accede to the Media’s application that it be released would be likely to have the effect of encouraging prurient voyeurism and sensationalising the images. This is not to impute such motives to the Media, but rather to foresee the possibility that, if the material is released, some viewers, who have no particular interest in a fair report of the trial, will be attracted to the material.
	
	
	I have also weighed the interests of the deceased’s family, to which, as it happens, the accused also belongs, as she and the deceased were cousins. The difficulty of coming to terms with the loss of a 21 year old woman who died as a result of violence cannot be underestimated. The publicity that can be expected to be given to moving images of her last hours of life could not but aggravate their grief and distress.
	
	
	For these reasons I decline the access sought.

		26 February 2015",2015-02-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765936,Shane Justin McEwen v R [2015] NSWDC 248,"Judgment


	
	Shane Justin McEwen (the appellant) appeals against the convictions entered by Ms Kennedy LCM on 12 September 2014 at the Downing Centre Local Court in relation to a breach of Clause 265(3) of the Australian Road Rules 2008 (the Road Rules) that involved the appellant being the driver of a motor vehicle with 3 unrestrained passengers in the back seat. The appellant was fined the sum of $979.00, which was the amount on the traffic infringement notice.
	
	
	On the appeal, Mr Boland of Counsel appeared for the appellant and Mr George, solicitor, appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions; the respondent in the proceedings.
	
	
	The prosecution case can be summarised as follows. On 1 January 2014 the Police had set up a random breath testing station in the northbound lanes of Clark Road, Neutral Bay. The police officers used a police vehicle and orange witches hats to create a preclusion zone, where cars would be directed from lane two into lane one, in front of the police vehicle so that the drivers could be safely submitted to random breath testing. Senior Constable Smith then used a sign and a torch fitted with an orange opaque cover to direct drivers from lane two into the preclusion zone.
	
	
	At about 8.15pm Senior Constable Smith signalled to the appellant to bring his vehicle into the preclusion zone. As the vehicle passed Senior Constable Smith he noticed that the rear nearside passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and he called out to the police officers who were performing random breath testing “seatbelt” as he pointed to the rear passenger area of the vehicle. Senior Constable Gaskell was waiting to breath test the appellant and when the appellant’s vehicle came alongside of Senior Constable Gaskell, he noticed that none of the three rear passengers were wearing a seat belt. After performing the breath test and returning to the police vehicle, Senior Constable Gaskell issued the appellant with a traffic infringement notice.
	
	
	The appellant’s case can be summarised as follows. The appellant was travelling north on Clark Road, Neutral Bay in his vehicle, an M series Mercedes-Benz, with 4 passengers; being his wife Kathryn McEwen in the front passenger seat and 3 passengers in the back seat being; Ms Crabtree, Mr McIntyre and another male. The back seat passengers, the subject of the charge, were backpackers from the United Kingdom. The appellant’s case was that his vehicle was directed by the first police officer into the preclusion zone and that it then came to a stop alongside a second police officer behind some other stationary vehicles. The appellant waited for a short time presumably whilst the drivers of the vehicles in front were being breath tested. At about this time the back seat passengers removed their seatbelts. The vehicle was then directed forward to a third police officer, Senior Constable Gaskell, who breath tested the appellant and then spoke to him about the three unrestrained passengers, ultimately issuing him with the traffic infringement notice.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22];
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24].
	



	
	Tendered before me was the Crown bundle (Exhibit A), which comprised of a site diagram, the In-car footage (the ICV footage, Exhibit B), the statement of Francesca Jade Crabtree dated 1 September 2014, the statement of Cameron James McIntyre dated 29 August 2014 and the transcript of the hearing before the magistrate on 12 September 2014.
	
	
	I have read Exhibit A and I watched the ICV footage contained on Exhibit B in Court during the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	Clause 265 of the Road Rules provides:
	


A passenger in or on a motor vehicle that is moving, or that is stationary but not parked, must comply with sub-rule (2) if he or she:

is 16 years old or older, and

is not exempt from wearing a seatbelt under rule 267.

The passenger:

must occupy a seating position that is fitted with an approved seatbelt, and

must not occupy the same seating position as another passenger (…), and

must wear the seatbelt properly adjusted and fastened.

The driver of a motor vehicle (except a bus or taxi) that is moving, or that is stationary but not parked, must ensure that each passenger in or on the vehicle who is 16 years old or older complies with subrule (2) unless the passenger is exempt from wearing a seatbelt under rule 267.


	
	I am satisfied from reading the transcript that the case for the prosecution before the magistrate was that the three backseat passengers were at no stage wearing a seatbelt; that is from the time the vehicle passed Senior Constable Smith and entered the preclusion zone. I am also satisfied that the prosecution did not seek to make out the offence before the magistrate by relying on the appellant’s case, by arguing that even if the backseat passengers had removed their seatbelts after the vehicle entered the preclusion zone that the offence had still been committed.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	The magistrate recited the evidence in the case for the prosecution and the defence. The magistrate noted the issue between the parties as to the timing of the relevant events. The magistrate considered the timing issue to be “probably more relevant to general credibility than any real issue in the case”. The magistrate further considered that the appellant and Mrs McEwen were not in a position to see what the backseat passengers were doing and that each of them had no recollection of inquiring as to whether the backseat passengers were wearing their seatbelts. The magistrate considered the police officers’ evidence to be clear and inferentially accepted it. The magistrate did not expressly reject the evidence of the appellant or Mrs McEwen, but decided that they were not in a position to see and had no knowledge of whether or not the backseat passengers were wearing their seatbelts. The magistrate made no express finding as to the evidence of Ms Crabtree and Mr McIntyre.
	
	
	The magistrate made no express credit findings to which I must have regard. The magistrate’s decision was based on an acceptance of the police evidence and a finding that the appellant and Mrs McEwen were not in a position to contradict the police case.
	


Consideration


	
	After considering all of the evidence and the submissions of the appellant and the Crown, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offence for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Senior Constable Smith had sufficient opportunity to observe that the backseat passenger on the nearside of the appellant’s vehicle was not wearing a seatbelt as the vehicle drove past him. It was 8.15pm and it was dusk. The evidence was that Senior Constable Smith was using a torch, presumably because it was dark enough to need to do so. The vehicle’s windows were tinted. The vehicle moved past him in a very short period of time and his opportunity to see the chest and shoulder area of the relevant passenger would have been even further limited by his line of sight past the front passenger and the door pillar of the vehicle. Further, once the vehicle passed him his line of sight would have been obscured.
	
	
	Under cross-examination, Senior Constable Smith conceded that his first opportunity to observe the passenger was when the vehicle was 1 metre away and going past him (T13 lines 5-10). In that context I do not accept Senior Constable Smith’s estimate of having a 2-3 second chance to observe of the vehicle (T20 line 46) travelling at between 10-20 km/hour, as being realistic. In my view his opportunity to observe the rear passenger must have been much shorter than 2-3 seconds. Senior Constable Smith stated in cross-examination that he believed the window he looked through was up (T9 line 2). In those circumstances I cannot rely on his observations as being accurate. Senior Constable Smith made no notes on the night of the incident (T40 line 37) and prepared a statement on the day of the hearing being 12 September 2014, some 9 months after the incident (T8 line 5). He relied on the statement prepared by Senior Constable Gaskell, which itself was prepared on 8 June 2014, some 6 months after the incident (T8 line 10). Senior Constable Gaskell stated in his evidence that he asked the appellant to lower the rear passenger window (T41 line 8).
	
	
	I note the evidence that both officers had conducted many other random breath testing operations between 1 January 2014 and the date of the hearing. The evidence was to the effect that they would be involved in random breath testing on every shift, weather permitting. I cannot accept Senior Constable Smith’s clarity of recollection of this particular incident and I do not accept his evidence to the required standard.
	
	
	Second, I have respectfully come to a different view on the timing evidence to that of the magistrate. In my view the evidence in the appellant’s case to the effect that he had to wait alongside a second police officer before proceeding to Senior Constable Gaskell, is to be preferred to the evidence in the prosecution case. The appellant’s witnesses were ad idem on this issue. In contrast, Senior Constable Gaskell was “100% sure” (T53 line 50) that there was no intervening officer. I do not accept the purported clarity of Senior Constable Gaskell’s recollection because he made limited notes on the night of the alleged offence, he only prepared his statement on 8 June 2014 and he has been involved in a large number of random breath testing operations between the incident and the time when he gave evidence. I note that Senior Constable Gaskell recorded some oral notes on the ICV footage.
	
	
	I have listened to that recording and they do not assist in corroborating Senior Constable Gaskell’s evidence on this point. On the other hand, this was an unusual event for the appellant and Mrs McEwen and they had reason to remember the details of it. Further, the appellant raised character in the course of the case before the magistrate and I am entitled to take into account that he is a person that is less likely to give a false account of what occurred on the night, and I accept his evidence on this point and generally.
	
	
	Third, the evidence of Ms Crabtree and Mr McIntyre was in my view properly admitted into evidence, pursuant to either sections 64 or 65 Evidence Act 1995. The witnesses were available, but residing in the United Kingdom and calling them would have caused undue expense and would not in the circumstances have been reasonably practicable. In the appeal the prosecution took no issue about the admissibility of the statements. In paragraphs 9 and 10 of her statement, Ms Crabtree stated;
	


“When the car stopped he [Mr McIntyre] took off his seatbelt and looked across at me and Jordan … I followed [Mr McIntyre] and took my seatbelt off too and waited to see what was going to happen next”.


	
	In paragraphs 9 and 10 of his statement, Mr McIntyre stated;
	


“[The appellant] stopped the car and there were a number of police cars about. When the car stopped I thought that we all had to get out of the car so I undid my seatbelt and looked at [Ms Crabtree] and Jordan who undid their seatbelts as well”.


	
	Once in evidence, the statements of Ms Crabtree and Mr McIntyre raised a reasonable possibility that the appellant was not guilty of the offence charged. In particular, there is evidence that could not be contradicted, by reason of circumstances outside the appellant’s control, that the backseat passengers were wearing their seatbelts when the appellant’s vehicle entered the preclusion zone, but had removed them in response to the short delay that ensued, which for the reasons stated I have found had occurred. The police officers had the opportunity to take statements from the backseat passengers, but chose not to do so. The police had the ICV system available to them, but chose not to have it activated at the relevant time.
	
	
	After taking the statements, the appellant forwarded them to the prosecution and sought a response, going so far as offering to fly the witnesses from the United Kingdom or to arrange an audio-visual link (T2 lines 25-28). The appellant’s solicitor was available to give evidence as to the efforts that had been undertaken to obtain the statements (T2 lines 10-17). The appellant’s solicitor was not required by the prosecution for cross-examination (T2 line 20). The prosecution bore the onus of proving the elements of the offence at all times and in the event that the circumstances of procuring the evidence of the back seat passengers gave rise to any reasonable doubt, the benefit of that doubt must go to the appellant.
	
	
	In conclusion, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved the elements of the charge and I make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction allowed;
	
	
	Set aside the orders of the magistrate of 12 September 2014;
	
	
	Dismiss the Court Attendance Notice.

		03 November 2015",2015-02-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765947,R v Do (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 111,"Judgment


	
	The Crown has served a notice under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to lead firsthand hearsay evidence of certain matters that might broadly be described as relationship evidence. The evidence is of conversations between the deceased and various persons where the deceased has said things about the accused and her relationship with him.
	
	
	The evidence concerned is specified in the Notice but largely falls into two categories as was accepted by the parties. The first relates to discussions about a prenuptial agreement between the accused and the deceased. The second concerns the position of the accused’s visa to stay in Australia.
	
	
	There were a few other passages in dispute. I rejected paragraph 9 of the Statement of Aminda Huynh dated 27 September 2012 as being conclusionary. Portions identified in paragraphs 14 and 15 were not objected to if led in proper form. The highlighted portion of paragraph 19 was objected to on the basis that the evidence did not inform matters about the relationship and was conclusionary. I consider that the material did provide relevant evidence about the state of the relationship but that it needed to be led in admissible form.
	
	
	I turn now to consider the remainder of the material which falls within one or both of the areas mentioned.
	
	
	In each case the defence argues that the evidence is of such little probative value and that that probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In each case the Crown submits that the area of discourse is part of the whole relationship between the accused and the deceased and, in particular, that the matters gave rise to, and contributed to, tension in the relationship between the parties such that it is important that the evidence be before the jury.
	


(1)   The prenuptial agreement


	
	The evidence tends to suggest some doubt about the marital status that existed between the accused and the deceased. Exhibit 2 on the voir dire was what was entitled “A Marriage Keepsake” which otherwise purported to be a marriage certificate evidencing a marriage at Sacramento in California on 7 July 2011. Yet a number of witnesses report conversations at a later time with the deceased concerning what was called a prenuptial agreement and the deceased’s desire to have the accused sign such a document.
	
	
	The following are the relevant passages in the statements:
	



	
	Aminda Huynh dated 27 September 2012 – paragraph 42;
	
	
	Alice Huynh dated 15 September 2012 – paragraph 18;
	
	
	Alice Huynh dated 27 September 2012 – paragraphs 32 and 35;
	
	
	Anna Huynh dated 27 September 2012 – paragraph 28;
	
	
	Tri Dung Vo dated 6 October 2012 – paragraphs 9 and 10;
	
	
	Vien Doan paragraph 15
	



	
	It is not necessary to set out what is contained in those paragraphs in detail. It is sufficient to say that, with the exception to what is contained in the statement of Tri Dung Vo, the evidence concerns conversations that the deceased has had with the witnesses of her desire that the accused sign a prenuptial agreement but that he would not do so because he said he did not want to have any part of the family’s financial affairs. The material in the statement of Mr Vo, who is a solicitor, is that the deceased spoke to him about his preparing a financial agreement between her and the accused and then refer to his efforts to follow those instructions up.
	
	
	The defence submits that the evidence was of small probative value because of the small degree to which the evidence bore upon the relationship. There is certainly other evidence of disharmony in the relationship, as the defence accepts, but this present evidence is said only to disclose a belief on the part of the deceased that the accused would not sign the prenuptial agreement. The evidence does not indicate that on the side of the accused this brought about disharmony in the relationship.
	
	
	In Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230 Macfarlan JA (with whom Price and McCallum JJ agreed) said:
	


[33]   The Crown also submitted that the evidence was relevant to demonstrate ""the nature of the relationship"" (Crown's Written Submissions [17]) but, consistently with the approach taken by this Court in Qualtieri [Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 417] and DJV [DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272], it is insufficient to rely solely upon such a proposition. Evidence ""is not relevant merely because it discloses aspects of the relationship between an accused and a complainant. There must be an issue which the evidence may explain or resolve by placing the alleged events in their true context"": DJV per McClellan CJ at CL at [29]. Particularly because of its potentially prejudicial character, the precise basis upon which the evidence is relevant must be closely analysed. …


	
	In my opinion, the issue which the evidence may explain was the apparently declining relationship between the accused and the deceased. It is apparent that the prenuptial agreement in the deceased’s mind was a matter of some significance that she mentioned it as often as she did.
	
	
	Common sense suggests that in the case of the killing of a person where the accused is a spouse, a partner or even a friend, the nature of the relationship between the accused and the deceased would need to be explored. That may be because the evidence would disclose positive things between the parties as well as negative things. So much can be discerned from what was said by Barwick CJ in Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 337 and Heydon JA in Clark v R [2001] NSWCCA 494; (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 at [135] and [137].
	
	
	In my opinion the evidence has probative value. It would be artificial to excise evidence relating to the prenuptial agreement from the other evidence about the relationship generally and, in particular, other evidence about tensions in the relationship and the causes of that tension.
	
	
	The defence says that the admission of this evidence will cause unfair prejudice because the jury will unduly concentrate on the failure of the accused to agree to sign a prenuptial agreement and might wrongly reason that he did so with a view to killing the deceased. The defence says that no direction given to the jury could overcome the prejudice because the giving of a direction would serve only to emphasise the issue in the jury’s mind.
	
	
	No case will be put by the Crown suggesting any link between the evidence concerning the prenuptial agreement and the deceased’s death apart from the fact that it was one of a number of contributing factors to the increased tension within the relationship.
	
	
	The evidence concerning the prenuptial agreement does not tend to emphasise any behaviour or hostile attitude on the part of the accused. In that regard, the defence is correct in saying that the emphasis is on the belief and apparent irritation on the deceased’s part that the accused would not sign such an agreement. However, that conclusion does not mean that the evidence does not have probative value. It does, however, point to the small nature, if any, of prejudice that will arise by reason of its admission. The issue is simply presented as one of a number of matters which, at least on the side of the deceased, was increasing the level of tension within the relationship.
	
	
	In my opinion, the evidence is admissible.
	
	
	The defence also sought to have excluded the portions of the ERISP that dealt with the prenuptial agreement on the ground that the evidence was unfair because of the questioning. The relevant questions and answers are as follows:
	


Q430   [00.34] And I also believe that you were, are married to Kim in America.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q431   O.K. And you were talking about getting married in Australia.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q432   O.K. We've also been told about prior to you getting married in Australia that Kim wished for you to sign a prenuptial agreement.

A (Int):    …what about prenup, can you say a little bit further.

Q433   A prenuptial agreement is an agreement that if you divorce that you won't have a claim against the properties or money that those persons already had.

A (Int):   There is no, she, she didn't want to do any prenup and there is no prenup in place. And the children, her children already know that, you know, they will, you know, inherit her fortune and what we enjoys, you know, when we retire that what we are working together, together.

Q434   O.K. I'm aware of that. Now the question is, and I know that there is no prenuptial agreement signed.

INTERPRETER: Yes.

DETECTIVE SERGEANT LOWE

Q435   My question is, did Kim ask you to sign a prenuptial agreement before you got married?

[D: No, she said no need. She and I...] [Int: ... just answer the question. The question is simple and please answer to the question.] [D: Yeah.] [Int: Don't expand it further, that is before you got married to Kim, did she tell you that she wanted you to sign a prenup...] [D: No.] [Int:... like an agreement prior to getting married?] [D: No.]

A (Int):   No. She said, no, no.

Q436   When did you first hear about this agreement?

A (Int):   I didn't know anything about it and I only know it now when you told me but I didn't know it before that.

Q437   O.K. So, so this is the first time you've heard of any such plan of Kim?

A (Int):   No, she, she didn't tell me anything.

Q438   Did any of the daughters talk to you about this?

A (Int):   No. No. No, they never. No, they never, they never let me know. They never tell me anything.

Q438   Hearing about such a thing now how does that make you feel?

A(Int) I didn't, I didn't feel anything because, you know, I, I didn't pay attention to the money or I am not interested in money. I don't know anything about the money matters. Actually she did all the paperwork. She help me to get the divorce paper with my previous wife and then she went to America to do the paperwork about, you know, marriage certificate, you know, our marriage certificate. She lodge application for me to migrate to Australia. She did every paperwork. I didn't know anything about paperwork.

Q440   [00.40] O.K. O.K. So there was no talk or anything, you have no

knowledge of a prenuptial agreement until I've just mentioned it?

A (Int):   Yeah, that's the case. I never heard anything about that. She never told me anything about that until now, until when you told me about it.


	
	The answer in bold to Q 435 is the translation by an interpreter subsequently engaged by the New South Wales Crime Commission to listen to the tape of the accused’s ERISP and translate what he heard where it differed from the translation provided at the time.
	
	
	The Crown will rely upon the answers given by the accused that he knew nothing about a prenuptial agreement and that he said the deceased had never asked him to sign one.
	
	
	The unfairness is said to derive from the confusion about the marital status of the accused and the deceased. I noted earlier that there was what purported to be a marriage certificate showing that the accused and the deceased had married in Sacramento in July 2011 but that the subsequent conversations by the deceased in relation to a prenuptial agreement suggested otherwise.
	
	
	Question 435 is said to be unfair because it is ambiguous. It is submitted that the question was understood by the accused as being asked of the period before the Sacramento marriage. There is no evidence that the deceased asked the accused to sign such an agreement before that marriage. All of the evidence was at a time after July 2011 when the accused came to live in Australia.
	
	
	Whilst I can accept that question 435 when viewed in isolation contains some ambiguity (it could be referring to the marriage in Sacramento or it could be referring to a proposed marriage in Australia), when understood in the context of the earlier questions, I do not consider that there is any unfairness arising from the answers. While question 430 asked whether the accused married the deceased in America, question 431 and 432 asked about a proposed marriage in Australia. (I observe in passing that it is not clear what status such a marriage would have if the marriage in Sacramento was a valid one.) In particular, the first time the questioner introduces the topic of a prenuptial agreement was in question 432 which asked about the signing of such a document “prior to you getting married in Australia”. The only fair reading of question 435 is that it was asking the same question as question 432.
	
	
	I have already held that conversations relating to the signing of a prenuptial agreement are admissible. I do not consider that there is any unfairness arising from these particular questions in the ERISP. It is ultimately a question for the jury what they make of the answers given to these questions when set against the evidence of the witnesses who detail conversations from the deceased about the accused is alleged to have said and the evidence of Aminda Huynh of her discussions with the accused about the matter.
	
	
	I decline to reject this part of the ERISP.
	


(2)   The visa arrangement


	
	There is evidence from an officer of the Department of Immigration Border Protection that the accused applied for a sub-class 820/sub-class 801 partner combined visa on 28 September 2011. The deceased was recorded as the visa sponsor for the application. By 17 February 2015 no decision had been made on the accused’s sub-class 820 temporary partner application. There was no record in the system of the Department having been advised or been given information to indicate that the relationship between the deceased and the accused had broken down.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to lead that evidence and also evidence in the following statements concerning the accused’s visa:
	



	
	Aminda Huynh of 27 September 2012 – paragraph 19;
	
	
	Anna Huynh of 27 September 2012 – paragraph 27;
	
	
	Vien Doan – paragraphs 15 and 16.
	



	
	The defence submits that the evidence about the visa arrangements has no probative value. It cannot assist the jury to come to any view that the accused intended to kill the deceased because, if the deceased was not alive, the accused would cease to have the sponsor for him to obtain his permanent residence in the country.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the visa matter and the discussions about sending the accused back to America were just one of a number of issues that were contributing to disharmony in the relationship. Again, the Crown submits that it would be artificial to excise that aspect of the relationship from the other matters.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submission that it would be artificial to excise this matter from the remainder of the details of the relationship. Mr Smith SC submitted that it was highly prejudicial because the jury could reason that she was supporting the accused and that the threat to withdraw the support might have led him to murder her. Because, I think, that this was somewhat counter-intuitive Mr Smith said that he struggled to articulate why the evidence was indeed probative at all.
	
	
	I accept that the visa matter has less probative value than some of the other differences between the accused and the deceased. However, it forms a part of their relationship and it might be thought by the jury to have a significance in favour of the accused. His continuing residence in this country appears to have been dependent upon continuing sponsorship by the deceased.
	
	
	I do not consider that there is unfair prejudice from the admission of the evidence. As I have indicated, the evidence tends to support an inference that the accused would not want the deceased dead precisely because he did not want to return to the USA.
	
	
	In my opinion the evidence should be admitted.

		19 March 2015",2015-02-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765948,Wilde v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 28,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant served periods of imprisonment for three sexual offences involving violence towards a female victim. Since the expiration of the term of the third sentence, the appellant has been the subject of a number of supervision and detention orders made pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act).

On 1 April 2014, Hall J made a further extended supervision order pursuant to the Act in respect of the appellant. The order had a term of 3 years and required that the appellant comply with 65 conditions. On appeal, the appellant did not dispute the making of the order for the three-year period, but contended that Hall J was in error in imposing certain of the conditions.

The disputed conditions related to: association with Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs and other organisations declared under the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012 (NSW); the possession or viewing of material classified as X18+ or Refused Classification; the possession or consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs; and searches of the appellant’s computer devices.

The appellant contended that, in the exercise of his discretion to impose the conditions, Hall J erred in two respects. Firstly, he failed to apply the correct test under s 11 of the Act, which, the appellant contended, required that each proposed condition address an identified risk of sexual reoffending. Second, the appellant contended that Hall J applied a different and broader test, relating to the punitive or onerous nature of the condition, when imposing the condition relating to searches of computer devices.

Per the Court

(1)   Section 11 of the Act does not require that the proposed condition must have a specific demonstrated link to past offending. Rather, s 11 requires that the court be satisfied, having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act, that it is appropriate to impose a particular condition so as to address the risk of future re-offending of the kind that formed the basis of the extended supervision order. [53]

(2)   It may be appropriate to impose particular conditions under s 11, having regard to the scope, purpose, and objects of the Act, notwithstanding that the past offences did not involve conduct of the type constrained by such conditions. [54]

(3)   In the circumstances of the case, the imposition of conditions restricting the appellant’s access to alcohol were an appropriate means of controlling a possible risk factor for reoffending. [62]-[68]

State of New South Wales v Stevenson [2013] NSWSC 1070; State of New South Wales v Boatswain [2014] NSWSC 1446; State of New South Wales v Hill [2014] NSWSC 1803.

(4)   In the circumstances of the case, the imposition of conditions restricting the appellant from associating with Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs was appropriate, having regard to the Act's rehabilitative purpose and the link between reintegration into the community and reduced rates of recidivism. [69]-[70]

(5)   His Honour’s reasoning process in imposing the condition relating to supervision of the appellant’s computer devices was not in error, as it incorporated reasoning that related to the condition that prohibited the appellant from viewing material which is Refused Classification or X18+. [71]-[75]

(6)   The imposition of the condition prohibiting the appellant from viewing material which is Refused Classification or X18+ was appropriate for the reasons explained by his Honour. [72], [76]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 1 April 2014, Hall J made an extended supervision order in respect of the appellant pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act), s 9(1)(a). The order commenced on 2 April 2014 for a term of three years. His Honour further ordered, pursuant to s 11 of that Act, that the appellant comply with the conditions set out in Schedule A to his Honour’s judgment. Schedule A contained 65 conditions. (To avoid confusion, this judgment will refer to the conditions by Part and number as set out in Schedule A.)
	
	
	The appellant appeals against the imposition of certain of the conditions imposed (the disputed conditions). The appellant does not dispute the making of the extended supervision order for the three-year period specified by his Honour. However, he contends that his Honour erred in imposing certain of the conditions. The appellant recognised that the imposition of conditions involved the exercise of a discretion so that, to succeed on his appeal, it was necessary to establish that there had been an error in the exercise of that discretion, including an error of law: see House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	The appellant contended that his Honour erred in the following two respects in imposing the disputed conditions:
	



	
	In failing to have regard to and to apply the correct test under s 11, which, on the appellant’s contention, required that each proposed condition address an identified risk of sexual reoffending;
	
	
	In applying a different and broader test when imposing Condition K(49).
	



	
	The disputed conditions were as follows:
	


“Part C. Place and travel restrictions

…

(19)   [The appellant] must not attend any premises that he knows to be frequented by any person who he knows to be a member and/or associate of any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, Organised Criminal Network, or Criminal Organisation (as declared under the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012).

…

Part E. Non associations

…

(30)   [The appellant] must not associate with any person he knows to be a member and/or associate with any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, Organised Criminal Network, or Criminal Organisation (as declared under the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012), without the prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer.

…

Part G. Access to Pornographic, Violent and Classified Material

(40)   [The appellant] must not purchase, possess, access, obtain, view, participate in or listen to material classified or material that would be classified as Refused Classification and X18+, or any other material as directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer.

…

Part I. Alcohol and drugs

(42)   [The appellant] must not possess or consume any illicit drugs.

(43)   [The appellant] must not possess or consume any alcohol (including any alcohol-based products such as methylated spirits), without prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer.

(44)   [The appellant] must submit to drug and alcohol testing as directed by the Departmental supervising officer or any officer of Corrective Services NSW who from time to time supervises [the appellant].

Part K. Search and Seizure

…

Search of computer

(49)   If and as directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer, [the appellant] must:

(a)   permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person, to access, inspect and remove any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by [the appellant], including the temporary removal of the computer or other device from [the appellant’s] place of residence or his or her person for the purpose of inspection or the imaging of the contents of the computer;

(b)   take all available steps to permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person to have access to and inspect any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by [the appellant];

(c)   provide the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person with any requested assistance to enable either or both of them to access and inspect any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by [the appellant] including providing them with any required passwords;

(d)   permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person to make copies of any files or materials on any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by [the appellant] that the Departmental Supervising Officer reasonably believes may be relevant to the management of [the appellant’s] risk of re-offending …”

Factual background

(a) Personal circumstances


	
	The appellant is 53 years of age (52 at the time of the hearing before the primary judge). He has been in full-time custody since the age of 19, save for a period of approximately three years. At the expiration of the term of his last sentence, the appellant was detained pursuant to continuing detention orders made under the Act. The last of those orders expired on 12 December 2008. Upon his release, the appellant became subject to a number of interim and final extended supervision orders. Subsequently, due to breaches of those orders, the appellant has spent a total of two further years in custody.
	
	
	The appellant has lived continuously in the community since 15 July 2012 and currently resides in private rental accommodation. Since his release he has been subject to extended supervision orders, including the current order. The appellant has not sexually reoffended since his sentence expired in September 2008 and there have been no breaches of the extended supervision orders in place since his last release from custody in 2012.
	


(b) The serious sexual offences


	
	The appellant has three convictions for sexual offences, each involving violence towards a female victim. In particular, each case involved the victim being forced to submit to sexual intercourse at knifepoint.
	
	
	The first offence was committed in 1981, when the appellant was 19 years of age. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years with a non-parole period of two years. In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge, Nagle CJ at CL, noted that the appellant had given, as an explanation for his offending conduct, that he had consumed “a deal of alcohol”.
	
	
	The appellant was found guilty of a second sexual offence, together with a charge of motor vehicle theft, in 1983. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of six years. The sentencing judge, Mathews DCJ, in her sentencing remarks, described the appellant’s treatment of the victim to be “with the greatest degree of degradation and depravity”.
	
	
	The third offence of which the appellant was convicted occurred in 1991. The appellant was sentenced to a period of 16 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years. In respect of that offence, the sentencing judge, Ducker DCJ, described the appellant as having inflicted upon his victim, a woman alone in her own home, “the most degrading, humiliating, physically painful and distressing non-consensual sexual acts”. His Honour further remarked upon the appellant’s violence, observing that he “[exuded] a sense of latent, only barely concealed violence, which does not bode well for his future, nor that of the community when he is released”. His Honour also commented that the appellant had “resorted to [the] same modus operandi” as he had in respect of his past offences including “the use of knives to intimidate; the apparent need to degrade and humiliate the victims; [and] the choice as victims of lone women in their own homes”. His Honour also commented upon the appellant’s “dangerous propensities”.
	


Documentation before the primary judge


	
	In support of its application for an extended supervision order, and in accordance with ss 6 and 7 of the Act, the State filed a number of reports and other evidence. These included psychiatric reports of Professor Greenburg and Dr Samuels, a risk assessment report prepared by Patrick Sheehan, senior forensic psychologist with Corrective Services, psychological counselling notes of Ms Howell and progress notes prepared by officers of Corrective Services in relation to the appellant’s supervision.
	
	
	The following relevant matters emerge from that material.
	
	
	Professor Greenburg, in his report dated 2 March 2014, assessed the appellant as having significant static and dynamic risk factors that heightened his risk of sexually reoffending. Professor Greenburg stated that based on an actuarial and clinically guided risk assessment approach, the appellant’s risk of sexually reoffending would be in the ‘high risk’ category range over the long term.
	
	
	Included in the dynamic risk factors considered by Professor Greenburg were “social influences”. Professor Greenburg noted that the appellant had “previously claimed that he had strong affiliations with bikers and pagans”, but that more recently he had established relationships with a Christian motorcycle group known as the ‘God Squad’. The appellant, however, informed Professor Greenburg that he “was not a Christian but was into witchcraft”. He also reported his “social influences” to be “boring”. Professor Greenburg questioned the appellant about “the negative influences with other offenders or pro-criminal groups”. Professor Greenburg reported that the appellant was “dismissive of this discussion”, questioning “who was saying” that he had “negative social influences” and that the persons asking were “pieces of shit”.
	
	
	The appellant denied to Professor Greenburg that he had any history of alcohol or drug abuse but disclosed that he had tried “most drugs” between the ages of 8 and 18 and claimed that he could legally smoke cannabis as it was “part of his witchcraft religion”.
	
	
	Professor Greenburg also commented upon “distorted attitudes”, one of the dynamic risk factors relevant to re-offending. Professor Greenburg commented that the appellant had his own “moral system” that he claimed was superior to that of the community. Professor Greenburg, when considering this risk factor again observed that the appellant claimed to have “strong ties with the pagan and bikie community”. During the course of his consultation with the appellant, Professor Greenburg questioned him as to reports of his being intimidating and of making threats of violence. The appellant’s response was noted as follows:
	


“I don’t make threats. I can’t help how others feel. That’s their problem. I want to be left to live my life free. If they can’t handle it, that’s their problem.”


	
	Professor Greenburg was asked to comment upon the conditions the State sought to have imposed upon the appellant. He proffered the opinion that the conditions on the making of an extended supervision order that were proposed at that stage were “more likely than not to assist a non-recidivistic reintegration into the community”. It should be noted that the conditions upon which Professor Greenburg was asked to comment did not include any prohibition on association with any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang as defined in the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012 (NSW).
	
	
	Dr Samuels was also appointed to assess the appellant for the purpose of providing a report to the court pursuant to s 7 of the Act. The appellant refused to participate in the assessment. Accordingly, Dr Samuels’ report dated 21 February 2014 was based upon the material provided to him, including the extensive notes of Corrective Services relating to the management of the appellant. One particular matter to which Dr Samuels referred and to which reference should be made was that the appellant had used aliases to set up computer accounts. Dr Samuels concluded that the conditions sought by the State were appropriate. However, as was the case with Professor Greenburg, the conditions of which Dr Samuels was advised did not include any prohibition on association with Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs.
	
	
	In his risk assessment report dated 14 November 2013, Mr Sheehan observed that although the appellant denied substance abuse or problems with alcohol, he had admitted to cannabis use. Mr Sheehan also referred to the observations of Nagle CJ at CL that alcohol had been a factor in the commission of the first offence and that there were “prior institutional misconducts for possession of drug paraphernalia, consuming alcohol and refusing urinalysis”. Mr Sheehan noted that the appellant had not been known to consume alcohol or other drugs during his current supervision order, nor had he returned a positive breath analysis or urinalysis.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan commented upon social influences, noting that an offender’s social network is one of the most well established predictors of criminal behaviour.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan, as part of his consideration of “established Dynamic Risk Factors”, reported that the appellant had previously described, in 2008, a “strong affiliation” with “bikers” “pagans” and “environmentalist[s]”. Mr Sheehan also commented upon various references to violence by the appellant. The most recent of these was in 2013 when he had asked his case worker about the possibility of assisting a friend to retrieve her possessions from her former landlord by attending the residence in bikie clothes to intimidate the landlord and using a sledgehammer to get in the door.
	
	
	In the context of the appellant’s “self-regulation”, Mr Sheehan commented that the appellant had:
	


“… a stereotypical response to coping with a adversity with violent rumination and threat. These are at times grandiose and fantastical, however [the appellant’s] history of sexual violence against women suggests that there are occasions when the threat is real.”


	
	Mr Sheehan recommended that the successful management of the appellant:
	


“… would involve containment of those behaviours associated with risk … whilst simultaneously encouraging the development and maintenance of a stable and sustainable lifestyle …”

In this respect, Mr Sheehan referred, inter alia, to “building positive social relationships”.


	
	There are other references in the documentation to association with motorbike gangs in addition to those referred to above. For example in a file note of 23 April 2010 of Ms Howell, psychological counsellor, reference is made to a complaint by the appellant that “CCG never helped his reintegration since release from custody will not allow him to join motorcycle club, been told whether legal or outlaw all criminals”.
	


Legislation


	
	The Act provides, relevantly, for the supervision and detention of high risk sex offenders. The primary object of the Act, as provided for in s 3(1), is to provide for the extended supervision and detention of such offenders “so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community”. Subsection (2) provides that another object of the Act “is to encourage high risk sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation”. (The Act also relates to high risk violent offenders. However, the present case is concerned only with the Act insofar as it relates to a high risk sex offender.)
	
	
	A “sex offender” is defined in s 4 to mean “a person over the age of 18 years who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence”. A “serious sex offence” for the purposes of the Act is defined in s 5 to mean:
	


“(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a serious sex offence means any of the following offences:

(a)   an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900, where:

(i)   in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more, and

(ii)   in the case of an offence against an adult, the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation (within the meaning of the provision under which the offence arises),

(a1)   an offence under section 61K or 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900,

(b)   an offence under section 38, 86 (1) (a1), 111, 112, 113 or 114 (1) (a), (c) or (d) of the Crimes Act 1900 that has been committed with intent to commit an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900, where the offence intended to be committed is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more,

and includes:

(c)   an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act, and

(c1)   an offence by a person that, at the time it was committed, was not a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act but which was committed in circumstances that would make the offence a serious sex offence if it were committed at the time an application for an order against the person is made under this Act, and

(d)   any other offence that, at the time it was committed, was a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act.”


	
	A “high risk sex offender” is defined in s 5B to mean a person who is a “sex offender” and in respect of whom:
	


“… the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that [the person] poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if … not kept under supervision.”


	
	Pursuant to s 5B, in determining whether a person “poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence” the Supreme Court “is not required to determine that the risk of the person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not”.
	
	
	There is no dispute that the appellant is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of the Act.
	
	
	The application for and the making of an extended supervision order is governed by Pt 2. Section 5H provides that the State may apply to the Supreme Court for an extended supervision order against an offender. Such an application may only be made in respect of a “supervised sex offender”: s 5I(1). A “supervised sex offender” is a sex offender who, when the application for the order is made is, relevantly, under supervision pursuant to “an existing extended supervision order or continuing detention order”: s 5I(2)(b). The application must be supported by the documentation prescribed by s 6(3) as follows:
	


“(3)   An application must be supported by documentation:

(a)   that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 9 (3), and

(b)   that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner) that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing:

(i)   a further serious sex offence (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order), or

(ii)   a further serious violence offence (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).”


	
	Section 7 provides for pre-trial procedures in relation to an application for an extended supervision order, including conducting a preliminary hearing: s 7(3). If the Court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation presented at the preliminary hearing would, if proved, justify the making of an order, then it must make orders appointing psychiatrists and/or psychologists to provide reports in respect of the offender.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 9(1)(a), the Supreme Court may make an extended supervision order. Section 9(3) provides a non-exhaustive list of the matters to which the Court must have regard in determining an application under s 9(1):
	


“(3)   In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a)   the safety of the community,

(b)   the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)   the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)   the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1)   any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e)   any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h)   the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)   the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)   any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).”


	
	Section 11 provides that an extended supervision order may direct an offender to comply with such conditions as the Supreme Court considers appropriate, including but not limited to conditions of the type specified in paras (a)-(n). The conditions specified in s 11 (in its form as at the date of hearing) were the following:
	


“(a)   to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender’s residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or

(a1)   to permit any corrective services officer to access any computer or related equipment that is at the offender’s residential address or in the possession of the offender, or

(b)   to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or

(c)   to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or

(d)   to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or

(e)   to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or

(ea)   to reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or

(f)   not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or

(g)   not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or

(h)   not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or

(i)   not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or

(j)   not to change his or her name.”


	
	Pursuant to the amendments made by the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Amendment Act 2014 (NSW), s 11 now includes the following additional conditions:
	


“(k)   to report to police and provide information to police about the conditions imposed on the extended supervision order or interim supervision order and the offender’s residential address, or

(l)   to comply with any obligation that could be imposed on the offender under Part 3 of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 if the offender were a registrable person within the meaning of that Act and were not the subject of an interim supervision order or an extended supervision order, or

(m)   to comply with specified requirements in connection with the offender’s access to and use of the internet, or

(n)   to provide any corrective services officer with requested information in relation to any employment or any financial affairs of the offender.”


	
	Section 12 provides that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of an extended supervision order is guilty of an offence. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 12 is 500 penalty units (being a maximum fine of $55,000 or imprisonment for five years or both).
	
	
	Proceedings under the Act are civil proceedings: s 21. An appeal lies to the Court, relevantly, from any determination of the Supreme Court to make an extended supervision order. An appeal may be on a question of law, a question of fact, or a question of mixed law and fact: s 22(2).
	


Legal principles


	
	The test to be satisfied for the imposition of any condition attaching to an extended supervision order has been considered by the Supreme Court on numerous occasions and has also been the subject of consideration in this Court in Attorney-General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 and Winters v Attorney-General for NSW [2008] NSWCA 33. In Tillman, the Court (Mason P, Santow and Tobias JJA) observed, at [5], that the stated objects of the Act “reveal that the legislation is protective rather than punitive in its intent”. Their Honours also observed, at [45]:
	


“… the statutory objects in this extraordinary legislation are directed at ‘ensuring’ the safety and protection of the community and ‘facilitating’ rehabilitation of serious sex offenders.”


	
	The Court further noted, at [10], that pursuant to s 11, the court was permitted to impose such conditions as it “considers appropriate”, including those specified in the section. The conditions considered appropriate may impose constraints as well as positive obligations. Their Honours noted that most of the conditions specified in s 11 appeared to be directed to the capacity for the person subject of the orders to be supervised, but could extend to ordering mandatory participation in, for example, rehabilitation programs.
	
	
	In Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 Johnson J, in dealing with the power of the court to impose conditions as the court “considers appropriate”, noted, at [68], that that phrase:
	


“… indicates the striking of a balance between relevant considerations so as to provide an outcome which is fit and proper … The Court’s power to impose particular conditions depends in turn upon the scope of the Act, s.11 in particular: Winters … at 19 (per Mason P).”


	
	The scope of the Act, as his Honour had earlier noted, at [14], includes the matters to which the court must have regard in determining whether to make an extended supervision order specified in s 9(3).
	
	
	Johnson J again dealt with the question of the imposition of conditions in State of New South Wales v Ali [2010] NSWSC 1045, where his Honour stated, at [88]:
	


“In approaching the question of conditions, I bear in mind what was said in State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [68], that the imposition of conditions which are considered appropriate involves the striking of a balance between relevant considerations, so as to provide an outcome which is fit and proper. I bear in mind, as well, that the imposition of conditions under this Act creates a statutory offence if conditions are breached. The consequence of the ordering of a condition emphasises the need for a proper basis to be demonstrated for the condition to be made in the first place.”


	
	This test was accepted as correct in State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 per Beech-Jones J at [96]. His Honour added, at [99], in respect of a serious sex offender:
	


“The imposition of ‘appropriate’ conditions under s 11 is governed by the overriding purpose of mitigating the identified risk of the high-risk sex offender committing either serious sex offences, or at least offences of a sexual nature.”


	
	In State of New South Wales v Burns [2014] NSWSC 1014 Beech-Jones J, at [59], again applied this test as correct, and added that:
	


“Usually it will be necessary for such a condition to be related to the mitigation of the unacceptable risk that led to the formation of the conclusion of the relevant offender as a high risk sex offender.”


	
	In Burns, those considerations had included not only the history of the sexual offences, but also a history of the offender’s alcohol problems and evidence of his intellectual deficits.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Green (Final) [2013] NSWSC 1003 R A Hulme J accepted, at [36]-[38], that any condition attaching to an extended supervision order in respect of a serious sex offender must specifically address issues relevant to currently identified risk factors in relation to future offending and be limited to addressing conduct regarding the risk of future serious sex offences and not criminal offending generally. His Honour further stated that the conditions imposed are not to be unjustifiably onerous or simply punitive.
	
	
	There are cases that deal with the imposition of a condition relating to the consumption of alcohol. As the appellant challenges the imposition of a condition constraining his use of alcohol and drugs, it will be appropriate to deal with those cases when that particular challenge is being dealt with.
	


Consideration

First ground of appeal: failure to apply the correct test in determining whether to impose the disputed conditions


	
	Section 11 provides that the court may impose such conditions as it considers appropriate. The discretion is broad, but must be exercised having regard to the scope and purpose of the Act and its objects.
	
	
	The purpose and statutory objects of the Act are referred to above at [25]. The scope of the Act, so far as it is relevant to the making of an extended supervision order, is to be found in those provisions which govern the making and determination of an order, namely, s 9(3) and s 11. The matters specified in those sections are not exhaustive of the matters to which the court is to have to have regard or to which any condition imposed by the court must relate. Rather, as s 9(3) provides, the court must have regard to matters specified in the subsection “in addition to any other matter it considers relevant”. Likewise, the conditions that may be imposed are not restricted to those that fall within the paragraphs of s 11.
	
	
	The statutory objects listed in s 3 are twofold: the safety and protection of the community and encouraging high risk offenders to undertake rehabilitation. However, it is apparent from the language of s 3 that the listed objects do not exhaustively delineate the scope and purposes of the Act. This is apparent, in particular, from the language of subs (2), which refers to encouraging rehabilitation as being “another object of this Act”. Thus, whilst s 3(2) specifies that an object of the Act is to encourage offenders to undertake rehabilitation, the scope and purpose of the Act is such that it would be permissible for the court, if it considered it appropriate, to impose a condition directed to facilitating rehabilitation, even if that did not require the offender personally to “undertake” rehabilitative steps as is envisioned in the statutory object in s 3(2). It may be appropriate in a particular case to impose conditions that may reduce risk factors relevant to the particular type of offending to which the order made under s 11 relates.
	
	
	In the present case, the primary judge accepted, at [11], that although the discretion conferred by s 11 was a broad one, it had to be exercised in conformity with the legislative purpose. At [12], his Honour referred, it would appear with approval, to the propositions stated in Green set out above.
	
	
	His Honour also quoted the statements of Beech-Jones J in Fisk at [96] and [99], referred to above. At [14], his Honour accepted the appellant’s submission that:
	


“… the Court must be satisfied as to the appropriateness of any given condition in the context of mitigating the defendant's demonstrated risk of committing future serious sex offences, as opposed to simply being punitive.”

The correct test


	
	The State submitted that this statement is wrong in law and does not reflect the statutory test in s 11. Strictly, this matter should have been raised by a notice of contention. Nonetheless, it was fairly raised in the State’s written submissions and it is necessary to deal with it.
	
	
	Care always needs to be taken with use of language which is different from the statutory text. Section 11 does not require that there must be a specific demonstrated link to the past offending which is the basis of the order made under the Act. Rather, the court must be satisfied, having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act, that it is appropriate to impose a particular condition so as to address the risk of future offending of the type which was the basis of the order.
	
	
	As the cases to which we have referred correctly state, it is not appropriate for the court under s 11 to impose conditions on a person directed to general future criminal conduct. But the condition does not have to have a ‘demonstrated’ link to the past offending in the sense submitted by the appellant. Conditions C(19) and E(30) provide a good example of conditions that may be appropriate notwithstanding that the past sex offences did not involve conduct of the type constrained by such conditions. Here, the appellant’s serious sex offences had no connection with any association with an Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. Nonetheless, for the reasons we explain below, at [69]-[70], there was no error in his Honour imposing conditions prohibiting the appellant’s association with such groups.
	


Did his Honour err in imposing the disputed conditions?


	
	It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether his Honour erred in the imposition of the disputed conditions to which this ground of appeal is directed, having regard to the correct principles or test that governs the exercise of discretion conferred by under s 11. In proceeding to do so, we reject the State’s submission that the appellant had not argued this issue below but had focused upon whether the disputed conditions were onerous. A reading of the transcript of oral argument dispels the State’s contention that this question was not argued in the court below.
	
	
	The appellant argued this ground of appeal on the basis that there had been a failure of judicial method, and that as a result of this failure, the primary judge had incorrectly applied the principles that governed the exercise of the discretion under s 11. It was suggested that the correct approach to the determination of whether a particular condition ought to be imposed required his Honour, in effect, to restate the test in respect of each condition or group of conditions as part of the process of determining whether the particular condition satisfied the test required by s 11.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the consequence of his Honour’s failure to do this was that he failed to determine whether, in respect of each of the disputed conditions, he was satisfied of the required link between the condition and the demonstrated risk of the appellant committing future serious sexual offences. Particular complaint was directed to the primary judge’s consideration of Conditions I(42)-(44) in respect of drugs and alcohol and Conditions C(19) and E(30) in respect of the prohibition on any association with an Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. The purport of the submission was that these conditions did not satisfy the test to be applied for the imposition of a condition or conditions pursuant to s 11.
	
	
	By way of illustration of the appropriate judicial method it was contended that his Honour should have applied, the appellant referred to various passages in Green and Fisk where the test under s 11 was considered in conjunction with the particular condition under consideration. To understand the submission, it is sufficient to refer to the argument advanced in respect of the approach of the Court in Fisk.
	
	
	Fisk had been convicted of many sexual offences against boys under the age of 16 years. Under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 73(1) there was a further offence whereby sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 16 and under the age of 17 years who was under a person’s “special care”. The appellant had not been convicted of such an offence. Beech-Jones J, in determining whether it was appropriate to impose conditions relating to contact with a child or young person 17 years or under, stated that before the appellant could be at risk of contravening that provision, he would have to be in a position of “special care” vis-à-vis a victim. His Honour noted, at [104], that although the conduct that led to his original convictions might have met the definition of “special care”, “his current circumstances and the other conditions to be imposed on him make it very unlikely he would ever satisfy that definition”.
	
	
	Nonetheless, there was psychiatric evidence that should Mr Fisk pursue relationships with males aged 17, but not in his “special care” so as to offend against s 73(1), he could potentially expose himself to males under the age of 16 and thus put himself in a position to re-offend. In that case Mr Sheehan, psychologist, had provided an affidavit in which he referred to Mr Fisk’s practice of approaching people whose age was ambiguous. Mr Sheehan expressed the opinion that such conduct maximised the risk of contact, either directly or incidentally, with males under the age of 16 years. His Honour concluded, therefore, at [110], that the legislation permitted and the case required that to avoid the risk of Mr Fisk committing offences against males under 16, a line be drawn preventing him associating with males under 18 years.
	
	
	The point the appellant sought to make by reference to this decision was that in Fisk the disputed condition was imposed in circumstances where his Honour had expressly examined whether the proposed condition addressed Mr Fisk’s risk of further sexual offending. By contrast, in the case of conditions I(42)-(43) in this case, being the restrictions on the use of illicit drugs and alcohol, whilst his Honour recognised that there was no evidence that the appellant’s prior offences were committed under the influence of those substances, he merely stated that a restriction on the use of those substances might properly be imposed “as a means of controlling possible risk factors to sexual re-offending behaviour”.
	
	
	There have been a number of cases where the imposition of conditions relating to alcohol have been in issue. In State of New South Wales v Stevenson [2013] NSWSC 1070, a case in which, although alcohol had not been a factor in the defendant’s sexual offending, he had a long-standing problem with the consumption of excessive alcohol, Price J, at [51], considered that it was appropriate to impose such conditions, as the defendant’s alcohol dependence “may lead to sexual disinhibition and further serious sex offending”. In his Honour’s view, the conditions promoted the primary object of the Act.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Boatswain [2014] NSWSC 1446, the defendant, as is the case with the appellant here, had no history of alcohol abuse. Nor was alcohol a factor in his sexual offending. Nonetheless, Davies J, at [71], accepted an expert opinion that:
	


“… it would be prudent that [the defendant] remain abstinent from alcohol use in the long term in order to better manage his Sexual Sadism and his risk of relapse of his other substance use disorders.”


	
	By way of contrast, a proposed condition relating to non-consumption of alcohol was refused by Wilson J in State of New South Wales v Hill [2014] NSWSC 1803. The defendant had been convicted of paedophilic and child pornography offences. The State’s reason for seeking the imposition of such a condition in that case was based upon the general contention that alcohol had a differential inhibiting effect and could thus heighten the risk to the community posed by the defendant. The defendant resisted the imposition of such a condition, as well as a condition that he should be prohibited from attending licensed venues, on the basis that there was no evidence that alcohol was a risk factor in his sexual offending.
	
	
	In rejecting the State’s application in respect of such a condition, Wilson J observed, at [47]:
	


“The risk identified by the State is generic and not specific, and is not indicated in the applicant's case on the evidence. Licensed premises, by the very nature of such venues, ought not to be attended by children, and thus the prospect of the applicant encountering children at such places must be limited. It is not desirable to isolate the respondent from places where he can socialise with adults. Accordingly, I declined to impose upon the respondent the condition sought by the State restricting the respondent’s access to alcohol and places where alcohol is consumed.”


	
	As these cases indicate, there are judicial statements which support the imposition of a condition relating to alcohol because of its disinhibiting effect. To the extent that Wilson J rejected such a condition in Hill because of the generic nature of the risk relied upon by the State, it must be remembered that each case turns on its own facts and is subject to the exercise of the discretion of the judicial officer in the particular case. Further, in Hill, there was the additional factor that the offending conduct was in relation to persons under the age of 16, who, as her Honour observed, were not likely to be found in hotels and other places where alcohol was likely to be served, the frequenting of such places being part of the restrictions sought by the State in that case.
	
	
	In the present case, the primary judge observed, at [143], that there was no evidence suggesting that the appellant’s sexual offences were committed under the influence of alcohol. That does not accord with the sentencing remarks of Nagle CJ at CL to which reference has already been made. However, subject to that matter, there is no other reference to alcohol in the documentation before the primary judge. Nor was there any suggestion of substance abuse. There was, as mentioned above, reference to the use of marijuana and jail offences relating to alcohol and drugs. However, that material did not rise higher than the appellant having consumed both alcohol and drugs.
	
	
	Nonetheless, his Honour, at [144], considered that such a condition could be imposed “as a means of controlling possible risk factors to sexual re-offending behaviour”. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, this observation indicates that his Honour did have regard to the appropriateness of the particular condition. In our opinion, it was within the scope of his discretion to do so. Further, the appropriateness of the condition was supported in general terms by the opinions of Professor Greenberg and Dr Samuels that the conditions (which included the condition related to non-consumption of alcohol) sought by the State were appropriate.
	
	
	The other conditions about which the appellant made specific submissions under this grant of appeal were Conditions C(19) and E(30) restricting the appellant’s association with any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang.
	
	
	The primary judge, at [137], stated that the condition addressed relevant risk factors associated with anti-social behaviours that limit the prospect for rehabilitation and re-integration into the community. In the documentation before his Honour, there was reference to the link between social connections and offending behaviour: see above at [20]. It follows, and indeed must be considered trite, that association with unlawful groups in the community would not be an inducement to a person’s rehabilitation or re-integration into society. Having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act, those considerations were relevant to a determination whether the condition was appropriate. There was no error in his Honour’s determination that the condition be imposed.
	


Second ground of appeal


	
	The appellant contended that, in determining whether to impose proposed Condition K(49), his Honour, at [147], erroneously posed as the threshold test whether the condition was unjustifiably onerous or punitive. The appellant did not deny that that was a relevant matter to which to have regard: see Green, discussed above. However, the appellant contended that that was not the threshold test posed by s 11 and therefore, according to the submission, his Honour had completely failed to determine whether this condition satisfied that test.
	
	
	This challenge to his Honour’s reasoning process can be dealt with briefly. His Honour, at [139]-[140], dealt with proposed Condition G(40), which prohibits the appellant from viewing material which is Refused Classification or is X18+. His Honour stated, at [140]:
	


“Having regard to the serious violent sexual offences that have been previously committed by [the appellant], I am satisfied this proposed condition directly addresses the future risk of violent sexual re-offending materialising from viewing classified material that has violent content, and accordingly, is not unjustifiably onerous or punitive.” (emphasis added)


	
	The bolded portion of this passage is a statement of the test that the appellant recognises as being the primary test to be applied under s 11.
	
	
	When dealing with proposed Condition K(49), which relates to supervision of the appellant’s computer devices, his Honour stated, at [147]:
	


“Having regard to the supervisory nature of the order and for the reasons I have stated in respect of proposed condition [G(40)], and having regard to [the appellant’s] prior breach of conditions in contacting a person over Facebook, I do not consider that the condition is unjustifiably onerous or punitive.” (emphasis added)


	
	The judgment of course must be read as a whole. His Honour expressly incorporated the test and reasoning he had stated in respect of Condition G(40), at [140], into his reasoning in respect of Condition K(49), at [147]. Accordingly, contrary to the appellant’s submission, his Honour considered and applied the correct test under s 11. His Honour’s reference to the condition not being “unjustifiably onerous or punitive” was an additional and relevant consideration.
	
	
	It should be noted that the appellant did not pursue any separate argument in respect of Condition G(40). However, as we have indicated, his Honour, at [140], explained why the condition was appropriate. There was no error in his Honour’s determination.
	


Conclusion


	
	It follows from what we have said that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

2765949,R v Do (No. 1) [2015] NSWSC 106,"Judgment


	
	The deceased was killed on 13 September 2012. The accused has been charged with her murder. The deceased was found lying on the floor of a living room of the house just to the left of the entrance hall with a large amount of largely diluted blood on or around her. Blood was found in the hallway leading up to the back door through the dining area and across the hall into a bathroom on the opposite side of the entrance hall.
	
	
	Footprints were found in the blood. Pawprints from a dog or dogs were found including paw prints within a footprint at marker AN. Blood spatters were found.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to lead evidence from Detective Sergeant Flippence in relation to two matters. The first concerns a footprint in blood at marker AG. The second concerns evidence about blood drying time.
	
	
	A number of footmarks at the scene were identified with footprint ridge detail referred to in the statement of leading Senior Constable Searles. However, three footmarks at markers AG, AH and AN were not able to be identified using footprint ridge detail. The Crown accepts that the footmarks at AH and AN contain insufficient detail from which any conclusion can be drawn. The Crown seeks to lead evidence from Sergeant Flippence of his expert opinion about the footmark at marker AG.
	
	
	The evidence the Crown wishes to lead is the opinion of Sergeant Flippence that the footmark at marker AG resembles the left foot impression of the accused in both layout and size. Sergeant Flippence reaches that conclusion by having obtained foot impressions of the deceased, Aminda Huynh and the accused. These three persons were known to have walked with bare feet at the scene of the killing.
	
	
	The Crown says the purpose of the evidence is to show an inconsistency between what the accused says his movements were around the crime scene and the objective evidence. Footprints, most of which will be proved by the evidence of Detective Searles, will tend to highlight the inconsistency in the accused’s statements. The Crown accepts that the accused was close to the deceased in the room but the question is whether he was close to the deceased in the manner in which he says he was or whether he was close to the deceased in a way that arises from his being responsible for her demise.
	
	
	The Crown also wishes to exclude for the purpose of the jury’s consideration that there was anyone else present apart from the deceased, the accused and Aminda. If the footprint at AG is similar to, or consistent with, the accused’s footprint most of the footprints will be explained, and any inference that any other person had been present will be less likely. There can be no doubt that the footprint shown in the photographs at AG is significant by reason of its position near the deceased’s body.
	
	
	The evidence from Aminda Huynh is that she arrived home at about 8.30pm. She walked through the house to the kitchen without turning on any lights until she reached the kitchen. She let her dogs into the house. She went upstairs on two occasions. Shortly after midnight she went downstairs to let one of the dogs out of the house and as she turned on the light near the stairwell she saw the body of the deceased, her mother, lying in a pool of blood in the living room area of the house. She approached the body and touched her.
	
	
	The accused’s evidence in an ERISP taken on 20 September 2012 was that he arrived home at about 7.15pm and found the deceased lying in a pool of blood in the lounge room area of the house. He claimed to have gone to her assistance and attempted “to do CPR” by administering two breaths to her. It seems clear that what he meant by that was that he tried to perform mouth to mouth resuscitation. He thought she was dead. He attempted to wipe some of the blood away and went to the bathroom to wash his hands and feet. He thereafter left the house.
	
	
	The defence opposes the evidence in relation to the footprints because it asserts that Sergeant Flippence does not have specialised knowledge in relation to footprint identification.
	
	
	There were two footprints at AG. Detective Searles had identified the right foot using friction ridge identification. The left foot at that marker was unidentified.
	
	
	Sergeant Flippence took impressions of the soles of the feet of the deceased, Aminda Huynh and the accused. He measured those impressions, the length overall, the length from the ball to the heel and the width of the foot. He also looked at the position of the toes of the foot. He prepared overlays of each of those three impressions for comparison with the photograph of the identified footprint at marker AG.
	
	
	When the overlay of the impression of the accused’s foot was put on the photograph of the unidentified footprint, whilst there were some slight differences, Sergeant Flippence concluded that the general shape of the foot was very similar.
	
	
	A comparison of the impressions of the deceased’s foot showed fairly clearly that they did not match. The deceased’s foot was two centimetres shorter than the unidentified footprint. Further, the deceased had sunken arches which meant that more of the skin of her foot on the instep side of her foot made contact with the floor.
	
	
	The impression from Aminda Huynh’s foot was similar in length although slightly shorter than the unidentified footprint. However, the main difference was that she had a sunken arch so that there was a line going almost straight down from the ball to the heel.
	
	
	The Crown does not seek to use the evidence as a formal identification of the accused’s left foot in the way that ridge detail can be formal identification. It wishes to use the evidence to show that the accused cannot be excluded from consideration.
	
	
	The defence concedes that there is a field of expertise in relation to footprints/marks/shapes and the field of forensic podiatry is a recognised area of specialised knowledge: R v Sica [2012] QSC 430; (2012) 232 A Crim R 486 and Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 64. The defence challenges Sergeant Flippence’s specialised knowledge in the area.
	
	
	At the time of his statement of 10 July 2013 Sergeant Flippence had performed duties in the Forensic Services Group of the police force for 18 years. In 1999 he completed a Diploma of Applied Science (Forensic Investigation). Subjects relating to Blood Pattern Interpretation were these:

	In 2004 he completed a 40 hour course in Blood Stain Pattern Interpretation presented by the National Institute of Forensic Science. He has been assigned numerous cases directly relating to Blood Stain Interpretation and has previously given evidence before this Court in relation to the examination, interpretation and analysis of blood stain and blood stain patterns at crime scenes. He has supervised and assessed students in relation to interpretation and evidence collection. He is the author of a paper entitled “Calculating the area of origin of spattered blood on curved surfaces” published in September 2011 in the International Association of Blood Spatter Pattern Analysts Journal.
	
	
	Some of the evidence to be given by Sergeant Flippence is factual evidence and some purports to be expert evidence. The factual evidence concerns the taking by him of foot impressions, measuring those impressions and measuring the footprint taken at the crime scene. The preparation of the overlays has enabled him to make comparisons between the footprint at the crime scene and the other foot impressions.
	
	
	However, his evidence of the comparison of those impressions is opinion evidence. So too is his evidence about the impression a person with sunken arches would make compared to a person with a more normal arch over their instep. This evidence must therefore satisfy the requirements of s 79(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	I am not satisfied that Sergeant Flippence has demonstrated an expertise in these matters as a result of his study and experience. Although he has studied Human Anatomy and Physiology, no details were given about his learning in relation to footprints and foot anatomy generally. In my opinion, it would be necessary for a podiatrist or a person with similar training and experience to give such evidence.
	
	
	Sergeant Flippence should be entitled to give factual evidence of the taking of the photograph of the footprint at the scene, the foot impressions from the feet of the deceased, the accused and Aminda, the preparation of the overlays, and the measurements he made of the foot impressions. These matters are factual matters. Comparisons made from the use of the overlays is likely to be something that the jury can perform for themselves: Honeysett v The Queen [2014] HCA 29; (2014) 88 ALJR 786 at [44]. Inferences can be drawn by the jury although they may need to be warned about the limits of the inferences that can be drawn. As noted, the Crown expressly eschews the notion that the evidence amounts to identification evidence.
	
	
	The making of such comparisons could not be said to based wholly or substantially on specialised knowledge of podiatry in any event. It would appear to be based on general knowledge and common sense. That is why it is open to the jury to use the overlays themselves. Sergeant Flippence should not be allowed to give that evidence.
	
	
	An opinion on the impression a person with sunken arches would make on a surface whether in blood or otherwise would be substantially based on specialised knowledge, but Sergeant Flippence does not have that specialised knowledge. Sergeant Flippence should not be permitted to give evidence about sunken arches explaining the impressions obtained from the feet of the deceased and Aminda. Evidence should be permitted generally to show that Aminda and the deceased had sunken arches or flat feet.
	
	
	The result is that I make the following rulings concerning Sergeant Flippence’s statements:
	



	
	Statement dated 10 July 2013, paragraph 25 – in the second sentence, omit the reference to “AG”; omit the material in the first two bullet points; paragraph 42 d – in the third last sentence commencing “The footmarks at marker AG…” it should be made clear that it is not being asserted that the unidentified footmark is that of the deceased. It is accepted that the right foot at that marker is identified by Detective Searles.
	
	
	Statement dated 17 February 2015, paragraph 7 – omit the material in the last bullet point; paragraph 8 – omit the material in the last bullet point; paragraph 9 – omit the material in the last bullet point.
	



	
	The second matter about which the Crown seeks to lead evidence from Sergeant Flippence concerns the drying time of blood. In summary, Sergeant Flippence’s evidence is that spattered blood dries between five and fifteen minutes depending on the surface. His evidence will also be that pooled blood takes longer to dry and if it is diluted with water or some other liquid it may take longer to dry.
	
	
	The purpose of the evidence sought to be led by the Crown relates to the time of death of the deceased. The Crown accepts that it will not be in a position to lead any evidence of the time of death. However, the evidence provides certain indicators. The accused suggests that he arrived home somewhere between about 7.15pm and 8.00pm and the deceased was then dead. Aminda says that she arrived home at about 8:30pm and let the dogs into the house. As noted earlier paw prints were found indicating that a paw had been placed in wet blood. That could have occurred when the dogs were first let into the house. Paw prints were found going towards the back door.
	
	
	The Crown says that the jury need to understand that there are many uncertainties concerning the blood found at the crime scene and that that is why they cannot be presented with evidence that establishes a time of death. The jury need to understand that the blood may have remained wet for some time after the death because it had been diluted with the water that was found at the scene.
	
	
	The defence says that it is because of all of the variables that the evidence has such little probative value and that when that is set against the unfair prejudice as s 137 of the Evidence Act requires the evidence should be excluded.
	
	
	I am entirely satisfied that Sergeant Flippence has the specialised knowledge to give evidence about the drying time of blood. His training and experience well qualifies him in that regard. The defence accepts at least that he has expertise in blood stain pattern interpretation. The summary that I provided earlier of his training and experience satisfies me that he has the specialised knowledge to give his opinion about blood drying times.
	
	
	It seems to me that the evidence has some probative value because in a circumstantial case such as the present the jury is likely to see the time of death as a significant matter. In that regard they need to be given maximum information to understand why it is difficult to pinpoint a time of death. It is for that reason that the variables concerning the time pooled and diluted blood take to dry is of some significance. It acquires greater significance because of the paw prints that indicate that blood was not dry when the dogs were in the house, probably not before 8.30pm.
	
	
	It is difficult to see what unfair prejudice arises from the admission of this evidence for s 137 to have any work to do. It is suggested that the jury might wrongly apply a timeframe of five to fifteen minutes. If the whole of the evidence is given regarding blood drying times and the variables involved at the crime scene it does not seem to me that the jury are likely to misuse the information. If they were only permitted limited information about the drying times of blood spatter that may be the case. If all of the evidence is given concerning the variables the jury are far less likely to misuse the evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, the whole of the evidence contained in the Statement of Sergeant Flippence of 13 February 2015 is admissible.

		19 March 2015",2015-02-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765951,NADINE MUSABWASONI v R [2015] NSWDC 243,"Judgment


	
	Nadine Musabwasoni (the appellant) appeals against the convictions entered and the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order made by Ms Kennedy LCM on 24 September 2014 at the Burwood Local Court.
	
	
	On that day the appellant pleaded not guilty to two counts of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm pursuant to section 59(1) Crimes Act 1900 (sequences 1 and 2) and one count of Stalk/Intimidate with the intent to cause fear pursuant to section 13(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. On each charge the appellant was convicted and ordered to enter into a bond for a period of 12 months pursuant to section 9 Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Further, the appellant required the prosecution to show cause why an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order should be made in favour of the complainant. At the completion of the hearing, the magistrate made the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order for a period of 12 months on the standard conditions 1(a)-(c).
	
	
	The complainant, Robert Sebie, was the appellant’s husband. The history of their relationship was tumultuous. They had separated on or about 14 February 2014, but remained living in the matrimonial home. On 30 April 2014, the appellant had commenced proceedings in the Family Court of Australia seeking parenting and financial orders.
	
	
	On the appeal, Mr Segal of Counsel appeared for the appellant and Ms Holloway, solicitor, appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions; the respondent in the proceedings.
	
	
	The prosecution case on sequences 1 and 2 was that on 21 April 2014, at about 9.00pm, the appellant struck the complainant, her husband in the left eye with a coffee mug in a punching type motion, and then shortly thereafter struck him on the lateral aspect of the left upper arm with a skateboard. As to sequence 3 it was the prosecution case that on 5 May 2014 at about 7:30am in the kitchen that the appellant held a knife pointing upwards and said to the complainant, words to the effect, “one day Robert I can kill you”. At about 7.00pm on 5 May 2014 the complainant attended Burwood Police Station and gave a statement in relation to the matters that became the subject of the charges. At about 9:50pm on 5 May 2014 police spoke to the appellant and placed her under arrest. She was conveyed to Burwood Police Station and exercised her right to silence.
	
	
	In evidence the appellant denied assaulting the complainant on 21 April 2014. She gave evidence that the complainant had told her that he had suffered injury when he was cutting tree branches that were overhanging the pool at the rear of the house. The appellant further denied saying the words alleged to have been said by her in relation to sequence 3 on 5 May 2014.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22];
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24].
	



	
	Section 13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides:
	


A person who stalks or intimidates another person with the intention of causing the other person to fear physical or mental harm is guilty of an offence.

...

For the purposes of this section, a person intends to cause fear or physical or mental harm if he or she knows that the conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person.

For for the purposes of this section, the prosecution is not required to prove that the person alleged to have been stalked or intimidated actually feared physical or mental harm.

…


	
	Section 16 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides:
	


A court may, on application, make an apprehended domestic violence order if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a person who has or has had a domestic relationship with another person has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears:

the commission by the other person of a personal violence offence against the person, or

the engagement of the other person in conduct in which the other person:

intimidates the person or a person with whom the person has a domestic relationship, or

stalks the person,

being conduct that, in the opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order.

Despite subsection (1), it is not necessary for the court to be satisfied that the person for whose protection the order would be made in fact fears that such an offence will be committed, or that such conduct will be engaged in, if:

(a)   the person is a child, or

(b)   the person is, in the opinion of the court, suffering from an appreciably below average general intelligence function, or

(c)   in the opinion of the court:

(i)   the person has been subjected at any time to conduct by the defendant amounting to a personal violence offence, and

(ii)   there is a reasonable likelihood that the defendant may commit a personal violence offence against the person, and

(iii)   the making of the order is necessary in the circumstances to protect the person from further violence.

For the purposes of this section, conduct may amount to intimidation of a person even though:

(a)   it does not involve actual or threatened violence to the person, or

(b)   it consists only of actual or threatened damage to property belonging to, in the possession of or used by the person.


	
	I pause to note that I need only be satisfied of the matters provided for in section 16, to make an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, to the civil standard of proof; that is on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Section 17 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides:
	


In deciding whether or not to make an apprehended domestic violence order, the court must consider the safety and protection of the protected person and any child directly or indirectly affected by the conduct of the defendant alleged in the application for the order.

Without limiting subsection (1), in deciding whether or not to make an apprehended domestic violence order, the court is to consider:

in the case of an order that would prohibit or restrict access to the defendant’s residence-the effects and consequences on the safety and protection of the protected person and any children living or ordinarily living at the residence if an order prohibiting or restricting access to the residence is not made, and

any hardship that may be caused by making or not making the order, particularly to the protected person and any children, and

the accommodation needs of all relevant parties, in particular the protected person and any children, and

any other relevant matter.

When making an apprehended domestic violence order, the court is to ensure that the order imposes only those prohibitions and restrictions on the defendant that, in the opinion of the court, are necessary for the safety and protection of the protected person, and any child directly or indirectly affected by the conduct of the defendant alleged in the application for the order, and the protected person’s property.

If an application is made for an apprehended domestic violence order that prohibits or restricts access by the defendant to any premises or place and the court hearing proceedings in respect of the application decides to make an order without the prohibition or restriction sought, the court is to give reasons for that decision.


	
	Section 84 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 relevantly provides as follows:
	


An appeal may be made to the District Court:

by a defendant against the making of an apprehended violence order by the Local Court

…

An appeal under subsection (2):

may be made under Part 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 in the same way as an application may be made under that Part by a defendant against conviction arising from court attendance notice dealt with under Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986…

The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 applies to an application or appeal arising under this section with such modifications as are made by or in accordance with the regulations under that Act.


	
	Tendered before me was the Crown bundle (Exhibit A), which comprised of the statement of Constable McCue dated 18 May 2014, the statement of Constable Dreon dated 16 May 2014, three photographs of the complainant taken by him on or about on 24 April 2014 (Exhibit 4 below), four photographs of the complainant taken by police on 5 May 2014 (Exhibit 2 below), the Initiating Application filed in the Family Court of Australia and the transcript of the hearing before the magistrate on 24 September 2014.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	The magistrate noted that the appellant agreed she was at home with the complainant on both 21 April 2014 and 5 May 2014 and that the issue in each matter was whether or not the events that were the subject of the charges occurred at all.
	
	
	The magistrate recited the complainant’s evidence and of particular relevance noted his evidence to the effect that his brother Richard was present in the house at the time when the assaults of 21 April 2014 were alleged to have occurred. The magistrate made no finding about the significance of the failure of the prosecution to call Richard Sebie.
	
	
	The magistrate recorded that the complainant had given evidence that he felt threatened when the appellant held the kitchen knife with the blade pointing up and said the words, “one day Robert I can kill you”.
	
	
	The magistrate then recited the appellant’s evidence, including that she noticed the complainant’s eye was swollen when he arrived home on 21 April 2014 and that she asked him about it. The complainant told her that he had fallen when cutting a tree. The appellant gave evidence that she had separated from the complainant but continued living under the same roof from about 14 February 2014 onwards; being the date when she had returned her rings to the complainant.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that this was a one witness versus one witness dispute and that the prosecution had to prove the matter to the very high standard of beyond reasonable doubt. The magistrate commented that it was appropriate for her to exercise caution in accepting the word of one person, without further corroboration, particularly where the appellant had given evidence and denied that the relevant events had occurred.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the appellant had raised character and that she had taken it into account. It was agreed between the parties that on the appeal, I should not have reference to character, and therefore I do not need to comment further on this aspect.
	
	
	The magistrate accepted the complainant’s evidence as to the assaults of 21 April 2014 as she believed that it was corroborated by the photographs taken by him of his injuries on about 24 April 2014. She accepted his explanation for the delay in complaint, by reference to the history of their relationship and his “habit of photographing incidents and taking no action” (T64 line 5). She accepted that the threat made to him on the morning of 5 May 2014 was a precipitating factor in making his complaint to the police. She accepted that he felt fear on that occasion and that had prompted him to go to the police.
	
	
	The magistrate found that there were some inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, in the following respects:
	



	
	that she gave evidence that she was initially concerned about the injury to the complainant’s eye and then later gave evidence of not being concerned about his eye;
	
	
	that at one time she gave evidence that these proceedings had forced her out of her home and that she later gave evidence that she was looking forward to moving out and finding her own accommodation.
	



	
	Ms Holloway fairly and appropriately conceded in submissions that the inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence referred to by the magistrate at T 64, were illusory.
	
	
	First, the appellant’s initial concern about the complainant’s eye injury was in the context of her return from Melbourne on 21 April 2014, when she enquired of how he had received the injury (T50 line 37). Her later evidence about not being concerned about him having minor injuries in general, was in the context that on her evidence that he regularly had minor injuries sustained in the course of his work as an air-conditioning installer (T51 lines 20-27). For my part and with the benefit of the Crown’s submissions I do not consider this to be an inconsistency in the appellant’s evidence.
	
	
	Second, the appellant gave evidence of being distressed as a result of being forced to leave her home as a result of these proceedings (T40 line 40). The appellant later gave evidence to the effect that as at about 5 May 2014 she was relieved that the Family Court proceedings being commenced and she was “looking forward” to finding a rental property and moving out on her own (T53 line 15). In my view those two pieces of evidence clearly related to two different points in time and accordingly are not inconsistent.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that in relation to sequence 3 the basis of her finding of guilt was that the appellant had the knife in her hand because she was cutting sandwiches, and it was not the case that she had picked up the knife for the purpose of making the threat (T64 lines 27-30).
	
	
	The magistrate made no express credit findings to which I must have regard. The magistrate made no express findings about the demeanour of any of the witnesses.
	


Consideration

Failure to call Richard Sebie


	
	In general, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to call all available material witnesses, unless there are good reasons not to do so. The tribunal of fact should not speculate about the evidence that might have been given by the witnesses who were not called.
	
	
	In Mahmood v Western Australia (2008) 232 CLR 397 at [27] the plurality of the High Court said:
	


“… Where a witness, who might have been expected to be called to give evidence on the matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.”


	
	See also Louzios v R (2009) 194 A Crim R 223 at [57].
	
	
	The complainant’s evidence was that his brother Richard had been living with him and the appellant from the beginning of 2014, “on and off” (T3 lines 27-29), and that he was present at the house on the night of 21 April 2014. On the complainant’s evidence, his brother heard the argument taking place at the time when the appellant struck him with the coffee mug and that as a result of the commotion Richard came into the kitchen, at which time, the complainant said to Richard, “she hit me with a coffee mug” (T6 lines 16-17). The complainant continued in his evidence to say that he and Richard were walking away from the kitchen towards the hall, at which time they passed through the lounge room. The complainant gave evidence that it was at this time that the appellant picked up a skateboard from the children’s toy area and struck him with it across the back of the left upper arm (T8 lines 6-10).
	
	
	Under cross-examination the complainant gave evidence that his brother Richard was present, that he had not provided a statement to the police but that it had volunteered to do so (T11 line 20-25). As the complainant understood it he had not been asked by the police for a statement. The complainant gave evidence that his brother “was even available to come today [the day of the hearing] if he was required, but no one” had requested him to do so (T11 line 26). The complainant gave evidence that Richard had not seen any injury to his face, prior to the alleged assault as a result of the gardening incident (T20 lines 18-19). The complainant also gave evidence that his brother had stayed with him for a while after the alleged assaults on 21 April 2014 before the complainant had gone to bed (T16 lines 34-35).
	
	
	In the present case there was no explanation as to why Richard Sebie was not called as a witness or even why the police had failed to take a statement from him.
	
	
	On the complainant’s evidence Richard was an available and willing witness to the events that occurred on 21 April 2014 and he had ample opportunity to observe the matters in dispute. Richard Sebie, it appears to me, could have given important evidence about the interaction between the complainant and the appellant on 21 April 2014. In fact, the complainant’s evidence emphasised Richard’s proximity to and involvement in the relevant events. In my view he was a crucial witness, if the prosecution was to prove the assaults of 21 April 2014 occurred to the standard required, that is beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In the absence of any evidence from Richard Sebie and any explanation as to why he was not called, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the assaults of 21 April 2014 took place.
	


Consistency of the injuries alleged


	
	In relation to sequence 1, the complainant gave evidence that he was struck in the left eye with a ceramic coffee mug, in a punching type motion (T4 lines 14-19). The complainant gave evidence that he did not initially have any injury, but that it started to bruise “after a day or two” (T6 line 10). In cross-examination the complainant gave evidence that he didn’t even notice that he had a black eye until two days after the incident. He said that his eye felt puffed up but did not start turning black until a day or two afterwards (T13 lines 30-35). He later added that his eye was “slightly red” immediately following the injury (T18 line 9). He gave evidence that he took the photographs which were exhibit 4 below, after he noticed how bad the swelling got, and how bad his eye was (T18 line 27-30).
	
	
	As to sequence 1, the photographs taken by the complainant of himself that became Exhibit 4 in the Local Court, depicted bruising to the left eyelid and immediately under the eye extending downwards in a crescent shape that was approximately 10-15mm below the centre point of the eye at its lowest point. In my careful examination of photographs I do not accept that they depicted swelling of any part of the eye region. There appeared to be no injury to the eyebrow area. The photographs that became Exhibit 2 below, did not depict any injury to the eye in my view, probably because the injury depicted in the other photographs had resolved.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury to the left eye was inflicted by the use of an oversized coffee mug. In my view, such an object was likely to cause injury to the eyebrow area at least in addition to any other injury. I do not accept that the use of the object alleged would have caused the localised bruising that is depicted in the photographs. Further, I do not accept the complainant’s evidence about the initial appearance of his eye after the assault because it appeared to me to be contradictory and self-serving.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 2, the complainant gave evidence that he was hit in the lateral aspect of the upper left arm with a skateboard. The complainant described the skateboard as a “full-size skateboard” (T8 line 24) with a rough sandpaper like surface (T8 line 34). The complainant stated in his evidence in chief that he was struck with “one of the corners of the skateboard” (T8 line 28).
	
	
	The photograph in Exhibit 4 below depicted an injury to the left arm consistent with a deep graze that was circular in shape and slightly larger than a 50 cent piece. The arm injury depicted in the photographs, including the photographs taken by police that became Exhibit 2 in the Local Court did not include bruising.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that he was wearing a short sleeved T-shirt at time of the assault (T12 lines 1-2). He described a T-shirt as having a longer than normal sleeve, in that the sleeve came down to his elbow (T12 lines 19-20). The complainant agreed in cross-examination, that the T-shirt was covering the part of his left arm that was struck by the skateboard (T12 line 33). The complainant gave evidence that the arm injury included bruising (T17 line 37).
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury to the left arm was caused by the skateboard because I do not accept that the graze type injury could have been caused through the material of the T-shirt that the complainant said he was wearing. Further, I do not accept that the injury could have been caused in the manner described without there being significant and visible bruising to the area of impact.
	
	
	Ms Holloway fairly and appropriately conceded in the appeal, that the injuries to the complainant could have been equally caused by either the assaults alleged or the gardening incident. Ms Holloway further conceded accordingly that the injuries could not be considered as independent corroboration of the complainant’s version of events.
	
	
	For these reasons, which are in addition to the reasons I have given relating to the failure to call Richard Sebie, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution have established the elements of the offence required to record a conviction in relation to both sequence 1 and sequence 2.
	


Delay in complaint


	
	There can be many reasons for a complainant to delay their complaint to the police and the fact of a delay in complaint:
	



	
	does not automatically detract from the veracity of the complaint, and
	
	
	will not automatically be adverse to the complainant’s credit.
	



	
	On the other hand, the tribunal of fact may consider that the failure of a complainant to make a complaint at the earliest available opportunity can be taken into account in whether to believe the complainant at all or to impugn his or her credit: Kilby v R (1973) 186 CLR 427.
	
	
	Further, the tribunal of fact is entitled to consider whether or not the accused has been prejudiced in presenting his or her defence by the delay in the complaint coming to his or her attention: Lemura v R [1998] NSWCCA 699.
	
	
	In my view the appellant was prejudiced in the presentation of her defence referrable to the delay in the complainant’s complaint in two respects, being:
	



	
	the prosecution did not put into evidence the T-shirt that the complainant was wearing on the night in question. Had it been available, it could have been examined for blood and/or coffee stains that could have been corroborative of the complainant’s account;
	
	
	the police would have had the opportunity to make independent observations of the injuries closer to the time when they were allegedly inflicted and that may have included the opportunity to have the injuries looked at by a medical practitioner.
	



	
	The complainant and the appellant were going through a relationship breakdown. I do not accept the complainant’s evidence that he did not want the appellant to get into trouble and that is why he did not complain about the assaults alleged to have occurred on 21 April 2014. On this issue, I prefer the evidence of the appellant that the breakdown of the relationship had reached a point that the complainant and the appellant were discussing arrangements for her to move out of the matrimonial home. This evidence was corroborated by the fact that the appellant had instructed solicitors to commence the Family Court proceedings and that those solicitors had progressed the matter to the stage of filing the Initiating Application in the Family Court. In my view, this upset the complainant sufficiently to make false allegations of what occurred on 21 April 2014 and 5 May 2014.
	
	
	It follows that in accepting the appellant’s evidence on this point, and finding that the complaints were false that I cannot be satisfied of the veracity of the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt or at all, and I must acquit the appellant on all three counts: Liberato v R (1985) 159 CLR 507.
	


Intent required for sequence 3


	
	The intent required for the proof of sequence 3 is set out in section 13(3) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	
	
	Mr Segal submitted that taking into account the complainant’s evidence of the history of the relationship and in particular his experience of being told similar words on numerous occasions that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that those words would be likely to cause fear in the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that similar words had been said to him by the appellant on about 15-20 times in the past several years (T9 Lines 15-25). Later in cross-examination he gave evidence that she had “said it a number of ten times before” (T19 lines 13-15).
	
	
	I agree with the magistrate on this issue that the fact that she had the knife in her hand was incidental to the words spoken, because she was in the process of making sandwiches, and that the holding of the knife could not of itself add to the threat. Further, I cannot reconcile what type of knife the appellant was holding. It was described in the evidence as both a “cutting knife” and a “butter knife” and I am left with a reasonable doubt as to which one it was. In my view, the type of knife was relevant to the purported threat. As I am left in some doubt as to the type of knife the benefit of that doubt must go to the appellant.
	
	
	If I accept the complainant’s evidence on this point, which would be to accept the prosecution case at its highest, the only reasonable inference to draw was that a comment to this effect was within the ordinary discourse between the complainant and the appellant. In those circumstances, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew, either actually or recklessly, that the words would cause the complainant fear of physical or mental harm.
	
	
	As a result, the prosecution has failed to establish an essential element of sequence 3 and I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness I should add that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s evidence that the words were in fact spoken and I therefore must acquit the appellant of sequence 3.
	
	
	My findings on the inconsistency of his evidence as to the injuries that he alleged he suffered, are sufficient for me to reject his evidence as a whole. I have carefully considered the appellant’s evidence and I prefer it to the evidence of the complainant whenever it is in conflict. In so doing I am mindful that I did not see or hear the witnesses give their evidence, but it was conceded by Ms Holloway that the magistrate made no credit or demeanour findings to which I must have regard. In my view, the appellant’s version that the injuries to the complainant were sustained in the gardening incident is more likely and I accept it. It follows that in my view the complainant gave a false account in his evidence.
	
	
	The result is that I am not satisfied even on the civil standard that any of the conduct alleged that was the subject of the charges occurred at all.
	
	
	The magistrate presumably made the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order on the basis that she had convicted the appellant of personal violence offences as defined by the legislation. As I have set aside the convictions I must consider the requirements of the section afresh.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the complainant had reasonable grounds to fear that the appellant would commit a personal violence offence or otherwise that she would engage in conduct that intimidated him or amounted to stalking.
	
	
	In conclusion, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved the elements the three charges and I make the following orders on the appeal against conviction:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction allowed;
	
	
	Set aside the orders of the magistrate of 24 September 2014;
	
	
	Dismiss the Court Attendance Notice.
	



	
	In relation to the appeal against the imposition of the Apprehended Violence Order I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the matters set out in section 16(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 have been established and I make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against the imposition of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order is allowed;
	
	
	Set aside the order made by the magistrate on 24 September 2014.

2765953,R v Burns; R v Usher [2015] NSWDC 174,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Burns do you mind standing up for a moment. I tell people in advance what sentence I am going to impose then you can sit down of course. I have got a lot of reasons to give but I like people to know in advance what they are going to get.
	
	
	I know you are only interested and Mr Usher is only interested in the bottom line. I appreciate that and the complexities of s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are not of particular interest to you.
	
	
	In relation to count 1, when I say count it is not a count in your case it is the aggravated break and enter with intent. You know the charge on 10 October 2013?
	
	
	ACCUSED BURNS: Yep.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You know that one. In relation to that offence I am proposing to sentence you to three years imprisonment back dated to 28 December 2014. In other words giving you credit for the time you have spent in custody up until the present time. Now I know you have served other sentences, but I have actually back dated 61 days I think. I have given you the benefit of a day. In relation to that sentence at the moment I do not need to fix a non-parole period.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 that is the most serious offence the aggravated break and enter with intent. I am going to sentence you to four and a half years imprisonment and I am going to accumulate that on the first sentence by six months. So that leaves a total sentence of five years and I am going to fix in relation to that sentence a non-parole period. I have to fix a non-parole period under the provisions of the Act where there is a standard non-parole period. In any event I am going to fix a non-period of two years, six months. So effectively you are going to serve five years with a three year non parole period in relation to all the offences backdated giving you due credit for the time in custody, backdated to last December. Remembering you were on bail for a period of time, you know that and then you went back into custody and served sentences from 9 September. You understand that?
	
	
	In relation to the deal with proceeds of crime I am going to sentence you to two years and six months entirely concurrent with a non-parole period for count 2. So you can sit down. That sentence Mr Burns represents a 25% discount on the otherwise appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Mr Usher. In your case you get a discount of 10%. As you know your late plea, but the commencement date of your date sentence is a bit earlier than Mr Burns. Your sentences will effectively date from 18 April 2014. Now the starting point for count 1 which is the aggravated break and enter is a bit higher than Mr Burns because you have got the matter on the Form 1 that I have got to take into account. With the discount of 10% I am going to sentence you to five years, ten months in relation to that matter dating from 18 April 2014.
	
	
	In relation to the charge concerning use of proceeds of crime for the purchase of the car, you receive two years six months imprisonment. That sentence dated from the 18 April 2014, entirely concurrent with that non-parole period.
	
	
	Now in relation to your non parole period, the total non-parole period is going to be 60% same as Mr Burns. 60% of the total sentence, including the six month non-parole period that you served for the drive whilst disqualified. I have got to factor that into the sentence. So your effective non parole period is in relation to the aggravated break and entering and stealing matter three years three months and that will date from 18 April 2014. That will mean you will be eligible for release to parole on 17 July 2017. So you become eligible for parole on my calculation a couple of weeks after Mr Burns. The reason that you are so close together in that regard is that you have spent more time in custody than him, but he has got a bigger discount than you and I have also balanced off all the other competing matters.
	
	
	You can sit down. So effectively you are going to be sentenced to five years ten months with an effective non-parole period in relation to that sentence of three years three months, but with your other non-parole period the effective non-parole period is three years nine months. That partial accumulation is a special circumstance and I will give my reasons and make the relevant orders. I will require you to stand up when I make the orders but naturally you can just sit there. Do you want a glass of water, it is going to take some time. Do you want a cup of water?
	
	
	ACCUSED USHER: Yes please.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Can we give both men a cup of water please. I know I am going to need one. Now I just want to clarify one thing about Mr Burns, it is not a major thing. His name Aarin is that the correct spelling?
	
	
	STEWART: Yes that is right.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Normally it is spelt slightly different.
	
	
	Aarin Burns and Richard Usher each appear today for sentence in respect of a number of matters which are common to them both and in respect of which they in various ways are liable as participants in joint criminal enterprises concerning each charge.
	
	
	The particulars of the charges they each face and the manner in which they are prosecuted and the circumstances in which they appear in this Court however are somewhat different. To start with Mr Burns. He pleaded guilty at the Local Court to three charges and was committed for sentence to this Court.
	
	
	These charges in order in which I will pronounce the sentences and in chronological order are firstly, an aggravated break and enter with intent to steal contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act (1900), which according to the Crown’s cover sheet and which I accept carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. It has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	He also pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated breaking entering and stealing contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act (1900), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	The third matter for which he was committed for sentence is a charge of knowingly deal with proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and has no standard non parole period. As he pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity he is entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence in relation to each charge and in accordance with the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, to recognise the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Mr Usher as I understand it was committed for trial, presumably by paper committal. On the occasion that his trial was listed to proceed, at least in the sittings in which the trial was listed to proceed, he pleaded guilty to two charges either identical to or very similar to two of the charges pleaded guilty to by Mr Burns at the Local Court.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty on arraignment on a charge of aggravated breaking entering and stealing committed no 13 October 2013. In effect an identical charge as charged against Mr Burns, although with somewhat more specific particulars. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of engaging in a transaction with proceeds of crime to wit $13,890 being part of the proceeds of the breaking entering and stealing matter.
	
	
	That charge is brought against him under the same section as the charge of dealing with proceeds of crime against Mr Burns, but has somewhat different particulars. The particulars in relation to Mr Burns would allege that he dealt with the full proceeds, over $90,000, of the aggravated breaking entering and stealing offence.
	
	
	The breaking entering and stealing offence was committed on 13 October 2013 and in the case of both prisoners the dealing with proceeds of crime is pleaded to have occurred on the same date. The aggravated break and enter with intent to steal occurred three days earlier on 10 October 2013.
	
	
	In respect of that matter Mr Usher requests that it be taken into account on a Form 1 when sentencing for the principal offence, that is the breaking entering and stealing in company matter, which I will shortly after I refer to as aggravated break and entering and stealing.
	
	
	The offence on 10 October, that is the matter on Mr Usher’s Form 1 and the matter to which Mr Burns pleaded guilty at the Local Court obviously on the facts has direct relationship to the offending in the principal offence.
	
	
	Having regard to what I was told by the Crown and by the counsel for Mr Usher and Mr Burns, notwithstanding the fact that Mr Usher obviously did not plead guilty to all the charges for which he was committed for trial, and allowing for the fact that close to the trial he received some fresh material from the Crown that, as I understand it, persuaded him to plead guilty, in the context of the principles and the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton earlier referred to, I am prepared to grant him a discount of 10% upon the otherwise appropriate sentences for the matters where terms of imprisonment are to be imposed.
	
	
	Although the prisoner may have changed his motivation for pleading guilty with this fresh material and although the pleadings and particulars were somewhat different to the co-accused Mr Burns, at the time that Mr Burns appeared at Local Court, ultimately the matters to which Mr Usher pleaded guilty to and which he admits his guilt for are matters for which he was committed for trial. Thus the utilitarian value of the pleas is largely to be assessed by regard to the timing of them rather than other factors that may arise or in other circumstances may be relevant. To my mind changes of particulars between the committal for trial and the arraignment of the accused are of little significance. In fact they are of so little significance nobody bothered to bring any such matter to my attention. It is a matter that I had to address independently.
	
	
	In any event, if there had been some issue in relation to particulars this is what judges are here for not juries. It could have been dealt with by a disputed facts hearing. One of the peculiarities of the particulars as I earlier mentioned is that the dealing with proceeds of crime charge in the case of Mr Burns involve dealing with the $90,815 in cash that was the proceeds of the aggravated breaking entering and stealing matter. The particulars as I said in relation to Mr Usher involve a much lesser sum. None of the money has been recovered, although of course $13,890 of it is accounted for with the purchase of the motor vehicle by Mr Usher that is the essence of count 2 in this indictment.
	
	
	In relation to the two prisoners the facts I have been presented are in somewhat different form and have considerably different detail. In fact it was a little unclear in the facts relating to Mr Burns where he was at the time of the commission of the aggravated break and enter with intent matter. These differences however appear to me, based upon the submissions of the parties, to be matters of no controversy. It was conceded by counsel for Mr Burns that although the facts were a little ambiguous about the matter it is the case in relation to the first offence in time, the aggravated break and enter with intent matter, that he, as he did for the break enter and steal matter, drove the motor vehicle that carried the two other offenders who committed that crime including Mr Usher. Ultimately the differences in the facts reflect nothing of significance concerning the objective liability of each accused in relation to the offending.
	
	
	The background of this matter was that Mr Burns had been employed as a duty manager at the Woolworths store at Mittagong before 13 October 2013. That store had a cash office as it was described with two safes which held the daily takings of the store. To get into the cash office the key was required to get into what was called the key lock box where the key to the cash office was held. The store normally closed between midnight and 1am and was partially re-opened to enable bakery staff to commence work at 2.40am.
	
	
	These aspects of the operation of the store were obviously known to Mr Burns. Only particular people including managers had keys to external doors and were given the relevant security codes, safe combinations and the like. Mr Burns had access to the key lock box. He also had a security code for the alarm system and the facts state that he knew the combination for a safe in the cash office. He also, as I said, knew the routine of the store.
	
	
	For reasons at the end of the day really best known for himself, the prisoner had not been at work for a number of weeks before 10 October 2013. His employer’s belief was that he had abandoned his employment. Woolworths had requested him to return his keys. The facts said but he had retained them up until 13 October. He had his duty manager’s keys, he knew the security code and safe combinations and none of these had been changed. This on reflection was a considerable mistake by his former employers.
	
	
	The facts in relation to Mr Usher indicate that he lived a few doors down from where the prisoner lived at Glenfield in the south western part of Sydney. He and Mr Usher and Mr Burns discussed the facts states in the days before 10 October breaking into the Woolworths store and stealing money and possibly other items.
	
	
	On 10 October Mr Burns provide Mr Usher with the keys to the store for Mittagong and details of the codes and combinations, location of relevant offices and the location of the keys to open up the cash office. The store closed at 1am and shortly after 2am the prisoner, Mr Burns, Mr Usher and another man who has never been identified arrived at Mittagong and Mr Usher and the other man entered the store.
	
	
	Mr Burns apparently remained in the car. Mr Usher was wearing a balaclava and dark clothing to avoid identification from security cameras. The alarm was activated for some reason and the two intruders left the store without anything. This is the essence of the aggravated break and enter with intent charge.
	
	
	The three men returned in the early hours of 13 October. Foolishly the alarms and their codes had not been changed. Again Mr Usher and the unknown co-offender entered the store with Mr Burns waiting in the car outside. Mr Usher again was wearing a balaclava and was carrying a bag this time. He and his co-accused managed ultimately to get into the cash office aided by the keys and the information provided by Mr Burns. They loaded up as I understand the facts two bags with notes and coins from one of the locked safes.
	
	
	It would turn out that foolishly Mr Usher left Mr Burns’ keys with his name on them in the key lock box along with other keys. As a result of this action one might have thought it was not very difficult for investigators to work out who had some connection with the breaking into the store and access to the cash office.
	
	
	In the facts relating to Mr Usher it states that the money taken from the burglary was distributed between the three offenders. Mr Burns said in an interview initially when arrested he knew nothing about the offences. Although he did tell police apparently on the brief summary I have that some months before he had agreed with another person to stage at the store some sort of fake robbery in order for money to be taken, but backed out of the arrangement before it occurred.
	
	
	He was unable to explain matters to the police such as how his keys were left at the scene, the use of his code to get into the premises, the finding of clothes that were identical to that worn by the offenders at his home. After an extension of the investigation period he became, what is described in the facts as, ‘compliant’ and told the account of how the burglary happened.
	
	
	The prisoner however claimed he received approximately $6,000 in cash from the two offenders as his cut of the proceedings and he said he was unaware of the full amount they obtained. For reasons which are self-evident I find that very difficult to accept. He was in possession of a small amount of cannabis and amphetamine when he was arrested.
	
	
	Mr Usher on the day of the break and enter and steal, that is later in the day went off to a car yard in Cabramatta and purchased a motor vehicle for $13,890, using cash from the Woolworths store. He was arrested on 18 October in Ulladulla after a search warrant had been executed in his home two days before and items associated with the burglary were located. He did not admit to being involved in any of the offences.
	
	
	As I said earlier neither man has provided details in relation to the identity of the third person, but the Court could not readily conclude that that person kept $70,000 which is not accounted for at the moment. It would be ridiculous to reach that conclusion. The best that can be said is that the Court cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt precisely what each offender received, but the Court is entitled to be circumspect in accepting Mr Burns account and that Mr Usher’s proceeds from the robbery was the cash he used to buy the car.
	
	
	Ultimately, although the matters are pleaded somewhat differently, to my mind the two prisoners are equally liable in respect of all three offences subject of course to the presence or otherwise of relevant aggravating factors arising under s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (1999) or otherwise and relevant mitigating matters.
	
	
	I heard little to suggest otherwise in the submissions of the parties. Although the prisoner Burns has pleaded guilty to dealing with the entire proceeds of the break enter and steal matter, the facts do not establish that he was the only person who was the beneficiary of that sum and the second count in the indictment relating to Mr Usher conclusively shows that it is so.
	
	
	The dealing with the proceeds of crime was intimately bound up in the criminality involved in the primary offence and he, Mr Usher, and the man who has not been made accountable for his crime are equally responsible for the theft of the money as part of a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	In this regard as I subsequently will indicate I propose to approach the matter in the way in which it was urged by me by Mr Burns in so far as the treatment of the offences committed on 13 October. Noting of course the decision his counsel referred me to of R v Stewart [2005] NSWCCA 290.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the particulars I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Burns benefitted in relation to the sum of money received any greater than any of the other offenders. In fact his dealing with the proceeds of crime particularised was truly a transitory matter save for whatever he received himself.
	
	
	Mr Burns was born in December 1978 and Mr Usher was born in November 1981. So there is little to distinguish between them in terms of either their youth or age maturity. Mr Burns has a relatively minor criminal history with some findings of guilt at Moss Vale Children’s Court and Campbelltown Local Court in the late 1990s and a mid-range PCA and a possess prohibited drug matter in 2000.
	
	
	Prior to committing the offences with which I am concerned he had never been gaoled, he had never been previously subject to what was then Probation and Parole Service supervision, now Community Corrections supervision by way of probation or parole. Since being charged, however, in relation to the current matters he was in custody from the date of his arrest, that is 14 October 2013 until his release on bail on 11 December 2013. This is calculated to be a period of 58 days. There has been three days since that time to make a total of 61 days in custody solely referrable to this matter and I will take that into account.
	
	
	It would seem very clearly, however, that for Mr Burns his life had gone considerably sour since he committed this offence and particularly whilst on bail in relation to these matters. I have noted from going through his criminal history that he was charged with having goods in custody suspected of being stolen on 29 May 2014 and apparently was sentenced on 8 September 2014 to three months imprisonment for some reason commencing on 9 September 2014 concluding in December 2014.
	
	
	Subsequent to May 2014 he was charged with possessing house breaking implements, although it is a little unclear when he was charged. When he appeared at court on 9 September 2014 in relation to that matter he was sentenced to four months imprisonment to run concurrently with the other sentence of three months. That sentence concluded on 8 January 2015.
	
	
	Whilst apparently in custody in relation to those matters it appears he was charged with bringing or introducing a small quantity of a drug into a detention centre. He was apparently on 25 November sentenced to three months imprisonment for that offence commencing either on that date, or 25 November, but expiring on 24 February 2015. That means since coming back into custody after being released on bail in relation to current matters he has been primarily serving terms of imprisonment for offences committed whilst on bail in relation to the current matters. How that could have been permitted to occur, that is how the prisoner could not have been returned to custody for some of those matters having been already charged and on bail in relation to current matters is a mystery. But this is a mystery not of the prisoner’s making as best I can work out.
	
	
	Also, he was charged on 26 August 2014 with driving under the influence of alcohol or other drug and possessing some sort of prohibited drug. I assume methylamphetamine, but I am not quite sure, for which he failed to appear at court on 14 October 2014. The reason he did not appear obviously was because he was in custody in relation to other matters. What happened in the dealing of that matter I have not been informed.
	
	
	These convictions subsequent to the commission of the current offences with which I am concerned seem to me to reflect in part the deterioration of his drug use and attitude since his involvement in the commission of these offences.
	
	
	The Community Services reports, there are two because one had an error about his previous supervision, reflected upon the fact that the prisoner’s had difficulties with prohibited drugs in recent years. Although there have been fluctuations in his use of cannabis and amphetamines. There was some increase in his use of drugs since his involvement in the current offending reported in the first report.
	
	
	He had a break down in a long standing relationship in 2013 which caused him considerable stress before he got involved in this current offending. He had been in a partnership with the mother of his two children for eight years. This is said to have contributed to his “stressors” along with his financial difficulties. He said he had health issues which caused him to leave the employment with Woolworths leading to the offending. He had some back pain due to an old work injury, claimed a history of a heart murmur for which there is no medical evidence available but which he suffered as a child. It could be consistent with the sequelae of rheumatic fever but I do not know. He was also cooperative with the preparation of the report, but it noted that when difficulties in his personal life arise he resorted to drug use which impacted upon his relationship with his family.
	
	
	He was assessed as requiring supervision to address his drug use and abuse and to assist him with psychological issues. As I said the first report mistakenly reported that he had previous supervision which is clearly not true. The subsequent report correcting this reflects upon the fact that in custody at the South Coast Correctional Centre he has been in employment. That he would wish to return to Wollongong rather than Campbelltown on his release from custody. The second report reflected upon a history of black outs and enquiries were made of Justice Health about this matter. The prisoner said the offences were committed to fund his drug and alcohol additions.
	
	
	A Justice Health report dated 18 February 2015 noted a history of black outs in 2012, including a fall and feeling some pins and needles, but neurological testing at that time revealed no abnormality, the examinations occurring in that year, that is 2012.
	
	
	The prisoner when interviewed in custody in January 2015 claimed black outs occurring “12 months ago with the last occurrence three to four months ago.” That is as I would understand it since he committed the current offences. He gave a history of three or four black outs for a period of a few minutes. He complained of headache and numbness to the top of his head and mild to moderate clubbing of fingers. The rest of the neurological examination was essentially normal. No diagnosis was capable but he was recommended to be sent off for further examination.
	
	
	I have a psychiatric report in relation to Mr Burns from Dr Furst. That sets out some history. Although the doctor said further psychometric testing was required to determine whether the prisoner had an intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning. The prisoner had no major mental illness or history of such illness at the time of the offending or beforehand, although he had received some anti-anxiety medication.
	
	
	He has other medical issues which I do not propose to state in public out of respect for his privacy. He also gave a history of experiencing black outs in custody. He said in the history he gave to the psychiatrist that he was ill with black outs before he left Woolworths. He said he was put on sick leave and then he was “put off work”. This is not the history in the facts because, as I said, his employer has informed the police that they believed he had abandoned his employment.
	
	
	The prisoner said to Dr Furst that his involvement in the offence was “quite crazy” and “quite stupid” and at the time he did not care about the consequences because he was under stress from being sick and separated from his wife. He stated that his motivation in obtaining money was to fund his drug use. Although obviously objectively it was to receive far more money than his immediate drug needs would reasonably require.
	
	
	He described himself as an “idiot” who would rather be home with his wife and kids as he described it. In clinical examination, although there was no psychometric testing the doctor believed that his manner was consistent with “low intellectual functioning”. There was no evidence of severe depression or psychosis, although he was low in mood as one would expect interviewing someone in custody.
	
	
	The psychiatrist thought he met the criteria for substance use disorder and that there was a likely borderline intellectual function given his history of learning difficulties, early departure from school and also attending a special school at Glenfield. There was no evidence however of enduring mental disorder relevant to the offending. The doctor said that it was a combination of substance abuse and family break up along with inability to work and low level intellectual functioning that may have attributed to his offending.
	
	
	He also noted his history of medical problems. He thought the prisoner’s black outs may well be associated with cardiac arrhythmia. However there has been no cardiologist or relevant specialist opinion about this matter. There were no indications that the prisoner was unaware of his actions or the wrongfulness of his actions at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The assessment by the doctor just based upon a clinical examination is not entirely consistent with his employment history, particularly his appointment as an acting manager at Woolworths. This assessment appears to be based upon very limited information indeed. In any event his counsel did not submit that there was any issue that gave rise to a consideration of principles that are summarised by his Honour, McClellan CJ at CL, in the decision of DPP (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, particularly at [177].
	
	
	I accept that some aspects of his medical condition might make his circumstances of custody somewhat more difficult than the normal prison population, but not substantially nor was it urged that they would. The psychiatrist felt that he needed to undertake relapse prevention programs for drug and alcohol use. He did not need anti-depressant medication. He needed psychological assistance as said the community corrections officer. He had poor coping skills with emotional problems. His educational and rehabilitation should also be encouraged.
	
	
	The doctor pointed out that the prisoner was working constructively before going into custody and could on release. The major issue to be addressed however was preventing relapse into further drug use and this would be self-evident. Also monitoring his peers I would expect.
	
	
	The psychiatrist thought he had reasonable prospects of being successfully rehabilitated giving his willingness to involve himself in counselling and rehabilitation programs. I will say something more about psychiatrists seeking to express opinions about matters not based upon their medical assessment. He only had partial insight into his drug use and its effect and certainly there was a need for assistance for future direction in that regard on his release. I have taken all those matters into account and I have ultimately concluded that there ought to be a finding of special circumstances in part based upon the doctors analysis.
	
	
	Mr Usher has a more significant criminal history than Mr Burns, having appeared primarily at the Local Court in relation to a large number of offences between 1998 and 2014. Most of his offences relate to the use or abuse of motor vehicles, but he also has convictions for larceny, breaching apprehended domestic violence orders, taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, possessing implements to enter, goods in custody, driving with prescribed concentration of alcohol, various street offences, obtaining money by deception and larceny as a bailee.
	
	
	He has committed various offences regularly over the last 15 years, but the offences for which he has most been convicted relate to driving whilst disqualified. I went through his record last night very carefully, I lost track to be truthful, but I counted at least nine separate times that he has been convicted of driving whilst disqualified. There are some matters in his record showing convictions recorded because he did not appear at court.
	
	
	I have tried to reconcile them with subsequent convictions. He has previously been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. The first time for driving whilst disqualified. That was converted to a suspended term of imprisonment on appeal to the District Court. But he breached that bond, causing him to go back and serve the sentence of imprisonment that he was originally given.
	
	
	He has also received terms of imprisonment for driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving a motor vehicle without consent in 2004. The last sentenced offence in that series of offences involving a sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of eight months. He also received another sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of eight months for driving whilst disqualified at that time.
	
	
	In 2006 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months with a non-parole period of nine months for driving whilst disqualified and driving with mid-range PCA. In 2013 he was convicted and sentenced after his arrest in relation to the current matters to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months expiring on 17 April 2014 for driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	There are other terms of imprisonment imposed for other offences going back to at least 2003. He has received good behaviour bonds, community service orders and suspended sentences of imprisonment. Although he has been in custody since 18 October 2013, obviously the criminal history as has been conceded just a few minutes ago reflects the fact that part of that time he has been serving a term of imprisonment for unrelated offending.
	
	
	Therefore the sentence I will impose must commence at the expiry of the non-parole period for the conviction recorded in late 2013. That is a non-parole period which expired on 17 April 2014. I note in his criminal history for some reason there is noted a revocation of parole for which he was ordered to serve home detention rather than return to prison custody.
	
	
	The criminal history said that this was recorded at the “Parole Board Court” on 6 November 2002. Never heard of such a ‘court’. But I accept that it reflects some matter dealt with by the then Parole Board.
	
	
	Mr Williams who appeared for Mr Usher, noted that a request had been made for a pre-sentence report when the matter was last before the District Court here in Goulburn in November last year. There is no record on the Court file of any order for such a report and no report has been prepared. Mr Williams also noted that no psychological or psychiatric report had been prepared. I was not told why that was so, if it was needed Mr Williams certainly said he was not counsel on the last occasion.
	
	
	I raised with Mr Williams what he wished to do about it. He advised me that his client was anxious for the matter to be dealt with as soon as possible. The issue of seeking an adjournment to have relevant reports prepared was clearly raised with Mr Williams in a manner for him and the accused to consider. But it was the position of the accused in the letter he wrote to me, and that of his counsel on instructions that the matter should proceed without the reports. If an application to adjourn the matter had been made to obtain reports obviously that would have been granted, even if it led to a delay in sentencing. But that would not have affected the sentencing of Mr Burns.
	
	
	Mr Usher prepared a type written three page document being a statement as it was described setting out details of his background. In fairness to him he said in that document he was dyslexic and he sought assistance in the writing of it. But I accept it is a genuine expression of matters pertinent to him.
	
	
	I do not wish to embarrass him at all but these matters have to be stated in public. He stated that his mother was a heroin addict who left him and his father when he was two years of age. He was his father’s only son. He never saw her again until he was 17 and apparently sadly she died in 2006 when he was 23. He had a very good relationship with his father who has passed away. He described his childhood as “quite good”, however he only completed Year 7 at school. He had little interest in school and amongst other things if he was dyslexic that would have affected his ability to enjoy or perform well at school.
	
	
	He said in his statement that whilst in custody he was trying to improve himself by improving his literacy, his writing ability and his arithmetic ability. He has been in partnership with his current partner for ten years and he has two children aged eight and six. He described the relationship as strong, but said she had given him an ultimatum about his drug use. She might also give him an ultimatum about his use of cars and committing crimes. His drug use to my mind is only part of the problem she has.
	
	
	He did say that he had a history of schizophrenia since he was 18 or 19 and that he had been taking medication in custody regularly, although he did not do so when he was at large. He had seen a psychiatrist in the past but not for over two years. He said that he had been committed to some sort of hospital care for his mental health problems at some stage.
	
	
	He said in relation to this matter that he understood that there had been recent Legal Aid Commission approval for a report to be prepared, but he did not want his case adjourned as I earlier said.
	
	
	So far as employment was concerned he said that since leaving school at the age of 15 he worked for six months cleaning cars, been unemployed for a while and at about the age of 20 took up the trade of being a ‘powder coater’. That is, powder coating metal. He said when at large he generally was in employment and he would look for that employment on his release. I would understand that that is a skill that would have some demand.
	
	
	He wanted to live drug free, given his mother’s history, during this life, but when his father died in 2009 he said he took that pretty hard. He said that when he got out from custody and previous occasions he started using drugs again. He hoped when he was gaol before to avoid using drugs, but he would always return to them. He said that he committed the offences with which he was now concerned to support his addiction. As I say, that may be in part one of his reasons, but the fact that he bought a car shows that he had other interests as well.
	
	
	I find it interesting that he went off to buy a car in circumstances where, without seeing his Roads and Maritime Service traffic record (as opposed to his criminal history), he would have been disqualified from driving a motor vehicle for many years into the future. One of the problems the prisoner will have to face, and bite the bullet on I must say, is that for employment purposes he is at a disadvantage not having a motor vehicle driver’s licence. But the facts are that in the near future, at least, I would strongly suspect, given that disqualifications for driving whilst disqualified are cumulative upon existing disqualifications, he has no right to be driving motor vehicles at all.
	
	
	Of course, what he wrote in the statement is untested. Although the Crown very graciously did not object to the statement and in my view, if I be so bold to say so, took a very sensible approach to the whole sentencing proceedings as he always does. In many respects the material in the statement was uncontroversial. But, of course, in the absence of any independent medical evidence with no request from the prisoner to obtain it which is as I understand it a deliberated decision on his part, there is no evidence either in the objective facts or even in his own statement of a relationship directly between any mental disorder and the offending, save for the fact that he may well have had some form of substance abuse disorder at the time of the offending.
	
	
	Mr Burns’ counsel prepared very detailed written submissions and I will refer to them in some detail in a moment when I consider the relevant issues in his case. He covered the field for both his client and Mr Usher in many respects. In oral submissions I raised specifically with him matters relating to the breach of trust, the significance of the criminal history or not and also issues of parity and disparity with his co-accused.
	
	
	Of course parity principles loom large in this matter notwithstanding the different particulars in the charges, the different way in which the charges have come to court and of course the different criminal histories of the men. The fact that Mr Usher has a matter on a Form 1 to my mind as I earlier said is not a matter of great significance, given the fact, in accordance with the guideline judgment of 2002 which reference I do not immediately have in front of me, I am afraid, it was held that in fixing a sentence for the principal offence taking into account a matter on a Form 1, considering such a matter on a Form 1 may require giving greater weight if needs be to specific deterrence and other factors that would otherwise require an increase of the otherwise appropriate sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	Mr Burns’ counsel did not indicate that there was any significant difference between his client and the co-accused, although he took exception to the categorisation of the prisoners conduct as a breach of trust. As I understand the oral submission put to me, based upon the facts that the Crown presented, because the prisoner had abandoned his employment and because he was no longer in the employee of Woolworths there was no issue of trust that arose. In my view with respect this submission was somewhat misconceived. I accept as an objective fact that at the time of the commission of the offence the prisoner was no longer an employee of Woolworths. But the facts are the trust put in him by Woolworths occurred at the time that they handed him the keys and the security codes. Whilst he was an employee Woolworths provided him with the opportunity to gain information about the layout of the premises and other relevant matters for the use of Woolworths, not for his personal advantage. Certainly not to take advantage of any of that information or any of those items to steal from his employer or his former employer at any time.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are that for a period of time before 10 October he held onto the keys, notwithstanding the fact his employers wanted the keys back. I appreciate the fact he could not expel from his mind his knowledge of the layout, his knowledge of security codes, the work habits of employees. But that information was not to be disseminated to people who wanted to commit crimes with him against his former employer.
	
	
	I accept the general proposition that there are levels of breach of trust. I accept of course that a solicitor who steals from his clients commits a more heinous or egregious breach of trust than an employee stealing from an employer in most instances. But there still is the substantial breach of trust involved here as the prisoner was entrusted with confidential information that he could not use to his advantage at any time.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Usher relied upon exhibit 1, referred to the background of employment, the interests of the prisoner’s wife and children, his ongoing drug difficulties. He accepted that there was not any evidence upon which the Court could rely to establish any relevance of any mental illness to the commission of the offence, particular as it might relate to the weight to be given to general deterrence, the specific matter to which Mr Williams referred. But he also submitted it was clear that his client had a difficulty with drugs and addiction and the prisoner was on notice from his partner of his need to address this matter. It was also submitted the document I saw reflected insight on his part and the wish of the prisoner to better himself, which I accept.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions in relation to Mr Burns were that the prisoner did breach the trust given to him by his employer at the time of his employment, and that trust continued up until the time of the commission of the offence, whatever the status of his employment at that time, a submission I accept. He had material and information entrusted to him by his employer that allowed the offence to occur in the circumstances in which it did. The Crown did not submit that the offence involved planning as an aggravated factor, but noted the prisoner did have knowledge from his employment of matters that went into the plan. The prisoner, Mr Burns, was entitled to a 25% discount. The learned Crown said that he did not part company from the submissions made about the prisoner’s criminal history by his counsel. He also said that the prospects of rehabilitation were somewhat limited and there should be some partial accumulation in respect of the offences of the 13th and the offence of the 10th with which I agree.
	
	
	In relation to the matter of Usher the Crown submitted that the discount should be 10%, I have already dealt with that matter. With regard to matters of planning and the like they were common to the co-accused, although in the case of Mr Usher there was no breach of trust. He said in relation to the proceeds of crime in relation to both prisoners that he would “not vigorously contest” the argument that there should not be any partial accumulation in relation to those offences. He said, however, in relation to Mr Usher that he had a persistent criminal history and although it did not involve offences of this seriousness he had limited prospects of rehabilitation given that past history.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Burns prepared, as I said earlier, very helpful written submissions. They are exhibit 2. They concern Mr Burns of course, but they have some relevance to the situation of Mr Usher. I need not quote them extensively. Correctly, counsel for Mr Burns identified the fact that the starting point of the calculation of any appropriate sentences is to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. Of course that task is not simply confined to a consideration of the presence or otherwise of aggravating factors under s 21(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a matter extensively addressed by Mr Stewart very effectively in his written submissions. But it must also be remembered that s 21A(1) of the Act retains the need for the Court to consider the relevant factors that arise in sentencing whether identified from the facts and circumstances of the case or identified from what could be called ‘common law’ principles, or general principles, of sentencing as they have developed over the years not otherwise provided for in the section.
	
	
	For example, the issue of parity of sentencing is not a matter expressly referred to in s 21A as far as I can recall but is obviously a very relevant matter to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise, as I have earlier noted. Mr Stewart in his written submissions correctly identified the relevance of Ponfield, the guideline judgment of Grove J particularly, a most erudite and learned judge of the Supreme Court, in relation to breaking, entering and stealing matters in 1999. He also cited the observations of Howie J, another learned judge, in R v Marshall [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [37], where his Honour by reference to the Pt 4 Div 1A of the Act said that “Ponfield criteria identified by Grove J were relevant matters to take into account in assessing whether an offence fell within the mid-range of seriousness”.
	
	
	100    It is to be noted that Marshall is a pre-Muldrock decision. That is, a decision handed down before the decision of the High Court in Muldrock in 2011, and was a decision given after the 2004 decision of Way, which until 2011 set out the principles to be applied in consideration of standard non parole periods substantially overruled by the decision of the High Court in Muldrock. There are of course some other historical matters to be pointed out, I am not sure whether Howie J discussed them or consider them in Marshall. One of the matters is that the guideline judgment of Ponfield set out a number of relevant criteria to be taken into account in fixing an appropriate sentence for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing, but declining to fix a numerical guideline because of the complexity or the character of the offending. The relevance of those criteria, however, was that they were handed down before the current s 21A came into law.
	
	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of 1999 in fact did not come into effect in 1999, it came into effect in 2001. The original s 21A which I had to apply for about 18 months or two years is in substantially different terms than the s 21A that is primarily at force today. The current s 21A, far more complex than the earlier section, has many matters in it that were specifically adverted to by Grove J in his erudite and prescient judgment. In other words, the legislation enacted already existing principles to some extent relevant to the sentencing of offenders.
	
	
	That having been said, in relation to Mr Burns and Mr Usher there are a number of features of the matter that arise from Ponfield and/or the more refined and detailed s 21A(2) that are absent. Neither offender was on conditional liberty, although there was some planning it was not professional planning, neither offender had a prior record of similar offences, there was no vulnerable victim, no vandalism or damage to the property, no stealing of property of sentimental value, no person was present, there was no trauma, no force, no threat, no use or possession or weapons. All this is correct and I take that into account. It might on one view be thought that the completed offence on 13 October was a repeat incursion because the prisoners admit their guilt in relation to the prior attempt to break into the premises to steal. But having pointed that out I am satisfied that if the first attempt had been successful then the offence would have been completed and they would not have returned. I would regard the concept of repeated incursions to be concerned with people who commit the same crime on the same victims over and over again, either because it is easy to do, the victims are too terrified to complain to the police or too vulnerable to complain to the authorities, or the object of the offences are a rich source of property that can be plundered over and over again.
	
	
	It is conceded at one point of the submissions that the sum of money taken was significant, however at another point of the submissions, that is at the bottom of p 4, the sum stolen is said to be “quite modest”. There is no doubt that it is a significant sum of money, and it is no doubt in terms of aggravating factors under s 21A(2) that in relation to both offenders there was substantial loss to Woolworths. The fact that Woolworths is a multi-billion dollar corporation, very profitable, largest supermarket chain in the country, is of no moment in the consideration of that matter. All citizens and all corporate personalities are entitled to the same protection of the law. Thus, that is a relevant aggravating factor in relation to both offenders.
	
	
	I must say stealing the sum of $90,000 in the course of a breaking and entering and stealing from commercial premises is to be seen as a very substantial sum indeed. From my experience as 14 years as a judge it is quite uncommon in the courts to be so much stolen by way of cash in the one offence. Of course I have seen many break, enter and steal matters of domestic premises, or even commercial premises, where property has been stolen, not just cash, of great value. But of course one can sweep up a pearl necklace or a diamond ring of very great value indeed with one movement of the hand.
	
	
	I note in the Local Court, as I understand it, the value of property that gives that court jurisdiction is property under the value of $15,000 if an election is relevantly taken. These types of offences, the one that I am dealing with now, rarely find their way to the District Court unless the offender has committed it in circumstances of aggravation or the offence is connected to some other serious indictable offence such as armed robbery or attempted murder or some other crime.
	
	
	I am aware of the fact that s 112 at (2) and (3) pleads various aggravating factors that give those matters jurisdiction to be dealt with in the District Court. However, I also note the observations made by learned counsel for the prisoner Burns that these offences plead aggravating factors, some of which are readily recognised, as being lesser aggravating factors than others. This was discussed in the decision of R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [48]. It seems to me with respect to the legislators that a number of offences come to the District Court where the property stolen is relatively minor, but only come here because of a particular aggravation which to my mind given the significant sentencing of discretions more properly could be dealt with in the Local Court. Of course this is not such a case.
	
	
	I accept the submission concerning the significance of being in company by contrast to other circumstances of aggravation being a lesser circumstance of aggravation here. I also note what was said in Harris about stealing being regarded generally as one of the lesser indictable offences contemplated by s 112, a matter not often reflected upon or understood. This was discussed by Simpson J in the decision of Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [27]. There was other observations in Harris at [29] concerning the significance of the crime of stealing in the context of sentencing for an offence of breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence, as cited in the written submissions on behalf of Mr Burns which I acknowledge and take into account.
	
	
	It should be also pointed out, however, that this was a true burglary of commercial premises where each of the prisoners would have had an expectation, given Mr Burns’ knowledge of the business, that there would be a considerable amount of money taken. It is not a case of two young tearaways jumping into a store at Glenfield and discovering to their delight when they break open a small safe that the owner of the store has left his lifesavings in there. I have no evidence of what average takings are of the Woolworths store at Mittagong on a daily basis, and whether on the particular day that the offence was committed it might reasonably have been expected that there would be more money or less money than on other days. I bear in mind of course there was a failed attempt to commit the same crime three days before. But there was an expectation at all times by both men that they would retrieve a considerable amount of money, proven by the fact that they got away with over $90,000. This shows to some extent, as is said, ‘the proof in the pudding’ of reasonable expectation of a very substantial sum of money being stolen.
	
	
	The remaining aggravating factor that applies only to Mr Burns of course relates to his breach of trust which I have already discussed. As I said earlier, the breach of trust did not depend upon his status as an employee or not as at 10 and 13 October 2013. The breach of trust arose from the trust given to him at the time of his employment, and it was his responsibility to return the keys and not use the information against his former employer. Even if he had been pre-emptively dismissed without good cause, which is of course not the case here, he would have no basis for acting the way he did.
	
	
	Of course all of these observations above concerning the objective facts also largely apply to the related earlier offence of aggravated break and enter with intent. In that case there was no loss and that offence was a preparatory step in relation to the current offence.
	
	
	With regard to the dealing with the proceeds of crime offence, as is in the case of Mr Usher, these offences in my view are subsumed into the objective gravity of the breaking, entering and stealing matter in the sense that the dealing with the proceeds, and the use of the proceeds by Mr Usher particularly, are merely a corollary of the principal offence. The whole purpose of stealing the money from Woolworths was to spend it one way or the other. That obviously, at least, happened in part. Particularly in relation to Mr Usher. Of course some break, enter and steal offences involve no dealing with property. But that is usually because the prisoner has no time to do anything with it, or the offender throws it away thinking it is valueless or irrelevant to his needs. These men broke into the property to steal money for their own needs and thus it seems to me that all the sentences for the proceeds of crime offences should be fully concurrent with the principal offence and will not require for reasons that are self-evident the fixing of a non-parole period, there being no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Usher, as I earlier said, I will need to take into account the aggravated break and enter with intent matter that is on the form one in the manner discussed by Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment, and I am particularly mindful of what was said in that judgment between [18] - [43]. Of course the Court of Criminal Appeal on that occasion said that the focus is on the principal offence and there is no need to particularise the extent to which any increase upon the principal offence sentence is calculated by taking into account a matter or matters on a Form 1. In other words, a ‘Markarian approach’, as it might be described, using instinctive synthesis. As it transpires I can indicate that such sentences as will be imposed on Mr Usher and upon Mr Burns, subject to relevant discounts, will take into account matters of totality, as reflected by the High Court in Mill v R, and of course the decision of Pearce v R [1998] 194 CLR 610 at [45]. In the case of Mr Burns the accumulation as I foreshadowed will be to the extent of six months.
	
	
	With regard to the subjective cases, apart from the matters I have already identified in relation to Mr Burns, I conclude that a mitigating matter is that the offending of both men is not part of organised criminal activity. I have already indicated I do not find as an aggravating factor in either case that it was planned criminal activity. But I cannot find that as a mitigating factor either on balance. To my mind the issue is evenly balanced, particularly given the fact that the crime is committed by particular information being provided to Mr Burns to the co offenders and the timing of the offence was identified based upon information available for Mr Burns’ employment.
	
	
	I am fully aware of the many pronouncements about what planning means, both as a matter of aggravation and a matter of mitigation under the Act. Howie J in relation to drug supply matters on a number of occasions pointed out that whilst drug supply matters may appear well planned, the planning was intimately connected to or tied up with the character of the offending. Such planning as was involved here, while intimately connected to the character of the specific offending, is not necessarily intimately tied up with the general character of this offending.
	
	
	To my mind ultimately the planning in this matter is a neutral matter so far as it relates to mitigating circumstances. I accept, however, that he does not have a significant record of criminal convictions, his plea of guilty is a mitigating factor for which he receives a discrete discount. I cannot conclude on balance he is unlikely to re-offend, particularly given his behaviour since he committed this offence and his involvement in this offence. I accept that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation having regard to the matters adverted by Dr Furst. Although I wish that psychiatrists do not fall for the trap upon commenting upon matters about which they do not have adequate information and are not based upon any medical skill that they have, but are solely based upon matters of history which are entirely dependent upon the history given by the patient, usually of a non-medical character, and do not have regard to the absence of independent evidence or the reliability of the history or its accuracy.
	
	
	I do not accept that the accused is remorseful as contemplated in s 21A(3) of the Act. He did plead guilty, he said he was sorry to Dr Furst. He has given no evidence in relation to this matter, however, that could be challenged by the Crown. He has provided absolutely no assistance for the recovery of the money and has provided no information that would lead to the identification of the co-offender. These matters could be taken into account, not only as cooperation, but as evidence of his contrition. The same observations may be made of Mr Usher. Of course I appreciate neither man has an obligation to give evidence or cooperate. These are matters that are not held against either prisoner. But they are relevant matters that can be taken into account in assessing whether a person is truly contrite or remorseful. Time and time again people turn up having said nothing for 14 or 15 months and say to the judge, sometimes in evidence with a straight face, that they are sorry. One might accept it, one might not. The expression of contrition has to be seen in full context. But the facts of the matter are that the timing of an expression of contrition is an important matter to take into account.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Usher, he has a lengthy criminal history which could be described as significant, having previously been gaoled and subject to various forms of supervision. Although I accept that he has no prior convictions for offences of this type, and I take that into account in his favour, I cannot find his criminal history offers a mitigating factor in this case. His criminal history in fact does not entitle him to any special leniency, although it is not an aggravating factor. Certainly, he could not be described as a professional burglar given his criminal history. It was to my mind his incompetence in leaving behind the prisoner Burn’s keys that quickly led to the apprehension of them both. I could not conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend. In some respects although I accept he is unlikely to reoffend in this respect. Although he has been disqualified from driving many, many times before, the first thing he did when he got access to the money was to buy himself a car. He is not entitled to sit behind the wheel of a car for many years to come. This action reflects something of his attitude.
	
	
	If he continues to drive cars he will continue to go to gaol for longer and longer periods, and he will continue to be disqualified for longer and longer periods of time. As to his prospects of rehabilitation that has been put on his behalf in his letter to the Court, they must be regarded, as the Crown said, with some circumspection.
	
	
	In relation to both prisoners I have had regard to s 3A of the Act. These are matters that require weight to be given to general deterrence, personal deterrence, making the prisoners accountable, denouncing their conduct, recognising the loss to the victim and other matters, as well as promoting their rehabilitation. I do not think the community needs protection from the prisoners, neither of them is a danger in the sense that this type of conduct is characteristic, particularly having regard to their ages and their criminal histories.
	
	
	As earlier point out, although drug usage was in the background of the matter and was in part motivation, I do not accept that it was the sole reason that either offender involved himself in these offences. Personal profit and unjustified enrichment were motivations too. In the case of Mr Usher, as I said earlier, this was amply demonstrated by the facts of count 2 in the indictment. Neither prisoner gives a believable explanation as to the distribution of the money. I do not accept for a moment that Mr Burns could only seek $6,000 for his involvement in the offence or he did not know how much was taken. He must have known roughly, or had some ambit idea of, how much money was in the safe. One might have thought without speculation that the three offenders would share in the money that was taken. It is to be remembered it was a joint criminal enterprise by its character. In the end I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt though of precisely what each person got.
	
	
	In relation to both offenders I have concluded that there are special circumstances made out. In the case of Mr Burns there is the partial accumulation of sentences that I will impose, the need for professional assistance to adjust to community living, and professional guidance in relation to matters discussed in the pre-sentence report and the report of Dr Furst. In the case of Mr Usher there is an issue of partial accumulation because I have to accumulate the sentences I imposed a past expired non-parole period for the sentences imposed in February 2014 of 12 months with a six month non parole period. The same issues arise in relation to him as arise in relation to Mr Burn in assessing the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence. In my view the adjustment of the sentence is to reflect special circumstances will assist the rehabilitation of both prisoners. Of course they will be required to fulfil their parole conditions which if not honoured will lead to their return to custody. These are matters for the Parole Authority in due course. They must understand of course I have got no power given the character of the sentences to direct that they be released immediately to parole on the expiration of their non-parole periods.,
	
	
	In fixing appropriate sentences for each offender I followed from what the High Court in Lowe v R (from 1984), and later in the decision of Postiglione (from 1999), particularly in the decision of Dawson and Gaudron JJ, where their Honours identified as the central principal or corollary of parity of sentencing, the concept of equal justice. ‘Aristotlean principles’ of equality essentially state that alike shall be treated alike, and the unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness. Justice Rothman much more eloquently than I focused on this matter in his judgment in the 2010 Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Jimmy.
	
	
	Although Mr Usher does not have the same mitigating factors as Mr Burns and Mr Burns’ subjective case, particularly in relation to criminal history is more favourable, the role of Mr Burns in providing information and resource that permitted the crimes to be committed is a strong balancing matter. One cannot really differentiate about their roles in determining who ultimately concluded it was a good idea to knock over Woolworths. The facts of the matter are they are equally liable to that initial decision.
	
	
	Ultimately I have concluded that I should not substantially differentiate between the offenders apart from matters pertinent to consideration of the matter on the Form 1, partial accumulation of sentences in relation to Mr Burns, and also the matter of the commencement date of the sentences. To substantially differentiate between the two offenders ultimately would be an act of sophistry or of subtle semantics, which the case does not deserve.
	
	
	Of course Mr Burns gets a substantially greater discount because of the greater utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. Mr Usher is able to have his sentence start earlier because he was never on bail. I am appreciative of the fact too of the way in which matters operate in these courts. Mr Burns pleaded guilty at the Local Court where the room for negotiation is far less than it may be when matters come to the District Court. It is a fact as we know as practitioners and as Judges that generally speaking a lot more focus negotiation occurs after the matter has been in the Local Court than while the matter is before the Local Court. The learned representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions here would have greater discretion in that regard than a police prosecutor or someone appearing for the Director at the lower court.
	
	
	There is a standard non-parole period in relation to the aggravated breaking, entering and stealing matter. This is a matter specifically addressed in the submissions of counsel for the accused Burns. He cites Muldrock, [2011] 244 CLR 120. Particularly I note what is said between [20] - [30]. Ultimately Muldrock held that Markarian principles are required in sentencing notwithstanding the existence of a standard non parole period (Markarian v R [2005] 228 CLR 357 particularly the observations of McHugh at [51]). The standard non parole period is not a determinative matter in fixing sentences. That having been said I also note, of course, that since Muldrock ss 54A and 54B have been substantially amended to make it clear that the standard non parole period is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender but without limiting the matters that are to be taken into account. The standard non parole in any event, as s 54A(2) now makes clear, is a matter that is to be taken into account only in relation to the objective factors. Of course finding ‘special circumstances’ and matters of mitigation have to be further taken into account in fixing the ‘non-parole’ period.
	
	
	If I was to categorise the seriousness of the offending in this matter I would be inclined to think that the offending was either at the very low end of the middle range of objective seriousness, particularly having regard to the amount of money that was taken, or alternatively just below the mid range of objective seriousness. But again as I said my understanding the authorities do not require an assessment of it beyond the analysis I have undertaken earlier.
	
	
	I am sorry, Mr Burns and Mr Usher, I said it would take some time. Mr Burns would you mind standing up, thanks very much. In relation to the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent, bearing in mind the starting point of the sentence for that matter is four years, I sentence you to three years imprisonment to date from 28 December 2014, that sentence to expire on 27 December 2017. I pause for a moment.
	
	
	Mr Stewart and Mr Crown is 28 December 2014 a fair starting date taking into account 60 days of presentence custody?
	
	
	SPEAKER: That’s right on my calculations your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I calculate it to be 61 days but it seems fair enough.
	
	
	SPEAKER: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sir in relation to count 3, when I say count 3 the third charge, the dealing with proceeds of crime charge, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a sentence of two years six months imprisonment to date from 28 June 2015 and that will expire on 27 December 2017. In relation to the aggravated breaking entering and stealing matter you are convicted. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years six months imprisonment to start from 28 June 2015 and that will expire on 27 December 2017. The total sentence is four years and six months and on my calculation that total sentence will expire on 27 December 2019. You can take a seat thank you very much.
	
	
	Mr Usher do you mind standing up please. In relation to the offence of, your concern with the proceeds of crime, count 2 on the indictment, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a sentence of two years six months to date from 18 April 2014, the sentence will expire on 17 October 2016. In relation to the offence of aggravated breaking entering and stealing with a starting point of six years six months, in your case I gave a starting point of six years for Mr Burns, but with a discount of 10% I sentence you to a non-parole period of three years three months to date from 18 April 2015, to expire on 17 July 2017. I fix a total sentence in relation to that matter of five years and ten months to date from 18 April 2014 and to expire on my calculation on 17 February 2012. Just take a seat sir thanks very much.
	
	
	That means that Mr Burns in your case you are eligible for release to parole on my calculation on 27 December 2017. And in the case of Mr Usher you are eligible for release to parole on 18 July 2017.
	
	
	In each case I make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act, to provide extended periods of supervision to assist the prisoners and to recognise the effect of partial accumulation of sentences.
	
	
	Now are there any errors in my calculations?
	
	
	SPEAKER: Not from me your Honour.
	
	
	SPEAKER: Not from me your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am told, Mr Crown, there are some related matters on the Justice Link information in relation to Mr Burns, is that right or not, s 166 certificate matters?
	
	
	STOLLERY: Yes your Honour, they’re sequences 4 and 5 possess prohibited drug matters.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: How are they to be dealt with? I mean obviously they’re not going to add to the sentence, are they to be withdrawn or?
	
	
	STOLLERY: Yes one 14/10/2013 relating to cannabis the other one relates to amphetamine.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: When he was arrested. When he was arrested he was in possession of a small amount
	
	
	STOLLERY: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: of cannabis and a small amount of amphetamine.
	
	
	STOLLERY: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well, Mr Crown, if you wanted them to be dealt with by pleas of guilty, and I’ll speak to Mr Stewart about this right now, I’d deal with them under s 10A of the
	
	
	STEWART: That is to be my submission your Honour, yes, s 10A.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Just let your solicitor speak to Mr Burns, he might not understand the intricacies of s 166 of the Act.
	
	
	STEWART: Yes that’s the preferred course your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am sorry to trouble you, Mr Burns, I know this would seem like a torture in the scheme of things but you realise when you were arrested you were in possession or you were alleged to be in possession of some amphetamine and some cannabis, do you understand that and you were charged with those two offences, possessing those two prohibited drugs. Do you admit your guilt in relation to those matters?
	
	
	ACCUSED BURNS: Yeah. Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything you want to say about the matter Mr Crown?
	
	
	STOLLERY: No.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything you want to say about the matter Mr Stewart?
	
	
	STEWART: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sit down Mr Burns.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 14 and 15 the accused is convicted and pursuant to s 10A he is convicted without penalty in relation to both of those offences. There is no utility in fining him. They are sequences 14 and 15, is that right? I have read that from the certificate. I think you said that.
	
	
	STOLLERY: No it’s 4 and 5.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 4 and 5 I am sorry, sequences 4 and 5.

		19 August 2015",2015-02-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765954,Leichhardt Council v Geitonia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2015] NSWLEC 30,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	The next witness for the prosecution to be called in this criminal prosecution is Mr John Loukis. Global Demolitions Pty Ltd, which he and his father owned, was the contract demolisher of the southern façade of a building in Parramatta Road, Annandale. The defendants are charged with demolishing the façade contrary to the terms of a development consent and thereby committing an offence under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.
	
	
	This morning, prior to Mr John Loukis being called, the defendants Mr Bill Gertos and his company Geitonia Pty Ltd (the developer and land owner) submitted that Mr Loukis should give evidence orally rather than his affidavit being read. The prosecutor consented to that course.
	
	
	A controversial matter was then raised by counsel for those defendants, who emphasised that he was doing so in his capacity as an officer of the Court. He submitted that before Mr John Loukis gives evidence the Court should tell him that he has a right of silence. This came to be refined to a contested submission that the Court should tell him that he has or may have a right to object to giving particular evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that he has committed an offence, tell him of s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995, and give him an opportunity to obtain legal advice or representation before giving his evidence.
	
	
	Section 128 relevantly provides:
	


128 Privilege in respect of self-incrimination in other proceedings

(1)   This section applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence, or evidence on a particular matter, on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness:

(a)   has committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, or

(b)   is liable to a civil penalty.

(2)   The court must determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds for the objection.

(3)   Subject to subsection (4), if the court determines that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is not to require the witness to give the evidence, and is to inform the witness:

(a)   that the witness need not give the evidence unless required by the court to do so under subsection (4), and

(b)   that the court will give a certificate under this section if:

(i)   the witness willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or

(ii)   the witness gives the evidence after being required to do so under subsection (4), and

(c)   of the effect of such a certificate.

(4)   The court may require the witness to give the evidence if the court is satisfied that:

(a)   the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable to a civil penalty under, a law of a foreign country, and

(b)   the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence.

(5)   If the witness either willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or gives it after being required to do so under that subsection, the court must cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence.

(6)   The court is also to cause a witness to be given a certificate under this section if:

(a)   the objection has been overruled, and

(b)   after the evidence has been given, the court finds that there were reasonable grounds for the objection.

(7)   In any proceeding in a NSW court or before any person or body authorised by a law of this State, or by consent of parties, to hear, receive and examine evidence:

(a)   evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given, and

(b)   evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence,

cannot be used against the person. However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence.

(8)   Subsection (7) has effect despite any challenge, review, quashing or calling into question on any ground of the decision to give, or the validity of, the certificate concerned.

(9)   If a defendant in a criminal proceeding for an offence is given a certificate under this section, subsection (7) does not apply in a proceeding that is a retrial of the defendant for the same offence or a trial of the defendant for an offence arising out of the same facts that gave rise to that offence.

(10)   In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence that the defendant:

(a)   did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue, or

(b)   had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue.

(11)   A reference in this section to doing an act includes a reference to failing to act.

…


	
	Defence counsel’s initial focus was upon a potential objection by Mr Loukis to giving evidence on the ground that it may tend to prove that he has committed an offence by demolishing the southern façade contrary to the terms of the development consent. In my opinion, the short answer is that proceedings for that offence have to be commenced not later than two years after the offence was alleged to have been committed or after the date on which the alleged offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer: s 127(5) and 5(A) Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. On any view, any such offence that Mr Loukis may have committed is time barred. There would not be reasonable grounds for objection under s 128(2) of the Evidence Act if there is no real risk of the person being prosecuted or if the person could not be convicted and punished for the offence, for example because he has received immunity against prosecution: R v Bikic [2001] NSWCCA 537 at [13]-[15] per Giles JA; Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (11th ed, 2014) at 764. In fact, Mr John Loukis did receive a letter from the prosecuting Council, variously described at trial as a letter of immunisation or letter of comfort against prosecution, if he gave “true” evidence. However, it has been overtaken by the statutory time bar.
	
	
	The submission was then put by defence counsel that the Court should tell Mr John Loukis before he embarks on his evidence that he can object to giving particular evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that either he has committed an offence by making a false affidavit (even though it has not been read) or might give false oral evidence. This submission was initially related to his immunisation against prosecution, but I do not consider that this fact relevantly distinguishes the present case from the many cases that daily come before the courts on affidavit evidence such that the Court should be telling him what defence counsel proposed. If anything, the fact that the letter of indemnification or comfort is conditional upon him giving true evidence may suggest that he would have been alert particularly to being truthful.
	
	
	Then it was put by defence counsel that there are discrepancies or inconsistencies or contradictions between the affidavit that Mr John Loukis swore and drafts disclosed by the prosecution to the defence, and that this is sufficient for the Court to tell him, before he embarks on his evidence, that he may object to giving evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that he has committed an offence of swearing a false affidavit or has committed or might commit perjury. As a general proposition, differences between an affidavit and drafts of an affidavit are unsurprising and hardly warrant the course proposed by defence counsel.
	
	
	Nor do I see any justification in accepting defence counsel’s submission that the Court should now give Mr John Loukis an opportunity to obtain legal advice or representation before he is required to give evidence.
	
	
	There is some force in the prosecutor’s submission that if the Court were to do what defence counsel has proposed, it might suggest to the witness that the Court had formed a preliminary adverse view of his evidence even before it was given. Defence counsel submits that this could be negated by the Court giving some appropriate explanation or qualification.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that what has been put by defence counsel is sufficient for the Court to embark on the course that has been proposed, for which no precedent has been cited, before the witness has even given evidence. Accordingly, I do not accept defence counsel’s submission.
	
	
	Exhibit XA (letters of indemnification or comfort to Mr John Loukis and Global Demolitions Pty Ltd) is to be returned.

2765966,Beatson v R [2015] NSWCCA 17,"Judgment

Application for Certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


The application

The applicant applies for a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (hereafter called the CCC Act) following her successful conviction appeal to this Court in 2009: Beatson v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 288.


	
	The applicant and her co-offender had been jointly tried and found guilty by a jury of being in possession for the purpose of supply of 209.4g of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy) at Chippendale on 16 June 2007 which amount was not less than the commercial quantity for that drug.
	
	
	On appeal this Court quashed the conviction that had been entered against the applicant on the basis that the conviction was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the appeal, after the Court delivered judgment, the applicant made an application for a Certificate under s2(1)(b) of the CCC Act. At that time the Court indicated that the application could be dealt with by way of written submissions from both parties. For reasons not clear, submissions were not filed until July 2013 on behalf of the applicant and December 2013 on behalf of the Crown. The Court received oral submissions on 16 February 2015.
	


Summary of applicable legislation and principles


	
	Section 2(1) CCC Act relevantly provides:
	


""2(1)    The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:

…

(b)    where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:

(i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or

(ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,

grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings. …""


	
	Section 3(1) provides:
	


""3(1)    A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:

(a)    if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and

(b)    that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.""


	
	Section 3A(1) defines ""all the relevant facts"" as:
	


""(a)    the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and

(b)    Any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and

(c)    Any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:

(i)    relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and

(ii)    were not adduced in the proceedings….”


	
	The power to grant a certificate pursuant to s2(1)(b) is discretionary and the applicant bears the onus of persuading the court that a certificate should be granted: Mordaunt v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor [2007] NSWCA 121; 171 A Crim R 510 at [36] per McColl JA (Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreeing):
	


“36    … The applicant for a s 2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings; it is not for the Crown to establish, nor for the Court to conclude, that the institution of the proceedings, was, or would have been in the relevant circumstances, reasonable.”


	
	Costs may not be awarded in respect of the applicant’s costs of the conviction appeal to this Court (s17(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, R v Stavropoulos  [2008] NSWCCA 68 at [25]).
	
	
	The relevant test has been stated in a number of cases. The Court of Appeal (Kirby P, Meagher and Handley JJA agreeing) said in Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 559 – 560:
	


“As we read s 3(1)(a) the task of the court or judge, justice or justices in

specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, as stated by

Sugerman P in R v Williams. But that question is addressed to evidence of all

of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal

(if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever

they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the

trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker. The decision-maker

must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all of the relevant

facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have

been reasonable to institute the proceedings.”


	
	In  R v Pavy (1997) 98 A Crim R 396 Hunt CJ at CL (Smart and Badgery-Parker JJ agreeing) said at 399:
	


“The primary test to be applied when deciding whether a certificate should be granted is to be found in the wording of s3(1)(a): If the prosecution had been in possession of all the relevant evidence as it is now known before proceedings had begun, would it have been reasonable to institute the proceedings?”


	
	In Regina v Jonathon Harold  Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; 49 NSWLR 203 at [10] Wood CJ at CL said:
	


“10 The requirement for proof, by the applicant, of unreasonableness for institution of the proceedings within the meaning of s3(1)(a) was the subject of consideration by Blanch J, in McFarlane, a case in which the accused was found not guilty, and discharged, at the close of the Crown case. …

…

12   … None of the reported cases addresses the question of what ‘reasonable’ means in the context of the decision to institute proceedings. Clearly a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies throughout Australia use as the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction. Equally the decision is not governed by the test in s41(6) of the Justices Act applied by magistrates, namely whether no reasonable jury would be likely to convict. Equally the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious.

In the ordinary course of events a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case but that does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution simply because a prima facie case exists. There may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence.

…

15   Fejsa at 257 and Pavy at 5, each make it clear that the mere fact that this Court allows an appeal and enters a verdict of acquittal, upon the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground, as it was then comprehensively described, is not necessarily a touchstone for an exercise of the discretion in favour of the applicant. …”


	
	McColl JA in Mordaunt at [35] – [38] comprehensively reviewed the principles applicable to an application under s2 of the CCC Act by reference to the earlier case law and said at [36]:
	


“…

(k)    The fact that a court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness.

…

(n) The mere fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal allows an appeal and enters a verdict of acquittal upon the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground, is not necessarily a touchstone for an exercise of the discretion in favour of the applicant …”


	
	The case law on applications under the CCC Act does not provide a single bright line test as to when it would be unreasonable for a prosecution to have been instituted. Rather, the cases indicate that where the issue is word against word which involves an assessment of credibility, then generally it would be less likely that the requisite affirmative opinion would be formed that it was unreasonable for the prosecution to be instituted. By contrast, if there were expert or highly technical evidence from which it was apparent that the Crown case was incapable of making out the elements of the offence then it might be more likely that the requisite affirmative opinion would be formed that it was unreasonable for the prosecution to be instituted.
	


Application of test


	
	The key issue in relation to the charge against the applicant was whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt the element of possession. The circumstances were that police officers searched a vehicle, which was being driven by the co-accused and in which the applicant was a passenger. The search revealed a quantity of ecstasy in the car.
	
	
	There was no direct evidence which linked the applicant to the drugs. There was, however, a strong case against the co-offender on the issue of possession. The only evidentiary connection which could link the applicant to the drugs was that when she returned to the car to obtain some ID from her wallet, she either dropped the wallet and a plastic sewing kit into the gutter next to the car, or while she was looking for her ID she knocked a clear white plastic container out of the vehicle. The sewing kit or clear white plastic container held a large number of resealable plastic bags which according to a police witness, were used in the drug trade. How precisely the sewing kit/container came to be dropped, intentionally or otherwise, by the applicant was never explored.
	
	
	The only other relevant evidence was that when the applicant asked why she was under arrest she was told “for the possession of a prohibited drug …” and the applicant responded “yeah but I didn’t have any drugs on me”. This response was regarded by the Court of Criminal Appeal as ambiguous at best in that the applicant may have understood “possession” as referring to the possession of drugs on her person.
	
	
	The leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered by Tobias JA (with whom Hidden and Howie JJ agreed). His Honour said:
	


“23    The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s shared interest in drugs with her co-accused implied, at the very least, comity with him insofar as the illicit possession and purchase of prohibited drugs was concerned. Drawing the necessary inferences, the circumstances favoured the hypothesis that the appellant was acting jointly with her co-accused rather than simply being his passenger, or indeed his customer. They remained in company with each other after the consumption of drugs.

24    I do not accept this last submission as being the only hypothesis that was open to the jury to find. In my view a position to the contrary was an equally open hypothesis. At the very least, a hypothesis of equal strength was that the appellant was in the company of her co-accused simply because she was indeed his passenger and may have been his customer and he her supplier. The factors relied upon by the Crown could not, in my view, have led the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only hypothesis open was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in the relevant legal sense.

…

27    In my view the Crown’s contentions should be rejected. The circumstances proved by the Crown did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence by the jury was that the appellant was, to her knowledge, in possession of the drugs in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except herself and her co-accused for the purpose of their supply.

28    As I have said, an equally rational inference to that contended for by the Crown was that the appellant was no more than a user of drugs and that she had used some of the drug on this occasion: in other words, although she may have used the drug with the concurrence of her co-accused, her relationship to the drugs was no more than a recipient of them from her co-accused as her supplier. At least that was a hypothesis equally open to the jury and thus one consistent with her innocence of the offence with which she was charged.

…

32    At the end of the day the only connection between the appellant and the vehicle was the fact that she was in the front passenger seat at the time that the police arrived on the scene. She was unconnected with the hiring and driving of the vehicle by her co-accused and, as I have indicated, there is nothing to establish when, for what purpose and for how long she had been in the vehicle.

33    It is thus apparent that the Crown’s case was based on no more than the contents of the vehicle and the fact that the appellant was found in it with the ambiguous evidence of the sewing kit. In my view the evidence led against the appellant not only displayed inadequacies but also lacked probative force and gave rise to a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted. Critically, in my view, a jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference from the evidence was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs found in the vehicle for the purpose of supply in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except her co-accused. I would experience such a doubt and, therefore, so ought have the jury.

34    I repeat that in my view, an equally rational inference open on the evidence was that the appellant was an innocent passenger in the vehicle. Even if her intoxication had been due to the ingestion of drugs, there was no evidence that would necessarily support an inference that it was the drugs in the vehicle she had ingested. But even if that was an available inference, it did not follow that a jury could find beyond reasonable doubt that she was in possession of the totality of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of supply.”


	
	The effect of the decision of the Court in Beatson is that upon the Crown case to be adduced at trial there was never going to be sufficient evidence to convict the applicant. As was said by the plurality (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ) in Barca v R [1975] HCA 42; 133 CLR 82 at 104 -105:
	


“When the case against an accused person rests substantially upon circumstantial evidence the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are ""such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused"": Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619, at p 634 . To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be ""the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw.”


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the evidence was insufficient to allow a conclusion of the guilt of the applicant beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence against the applicant was not going to improve at trial. For those reasons I have concluded that it was not reasonable for the Crown to institute proceedings. There was no suggestion in submissions that the applicant had acted or omitted to act in any way that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of proceedings. Rather, the only evidence before the court made it clear that the applicant sought on a number of occasions to have the proceedings against her discontinued.
	
	
	The order which I propose is that a certificate be issued in favour of the applicant pursuant to s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW).
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Charges and outcome of trial

The applicant was indicted before Armitage DCJ and a jury at Parramatta on 18 March 2014 in respect of five counts alleging sexual assault upon his daughter, LA (the complainant).


	
	The five counts were as follows:
	


Count 1 – Between 16 January 2007 and 19 January 2007 at Eaglevale did assault and commit an act of indecency on the complainant who was then aged 8 years contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 2 – Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 at Kings Park did assault and commit an act of indecency against the complainant who was then aged 12 years contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 3 - Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 at Kings Park did have sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then aged 12 years knowing that she was not consenting contrary to s61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 4 – On 4 April 2012 did assault and commit an act of indecency against the complainant who was then aged 13 years at Ingleburn.

Count 5 – On 4 April 2012 did have sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then aged 13 years at Ingleburn knowing that she was not consenting.


	
	In relation to count 1, a not guilty verdict was returned by direction of the trial judge. Verdicts of not guilty were entered in respect of counts 2 and 3. A verdict of guilty was entered in respect of count 4. In relation to count 5 the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction in respect of count 4.
	
	
	The applicant was originally charged and indicted in respect of counts 4 and 5. His trial commenced in May 2013 but was adjourned following legal argument. During the trial the complainant was further interviewed on 21 May 2013. Her disclosures caused the trial to be adjourned because the Crown wished to add further counts (now counts 1, 2 and 3) to the indictment. The applicant was not offered the opportunity to respond and be interviewed regarding these later allegations.
	


Factual background


	
	The complainant was the natural daughter of the applicant. Her mother was separated from him. While the mother was alive, the complainant and her brother lived with her full-time at a house in Kings Park and visited their father, the applicant, regularly. The mother passed away from cancer in March 2012. The complainant and her brother continued to live at Kings Park for a few weeks and in early April 2012, they went to live with the applicant and his partner, KR, at Ingleburn on a full-time basis.
	
	
	The complainant, who was born in January 1999, made three recorded interviews which were played at the trial.
	



	
	19 April 2012
	
	
	27 April 2012
	
	
	21 May 2013
	


At trial the complainant was aged 15.


	
	In her first interview on 19 April 2012 the complainant said that the applicant touched her private areas, namely her breast and vagina, the last occasion being “Thursday, 5 April 2012” at the applicant’s house at Ingleburn. Her brother was upstairs in his room and the applicant’s partner, KR, was downstairs watching television. The complainant said that when she went to the applicant’s bedroom to ask for a pen, he pulled her onto the bed and started kissing her cheek, wrestling and putting his hands down her pants and on her breasts. She said he sneaked his hand under her shirt and was stroking and squeezing her breasts (count 4).
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant put his hand down her shorts under her underwear and slid his fingers into her vagina, left them there and started moving them around. She felt pressure inside her vagina, mostly at the top. She screamed, kicked him, hit him, told him to stop and wriggled her way out and ran into her room and stayed there until dinner time when she went downstairs, had dinner, sat on the lounge with her stepmother and watched television and then went to bed (count 5).
	
	
	The complainant stated that:
	



	
	These events occurred on the Thursday before Good Friday between 6 – 7.30pm
	
	
	She lost the letter she was writing to her friend.
	
	
	She complained to her dance teacher, Alyce, on “Saturday night”. She said - “Can you take me home, I really can’t go back … because my dad does stuff to me that I don’t like”. Alyce was the first person she told.
	
	
	She spoke with her Aunty J on Sunday “I don’t want to stay with dad … dad touches me and I don’t like it”.
	
	
	She told her mother’s best friend, Claire, on the Monday – “He touches me and makes me uncomfortable.”
	



	
	In her second interview on 27April 2012 the complainant said that she had made two mistakes with the dates. Her complaint to Alyce the dance teacher was not on the Saturday but Sunday because she went to the Easter Show on the Saturday. Secondly, the incident described as occurring in the applicant’s bedroom was not on the Thursday, but Wednesday.
	
	
	The complainant further said:
	



	
	(i)   She went to the Easter Show on Saturday, 14 April 2012.
	
	
	(ii)   She was sick and vomiting on the Thursday (i.e., previously nominated as the date of the offences).
	
	
	(iii)   Her stepmother was not downstairs when the incident happened on the Wednesday.
	
	
	(iv)   The incident happened on Wednesday, 4 April 2012.
	
	
	(v)   On Wednesday her stepmother drove her to school and she was picked up by Aunt B. They drove to Aunt B’s place, arriving at about 3.30pm. The applicant collected the complainant about 4pm. They drove home arriving at about 4.30pm. She changed out of her school uniform, went downstairs, played with the dog and returned to her room.
	
	
	(vi)   The complainant did not know where her stepmother KR was although she was in the house having arrived home at about 6.30pm.
	



	
	In her third interview, on 21 May 2013, the complainant recalled other incidents relevant to counts 1, 2 and 3.
	
	
	Count 1 was charged as having occurred between 16 January and 19 January 2007, within a couple of days of the complainant’s eighth birthday. The complainant said that she was lying on the couch when the applicant walked in, lay down next to her and started touching her “in my vagina and my breasts” with his hands. This went on for a couple of minutes. She thought it was a week day because it was in the school holidays and her birthday is in the middle of the school holidays. She could not remember whether she was in year 4 or 5 at the time. She could not remember what teacher she had. She thought the touching was inside her clothes, but she was not sure. This allegation was made 13 months after the first interview on 19 April 2012. Count 1 was the subject of a verdict by direction because the complainant was unclear when the alleged assault occurred.
	
	
	The applicant said that count 2 occurred at Kings Park when her mother was not there. She said that she was 12 years old in year 7 and that she thought she was wearing her high school uniform. She said that when she was sitting on the couch in the lounge-room, the applicant touched her on her breasts and her vagina. He touched her breasts on the inside of her clothes. She said that her school finished earlier than her brother’s school so she got home before him.
	
	
	The complainant said that count 3 occurred on the same occasion as count 2. She said that the applicant touched her on the inside of her vagina using his hand. She felt a sharp pain. She did not know if he moved his hand or kept it still because she was trying to fight him off, she was moving around a bit. She said that the applicant slid his hand under her underwear. She was not sure how long this lasted, or what made him stop. Her brother came home at about 4pm-4.35pm but she did not say anything to him or to her mother.
	
	
	During the course of the trial, the trial judge gave a Markuleski direction (R v Markuleski (2001) 125 A Crim R 186); Murray direction (R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12); a Longman warning (Longman v R [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79); a Gipp warning (R v Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106); a Liberato direction (Liberato v R (1985) 159 CLR 507); a character direction, an alibi direction and a “not giving evidence” direction (Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25; 205 CLR 50) and OGD v R (1997) 45 NSWLR 744).
	
	
	The course of the trial was as follows. The jury retired to consider its verdict at 9.35am on 2 April 2014. At 12.20pm on 4 April 2014 the jury returned with verdicts of not guilty in respect of counts 2 and 3 but advised that they could not agree on counts 4 and 5. His Honour gave the jury a Black direction Black v R [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44 at [15]. On the afternoon of 4 April 2014 the jury advised that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict in relation to counts 4 and 5. His Honour then gave the jury a majority verdict direction. Late on the afternoon of 4 April 2014 the jury by majority verdict found the applicant guilty of the offence in count 4 but advised that they could not reach a verdict in relation to count 5.
	


Ground of Appeal 1 – The verdict of the jury in respect of count 4 should be set aside and quashed on the ground that it was irreconcilable with the failure of the jury to agree on count 5.


	
	The applicant submitted that counts 4 and 5 were based on the same incident. He submitted that an analysis of the complainant’s evidence did not reveal any fact or facts sufficient to distinguish counts 4 and 5 other than those facts which differentiated the charges in law. He submitted that if the jury could not agree on count 5, based on the complainant’s evidence, then there was no additional evidence that could give rise to a finding against him on count 4.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the summing up did not draw a distinction between counts 4 and 5, other than the elements of the offences. The applicant submitted that on this issue the evidence of his partner KR was important. Her evidence did not put him in his bedroom at the time alleged by the complainant. He submitted that the jury could not be satisfied as to the elements of the offence in count 4, without also being satisfied as to the elements of the offence in count 5. The fact that the jury could not agree on whether he had committed the offence in count 5, meant that there was an inconsistency between their failure to agree on count 5 and the verdict of guilty which they arrived at in respect of count 4.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the case was conducted on the basis of the reliability of the complainant. He submitted that a verdict of guilty in relation to count 4 and the inability of the jury to agree on a verdict in relation to ground 5 meant that the principles relating to inconsistent verdicts applied. He submitted that the determination by the jury in respect of counts 4 and 5 were indicative of the jury having reached a compromise in relation to count 4, because they determined that the complainant was unreliable in relation to the other counts with which he had been charged. The applicant submitted that the evidence of complaint from Alyce, Aunt J and Claire did not provide a basis for distinguishing count 4 from count 5.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the jury’s verdict and non verdict on counts 4 and 5 respectively bear no other analysis than that the decision making process miscarried. He submitted that logic and reasonableness supported that submission (TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [8]). The applicant submitted that the verdict in relation to count 4, when taken with the failure to agree in relation to count 5, suggested a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty and suggested confusion in their minds, or a misunderstanding of the function or uncertainty about the differentiation between the offences.
	


Consideration


	
	The extent to which, if at all, the applicant can rely upon this ground of appeal, based as it is upon apparently inconsistent verdicts between count 4 and count 5, is problematic. Until the Court brought this issue to the attention of the parties, no submissions had been addressed to it, except by the Crown. In that regard, the Crown submitted (without reference to authority) that the applicant’s argument could not be maintained because in reality there was no verdict actually entered in respect of count 5.
	
	
	Having drawn the parties’ attention to the authorities on this issue, the Court gave them a further 48 hours within which to provide written submissions. These have now been received and have been taken into account in these reasons. The matter is of importance because until now, there has been no New South Wales authority on the issue.
	
	
	The issue first appears to have been considered in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316. The only justice to expressly deal with the point was Callinan J at [232] where his Honour said:
	


“232   … There is an important distinction between an acquittal and a disagreement by a jury. As was pointed out during argument in this Court the jury may have simply been immovably divided on a question whether Mr Albion should be convicted of manslaughter or murder having regard to his lesser involvement in conceiving, planning and executing the death of Mr Osland. I do not accept that the jury's failure to agree upon a verdict in relation to Mr Albion at the joint trial can be regarded as repugnant to the verdict of guilt in respect of the appellant. I cannot accept therefore the appellant's submission that such a disagreement may, for the purposes of determining an issue of inconsistency, be equated with a verdict of acquittal.”


	
	The issue arose expressly in R v DAL [2005] QCA 281. There, McPherson JA said:
	


“2   The appeal against conviction in this case is said to raise a question of “inconsistency” between verdicts of guilty returned by the jury to one or more counts in the indictment and their failure to reach verdicts on one or more of the other counts in the indictment. I have been unable to persuade myself that any such inconsistency exists or is capable of arising. …”


	
	Having referred to some early English decisions, McPherson JA went on to say:
	


“5   Those decisions show that being discharged from rendering a verdict cannot be equated with a verdict of acquittal. …

6    What then is the basis for the appeal in the present case? We know it is neither autrefois acquit or autrefois convict. It is said, however, to consist of a form of inconsistency in verdicts. The word verdict is derived from the Latin veredictum meaning a true declaration: Black’s Law Dictionary, title “Verdict”. But in the case of those counts in the indictment here as to which no verdict was given, the jury made no such declaration or decision. There cannot be a state of inconsistency between something and nothing. Of course, it is said that if you look at the evidence, it is not easy to see why the jury convicted on one count and did not on the same evidence do so on another. That may be a matter of regret for the Crown, but it cannot be a source of legitimate complaint by the appellant. It is not a reason for setting aside the verdict or verdicts in those instances in which they did find him guilty.”


	
	In the same case, Keane JA (with whom McMurdo P agreed) said:
	


“21   At the outset of a consideration of the appellant's argument it is necessary to emphasize that the only verdict of acquittal related to one count of procuring a sexual act by intimidation in relation to the complainant M. As the appellant accepted, there is an obvious explanation for this acquittal by reason of the divergence between what was opened by the Crown and the evidence which was given. Apart from this one instance, it is not correct to speak of inconsistent verdicts. In this case the jury only returned verdicts of guilty while failing to reach agreement on the other charges. The failure to reach a verdict is not to be equated with a verdict of acquittal. As Callinan J said in Osland v The Queen. …”

(His Honour then set out the above quotation).

“22   In this State ""inconsistent verdicts"" may afford one way of demonstrating that a jury has acted unreasonably; which does authorise appellate intervention under s 668E(1) of the Criminal Code. The distinction between a failure to agree and an acquittal may be important because of what each of those two different outcomes says about the jury's deliberations.

23   The failure by the jury to agree on verdicts on a number of charges in the present case, for example, may well be explicable by reason of the eccentric view of one juror not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all the elements of the offence in question. Such an explanation does not necessarily throw the integrity of the guilty verdicts into question because it does not imply that the jury as a whole entertained a reasonable doubt about the reliability of evidence germane to the counts on which it convicted in the same way that a verdict of acquittal might have done. It is only if an appellate court is satisfied that a jury must have convicted in spite of such doubts that it must intervene. As McHugh J said in Osland v The Queen:

""When an appellate court sets aside a jury's verdict of guilty on the ground that it is inconsistent with a verdict of acquittal, it usually does so for one of two reasons. First, the verdict of acquittal may necessarily demonstrate that the jury did not accept evidence which they had to accept before they could bring in the verdict of guilty. Second, in acquitting the accused on one count, it may follow that the jury must have accepted evidence that required them to acquit on the count on which they convicted the accused. Sometimes, however, the verdicts may indicate that, if the jury did accept the evidence, it has misapplied or misunderstood the directions of law that it was given.""

…

32    Finally, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that in MacKenzie v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said that:

""... the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which appellate courts may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury ... ""

33    As I have observed, the issue before this Court does not involve the question whether inconsistent verdicts ""in the relevant sense"" are reconcilable, but the guidance afforded by this passage as to the proper approach of an appellate court applies a fortiori to a case where the jury has not returned a verdict on some counts while convicting on others. The point at which a jury decided that ""enough is enough"" and declined to convict or acquit on some counts is something which the courts cannot seek to second guess on appeal unless the result were to ""represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty."" …”


	
	The approach of Keane JA in DAL was followed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v CX [2006] QCA 409 where Jerrard JA (Atkinson and Douglas JJ agreeing) set out nine principles in relation to inconsistent verdicts. Relevant to this issue were the principles set out as points 6- 8.
	


“33   …

6.    Accordingly, as Callinan J wrote in Osland v The Queen, there is an important distinction between an acquittal and a disagreement by jury; a disagreement on one count is not necessarily inconsistent with a conviction on another, where an acquittal might be, for the reasons explained by McHugh J in Osland. As Keane JA wrote in R v DAL at [23], a failure to agree on a number of charges does not necessarily imply that the jury as a whole entertained a reasonable doubt about the reliability of evidence germane to the count or counts on which it convicted a defendant, in the same way that verdicts of acquittal might, and which would therefore throw the integrity of the guilty verdicts into question.

7.    It is therefore incorrect to describe as inconsistent with other verdicts the (non) result in counts on which a jury has failed to reach a verdict; that failure is indicative only of the inability of the jury unanimously to reach a verdict on those particular counts one way or another.

8.    Further, the failure of a jury to agree on some verdicts on a number of charges may be explicable by reason of the eccentric view of one juror not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of the offence in question. That explanation does not necessarily throw the integrity of guilty verdicts on other charges into question.

9.    Likewise, where there are a large number of counts on an indictment, there is scope for merciful disagreement by way of a refusal by some jurors to convict on some of the plethora of charges brought against a particular defendant, even though the jury are not prepared unanimously to acquit.”


	
	The same approach was followed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Garrett [2009] QCA 300. There Fraser JA (with whom Muir JA and Jones J agreed) said:
	


“35   Although the appellant did not base any argument upon the jury's failure to agree upon a verdict on the count of rape, I have considered whether it gives any cause for concern about the guilty verdicts on the two related counts of which the appellant was convicted. Had the jury acquitted the appellant of the rape charge there would have been cause for concern whether the inconsistent verdicts on the other counts were an affront to logic and common sense such as to throw doubt upon the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts: see MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368; R v CX [2006] QCA 409. However, the jury's inability to reach any verdict on the rape count does not constitute a verdict which is inconsistent with the guilty verdicts on the remaining two counts. The distinction between the absence of a verdict and a verdict of acquittal is in this respect significant: see Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 per Callinan J at 406; [1998] HCA 75 at [232]. As Keane JA pointed out in R v DAL [2005] QCA 281 at [23], a failure to agree about one count does not necessarily imply that the jury as a whole entertained a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the evidence which is relevant to the counts upon which it convicted a defendant in the same way that verdicts of acquittal might.

36   Furthermore, the jury's failure to convict on the rape count might have been referrable to the complainant's evidence which suggested that she must have been in a state of shock at the relevant time as a result of being confronted by an assailant with a knife, her evidence that the episodes of penile penetration were very brief, and the emphasis given in cross-examination of Mr Clausen to the absence of forensic evidence which corroborated the complaint of rape. Whilst that evidence does not entirely satisfactorily explain the contrast between the convictions upon the counts of burglary and detaining the complainant against her will on the one hand, and the jury's failure to agree upon a verdict on the rape count on the other hand, it does suggest that the jury's failure to agree on the rape count might be explicable by a view – perhaps an eccentric view – of one juror not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of that offence: cf R v DAL [2005] QCA 281 per Keane J at [23], referred to with approval by Jerrard JA (with whom Atkinson and Douglas JJ agreed) in R v CX [2006] QCA 409 at [33] (8); see also R v Kahu [2006] QCA 33 per Keane JA (with whom McPherson JA and Muir JA agreed) at [27].”


	
	In R v CBF [2012] QCA 294 Applegarth J (with whom Muir JA and Atkinson J agreed) followed those decisions when he said:
	


“16   A jury’s failure to reach a verdict cannot be equated with a verdict of acquittal. The absence of a verdict indicates that the jury was not prepared to find unanimously (or by majority if the circumstances permitted a majority verdict) that the evidence did not establish that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The absence of a verdict also indicates that the jury was not prepared to find unanimously (or by majority) that the evidence did establish that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”


	
	There is authority to similar effect in Western Australian and South Australia. In Western Australia in Millar v The Queen [2003] WASCA 211 McKechnie J (with whom Steytler and Anderson JJ agreed) rejected the proposition that a count on which a verdict could not be reached could be regarded as inconsistent with two guilty verdicts. He said:
	


“45 `The first thing to be noted is that there were not inconsistent verdicts. A majority of the jury were able to be satisfied as to counts 1 and 2 and there was no majority for any other verdict. It is wrong to equate this situation with an inconsistency.”


	
	In South Australia in R v R, GJ [2009] SASC 371; 105 SASR 506 Kourakis J (with whom Duggan and Bleby JJ agreed) said:
	


“31   It is not surprising, therefore, that the burden carried by a convicted person who appeals on the ground of inconsistency alone is a heavy one. A verdict of guilty will only be unreasonable if it is illogical having regard to a verdict of not guilty returned in the same trial. In MacKenzie v The Queen, the test was described in these terms by Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ:

“3.   Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness …

4.   Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ‘merciful’ view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries …

5.   Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty … It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case’. ” …

32   In this case the jury did not return a verdict of not guilty on the second count; the jury was discharged without reaching a verdict. The passage cited immediately above from MacKenzie suggests that a mere failure to reach a verdict should not be treated in the same way as a verdict of not guilty. Where a jury has failed to reach a verdict there is not, “on the public record”, an inconsistent verdict which is “an affront to logic and common sense”. The very fact that the jury has been discharged before and without reaching a verdict means that all that can be said is that no verdict was reached. There is very little if any force in the proposition that a verdict of guilty is rendered illogical by the failure of a jury to reach a guilty verdict on another count within the same period of time. …”


	
	A somewhat different approach has been taken in Victoria. In Pillay and Ors v The Queen [2014] VSCA 249 the Victorian Court of Appeal (Maxwell P Weinberg and Santamaria JJA) said:
	


“20   There is a considerable body of authority in support of the proposition that the ‘inconsistent verdicts’ doctrine, as the basis for an unsafe and unsatisfactory submission, cannot be invoked, as such, when comparing a guilty verdict with an inability on the part of the jury to agree on another charge. That is because, strictly speaking, in the case of a disagreement on the part of the jury, there is no ‘verdict’. Accordingly, so it is said, there is no room for any argument based on inconsistent verdicts.

21    There is, however, some authority to the contrary. For example, in R v Formhals the English Court of Appeal was faced with just this dilemma. The defendant, a dealer in antiques and memorabilia, sold via Ebay documents said to bear the genuine signature of Winston Churchill. In fact, he had forged them. He was charged on six counts with six separate offences, each involving the same buyer. The jury convicted on three of those counts, but failed to agree on the other three. The appeal was conducted on the basis that the convictions were unsafe as the facts being the same, the verdicts were inconsistent.

22    The Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, on the basis that the evidence in relation to the counts upon which there were convictions differed in certain key respects from that relating to counts upon which the jury could not agree. Nonetheless, it was accepted that a verdict could be set aside as unsafe or unsatisfactory if logically, and factually, that verdict could not be reconciled with the jury’s inability to agree on other counts. The Court said this:

“Overall in this context what the Court of Appeal ultimately has to consider is whether or not a conviction is safe. The failure of a jury to agree on a verdict is, as we have said, self-evidently not a verdict. But in our view, in a context such as the present, linguistics should not be allowed to triumph over justice. It thus may be that where a jury fails to reach a verdict that cannot be said to give rise, strictly, to an inconsistent verdict when set against another verdict. But that is labelling; and in our view, the principles applicable to inconsistent verdicts are capable of applying by analogy where it simply is logically inexplicable as to how a jury could not reach a verdict on one count when set against a verdict of guilt they had reached on another count. We thus think it would be going too far to preclude a defendant in such a situation from even being permitted to argue that the resulting situation gives rise to an unsafe conviction. Accordingly, it is open to the defendant to raise this point in this appeal.” (R v Formhals [2014] 1 WLR 2219)

23    The approach taken in Formhals seemed to us to be correct, and one that we should also adopt.”


	
	The approach in Pillay was followed by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Tukuafu v The Queen [2014] VSCA 345 where the Court (Maxwell P, Redlich and Whelan JJA) said:
	


“24    The relevant principles for the assessment of a submission that verdicts are inconsistent were set out in R v MacKenzie. Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ, in their joint reasons, said that ‘the test is one of logic and reasonableness’. They said:

[I]f there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.

...

[A] residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case’.

25    A failure to reach a verdict should not be equated with an acquittal. All that can be said when a jury does not reach a verdict is that one or more of the jurors were unable to conclude that the accused was guilty. There is no ‘verdict’ as such. As Callinan J said in Osland v The Queen:

“There is an important distinction between an acquittal and a disagreement by a jury. As was pointed out during argument in this Court the jury may have simply been immovably divided on a question whether Mr Albion should be convicted of manslaughter or murder having regard to his lesser involvement in conceiving, planning and executing the death of Mr Osland. I do not accept that the jury’s failure to agree upon a verdict in relation to Mr Albion at the joint trial can be regarded as repugnant to the verdict of guilt in respect of the appellant. I cannot accept therefore the appellant’s submission that such a disagreement may, for the purposes of determining an issue of inconsistency, be equated with a verdict of acquittal.”

26    Recently, in Pillay v The Queen, this Court determined that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict could give rise to an inconsistency with a verdict of guilty. The failure to reach a verdict gave rise to the question whether there could be any explanation for the outcome of the jury’s deliberations ‘apart from some form of irrational and improper compromise’. The Court in Pillay concluded that it was not rational for the jury to have found consent not to be present in relation to an indecent assault charge but to have failed to reach unanimity on the same issue with respect to rape charges.

27    The appropriate inference to be drawn from the jury’s failure to reach a verdict with respect to a particular charge is to be determined according to the circumstances of the particular case. In R v DAL Keane JA (McMurdo P agreeing) made the following observations:

“The failure by the jury to agree on verdicts on a number of charges in the present case, for example, may well be explicable by reason of the eccentric view of one juror not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all the elements of the offence in question. Such an explanation does not necessarily throw the integrity of the guilty verdicts into question because it does not imply that the jury as a whole entertained a reasonable doubt about the reliability of evidence germane to the counts on which it convicted in the same way that a verdict of acquittal might have done. It is only if an appellate court is satisfied that a jury must have convicted in spite of such doubts that it must intervene.”

28    In Avery v The Queen, Warren CJ and Redlich JA made observations to similar effect:

“Contrary to the applicant’s submission, verdicts of not guilty or disagreement on the balance of the charges on the indictment do not necessarily reflect a view by the jury that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, such that this Court should assess the reasonableness of the three guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant was a person of damaged credibility. Credit is not a homogeneous and indivisible whole. It simply does not follow that because the jury, or some of them, had a reasonable doubt as to the evidence the subject of the charges other than those upon which a guilty verdict was returned, that it should have had a doubt about the evidence of the complainant on Charges 10, 11 and 12. As Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v The Queen, a verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or demonstrate a want of confidence in the complainant. A verdict of not guilty or a disagreement by the jury may reflect no more than a cautious approach to the discharge of its heavy responsibility. That caution might be attributed to the absence of supporting evidence or detail in the complainant’s account, some level of uncertainty, a faulty recollection, a contrast in different parts of the account that suggest that parts of it are more reliable than others, or to the jury thinking that although a number of offences had been alleged, justice was met by convicting the applicant on some only. [2014] VSCA 86)””


	
	With great respect to the Victorian Court of Appeal, I am not persuaded that the approach in Formhals and Pillay is correct. To follow such an approach implicitly accepts that there is no difference between a verdict of acquittal or guilt and a failure to reach a verdict, a proposition which is contrary to law and common sense. The reasons why a verdict of acquittal or guilt and a failure to reach a verdict should be treated differently, are set out in DAL and the cases which followed it. That is sufficient to deal with this ground of appeal.
	
	
	Contrary to the proposition in Formhals, the difference between a verdict of acquittal or guilt and a failure to reach a verdict by a jury is not simply a matter of “linguistics”. In this case the conviction on count 4 of necessity involved 11 jurors being satisfied as to the elements of the offence. Their failure to arrive at a verdict in relation to count 5 potentially could involve a number of other permutations. The language of the High Court in Mackenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 and that of Callinan J in Osland when dealing with the difference between a verdict on the public record, as opposed to a failure to reach a verdict, cannot be regarded simply as a “linguistic” analysis. Rather, they raise fundamental concepts reflecting important differences between the two factual circumstances.
	
	
	Similarly, the concept of a compromise in circumstances where a jury has failed to arrive at a verdict is hard to conceptualise, i.e. what was the precise nature of the compromise?
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal cannot succeed and ought be dismissed.
	
	
	That does not end the matter. There is a possible way of reconciling the approach in Formhals and Pillay with the DAL line of decisions but not on the basis of inconsistent verdicts. In circumstances where an “unreasonable verdict” ground has been raised (such as in the second ground of appeal here), it may be possible to argue that a possible inconsistency between a verdict by the jury and a failure to arrive at a verdict constitutes another reason why a jury verdict was unreasonable. It is difficult to envisage circumstances where such a ground alone without other grounds could provide a basis for a finding that a verdict was unreasonable. This is because of the possible explanations for a failure to reach a verdict set out in DAL at [23].
	
	
	In case I am wrong in the above analysis and an apparent inconsistency between a jury verdict and a failure to reach a verdict can provide the basis for a finding of inconsistent verdicts, this ground of appeal still fails. This is because there is a clear explanation for why the jury might have found the applicant guilty on count 4 but have been unable to agree in relation to count 5. An examination of the complaint evidence supports the touching which formed the basis of count 4, but does not necessarily support sexual intercourse as asserted in count 5.
	
	
	Alyce was told that “my dad does stuff”. Aunty J was told “dad touches me and I don’t like it” and Claire was told “he touches me and makes me uncomfortable”. This is a sufficient basis to explain how the jury could convict the applicant of count 4, but have failed to reach a verdict in relation to count 5.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The verdict of the jury in respect of count 4 should be set aside and quashed on the ground that it was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the acquittals on counts 1, 2 and 3 and the failure to agree on count 5.


	
	The applicant submitted that the case was conducted on the basis of the reliability of the complainant. He submitted that the verdict by direction in relation to count 1 and the verdicts of acquittal in respect of counts 2 and 3 made it clear that the jury must have had real doubts as to her reliability. He submitted that when those matters are taken into account with the inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant’s evidence in relation to count 4, it is clear that the jury’s verdict in relation to count 4 was unreasonable and it was simply not open to them to find him guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In making that submission, the applicant conceded that it was natural that the complainant’s recollection of events over time would contain inaccuracies, internal contradictions and other imperfections which would not necessarily justify rejection. He submitted that in this case the inaccuracies and contradictions were so great that the jury’s verdict in relation to count 4 could only be regarded as unreasonable and that the only logical conclusion is that their decision making miscarried.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the following evidentiary material – the different dates in the first and second statements, the evidence of KR to the effect that the applicant had almost no opportunity to commit the offences on the Wednesday night, the failure to mention Mr and Mrs McHugh being in the house in either statement, and the differences in the evidence as to where KR was on the Wednesday.
	
	
	The applicant stressed what he described as the contradictions in the evidence as to the timing of the offending. He submitted that the time suggested by the complainant was inconsistent with the evidence of KR and most particularly with the evidence of Ms McHugh as to when she and her husband were present and who they saw at the time.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that these were significant contradictions which when taken with the not guilty verdicts in respect of counts 1 -3, rendered the jury’s verdict unreasonable.
	


Consideration


	
	Before dealing in detail with the specific submissions of the applicant, it is useful to restate the importance which courts have given to jury verdicts and the difficult onus which the applicant has to discharge in seeking to have a jury verdict set aside. In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said:
	


“25   Where it is argued that the verdict of a jury is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in M v The Queen. That test was accepted and applied by this Court in Jones v The Queen. In M, it was pointed out that it was once common for expressions such as ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"", or ""unjust or unsafe"", or ""dangerous or unsafe"" to be used in place of the language of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and corresponding statutes in other jurisdictions, and that such expressions might cover different parts of the statutory provision, referring, for example, either to a verdict that is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or to a miscarriage of justice because an accused has not had a fair trial according to law. Speaking of cases where what is in question is whether a verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the joint judgment said:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""

26   The test, as formulated in M, should not be confused with the question whether a trial judge ought to have directed a verdict of not guilty. This is made clear by the opening words of the above passage. The difference between the function of an appellate court in reviewing the totality of the evidence at a trial in order to determine whether a verdict of guilty was unreasonable, and the function of a trial judge in considering whether as a matter of law there is evidence on which an accused could be convicted, was explained in R v R, a decision which was approved by this Court in Doney v The Queen.

…

34   Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.

35   It appears from the review of decisions of trial judges and intermediate appellate courts undertaken in Markuleski that some judges have taken Jones as authority for the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant, then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. That view is erroneous. It overlooks the attention to factual detail in the reasoning of Jones. It also overlooks the principles stated in MacKenzie, which were not qualified in Jones, and the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph in these reasons. Jones is not to be understood as establishing a set of legal propositions, separate or different from the test formulated in M, which must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.”


	
	These observations were refined in TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151, 74 NSWLR 299 where Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) said:
	


“135    Mackenzie, Jones and Norris all appear to have proceeded upon the basis that, absent the acquittals, the evidence adduced was sufficient, and was not relevantly tainted, to support the convictions. I do not mean to suggest that Jones creates a separate entity of unreasonable verdict: that is expressly contradicted by MFA. It is also clearly contradicted by the last paragraph in the joint judgment in Jones itself. But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

136    In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations: see, for example, Mackenzie (at 367); R v Landsell (NSWCCA, unreported, 22 May 1995 per Gleeson CJ). It is only in circumstances where the evidence points, and points clearly, even unequivocally, to departure from those obligations that an appellate court will come to such a view.

…

138 This requires the appellate court to examine the evidence for an explanation or explanations, other than scepticism about the complainant’s credibility, for the acquittals. …”


	
	When applying those principles to the acquittals in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3 and the conviction in count 4, an explanation for the verdicts, which does not involve the undermining of the credibility of the complainant, is readily available.
	
	
	The jury in convicting the applicant on count 4, clearly accepted the evidence of the complainant beyond reasonable doubt given that she had made a recent complaint of that incident and made her statement to the police 15 days after it occurred. Accordingly, the jury had a sound basis for accepting the young complainant beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In contrast, the complainant did not make an early complaint about the offence in count 1, (it was pleaded as occurring between 16 and 19 January 2007). Not only did the complainant not make an early complaint, but she did not say anything about this incident in her first or second statements to the police, despite having the opportunity to do so. It was her difficulties in recalling the specificity of dates in relation to count 1 which led to the trial judge entering a verdict by direction. This was the consequence of the Crown pleading count 1 narrowly as occurring between 16 and 19 January 2007. The complainant under cross-examination indicated that she could not be sure that the offence occurred at that time as she was uncertain how old she was at the time. His Honour’s direction to the jury to acquit the appellant on count 1 was based solely on the date of the count and not any determination by his Honour of the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s version of the allegation.
	
	
	Similar considerations apply in relation to the acquittals of the applicant on counts 2 and 3. Counts 2 and 3 were alleged to have occurred within seconds of each other during 2011. Like count 1, the complainant did not make an early complaint about these 2011 incidents. Also like count 1, the complainant made no mention of the incidents that constituted counts 2 and 3 in her first and second statements to the police, despite having the opportunity to do so.
	
	
	The lack of specificity in the complainant’s description of the allegations that made up counts 2 and 3 could only lead to the indictment covering a 12 months period (in contrast to count 4 which due to the early complaint, could be pleaded on the specific date). This was significant because of the importance the trial judge gave to this in his summing up when he gave his “Longman” direction. Unlike count 1, however, the Crown had pleaded counts 2 and 3 widely enough so as to not give rise to the same problem which caused the verdict by direction.
	
	
	In the circumstances, it is not surprising that senior counsel for the applicant strongly attacked the complainant’s failure to mention counts 2 and 3 in her first two statements to the police. Such submissions on behalf of the applicant were inevitable and likely to be effective. It is also fair to say that the jury did not receive any real explanation directly from the complainant as to why she had not told the police at an earlier point in time about the events which gave rise to counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	One of the problems for the applicant, however, was that when the delayed complaint in relation to counts 2 and 3 was highlighted to the jury so that this assisted in convincing them to have a reasonable doubt about counts 2 and 3, it also had the effect of highlighting the strength of counts 4 and 5 and why they fell into a different category. This is because in counts 4 and 5 the complaint was fresh and the statement to the police was made shortly after the event.
	
	
	The acquittals in respect of counts 2 and 3 could also be explained by the strong “Longman” direction which his Honour gave (despite the provisions of s165B of the Evidence Act 1999). In giving that direction, his Honour stressed to the jury that they must consider the effects of the delay in complaint in relation to counts 2 and 3 and in particular, the disadvantage that the applicant suffered as a result of that delay.
	
	
	The jury’s acquittals on counts 2 and 3 did not necessarily indicate a rejection of the complainant’s truthfulness or reliability. The jury may well have regarded the complainant as truthful and reliable about counts 2 and 3 but have been prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt because of the delayed complaint, particularly in the light of his Honour’s “Longman” direction. It should also be remembered that his Honour had given a “Markuleski” direction. In doing so, he stressed that the jury were not to compromise their verdict (and gave a relevant example). There was no reason to find that the jury did not follow this direction. This is so where there were obvious and proper reasons to explain the differing verdicts, rather than leaping to the conclusion that a compromise was involved.
	
	
	A close examination of the evidentiary matters relating to count 4, to which the Court’s attention was directed reveals that the asserted contradictions were more apparent than real. Insofar as the timing of the offending is concerned, the evidence of Ms McHugh was essentially that she could not remember any precise times, but was prepared to accept the approximations which were put to her in cross-examination. It is also clear from the complainant’s first statement that her evidence as to when the offending occurred was not as precise as has been submitted and that, in effect, the interviewer incorrectly summarised what she had said when attempting to summarise the effect of her evidence. The applicant’s submission on this issue seeks to give general evidence as to timings a precision which it lacks and which given the circumstances of the offending, has an air of unreality about it.
	
	
	The other evidentiary matters to which the applicant referred are the sort of contradictions which frequently occur in matters of this kind, particularly when evidence is given by young persons. The jury had the benefit of seeing and assessing the complainant and KR. The issues raised are fundamentally questions for the jury. The jury were clearly in a better position than this Court to assess the credibility and reliability of the complainant and other witnesses.
	
	
	It is not without significance that the complainant was extensively cross-examined. There were no important inconsistencies in that cross-examination and the complainant’s evidence was credible and cogent. This is against the background that count 4 involved a recent complaint, a specific date and a consistent version of events from the complainant. The complainant’s inability to remember some matters peripheral to the offending did not affect her overall credibility and provides no basis for this Court finding that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to the applicant’s guilt. Memory problems for young complainants in child sexual assault matters are not unique.
	
	
	There is also the difference in the evidence of complaint to which reference has already been made at [41] and [42] hereof.
	
	
	I am not persuaded upon the whole of the evidence that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence in count 4. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against conviction is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed, but would prefer to state briefly my own reasons for that conclusion. In doing so, I gratefully adopt his Honour’s analysis and summary of the evidence, jury directions and the course of the trial and deliberations.
	


Ground 1 - The verdict of the jury in respect of count 4 should be set aside and quashed on the ground that it was irreconcilable with the failure of the jury to agree on and count 5.


	
	The terms of this ground do not make it clear whether the appellant is seeking to contend that the verdicts (or more correctly, outcomes) were inconsistent in law or whether he attempts to persuade the Court that there is a factual inconsistency between the verdicts such as to give rise to the Court’s jurisdiction to interfere with a verdict that it considers to be unreasonable or unable to be supported. The distinction between verdicts that are inconsistent in law and verdicts that are factually inconsistent was explained by Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MacKenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 365-366:
	


“The argument that two or more jury verdicts are inconsistent (or, as sometimes described repugnant or illogical) ordinarily arises, in the context of criminal trials, when it is suggested that a conviction resting upon one of the verdicts is thereby demonstrated to be unsafe or unsatisfactory. In civil trials, the problem of inconsistency or incompatibility has often arisen where special verdicts are taken on questions, resulting in the argument that the respective answers cannot logically stand together.

…

1. A distinction must be drawn between cases of legal or technical inconsistency and cases of suggested factual inconsistency. The former will generally be easier to resolve. On the face of the court's record there will be two verdicts which, in law, cannot stand together. Examples include the case where the accused was convicted both of an attempt to commit an offence and the completed offence or of being, in respect of the same property and occasion, both the thief and the receive. There are other like cases. Where technical or legal inconsistency is established, it must be inferred that the jury misunderstood the judge's directions on the law; compromised disputes amongst themselves; or otherwise fell into an unidentifiable error. The impugned verdict or verdicts must be set aside and appropriate consequential orders made.

2. Suggestions of factual inconsistency have arisen both as between different verdicts affecting the same accused and different verdicts affecting co-accused or persons tried separately in relation to connected events. The last-mentioned problem is an inevitable risk of the trial system where accused offenders are tried separately. Thus in R v Rowley the appellant was convicted after a plea of guilty. The principals in the offence were later acquitted after a trial. The appellant gained an order quashing his conviction. Yet it was pointed out that apparently inconsistent verdicts in such circumstances might be no more than the result of ""differences in the evidence presented at the two trials"" or ""the different views which the juries separately take of the witnesses"".


	
	See also MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [33] (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and [85] (McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ).
	
	
	The verdicts in this case could not possibly be described as legally inconsistent. Count 4 required proof of penetration. Count 5 did not.
	
	
	The question of whether verdicts are factually inconsistent so as to give rise to a finding that the guilty verdict is unreasonable requires consideration of whether there is any explanation in the evidence for the different outcomes or whether the verdicts represent “an affront to logic and commonsense”: see MFA v R at [34] (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and [85]-[86] (McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ). Where the prosecution case depends solely or largely on the evidence of one witness, the question is whether the circumstances are such that the acquittal means that the credibility of the witness was damaged with respect to all counts or whether the evidence may have been more reliable in respect of the count or counts where there was a guilty verdict: Jones v R [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439 at 453 (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ). Ultimately, the test is unreasonableness rather than inconsistency and the question turns on the application of the statutory language in s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) as explained by the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487: see MFA v R at [25], [36] and [59]. The Court must “examine any differentiation in the verdicts to see if it can be justified”: MFA v R at [89].
	
	
	In the present case, the evidence adduced at trial provided a cogent explanation for the asserted inconsistency between the guilty verdict on count 4 and the inability of the jury to reach a verdict on count 5. Two or more members of the jury may have been prepared to give the accused the benefit of the doubt in respect of the issue of penetration. As Hoeben CJ at CL points out, the complainant did not make an early allegation of penetration. Rather, the early complaints were made in terms of “touching” and “doing stuff”. Given the directions that the jury received in relation to the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with great care and to look for supporting evidence (including complaint evidence), there is a clear and obvious reason why two or more members of the jury may have found themselves unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the element of penetration while, nevertheless, finding the young complainant to be an otherwise truthful and reliable witness. As Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v R at [34]:
	


“This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility.”


	
	For that reason, and to adopt the terms of the ground of appeal, I am not persuaded that the guilty verdict on count 4 was “irreconcilable” with the failure of the jury to agree on count 5.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to express any final opinion on the possible conflict between the Victorian authorities and those emanating from Queensland and elsewhere. I am inclined to the view expressed by the Victorian Court of Appeal (Maxwell P, Redlich and Whelan JJA) in Tukuafu v The Queen [2014] VSCA 345 that:
	


“the appropriate inference to be drawn from the jury’s failure to reach a verdict with respect to a particular charge is to be determined according to the circumstances of the particular case.”


	
	Also, I am inclined to agree with the reconciliation of the authorities proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL at [40] of his draft judgment. In other words, I agree that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict may, in particular circumstances, provide some support for a ground of appeal based around an assertion that a guilty verdict reached by the same jury is unreasonable or unable to be supported.
	
	
	Ground 2 - The verdict of the jury in respect of count 4 should be set aside and quashed on the ground that it was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the acquittals on counts 1, 2 and 3 and the failure to agree on count 5. 
	
	
	I will not repeat what I have said about reconciling the disagreement on count 5 with the guilty verdict on count 4. In considering the general ground that the verdict is unreasonable or unable to be supported, I have taken the jury’s inability to reach a verdict on count 5 into account.
	
	
	As to reconciling the guilty verdict on count 4 with the acquittals on counts 2 and 3, I agree with the reasons given by the Chief Judge at Common Law. In relation to count 2 and 3 (and for that matter 1) there was no recent complaint. Any complaint was made when the trial relating to counts 4 and 5 was first listed. That was many years after the event alleged by the complainant to constitute counts 1, 2 and 3. The complainant’s evidence in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3 was completely uncorroborated. On the other hand, her evidence in relation to count 4 was corroborated by the things she had said to others immediately, or a very short time, after the relevant events.
	
	
	I have considered the whole of the record and in particular have taken into account the inconsistencies pointed to in the careful submissions of Mr Bellanto QC. I have also considered the evidence concerning the opportunity (or lack of opportunity) for the appellant to commit the offence charged in count 4. As senior counsel for the respondent pointed out, much of the evidence (of timing) that went to the issue of “opportunity” was couched in vague and uncertain terms. The jury was given careful directions as to these matters and the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The warnings provided by the learned trial Judge were careful and repeated.
	
	
	This is a case where the jury was in a better position than this Court to assess the credibility of the complainant’s allegations and the appellant’s denials. The jury had the benefit of seeing (rather than reading) the recorded interviews with both the complainant and the appellant. Neither party suggested that it was necessary or desirable for this Court to review that material: cf SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [28]-[29] (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ). The jury observed the complainant being cross-examined and was present when the “opportunity” witnesses, including the appellant’s wife, gave their evidence.
	
	
	The “jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving” any doubt that arises as a result of the matters raised on the appellant’s behalf: M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494 (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) and SKA v The Queen at [13]-[14].
	
	
	On the whole of the evidence, and taking into account the verdicts on counts 1-3 and the disagreement on count 5, I am not left with a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. The evidence relied upon by the appellant as casting a doubt upon his opportunity to commit the offence was uncertain or vague in relation to the critical issue of time. The complainant’s testimony received support in the evidence of her prompt complaint. Accordingly I would not uphold ground 2.
	
	
	For those reasons I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

		02 March 2016",2015-02-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765986,R v Kelsall (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 251,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Daniel Jack Kelsall, has pleaded not guilty to the two counts on the indictment which allege that on 8 September 2013 at Neutral Bay he indecently assaulted and murdered Morgan Huxley.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused followed the deceased from the Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay to the deceased's nearby home in Watson Street. It is alleged that he entered the deceased's apartment and there, in the deceased's bedroom, committed the two offences. The deceased's flat mate was alerted to sounds coming from his bedroom. She went to investigate and found the deceased on the floor covered in blood. The immediate investigation established that he had died from the effects of multiple stab wounds.
	
	
	The issue with which this judgment is concerned is whether a conversation between the accused and Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Dukes of the Homicide Squad on 26 September 2013 is admissible. It was not recorded. Counsel for the accused objected to the evidence on the basis that it was not recorded (s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)). (Counsel also relied, unnecessarily, upon the provisions of ss 90, 135, 137, 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).)
	
	
	Section 281 is in the following terms:
	


(1) This section applies to an admission:

(a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and

(b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and

(c) that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person.

(2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless:

(a) there is available to the court:

(i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or

(ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or

(b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made.

(3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2).

(4) In this section:

investigating official means:

(a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or

(b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences prescribed by the regulations.

official questioning means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.

reasonable excuse includes:

(a) a mechanical failure, or

(b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or

(c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned.

tape recording includes:

(a) audio recording, or

(b) video recording, or

(c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording.


	
	The Crown tendered on the voir dire statements by Detective Dukes and by the officer who was with him at the time of the conversation, Plain Clothes Senior Constable Iain Adcock. It also tendered the transcript of an interview with the accused on 24 September 2013.
	
	
	In order to understand the Crown's contentions it is necessary to set out what had occurred during the investigation up until the conversation in question occurred.
	
	
	The police investigation commenced almost immediately after the death occurred on 8 September 2013. Detective Dukes was assigned to be the officer in charge from the outset. By the time of the conversation with the accused on 26 September 2013 the police had evidence of the following matters.
	
	
	CCTV footage obtained from the Oaks Hotel and in the vicinity showed that a man was in that area at the time when the deceased entered the hotel. That same man was seen to remain outside, in the general area, for the ensuing 30 minutes or so until the deceased left the Oaks Hotel. The deceased was seen to walk west on the northern footpath of Military Road to the intersection of Watson Street. He was then seen to cross Military Road at the traffic light controlled pedestrian crossing at about 1.36am. The other man was seen to follow the deceased, sometimes running in his direction. Sight was lost of the pair as they proceeded across the pedestrian crossing.
	
	
	Detective Dukes said that he had initially thought that the other man was dressed in chef's clothing so it was thought that he worked in the area and was hastening towards a bus interchange near the intersection of Military Road and Watson Street in order to catch a bus home; or perhaps to get a taxi, or a lift, home.
	
	
	Detective Dukes said that subsequent to this, namely on 24 September 2013, witnesses identified the man in the CCTV footage as the accused and it was established that he lived in the general area. I interpolate, this would have put paid to the catching a bus/taxi/lift home theory.
	
	
	Police immediately located the accused and interviewed him at the North Sydney police station after having cautioned him concerning his right to silence. He gave an account, the essence of which was that he had briefly encountered and spoken to the deceased in a convenience store in Ben Boyd Road opposite the Oaks Hotel. He remained in the area talking to a security guard from the hotel and then walked the route covered by the CCTV footage. However, he said that this was in order for him to return to his place of employment on the other side of Military Road because he had ""left the light on"". He noticed the deceased proceeding in the same direction until he, the accused, diverted down Cheal Lane towards his workplace. He then went to his home in Spruson Street, Neutral Bay.
	
	
	Detective Dukes accepted in his evidence on the voir dire that it was apparent that the accused might have been the last person to have seen and spoken with the deceased.
	
	
	The accused said some rather odd things in that interview but Detective Dukes was untroubled about them. These included a seemingly fanciful explanation for having followed the deceased up Military Road and crossing at Watson Street; an incredible explanation for running part of the way (it was cold and his mother had told him to go for a jog if he got cold); an unlikely explanation for why it would have taken him longer to walk to his home in Spruson Street (his parents were home and, I infer, might have been asked by police if they knew what time he got home); and a seemingly nonplussed series of responses when asked about a subsequent conversation with a security guard from the Oaks Hotel in which he asked the guard about news of Mr Huxley's murder. In cross-examination, Detective Dukes' attention was drawn to some of these responses but he denied that they caused him to regard the accused as a suspect: ""No. I just thought he was strange, to be honest"" (2.3.15 at T40.40).
	
	
	The accused rang Detective Dukes during the afternoon of 26 September 2013. He said that when he had spoken to the police on the 24th he ""wasn't completely telling the truth"". He was asked what he meant and he replied, ""Well I wasn't telling the entire truth"". Detective Dukes asked if the accused would like to tell the truth and he replied, ""Yeah, do you want me to tell you now or in the next few days?"" The detective replied, ""Now would be fine"". An arrangement was made for the accused to be picked up where he was; outside Woolworths at Neutral Bay. I infer that the detective considered talking to the accused was a matter of priority even though in his evidence on the voir dire he characterised his thoughts as being of ""curiosity"".
	
	
	Detective Dukes and Constable Adcock immediately proceeded the short drive from North Sydney to Neutral Bay. The detective's evidence of what occurred when they arrived was as follows:
	


“I got out of the police vehicle and the accused walked towards me. I said, “How you going mate, come and stand at the back of the car.” With the accused and Plain Clothes Senior Constable Adcock we walked and stood at the rear of the police vehicle.

I said, “You met Detective Adcock the other day. What’s going on?” He said, “Well I haven’t been completely truthful.” I said, “What do you mean? He said, “Well you know the other day when I said that I hadn’t spoken to that guy well I did.”

I said, “Okay well what happened?” He said, “Well I started talking to him and he was like upset and depressed so I said to him can I cheer you up?” I said, “Okay what happened then?” He said, “Well we went back to his apartment and up to his bedroom on the first floor.” I said, “Okay.” He said, “I started to give him head and he fell to sleep. I tried to wake him up but I couldn’t.”

I said, “Okay mate I want you to understand that you are not obliged to say or do anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say or do will be recorded and may be used in evidence. Do you understand that?” He said, “Yes.”

I said, “What happened after you couldn’t wake him up?” He said, “I left, I went down the stairs out the front door and I didn’t lock it. I just shut it. I think I am the reason why he was murdered.” Whilst the accused said this he began to cry.

I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Well when I was leaving there was a woman coming towards his unit and she saw me coming out and I don’t think I locked the door.”

I said, “Okay so what are you trying to say?” He said, “She saw me coming out and I think that’s why he got murdered.”

I said, “Okay mate you are under arrest do you understand that?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “I am going to take you back to North Sydney Police Station where I am going to ask you further questions in relation to this matter. Do you understand that?” He said, “Yeah okay.”

I conducted a cursory search of the accused including the grey coloured Philips Fox brand shoulder bag.

I said, “Jump in the back seat and we will head back to the police station.” The accused was seated behind the front passenger’s seat and I sat beside him.

I said, “How long were you there for?” He said, “Only about 15 to 20 minutes.” I said, “What did you do after that?” He said, “I went back to work cause I told you before that I left the light on.”

I said, “Did you take anything from the unit?” He said, “Yeah just some coins that he had. He had heaps of change lying around.” I said, “Anything else?” He said, “No.”

I said, “What did the female look like?” He said, “I think she had blond hair.” I said, “How long was her hair?” He said, “Short.” I said, “What else did she look like?” He said, “She was shorter than me.”

I said, “Why are you telling this now. Why didn’t you tell us before?” He said, “I was embarrassed. I don’t like people knowing that I am gay.” I said, “You know I don’t care that you are gay.” He said, “Yeah I know.”

I said, “Mate did you murder Morgan Huxley?” He said, “No. No way.” As he said this he shook his head a number of times.

Shortly before we returned to the police station the accused said, “I will give you my DNA and fingerprints now if you want them?” I said, “Okay mate we will sort that out when we get back.”

When we returned to North Sydney Police Station the accused was taken to the Charge room where he was introduced to the custody manager.”


	
	Later in the evening the accused was invited to participate in an electronically recorded interview but he exercised his right to silence.
	
	
	Detective Dukes maintained that up until he administered the caution in the conversation outside Woolworths he did not suspect the accused had any involvement in the killing of the deceased. The critical question, however, is whether the accused ""could reasonably have been suspected"" by the detective of having committed the offence. In this respect, the detective had the following evidence:
	


●   the accused had a brief interaction with the deceased in the convenience store opposite the Oaks Hotel;

●    the accused lingered in the area of the hotel while the deceased was inside;

●   the accused followed, sometimes running, after the deceased after he left hotel;

●   the accused was possibly the last person to see the deceased alive;

●    the accused gave some very odd (to say the least) explanations in his interview on 24 September 2013;

●   the accused told police on 26 September 2013, on the telephone prior to the Woolworths conversation, that his exculpatory account given two days earlier contained lies; and

●   the deceased had been stabbed multiple times with what was described by the Crown Prosecutor as a ""large knife"" (T59.14) and the accused worked as a kitchen hand with obvious access to knives.


	
	This body of evidence available to police prior to the conversation on the afternoon of 26 September 2013 should have given rise to a reasonable suspicion that the accused was involved in the killing of the deceased.
	
	
	I do not accept that there was any ""reasonable excuse"" for not recording the Woolworths conversation in its entirety (i.e. both before and after the suspicion was said to have arisen that prompted the caution). Detective Dukes was based at North Sydney police station for the purposes of this investigation. He did not normally work there but assumed that hand-held recording devices would have been available. He made neither an inquiry as to the availability of a recording device nor any attempt to obtain one. He had a mobile phone but it was an old one which he did not think had a facility to make audio recordings.
	
	
	In any event, there were facilities at North Sydney police station for recording interviews with suspects and it was only a few minutes away. Why the detective could not have waited until he got back to the police station to record a conversation with the accused, who indicated a willingness at that point to speak with police, is inexplicable. His explanation that he did not know what the accused was going to say is unacceptable. And the fact that the detective chose to continue with an unrecorded conversation after having cautioned the accused beggars belief.
	
	
	The conversation between Detective Senior Sergeant Dukes and the accused on 26 September 2013 is inadmissible.

2765987,R v GW [2015] NSWDC 52,"Judgment

Reasons for Upholding the Appeal against Finding of Guilt 

Introduction


	
	On 19 August, 2014 the appellant, who is a juvenile and therefore remains anonymous, was found guilty by the Children’s Court at Dubbo in respect of a charge that she on 2 May 2014 at Dubbo in the State of New South Wales did deface a wooden bench with a graffiti item. That charge is contrary to s 4(1) of the Graffiti Control Act, 2008. Through the solicitor from the Aboriginal Legal Service who appeared for her at the time, she appealed against the finding of guilt.
	
	
	On 5 March 2015 that appeal came before me. The matter had been adjourned several times as the young person was at one stage contemplating having the matter litigated in the Supreme Court. After brief submissions on 5 March 2015 I took the view that the appeal should be upheld. I did not understand the Crown to dissent from this course. I made orders accordingly, and indicated that I would later give reasons. These are those reasons.
	


Proceedings before the Children’s Court


	
	GW was arrested in respect of the charge contrary to the Graffiti Control Act on 5 May 2014. Her first appearance before the Children’s Court was on 6 May 2014 on which occasion the matter was adjourned for plea or mention on 16 May 2014. On that date a plea of not guilty was entered and brief service orders made. On 27 June 2014 the matter was again before the Children’s Court and was set down for hearing on 19 August 2014.
	
	
	On 19 August 2014 Ms Caufield of the Aboriginal Legal Service appeared for the young person. There did not appear to be any factual matter in issue. At p 3 line 7 of the transcript the following is attributed to Ms Caufield:
	


“Yes Your Honour. Your Honour I can indicate at the outset, I’ve spoken with my friend and the matter can proceed by handing up the brief, there’s no issue that the offence occurred, the issue is doli incapax…”


	
	The police prosecutor tendered over objection the bail report in respect of the young person in an attempt to negate beyond reasonable doubt the issue of doli incapax. It is the tender of that bail report that appeared to me to be the substantial issue, or at least one of the more substantial issues on the appeal.
	
	
	Before going to that issue I will need to address the facts. The material in the brief that was tendered before the Children’s Court, and therefore constitutes the material before me on the appeal, entitles me to find the following beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 2 May 2014 Constables Maslen and Calabretta were called to the Dubbo Square shopping centre in Macquarie Street, Dubbo. Macquarie Street is the main street of Dubbo’s central business district. They spoke to Mr Nathan Coles, a security officer. Police were shown a wooden bench with graffiti that had been placed there by some type of thick marking pen. Constable Maslen was shown some CCTV security footage. She was able to recognise the appellant on that footage from previous dealings with the young person. The footage clearly showed the appellant leaning down towards the bench with what appears to be some sort of pen. One of the pieces of graffiti observed by the officer was the name “G…… [first name of the appellant] W”, which is the name of this appellant. Photographs were taken of the damage. Those photographs are part of the Crown tender bundle on the appeal.
	
	
	Also part of the Crown tender bundle on the appeal was a statement from Constable Smart of Dubbo who arrested the appellant in respect of an alleged breach of bail on the afternoon of 5 May 2014. When she was processed in respect of that matter the issue of the graffiti was the subject of a “COPS” warning. The officer then completed the charge in respect of the Graffiti matter. The young person had previously declined to be interviewed about the alleged breach of bail. I presume the officer took the view that she would do likewise in respect of the Graffiti allegation. In the circumstances, this would have been an entirely appropriate assumption for the officer to make.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness, the tender bundle also contained a statement from Danielle Kirkwood, the contents of which indicate that the chair which was damaged was the property of the Dubbo Square Centre, that cleaners were required to clean the chair and that nobody had permission to graffiti or damage the chair.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is clearly established beyond reasonable doubt that but for the issue of doli incapax the young person was guilty of the offence with which she was charged. It was not argued otherwise, either before the Children’s Court or on the appeal.
	


Doli Incapax


	
	Section 5 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides that a child under 10 is conclusively presumed not to be guilty of an offence. There is no statutory provision relating to children between 10 and 14, however, the common law is that there is a rebuttable presumption that children aged between 10 and 14 are incapable of coming a crime because of a lack of understanding of right and wrong and consequentially a lack of mens rea.
	
	
	In BP v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 174 Hodgson JA (Adams & Johnson JJ agreeing) said at [27]-[29]:
	


“The common law concerning the criminal responsibility of children has been modified in New South Wales by s 5 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (which provides for a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 years can be guilty of an offence), but not otherwise. Accordingly, as regards a child between 10 and 14 years, there remains a presumption that such a child is doli incapax, that is incapable of committing a crime because of lack of understanding of the difference between right and wrong, and consequential lack of mens rea. It is clear that when a child between 10 and 14 years is accused of a crime, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the child did the act charged, accompanied by the necessary mental element, but also that, when doing it, he or she knew it was seriously wrong, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief: The Queen v M (1977) 16 SASR 589; C v DPP [1996] 1 AC 1 at 38; R v CRH, NSWCCA, 18/12/96; R v ALH (2003) 6 VR 276.

[28] The child must know that the act is seriously wrong as a matter of morality, or according to the ordinary principles of reasonable persons, not that it is a crime or contrary to law: Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, The Queen v M.

[29] It has been said that evidence to prove the child’s guilty knowledge must not be the mere proof of doing the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong the act may be: C v DPP at 38. This was said in CRH to represent the common law of Australia; but it was strongly disapproved by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v ALH at [20] and [85]-[86]. However, on either view, the circumstances of the offence, such as concern to avoid detection, may be some evidence of knowledge; although, if the concern is consistent with the child thinking that the act is merely naughty, this will carry little weight.”


	
	Lord Lowry (Lords Jauncey, Harwich, Ackner and Browne-Wilkinson agreeing) in Re C (A Minor) [1996] 1 AC 1 at [18] said
	


“…The doctrine is summarised in Archbold (1993) vol 1 para 1-96:

‘…at common law a child under 14 years is presumed not to have reached the age of discretion and to be doli incapax; but this presumption may be rebutted by strong and pregnant evidence of a mischievous disposition….Between 10 and 14 years a child is presumed not to know the difference between right and wrong and therefore to be incapable of committing a crime because of lack of mens rea…Wrong means gravely wrong, seriously wrong, evil or morally wrong’.”


	
	Later, his Lordship said at [29]:
	


“The material which Mr Robertson put before your Lordships convinces me that the presumption is still universally recognised as an effective doctrine which the Government has recently reaffirmed to be, in the Government’s view, part of the criminal law. The imperfections which have been attributed to that doctrine cannot, in my view, provide a justification for saying that the presumption is no longer part of our law…”


	
	At [64]-[65] his Lordship said:
	


“A long and uncontradicted line of authority makes two propositions clear. The first is that the prosecution must prove that the child defendant did the act charged and that when doing that act he knew it was wrong as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or childish mischief. The criminal standard of proof applies. What is required has been variously expressed, as in Blackstone, ‘strong and clear beyond all doubt or contradiction’ or in B v R (1958) 44 Cr App R 1, 3 per Lord Parker CJ, ‘It has often been put in this way, that…guilty knowledge must be proved and the evidence to that effect must be clear and beyond all possibility of doubt’. No doubt, the emphatic tone of some of the directions was due to the court’s anxiety to prevent merely naughty children from being convicted of crimes and in a sterner age to protect them from the draconian consequences of conviction.

The second clearly established proposition is that evidence to prove the defendant’s guilty knowledge, as defined above, must not be the mere proof of the doing of the act charged however horrifying or obviously wrong that act may be. As Erle J said in Reg v Smith (1945) 1 Cox CC 260:

‘…a guilty knowledge that he was doing wrong – must be proved by the evidence, and cannot be presumed from the mere commission of the act. You are to determine from a review of the evidence whether it is satisfactorily proven that at the time he fired the rick (if you should be of the opinion he did fire it) he had a guilty knowledge that he was committing a crime’.


	
	His Lordship went on to say at [68]:
	


“The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge. The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what the defendant said or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty mind…”.

Rebutting doli incapax by proof of previous findings of guilt


	
	Again I make reference to the speech of Lord Lowry in Re C (A Minor). His Lordship dealt with the issue of the prosecution being able to rely on previous convictions or previous record at paragraph [53] and continuing in the speech. Clearly enough his Lordship concluded – see for example paragraphs [55]-[56] - that the previous convictions are admissible to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. However, as Lord Lowry observed at [55], “One would, of course, have to know the nature of the earlier convictions before accepting that they might properly prove a guilty mind in relation to offence charged”.
	
	
	Newman J in Ivers (by his tutor Ivers) v Griffiths & Anor BC9803397 NSWSC unrep 22.5.1998 said:
	


“In the instant case the facts relating to the commission of offences contrary to s 114(1)(b) and s 188 of the Crimes Act were not in dispute. The only matter raised in defence was the presumption of doli incapax. Accordingly, the tender of the plaintiff’s past record was not done for the purposes of proving the commission of the crimes in question but merely in rebuttal of the presumption of doli incapax”.

As Lord Lowry pointed out in the passing in ‘C’ cited above, evidence of previous convictions can be admitted in instances where the accused child has put his character in issue or attacks the character of prosecution witnesses or if the earlier convictions come within the similar facts rule. His stricture on the admission of such evidence was in a setting of a case where the primary facts were in dispute”.


	
	Ultimately it seems that on the authorities it is now uncontroversial that the record of previous findings of guilt are admissible to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. Mr Day for the appellant in the matter presently under consideration did not argue to the contrary. His issue was the manner in which the previous record of the appellant was placed before the Children’s Court.
	
	
	I was careful to use the expression “findings of guilt” rather than conviction as s 14(1)(a) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides that in New South Wales a person under the age of 16 cannot be convicted of a matter before the Children’s Court.
	
	
	Further, in New South Wales and the other jurisdictions where the Uniform Evidence Act applies the prejudice of which Lord Lowry spoke in Re C (A Minor) is overcome to a very significant extent, if not completely, by s 136 of the Evidence Act, 1995 that provides:
	


“The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or

(b) be misleading or confusing.”


	
	In a matter where the prosecution seek to lead evidence of prior record or findings of guilt any prejudice to the young person is overcome by the court applying s 136 of the Evidence Act, 1995 and limiting that evidence solely to the issue of doli incapax. In this regard it is to be noted that almost all criminal matters involving young persons are heard to finality in the Children’s Court with only the serious children’s indictable offences being dealt with in the higher courts on indictment.
	


The matter presently under consideration


	
	As the law stands at the present, a young person, even one against whom findings of guilt have been previously recorded in respect of other matters, is not required to give any notice that the prosecution is going to be put to proof on the issue of doli incapax. I note that this is not the first conviction appeal that I have heard at Dubbo (where I have presided on a permanent basis since November 2011) where this issue has arisen. It seems that the prosecution may have had some notice in this matter (see transcript Children’s Court proceedings p 4, lines 32-3).
	
	
	Upon the prosecution becoming aware that the issue of doli incapax was a live one, the police prosecutor tendered the bail report. A bail report is not a record of findings of guilt per se, but a history of all appearances before a court, regardless of the outcome. Speaking from experience of some almost seven years as a Magistrate sitting in the Local Court and also routinely sitting in the Children’s Court in metropolitan and several rural centres, those bail reports can be cumbersome. It is often the case that those bail reports are how this court is informed of criminal history in sentence appeals from the Local Court and the Children’s Court. It takes some time and experience to be able to successfully negotiate some of those documents. I infer from the transcript of the proceedings before the Children’s Court, although it was not made particularly clear, that the bail report was not served as part of the brief.
	
	
	The learned Children’s Magistrate admitted the bail report over objection. The learned Magistrate said at p 4 (line 30 and continuing);
	


“…The prosecution seek to tender into evidence a document identified from the bar table as a bail report. The basis or the purpose of the tender at least as the Court understands it is having received prior notification of the defence likely to be raised by the young person. But the document would act in some form of rebuttal so far as the identified defence or defences are concerned. Counsel for the young person objects to the tender of the document on a number of bases, first of all conceding that it may meet the criteria of a business record. Additionally submitting that the document per se could be visited as being a hearsay document, it is non-compliable with the provisions of s 178 of the Evidence Act, so far as a number of shortcomings of the document are concerned and in additional mindful of the accused in this matter is a young person that he/she should not be in a position any worse that the present situation by virtue of the Court visiting or having regard to the documents the subject of the tender.

Obviously the purpose of the tender is not to place the young person in any position of disadvantage. The Court would determine that the nature of the document probably meets the criteria of a business record, its only basis or only purpose is to rebut what has been flagged as a possible defence or defences to the action against. On that basis I propose to admit the document”.


	
	Given my conclusions above about the use of the record of past findings of guilt to negative doli incapax, I take no issue whatsoever with the court per se using that record. However, it is the manner in which that material that was presented to the court that led me to the very reluctant conclusion that the evidence should be rejected. Once the evidence of the past record was excluded, there was nothing available to the prosecution to negate doli incapax to the criminal standard of proof.
	
	
	Section 178 of the Evidence Act, 1995 relevantly provides:
	


“Convictions, acquittals and other judicial proceedings

(1)       This section applies to the following facts:

(a)   the conviction or acquittal before or by an applicable court of a person charged with an offence,

(b)   the sentencing of a person to any punishment or pecuniary penalty by an applicable court,

(c)   an order by an applicable court,

(d)   the pendency or existence at any time before an applicable court of a civil or criminal proceeding.

(2)    Evidence of a fact to which this section applies may be given by a certificate signed by a judge, a magistrate or registrar or other proper officer of the applicable court:

(a)   showing the fact, or purporting to contain particulars, of the record, indictment, conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding in question, and

(b)   stating the time and place of the conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding, and

(c)   stating the title of the applicable court.

(3)       A certificate given under this section showing a conviction, acquittal, sentence or order is also evidence of the particular offence or matter in respect of which the conviction, acquittal, sentence or order was had, passed or made, if stated in the certificate.

(4)       A certificate given under this section showing the pendency or existence of a proceeding is also evidence of the particular nature and occasion, or ground and cause, of the proceeding, if stated in the certificate.

(5)       A certificate given under this section purporting to contain particulars of a record, indictment, conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding is also evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

(6)    In this section:

‘acquittal’ includes the dismissal of the charge in question by an applicable court.

‘applicable court’ means an Australian court or a foreign court.

Note. Section 91 excludes evidence of certain judgments and convictions.”


	
	Had the record of previous findings of guilt recorded against the young person been in a form that complied with the provisions of s 178 of the Evidence Act, 1995 I would have had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal. Indeed, had the material complied with s 178 it is difficult to perceive of a valid submission that could be made to ground the rejection of the material relating to previous findings of guilt that had been recorded against the appellant.
	
	
	The prosecution must have been on notice that there was at least the possibility of doli incapax noting that the prosecution case against the appellant was otherwise unassailable. It would not have been particularly difficult to obtain the material in a form that complied with s 178 of the Evidence Act, 1995.
	
	
	Prima facie the bail report may well be a business record. However, as I have already indicated the documents themselves can be cumbersome. The issue of whether or not the bail report was a business report was not argued before me with the Crown essentially conceding the matter on the point that I have already decided on the manner in which the previous record was placed before the Court.
	
	
	However, even if the bail report is a business record (a point on which I do not purport to make a decision) there needs to be compliance with s 171 of the Evidence Act, 1995. As Odgers says in his text “Uniform Evidence Act” 11th Edition at p 324:
	


“Evidence of a fact that is ‘to be proved in relation to a document or thing’ under s 69, may (in accordance with Div 2 of Part 4.6) be given by a person permitted under s 171 to give such evidence – by affidavit, or if the evidence relates to a public document (see Dictionary) by written statement”.


	
	In the matter presently under consideration no such affidavit or statement accompanied the service of the bail report, or if it was, there is no evidence of that before me on the appeal.
	
	
	For these reasons, the evidence of and relating to the contents of the bail report is excluded. Accordingly, there is no other evidence upon which the prosecution can rely to rebut doli incapax to the criminal standard. Therefore, the appeal must be upheld, the finding of guilt and all consequential orders quashed.
	


Additional comments and recommendations


	
	As once observed by the House of Lords in dealing with a technical point in an appeal concerned with an offence of dishonesty, words to the effect of, “but for this technical point, the appellant would otherwise be singularly unencumbered by merit”. Those comments are more than apposite to the case of the young person GW. Although the bail report that was tendered before the learned Magistrate was not before me as part of the appeal, it is apparent that the young person has had several appearances before the Children’s Court. As much is obvious by the fact that she was initially apprehended by Constable Smart on 5 May 2014 in respect of an alleged breach of bail in another matter then pending before the Children’s Court.
	
	
	As the learned Magistrate observed at p 6 lines 36-7 of the transcript of proceedings before the Children’s Court:
	


“The case for the prosecution is essentially comprised within documentary material additional upon that material it has been identified as a bail report type document. That document on its face would indicate that Ms [W] has interfaced with the criminal justice system on many occasions up until the or about the time of this offending behaviour 2 May 2014…”


	
	In this regard I note that the appeal to the House of Lords in Re C (A Minor) came before their Lordships as the court below certified as a point of law of general public importance expressed as:
	


“Whether there continues to be a presumption that a child between the ages of 10 and 14 is doli incapax and, if so, whether that presumption can only be rebutted by clear positive evidence that he knew that this act was seriously wrong, such evidence consisting merely in the evidence of the acts amounting to the offence itself”.


	
	Lord Lowry in Re C (A Minor) at paragraph [71] of his speech said:
	


“My Lords, I have reached without difficulty the conclusion that both parts of the certified question should be answered “YES”…Forty years have passed since the article by Professor Glanville Williams and the years between have witnessed many criticisms and suggested remedies, but no vigorous or reasoned defence of the presumption. I believe that the time has come to examine further a doctrine which appears to have been inconsistently applied and which is certainly capable of producing inconsistent results, according to the way in which courts treat the presumption and depending on the evidence to rebut it which is available in each case”.


	
	Lord Jauncey in some brief additional comments in concurring with Lord Lowry said at [2]:
	


“…There must be many youthful offenders under the age of 14 who are very well aware that what they are doing is seriously wrong”.


	
	With unfeigned respect to Lord Jauncey, his Lordship is stating the obvious. The issue of doli incapax can, as in this present appeal of GW lead to unfairness to the community. In Re C (A Minor) at [60] in dealing with the written submissions from the respondent (prosecution) Lord Lowry said:
	


“…His (Henriques QC) written case contained submissions based on the current educational standards of children and on the ever earlier onset of their physical and psychological maturity as witnessed by the recent statutory abolition of the irrebuttable common law presumption that boys under 14 are incapable of offences involving sexual intercourse on their own part…The written case also listed examples of legislative and judicial changes of attitude towards young children called as witnesses…”


	
	As the learned Magistrate in the matter presently under consideration observed, the bail report demonstrated that the young person had “interfaced” with the criminal justice system a number of times. I am aware of situations where several teachers from a school were required to attend court to give evidence for the prosecution on this issue of doli incapax, thereby depleting the school of several members of teaching staff for the day or the better part thereof.
	
	
	Drawing on several years’ experience as a Magistrate and several years as a judge hearing appeals from the Children’s Court it seems to me that the issue of doli incapax requires urgent attention by the legislature. As the law stands at present I am very firmly of the opinion that it is simply too open to abuse. As previously stated, as the law stands at the moment there is no requirement for the young person or his/her representative to put the court or the prosecution on notice that doli incapax is going to be an issue at any hearing of the matter.
	
	
	For the reasons enunciated by the learned Queen’s Counsel for the respondent in Re C (A Minor) as set out in the speech of Lord Lowry at [60] doli incapax ought be abrogated by statute, or at the very least the age reduced from 14 years of age to 12 years of age.
	
	
	This is not the first time I have made strident recommendations in this regard. It is entirely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether he wishes to send these recommendations to the Director of the Criminal Law Review Division.
	
	
	However, I recommend in the strongest of terms that there at least be a requirement for the legal representative of a young person (or if unrepresented, the young person themselves) to indicate at the time of the plea of not guilty being entered as to whether doli incapax is an issue.
	
	
	Further, I recommend that if the law remains as it is - ie. there remains a rebuttable presumption that children aged between 10 and 14 years are doli incapax – then there be legislative change in order that if the young person has been found guilty of an offence then the formal criminal history (sometimes known as the fingerprint report) be admissible in evidence to rebut the presumption of doli incapax without any further evidentiary requirement.
	
	
	In this regard, it would not be difficult to implement a procedure whereby the criminal history formed part of the brief of evidence served on the young person or the young person’s legal representatives. As I recommended above, once served that record would be admissible without further evidentiary requirement but limited to the issue of doli incapax. Alternatively, provision could (and should) be easily made to allow for the prosecution to call evidence in reply, with an adjournment of the hearing, if necessary.

		29 May 2015",2015-03-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765991,PS v R [2015] NSWCCA 20,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	R A HULME J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 28 August 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty in Tamworth Local Court to the offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The Applicant asked that two offences of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years be taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced by Judge Charteris in the District Court on 6 December 2013 to a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing 2 July 2013 and expiring 1 January 2017 with an additional term of three years expiring 1 January 2020.
	
	
	The Applicant appeals against the sentence on one ground only:
	


   The judge erred in failing properly to take into account the applicant’s mental condition in determining the sentence.

Facts


	
	The victim was born on 14 April 2007 and at the time of the offence between May and June 2013 she was six years and one or two months old. Her mother is the natural younger sister of the Applicant.
	
	
	On an undetermined night in May or June 2013, the Applicant injected himself with a quantity of home-made alcohol and cola using a syringe. Later that night, he went to his sister's home. She resided there with her daughter, the Applicant’s niece. The Applicant sat outside talking with friends.
	
	
	After some time the Applicant went inside where he found the victim asleep on a lounge. He picked her up, carried her to a caravan in the backyard and placed her on a bed in that caravan. He pulled the bed covers up over her and he then got into the bed himself under the bed covers.
	
	
	The Applicant then placed his hand down the child's pants and touched her on the outside of her vagina. That matter is the first offence included on the Form 1.  
	
	
	Having placed his hand on the outside of the child's vagina, he removed his hand and moved down the bed, placing his head in the area of the child's groin. He removed her pants and started licking her on the outside and then the inside of her vagina for somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. That was the offence for which he was sentenced. When the child told him to stop, he did so.
	
	
	He then moved up behind her. He took hold of her hand and put it down the front of his own pants, causing her hand to come into some contact with his penis. That act of indecent assault is the second matter on the Form 1.
	
	
	The child then removed her hand from the Applicant’s pants. She got up from the bed and told the Applicant that she wanted to go. He told her not to tell anyone what had happened, and the child went inside the house.
	
	
	About one month later, the Applicant approached his younger sister, the mother of the victim. He confessed to her that he had something to tell her and later said, ""I touched X"", naming the child. He was asked by his sister how he had touched the victim, and he said, ""with my tongue"". Later that day the sister contacted police.
	
	
	An investigation was commenced. The Applicant was interviewed and made full admissions. He was then arrested and charged.
	
	
	Prior to his arrest, the police had interviewed the victim and she disclosed what had happened to her. She told police that the Applicant had touched her with his tongue and she was able to mark a diagram in the area of the vulva saying that was where she had been touched.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant was born on 16 September 1972. He was therefore aged 40 years at the time of his offending. He had no convictions in New South Wales. He had a number of convictions in Queensland but they were all for relatively minor offences. He only had one prison sentence imposed for a three month period and that sentence was suspended.
	
	
	He has had a long history of abuse of alcohol and drugs and, to some extent, his criminal record in Queensland evidences that.
	
	
	The Applicant had a troubled upbringing. He was the second in a family of one boy and three girls. His younger sister, the victim’s mother, was born two years after him.
	
	
	Both parents were heavy drinkers. The father was very violent and bashed the Applicant’s mother violently and regularly. The children were also subject to beatings. The Applicant used to wet his bed and was severely punished for doing so. The beatings of him ceased when he was 14 years of age and big enough to challenge his father.
	
	
	He left home at the age of 15. He had a brief period of stable accommodation and found local employment. He spent most of his life in Queensland but never stayed long in one place. At the time of the offending he had lived in Tamworth for four years. He and his younger sister were always close. He would try to protect her from his father’s violence.
	
	
	He had learning difficulties and was transferred from a mainstream high school to a special school in Toowoomba because he was slow to learn. He cannot read much and his writing is very basic. He has had a number of labouring and truck-driving jobs as well as working on prawn trawlers. For the four years he has been in Tamworth he has been on a disability pension which he believes was granted to him because of his alcoholism and drug dependence.
	
	
	He has had several relationships although the longest was only for five months.
	
	
	He has been admitted to Tamworth Base Hospital several times for psychiatric reasons. Those included alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideas in July 2012, and mental and behavioural disorders in October 2012 due to acute intoxication, psychoactive substances and suicidal ideation. In November 2012 he threatened suicide by jumping from a roof.
	
	
	Since admission into custody he has been on an antidepressant and has complied with that treatment. He was first placed in a safe cell because he felt suicidal.
	
	
	In early years he abused cannabis and amphetamines. In recent times that has involved using amphetamines intravenously for four to five days and then taking cannabis “to come down”.
	
	
	He started drinking alcohol when he was only 11. From the age of 14 he was a heavy drinker. The psychologist who examined him said that the length and severity of his substance abuse history would be expected to have caused physical and cognitive impairment.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Sentencing Judge found that the nature of his criminal record entitled him to some leniency. However, his Honour said that the two offences on the Form 1 aggravated the penalty to be imposed. His Honour noted the Victim Impact Statement relating to the child prepared by the victim’s mother.
	
	
	His Honour noted the Record of Interview and the expressions of guilt and regret made in that interview together with the admissions made. His Honour said that the Applicant was entitled to credit for his frankness with the police and for his confession to his sister initially which brought the matter to light.
	
	
	His Honour noted the psychological report from Ms Anna Robilliard. His Honour detailed many of the matters contained in that report. His Honour accepted Ms Robilliard’s opinion and described her report as helpful.
	
	
	His Honour noted the evidence given at the sentencing hearing by the Applicant which his Honour described as frank and showing insight. His Honour was comfortably satisfied that the Applicant much regretted his conduct. His Honour accepted the Applicant’s evidence and said that he thought that the Applicant was very genuine in his concern as to working out why he engaged in the conduct.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the age of the victim was an aggravating matter and there was a breach of trust between an uncle and a child but he did not see how that would necessarily result in an aggravation of the penalty. He found that the criminality was within the broad middle range of offences that s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) covered. His Honour said that he would reduce the sentence by 35% to give weight to the early plea of guilty and his confession and co-operation with authorities.
	
	
	In relation to his mental state generally his Honour said this:
	


Various psychological testing was administered to him. The offender returned a very low ranking. In the view of the psychologist his total IQ was in the extremely low range with a percentile rating of one, meaning that he was in the bottom one per cent of the population. I have seen the offender give evidence before the Court. He had somewhat of a dull effect. I would not have placed him however in the bottom one per cent but I accept that was the conclusion of the psychologist from the results that she had obtained. He was able to answer the questions asked of him, I thought, in evidence but I do not dispute that he would have some cognitive impairment. The psychologist arrived at her opinion for the reasons that she has given. The IQ test, she noted, was not diagnostic of brain damage but the history of alcohol and drug abuse over years would make it very likely that he suffers a substance related brain damage. The additional effect of alcohol and drugs has a particularly damaging impact on the behaviour of individuals with pre existing cognitive impairment. He has a well entrenched pattern of behavioural disregulation and suicidal ideation when highly intoxicated.

…

I accept Ms Parker's submission that the offender has a reduced or impaired cognitive functioning. As I have already indicated, having seen him in the witness box, I thought he was being honest with the Court. However I would not have placed his cognitive capacity as low as the psychologist has done. It is urged upon me that, because of his cognitive impairment, his case is not a good vehicle for reflection of general deterrence. I have regard to the principles of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. Of course, as has been observed in other cases, although the case might not be a good vehicle for general deterrence, other purposes of sentencing may carry greater weight including the need to protect others from the offender.

…

It is urged upon me that I will conclude on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend. I cannot be satisfied of that on the balance of probabilities, nor could I be satisfied that he is likely to re-offend on the balance of probabilities. The Court simply does not know. I can draw inferences from the evidence but in my view it would be speculative to make a finding. I take into account his relatively good record. I accept he has prospects of rehabilitation because of his insight and his seeking that his problem be addressed. (emphasis added)


	
	His Honour found special circumstances by reason of the Applicant’s being in protection, that he had never been to prison previously and that he had some cognitive dysfunction. He said that the community would be advantaged if the Applicant were given a longer period of supervision than would be the case absent a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour said that the starting point for the offence should be a period of ten years imprisonment.
	


The Applicant’s submissions


	
	The Applicant’s counsel drew particular attention to the highlighted passages in the extracts in [32] above and then to the final sentence in the second of those passages. He submitted that the Sentencing Judge did not further address the question of the weight to be given to general deterrence and did not ultimately state whether general deterrence was given lesser weight or whether protection of society was given more weight in determining the sentence. He further submitted, however, that the balance of the remarks set out suggest that increased weight was given to the protection of society.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that to the extent that the Remarks of the Sentencing Judge implied that any reduction in the weight given to general deterrence would invariably be offset by an increase in weight for protection of society there was an error of principle disclosed. Reference was made to R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68.
	
	
	It was submitted that a reduced weight for general deterrence was warranted by reason of the Applicant’s cognitive and intellectual problems but there was no basis in the evidence for increased weight to be given to protection of society. The nature of the Applicant’s mental condition, it was said, was not inherently such as to give rise to a significant risk of further offending. There had been no sexual or violent offences in the past.
	


Consideration


	
	I do not consider that, on any fair reading of the part of his Honour’s Remarks complained of, those Remarks could be seen as implying that any reduction in the weight given to general deterrence would invariably be offset by an increase in weight for protection of society. His Honour said only that other purposes of sentencing “may” carry greater weight. To the extent that error is asserted on that paragraph, I reject the assertion.
	
	
	Nor can it be determined from his Honour’s Remarks if he considered that the Applicant’s case was a good vehicle for general deterrence. However, it would have been open to his Honour to conclude that it remained a good vehicle notwithstanding the intellectual and cognitive difficulties the Applicant had.
	
	
	In Zaharos v R [2008] NSWCCA 336 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said:
	


[13]   The sentencing judge rejected a submission that the applicant’s mental illness was causally connected to the commission of the offence. His Honour did not accept the diagnosis of Dr Nielssen, it being apparent that the account of the events which the applicant told the psychiatrist was at odds with the agreed facts placed before his Honour. In particular his Honour rejected the suggestion by Dr Nielssen that the applicant was acting “in response to a defect of reason in the form of persecutory beliefs arising from acute symptoms of mental illness” and further rejected the suggestion that the applicant did not know that what he was doing was “morally wrong.”

[14]   To my mind the finding which his Honour made was soundly based. Where mental illness has played a part in the offending, the need for general deterrence may be diminished: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. However, where an offender understands what he is doing and the gravity of his actions, general deterrence may be of continuing significance: Wright at 51; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [252]-[254]. The issue is further discussed in R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36].


	
	In the present case his Honour did not reach a conclusion that what may be described as the Applicant’s mental issues played a part in the offending. No causal link in that regard was identified in Ms Robilliard’s report.
	
	
	The evidence disclosed that the Applicant was very intoxicated at the time of the commission of the offence – he had injected himself with 42 proof alcohol. The Sentencing Judge found:
	


However he was not so affected that he was not alert to the fact that what he was doing was seriously wrong - he told the little child not to tell anyone about it.


	
	It may also be added that when the child told him to stop doing what he was doing he did so. Further, when he first informed his sister of what happened and subsequently the police, he was able to remember the details of what he did.
	
	
	It was open to the Sentencing Judge, therefore, to form the view that the Applicant’s mental issues were not responsible for his offending and that general deterrence was to be given some weight in the matter.
	
	
	In any event, as far as protection of society was concerned his Honour was unable to be satisfied one way or the other whether the Applicant was likely to reoffend. Whilst his criminal record disclosed no evidence of prior crimes involving sexual violence he volunteered in his ERISP the following:
	


I feel real bad for her [his sister]. I told her there this morning, I feel angry. And I feel I’m gonna kill myself. She said, You don’t have to do that, go and get help, you need help before you do rape a kid … you know, these girls go past and I get these urges. You can’t touch em. Some of them you don’t even know if they’re the right age, or they’re under age, ‘cause their breasts are that big.

It may be accepted that when asked by the police if he had had urges like that before he said that he had not. Nevertheless, the information volunteered by him needs to be considered on the issue of the likelihood of reoffending and protection of society.


	
	Although the Applicant’s counsel suggested that the Sentencing Judge’s Remarks in [32] above suggested that his Honour may have increased the weight to be given to the protection of society, counsel frankly accepted that there was doubt about whether his Honour had done so. The suggestion appeared to be that the sentence itself was sufficiently harsh, particularly the starting point, that his Honour must have done so.
	
	
	Although viewed from the perspective of a first offence of this nature, the starting point for the sentence might be thought to be high, the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period provide indications of the seriousness of the offence. The child was not only very young but the Applicant by his relationship to her was in a position of trust which was sorely abused. His Honour made a considerable adjustment by the finding of special circumstances to reduce the statutory ratio to 53.85%.
	
	
	Further, there is nothing in his Honour’s Remarks, apart from his inability to come to a view about likely re-offending, that suggest any increased weight was given to protection of society nor, if he did so, such an approach demonstrated error. Protection of society was a consideration for the Sentencing judge, and the weight to be accorded to it was within his Honour’s discretion.
	
	
	During the sentencing hearing the Applicant’s counsel (not counsel who appeared on the appeal) submitted that the Applicant’s intellectual disability should result in general deterrence being given less weight. The Sentencing Judge asked if protection of society should get more weight, and counsel replied:
	


Well I think that has to be your Honour’s primary objective in sentencing this offender for this type of offence.


	
	In my view, no error has been demonstrated.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal granted.

2.   Appeal dismissed.

2765992,Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hamill J.
	
	
	HAMILL J: Raymond Sabongi (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by Judge Hoy SC on 7 March 2014.
	


The charges and sentences imposed


	
	The sentences followed the applicant’s plea of guilty to four counts on an indictment relating to offences committed in the central business district of Sydney over a thirty minute period late on the evening of 3 July 2010 (“the 2010 offences”). Judge Hoy SC also sentenced the applicant in relation to five domestic violence offences committed between June 2007 and March 2008 (“the domestic violence offences”). Sentencing for the domestic violence offences arose because the 2010 offences constituted a breach of a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Act”). That bond had been imposed by the Local Court in relation to the domestic violence offences. Judge Hoy SC determined that the good behaviour bond should be revoked under s 98(2)(c) of the Act. A faint submission that his Honour might properly have taken no action on the breach was not pressed.
	
	
	There was a substantial passage of time between the offences – in particular the domestic violence offences – and the imposition of sentence. The delay is a matter of some significance and was emphasised in the applicant’s submissions.
	
	
	The offences for which the applicant stood to be sentenced were, first, the four offences committed on the evening of 3 July 2010:
	



	
	Count 1 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s 59 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) – maximum penalty 5 years)
	
	
	Count 2 Affray (s 93 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) – maximum penalty 10 years)
	
	
	Count 4 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company (s 59 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) – maximum penalty of 7 years)
	
	
	Count 7 Recklessly cause grievous bodily harm in company (s 35(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period 5 years)
	



	
	Then there were the five domestic violence offences:
	



	
	Sequence 10 Assault in June 2007
	
	
	Sequence 11 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 21 July 2007
	
	
	Sequence 5 Assault in September 2007
	
	
	Sequence 13 Assault on 31 December 2007
	
	
	Sequence 2 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm in March 2008
	



	
	The domestic violence offences were dealt with in the Local Court. The common assault charges (Sequence 5, 10 and 13) had a maximum penalty of two years if dealt with on indictment (s 61 Crimes Act) but (at that time) there was a jurisdictional limit of 12 months if dealt with summarily. Sequences 2 and 11 were subject to a maximum penalty of 5 years (s 59 Crimes Act) and a jurisdictional limit of 2 years. As to the jurisdictional limit, see s 268 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The maximum accumulated penalty for matters dealt with summarily is 5 years: s 58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
	
	
	Giving full weight to the youth of the applicant and his lack of prior convictions, it was appropriate for the Magistrate to impose a bond for the domestic violence offences. However, in view of their seriousness, it was a lenient disposition of the case. The bond commenced on 5 December 2008 and was due to expire on 4 December 2010, five months after the commission of the 2010 offences.
	
	
	Associated with the domestic violence offences, there was also a stalking charge in relation to the same victim. This was disposed of at the same time and the applicant was sentenced in the Local Court to a period of community service. On 14 February 2014 the District Court quashed the community service order and imposed a $1000 fine. Except for its relevance as part of the applicant’s criminal history for offences of violence, that penalty has no further relevance to the current proceedings.
	
	
	For all of these offences the learned sentencing Judge imposed a total effective sentence of 8 years with a total effective non-parole period of 6 years. This was achieved through individual sentences relating to each of the offences partially accumulated and partially concurrent. All offences attracted a fixed term sentence with the exception of count 7 where a non-parole period was specified. The domestic violence offences attracted a total effective fixed term of 18 months, 6 months of which was subsumed by the sentence imposed in relation to the remaining accounts. In other words, there was an accumulation of 12 months between the two sets of offences.
	
	
	The following individual sentences were imposed:
	


Sequence 10 – fixed term of 3 months from 5 February 2014 to 4 May 2014

Sequences 5 and 11 – concurrent fixed terms of 9 months from 5 March 2014 to 4 December 2014

Sequence 13 – fixed term of 12 months from 5 June 2014 to 4 June 2015

Sequence 2 – fixed term of 12 months from 5 August 2014 to 4 August 2015

Count 1: fixed term of 12 months from 5 February 2015 to 4 February 2016

Count 4: fixed term of 2 years from 5 August 2015 to 4 August 2017

Count 2: fixed term 2 years from 5 August 2015 to 4 August 2017

Count 7: a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 5 February 2016 and expiring 4 February 2020 with a balance of term of 2 years from 14 February 2020 to 13 February 2022.


	
	The commencement dates of the sentences were adjusted immediately after sentence was imposed when the parties brought to his Honour’s attention the fact that the applicant had spent 9 days in custody from the date of his arrest until the date of his release to bail (14 July 2010 to 23 July 2010).
	


The Facts


	
	The facts were largely agreed. Exhibit B was a document entitled “Crown Facts” and, with one exception, these facts were not disputed. However, the one exception was a matter of significance and was emphasised in the submissions of counsel for the applicant.
	
	
	The agreed facts were as follows:
	


“The Offender has pleaded guilty to 4 offences arising from two incidents in the city of Sydney on 3 July 2010:

1.   Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm on Henrique Gomez;

2.   Reckless infliction of Grievous Bodily Harm on Ryan Riley;

3.   Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm to Wade Riley; and

4.   Affray.

The first incident was at the Capitan Torres Restaurant in Liverpool Street at approximately 11.30pm. The Offender was together with Mitchell Temaipi and Gildo Zenairi. Temaipi urinated on a door of the restaurant. When staff came outside to remonstrate there was a discussion between the staff of the restaurant and the Offender's group. Without warning or provocation the Offender punched a waiter, Henrique Gomez. The punch is what is described as an ""overhand"" punch. Mr Gomez suffered bruising to his eyes and nose. [Count 1]

The second incident occurred at approximately 11.55pm in Kent Street outside Wilson's Parking. The Offender initiated a fight with Ryan Riley, Wade Riley, Clay Riley, Evan Hill and Nicholas Burton. These young men had been out celebrating a ""bucks' night"". They did not in any way initiate or encourage the assault.

Four of the young men were standing outside the parking station waiting for the remaining member of the group, Evan Hill, to attend. They were approached by the Offenders. As he saw that the Offenders appeared to be aggressive Wade Riley said ""Please mate we do not want a fight. We just want to go home."" The Offender pointed at him and said ""You've got five seconds to run away.""

As Wade Riley stepped back he said ""Calm down. We do not want to fight."" The Offender punched him to the left side of his face causing him to fall. Wade Riley was suffered two chipped teeth, bruising to his upper body and left eye. [Count 4]

Ryan Riley ran to assist his brother and punched the Offender. He was quickly overcome by the Offender and was punched and kicked by him a number of times. The Offender pushed him into the roadway. He was struck on the hip and shoulder by a car. The Offender then continued to fight with Ryan Riley. The other two offenders, Temaipi and Zenairi, assaulted the other members of the group. [Count 2]

Evan Hill returned from the carpark. He attempted to use a Vodka bottle as a weapon. He lost control of the bottle. [The Offender picked up the bottle and struck Ryan Riley on the head with the bottle.] The blow caused a major fracture of the bones of the skull. [Count 7]

Ryan Riley was taken to hospital. He was in intensive care for some time. Had the injury not been immediately treated he would have died. The injury required metal plates to be inserted in his skull. He has ongoing problems, both medical and psychological. As a result of his injuries he withdrew from his University course and is unable to resume studies.

Clay Riley suffered bruising and small cuts to his face. Evan Hill sustained bruising to his left temple and body. Nicholas Burton suffered a broken front tooth and cuts to his mouth.”


	
	In spite of a recorded interview in which the applicant gave an entirely different account of the events, the only disputed fact concerned the prosecution’s assertion that it was the applicant who wielded the bottle that caused the injuries to the victim Ryan Riley. This was relevant to count 7. The prosecution relied upon the applicant’s conduct in the time leading up to Mr Riley’s injury showing him to be the most aggressive party present as well as a description given by a witness at the scene. It also relied upon the fact that two members of the applicant’s group (Mitchell Temaipi and Gildo Zenairi) denied that they were responsible for wielding the bottle. Both Mr Temaipi and Mr Zenairi had been dealt with for different offences and in separate sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	It was clear, and agreed between the parties, that it was not the applicant who brought the bottle into the fight. Rather, one of the victim’s group (Evan Hill) brought the bottle into the fight.
	
	
	The applicant’s case was that he did not use the bottle. In his electronically recorded interview on 21 December 2010, the applicant nominated Mitchell Temaipi as the person who used the bottle. The applicant said that he had not specifically seen this but that Temaipi later told him that he was responsible. Temaipi denied that he used the bottle and (in his own sentencing proceedings) was sentenced on the basis that it was the applicant who did so. The factual basis upon which Temaipi was sentenced had no relevance to the resolution of the factual dispute between the parties in the applicant’s sentencing proceedings. The applicant had also signed a statement on 21 December 2010 indicating his willingness to give evidence that it was Temaipi who had wielded the bottle. Clearly, the prosecution did not accept that this was an honest account.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to go into further detail of the evidence and submissions made in relation to this factual dispute. The learned sentencing Judge resolved the issue in favour of the applicant in a judgment published on 10 December 2013. His Honour correctly applied the onus and standard of proof to the evidence with which he was confronted. He commented that suspicion was insufficient, no matter how grave, and determined that he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who used the bottle causing the devastating injuries to Ryan Riley. The applicant’s plea of guilty to count 7 (recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Ryan Riley) was based upon principles of common purpose or joint criminal enterprise. In other words, he was sentenced on the basis that he was criminally responsible for the injuries to Ryan Riley, whoever had directly caused them, on the basis of his involvement in the series of violent incidents that resulted in those injuries.
	
	
	In addition to the agreed statement of facts and the material received in the hearing directed towards the resolution of that factual dispute, the learned sentencing Judge also received medical and other expert evidence relating to the injuries suffered by Ryan Riley and a victim impact statement which set out the impact of the injury upon Mr Riley and his life. The victim impact statement was prepared by Mr Riley’s mother because Mr Riley’s brain injury made it impossible for him to prepare such a document for himself. The victim impact statement was in the following terms:
	


“This letter is addressed to the presiding Judge

Dear Sir,

As advised to put into writing the victim statement on behalf of my son Ryan Riley as he is incapable of doing so due to head injury,

Ryan is suffering severe bouts of anxiety and depression, emotional physical and suicidal thought. Ryan has gone from an outgoing happy confident young man filled with ambition, confidence and security for his future to a very fearful unhappy and tormented unhealthy sad depressed young man, the result of the very vicious assault has left Ryan with a permanent brain damage to the whole right side of Ryan’s brain the Drs don’t know what lifelong problems Ryan will suffer or what other conditions may arise

Ryan has problems with concentration and is forgetful and vague. His memory is terrible, has problems with his balance and hand co-ordination and balance, Ryan has difficulties with all organizing skills.

Ryan life ambitions was to be a professional song writer and has always been very talented in this area, this was Ryan’s gift and natural talent his whole life, Ryan’s music has always been his dream and that’s why he enrolled in bachelor of performing arts and creative writing skills in university. But that ability since the assault has been greatly affected if not all together stopped as Ryan memory problems is severely affected, this has effected Ryan deeply.

Ryan has severe phobias and is very fearful and untrusting. Ryan is very fearful to be in public and will not take public transport on his own anywhere Ryan does not drive and this makes it very difficult for him to get around. Ryan is very scared to be left alone in fear of someone hurting him or being hit on the head as the neurologist has told us for Ryan to have another impact on his head could be catastrophic and this has indeed left him in constant fear for his life. Ryan constantly covers his head whenever he hears a loud noise or when he is walking past a crowd in the street.

Ryan needs constant supervision and always needs someone to accompany him in public and hates being left alone, Ryan’s father also has concerns for Ryan’s mental and physical health. He also tells me of the constant fears and depression and torment he suffers. Ryan constantly obsessively checks all doors and windows are locked and will not open the door to anyone. Ryan often states he feels dumb and cannot focus or write or even spell anymore. Ryan will come into my room in the middle of the night fearful crying with bad dreams and flashback of the assault.

Ryan lives constant fear and torment. Ryan hardly sleeps and will sleep with knives worried about intruders coming to hurt him or his family. This has also had an impact on my own health and fears for Ryan’s safety and wellbeing. I’m frightened that his own health and fears are so terrorizing it is causing him so much stress. I’m frightened for my sons safety, his mental and physical health and what the future holds for him. Sir I would also with Your honours permission enclose a copy of Ryan brain scan.

Thank you sir for giving me the opportunity to express the ordeal we face daily I hope this letter help to bring my son some justice and that the offender will indeed think about the consequences of their actions.

Kind regards

Mrs Julie Riley 20/09/2012

My son lives in a prison daily. His rights and freedom have been taken away from him. This offender showed no mercy on Ryan. Sir could you please take this into consideration with your sentencing.”


	
	The offending in relation to those four offences occurred over a relatively short period of time. The incident outside of Capitan Torres occurred at 11:30 PM whereas the incident involving the affray and the awful injuries to Mr Riley occurred at around midnight. However, they were two separate incidents of violence. They were alcohol fuelled. The applicant was the major aggressor in relation to each of the incidents. The victims in each instance were doing no more than attempting to enjoy the night-life of Sydney when confronted with the applicant’s outrageous and aggressive behaviour.
	
	
	This type of conduct, which is to say alcohol fuelled and random acts of aggression by young men in the central business district of Sydney, has been subject to much commentary both in the media and in recent decisions of this court: see for example R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [102]; Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171 at [23]; AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [69]; MB v R [2013] NSWCCA 254 at [27]; R v Carroll; Carroll v R [2010] NSWCCA 55; Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [29]. It is clear that the community expects that such acts of violence will be met with significant punishment, particularly where death or (as in this case) really serious injury is occasioned to an innocent victim.
	
	
	The applicant does not contest the sentencing Judge’s summary of the facts of the domestic violence offences:
	


“The [offences] spanned apparently, a long-term relationship with [the applicant’s] former partner during which she was subjected to extraordinary acts of violence, abuse and cruelty over an extended period. She was his then girlfriend. They were in a relationship for nearly 2 years from August 2006. It was punctuated with instances of physical and psychological abuse and comprised the following offences which resulted in the bonds.

Sequence 10 – assault: in June 2007 the offender and the victim were at the offender’s parents’ house. The victim was planning a trip to her home town. She received an SMS from a friend. The offender became upset, he pinned her down and slapped her on the face with sufficient force to split the skin below the eye. It bled.

Sequence 5 – assault: in September 2007 after an argument, the offender held the victim down and he squeezed cold water by a plastic bottle into her ear. He then threw her into a wall, put a pillow over her face and started punching it. She was terrified; she thought he was going to kill her. He released her and then told her to leave. She went for her keys. He again pushed her to the floor, put some bathroom scales on her face and stood on the scales with her head underneath. The scales broke and the offender left. When she said she had called the police, he said he would kill her parents.

Sequence 11 – assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 21 July 2007 they were at a party. Again there was an argument. He then pushed her up against the wall and hit her in the chest. He ripped her necklace off, took her bag, threw it against the wall and pushed her to the ground.

Sequence 13 – assault. On another occasion, New Year’s Eve 2007, another argument. This time he jammed an esky into her chest and pushed her against a wall. He struck her on the side of her face with a bag and when bystanders intervened he told them to fuck off. The argument continued and after agreeing to separate he then grabbed her hand squeezed it and head-butted her.

Sequence 2 – assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In March 2008 there was another argument which resulted in him beating the victim. This time he grabbed a chair, pushed it into her and then held her by the throat holding her up against the wall. He lifted her off the ground by the skin of her underarms and as she was screaming in pain he threw her onto the floor. It was after this incident they finally separated.”


	
	The sentencing Judge described these facts as serious acts of cowardly violence over a continuous and extended period. There is nothing to gainsay Judge Hoy SC’s description of that offending. It is entirely apt.
	


Subjective and Mitigating features


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to each of the offences. The discount allowed by the sentencing Judge (12.5%) is the subject of one of the supplementary grounds of appeal (Ground 5).
	
	
	On a personal level the applicant relied on the contents of a presentence report which described him as:
	
	
	“a quiet and thoughtful young man who seems well aware of the seriousness of the subject proceedings and of the possible outcome for himself. To his credit, he appears to have had some insight in regard to his offending behaviour and has addressed those issues that led to the committal of the offences. It is noted that [the applicant] maintains the support of his partner, his mother and his employer.”
	
	
	The report had earlier described his family and social circumstances and his education and employment. At the time of sentence, the applicant was 28 years of age and was living with his fiancée with whom he apparently had a loving and supportive relationship. She remained supportive throughout the process. The applicant was born in Australia and moved to Lebanon when he was around 1 year of age. His parents often argued and he returned to Australia with his mother when he was aged around 4-5. His father returned to Australia a few years later and the marriage between his parents never fully reconciled. The applicant was not close to his father but maintained a supportive and close relationship with his mother.
	
	
	The applicant achieved his Higher School Certificate and commenced a Diploma in Construction at TAFE. He did not finish the course at TAFE but in 2013 completed his diploma at a private training institute. At the time of sentence he was eligible to apply for a builder’s licence. He had been employed in the building industry for some time prior to sentence as a foreman and project manager. His employer confirmed this information.
	
	
	A reference was tendered from a family friend (George Sedhom) who said that the applicant had very strong family values and work ethic as well as being adaptable and possessing leadership attributes. Reference was made to his representing both Penshurst Marist College and Kogarah Marist High School at the highest level in athletics and rugby league. The family friend described a significant change in the applicant over the 3 years since the 2010 offences and noted that he “has removed all bad elements from his lifestyle, and has purely been devoted to his family, his career, and his fiancée Maryann.”
	
	
	His uncle (Mr Matar) gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings that accorded with the reference of Mr Sedhom. Each noted a significant change in the applicant over the previous several years. Mr Matar was candid when he said that he offered the applicant work basically because he was his nephew. However, having employed him, he observed the applicant at close quarters and was very positive in asserting that the applicant was “a changed man”. Mr Matar also gave evidence that the applicant had demonstrated a problem with alcohol in his late teenage years this. His opinion was that the offences were out of character for the man he knew but agreed with the applicant’s own assessment that he deserved punishment. Mr Matar said that he would be there to support the applicant upon his ultimate release from jail.
	
	
	A builder (Robert Dale) gave evidence. He was aware of the history of offending which he described as “disturbing and very disgusting” but was of the opinion that the applicant was a “changed man”. The applicant was working for his company as its “one and only site foreman” and he was so impressed by the applicant that he told the Court that he would provide him with a job upon his release from jail provided that he was still in business. He had observed the applicant’s relationship with his current fiancée and described it in positive terms.
	
	
	As I have said, reliance has been placed in on the lengthy effluxion of time between the offending and the sentencing proceedings. The sentence proceedings occurred more than 6 years after the domestic violence offences and more than 3 years after the offences which occurred in July 2010. During that period of time, the applicant had complied with the conditions of the bond until the serious breach on 3 July 2010 and complied with his bail conditions from the 13 July 2010 until bail was revoked on 14 February 2013.
	
	
	While the sentencing Judge observed that the applicant was “not assisted by his criminal record”, his Honour was referring to the domestic violence offences. Apart from the matters for which the was to be sentenced, the only other offences on his record were a traffic offence in 2013 (not give way when entering a round-about) and a very minor offence in 2008 which attracted a $200 fine.
	


Parity


	
	There was no ground of appeal asserting that the disparity between the sentences imposed on the applicant and those imposed on Temaipi and Zenari would justify intervention by this Court. While some of the submissions hinted at such a ground, and used the language of “grievance” (see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606) the differences in the charges faced by the three men and their vastly different roles and cases means that there is no merit in the suggestion that the sentence infringed principles of equal justice. Counsel who appeared before the primary judge acknowledged that the cases were so different that parity of sentencing had little or no role to play.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	Submissions in support of a single ground of appeal were initially filed on behalf of the applicant under the hand of experienced senior counsel. That ground of appeal was in the following terms:
	


“1. His Honour erred in failing to give effect to his finding of ‘special circumstances’.”


	
	No oral arguments were addressed to ground 1 but it was adequately addressed in the written submissions.
	
	
	A short time before the hearing of the appeal, the applicant changed legal representatives and on 6 February 2015 a document styled supplementary grounds of appeal was filed. On 9 February 2015 substantial written submissions were filed in support of those additional grounds. The additional grounds of appeal are in the following terms:
	


“2. That the learned sentencing Judge treated the breach of bond matters as justifying greater sentences and accumulation than was warranted in relation to those offences and the offences on the indictment improperly increasing the overall sentence imposed;

3. That the learned sentencing Judge erred in law in failing to give due regard to the provisions of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the imposition of penalties other than custodial penalties where appropriate and available - see Criminal Procedure Act ss 267 & 268;

4. That in sentencing for the major offence [Count 5] his Honour permitted himself to be misled by treating the appellant as the principal offender despite his earlier finding inconsistent with that view;

5. That his Honour erred in assessing the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty to be worth no greater discount than 12.5%;

6. The sentencing Judge failed to accord sufficient weight to the Applicant's subjective case, in particular to the time lapse between the offences and sentences and the applicant's good conduct and restricted freedom whilst subject to onerous bail conditions;

7. That in consequence of the errors above and in the overall assessment of the total criminality of the offender the sentence imposed exceeded that appropriate to a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.”


	
	There is some overlap between a number of the applicant’s contentions and grounds of appeal. However, it is convenient to deal with the grounds separately. I will deal with the supplementary grounds and then return to the ground that was originally filed.
	


Ground 2

“That the learned sentencing Judge treated the breach of bond matters as justifying greater sentences and accumulation than was warranted in relation to those offences and the offences on the indictment improperly increasing the overall sentence imposed.”


	
	There are at least two propositions rolled up in this ground of appeal. The first is that the effective sentences imposed in relation to the two separate offences were excessive because the Judge erred in his treatment of the breach of the bond. The second is that the Judge erred in his approach to the accumulation of the individual sentences.
	
	
	As to the first proposition, there is no patent error disclosed in the judgment on sentence. His Honour’s remarks on the relevance of the breach of the bond were orthodox and legally correct. He treated the breach of bond as an aggravating feature of the 2010 offences. This accords with principles of common law and with s 21A(2)(j) of the Act. His Honour specifically and correctly eschewed the suggestion that the breach of bond should lead to a greater sentence in relation to the domestic violence offences when he said:
	


“The breaches of these bonds fly in the face of the leniency that was then afforded to him. I hasten to add, the facts of these matters do not aggravate the present offences.” (My emphasis)


	
	In context, the reference to the “present offences” was a reference to the domestic violence offences.
	
	
	As to the second proposition, questions of the degree of accumulation and concurrency are matters that fall squarely within the discretionary judgment of the sentencing Judge: see, for example, R v Hammoud  [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] (Simpson J). In Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 205 ALR 346; 78 ALJR 616 the Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [26]:
	


“Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.”


	
	In the absence of any identifiable error of principle in the judgment, it is necessary to consider the sentences actually imposed. The total sentence for the domestic violence offence (18 months) is a severe one for a first time offender of the applicant’s age. However, the offending was very serious and repeated over an extended period of time. Offences of domestic violence must be denounced by the Courts in order to send a clear message to the community that they cannot be tolerated: see for example, R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436 at [41]; R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302 at [64]ff; R v Mahon [2015] NSWSC 25 at [102-103]; R v Johnson [2015] NSWSC 31 at [62].
	
	
	While I will further consider the sentence and non-parole period in considering grounds 1 and 7, I would otherwise reject ground 2.
	


Ground 3

“That the learned sentencing Judge erred in law in failing to give due regard to the provisions of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the imposition of penalties other than custodial penalties where appropriate and available - see Criminal Procedure Act ss 267 & 268.”


	
	In written submissions, the applicant contended that the learned sentencing Judge failed properly to consider whether or not he might have taken no action on the breach of the bond and failed to consider whether any sentence apart from a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate in relation to the domestic violence offences. It was submitted, for example, that “one available option for his Honour was the imposition of a fine”. It was further put in the written submissions that “the use of fines as a sentencing option in respect of the bond matters would not interfere with the appellant serving any sentence of imprisonment for the indictment matters”. The submission continued that fines would be an appropriate option. A number of reasons were given for that contention. It was accepted, as I understand the submission, that no other sentencing option (for example community service, suspension of sentence or home detention) was either appropriate or even technically available due to the fact that a full-time custodial sentence was the inevitable outcome of the sentencing for the 2010 matters.
	
	
	Experienced counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence conceded that a custodial sentence was the only available sentencing option. In view of the seriousness of the offences and the fact that the only options were a fine or a full time gaol sentence, the concession was a sound one. The learned sentencing Judge plainly, if implicitly, accepted and acted on the concession that the only appropriate sentence was one of full-time custody. There is no error in having accepted that concession.
	
	
	In argument, Mr Glissan QC appeared to retreat from the suggestion that it would have been appropriate for the sentencing Judge to take no action on the breach or to impose a fine. Rather he suggested that a “short sharp sentence” may be appropriate.
	
	
	The submissions under ground 3, and the ground itself, are without merit. For one thing, they seem to disregard the savage and sustained nature of the domestic violence encompassed in those matters originally dealt with by way of a bond. It is true that by the time of the breach proceedings they were relatively stale offences. It is also true that the matters were dealt with in the Local Court as a result of an election by the prosecutor. Neither of those matters, nor anything raised in the written submissions of the applicant, justify the disposition of those matters by way of the imposition of a fine or a discretionary decision to take no action on the breach.
	
	
	Ground 3 must be rejected.
	


Ground 4

“That in sentencing for the major offence [Count 7] his Honour permitted himself to be misled by treating the appellant as the principal offender despite his earlier finding inconsistent with that view.”


	
	The contention under this ground is that once the learned sentencing Judge resolved the factual dispute in relation to who struck Mr Riley with the bottle in favour of the applicant, it was not open to find that he was the “principal offender”. That submission appears to suggest that the only party that could properly be described as the principal offender was the person wielding the bottle. This is not correct. The sentencing Judge was extremely careful to make it clear that the applicant was being sentenced on the basis of his involvement in a joint criminal enterprise in which major injuries were occasioned to the victim but in circumstances where it could not be established to the necessary standard who had wielded the bottle. However, the sentencing Judge also noted that the offender appeared to be the initiator of the violence which was described as random and unprovoked. His remarks on sentence described the applicant as the “principal protagonist in all these incidents. He initiated the attacks. He was very provocative spreading a rampage of violence upon innocent victims.”
	
	
	Earlier, in accepting a concession that parity with the co-offenders had little (or no) part to play, the sentencing Judge correctly identified the fact that the applicant’s position was far more serious than that of his co-offenders due to the nature of the charges with which they were sentenced and their involvement being “to a lesser degree”.
	
	
	Nothing in the remarks on sentence suggests that his Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis that he hit Mr Riley in the head with the bottle. However, the applicant pleaded guilty to an offence whereby he accepted criminal responsibility for the injuries that had been occasioned to Mr Riley. Those injuries were extreme in their nature and have left Mr Riley with a seriously diminished quality of life. The victim impact statement read by his mother provided eloquent testimony to this. The descriptions of the applicant as the initiator of the violence, as the provocateur and principal protagonist were all justified by the agreed facts which were not disputed either at first instance or on the hearing of this appeal. Had the applicant not instigated the initial fight that led to the fracas and the introduction (by somebody else) of the bottle, Mr Riley would not have suffered the injuries which he did.
	
	
	The submissions made under this ground bordered on a traversal of the plea of guilty, but Mr Glissan QC was quick to indicate that that was not the intention of the submission.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no error in the approach adopted by the learned sentencing Judge and the plea of guilty to the charge under s 35 was well justified by the material available to both the defence and prosecution. I would reject ground 4.
	


Ground 5

That his Honour erred in assessing the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty to be worth no greater discount than 12.5%.


	
	In the proceedings before the primary Judge there was a dispute as to the discount that was appropriate for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the discount should be in the “region of 10 to 15%”. Counsel for the prosecution submitted that “5% would have to be their maximum”. In written submissions the learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that there “should be little if any discount for the plea”. Judge Hoy SC provided a discount of 12.5%.
	
	
	In spite of the submission by counsel at first instance, the applicant seeks to persuade this Court that the exercise of discretionary judgment which resulted in the 12.5% reduction was vitiated by error. That submission must be rejected.
	
	
	The offences were committed on 3 July 2010 and the applicant was charged on 14 July 2010. The plea of guilty was not entered until 27 July 2013, which is to say more than 3 years after he was charged. In the meantime, the applicant had been committed to stand trial and a trial of the offences had been listed and commenced. A jury was discharged whereupon a further trial date was set. A trial listed in April 2013 was vacated and yet a further trial date was set in July 2013 with a direction from the Chief Judge that the matter must proceed. It was on the day that the third trial was listed that the applicant entered his plea of guilty.
	
	
	Counsel at first instance explained this delay on the basis of the applicant’s lack of understanding of the concept of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose. Such a lack of understanding does not increase the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty.
	
	
	The features which are pertinent to an assessment of the appropriate discount for the plea are essentially (i) the timing of the plea and (ii) the complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and reduced. The greater the length and complexity of the trial the greater the utilitarian value of the plea: See R v Thompson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 at [154] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	On the hearing of the appeal, Queen’s Counsel attempted to persuade the Court that this was a matter of great complexity as a result of the engagement of those principles relating to joint criminal enterprise. I do not accept that the matter was particularly complex. In any event, the evidence which needed to be gathered to establish the applicant’s guilt was not evidence of much complexity. Directions of law may have had a degree of complexity but the complexity would not have greatly increased the length of the trial. The trial proceedings would not have been particularly lengthy.
	
	
	Clearly the complexity of the issues was a matter that led the learned sentencing Judge to reject the Crown’s submission at first instance and to provide the applicant with a 12.5% discount. It could not have been the timing of the plea. The timing of the plea was such that the Crown was justified in making the submissions that had been made at first instance, albeit that the learned sentencing Judge was justified in taking a more generous approach in the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	Parts of the submissions on this ground tended to suggest that the applicant was submitting that the difficulties that the Crown may have had in proving its case were matters which affected the utilitarian value of the plea. That submission was specifically, and correctly, eschewed when counsel was confronted with it on the hearing of the appeal. The strength of a prosecution case is not a matter properly to be taken into account in assessing the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty: see R v Thompson and Houlton at [137] see also R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32]; R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12].
	
	
	I would reject ground 5.
	


Ground 6

“The sentencing Judge failed to accord sufficient weight to the Applicant's subjective case, in particular to the time lapse between the offences and sentences and the applicant's good conduct and restricted freedom whilst subject to onerous bail conditions.”


	
	The terms of this ground itself demonstrate the difficulties which attend its success. The weight to be given to an offender’s subjective or personal circumstances was a matter entrusted to the sentencing Judge. There is nothing in Judge Hoy SC’s careful remarks in sentencing the applicant to suggest that he failed to take these relevant matters into account, that he mistook the facts or that he took into account extraneous considerations so as to attract appellant interference with the exercise of a discretionary judgement: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at [55].
	
	
	I would not uphold this ground of appeal. However the “time-lapse” between the offences and the sentences and the applicant’s good conduct and “restricted freedom” are matters of significance to the appropriate outcome of this appeal. The delay may be a factor going to special circumstance and to the length of the non-parole period: see R v EGC [2005] NSWCCA 392 at [38] (Latham J).
	


Grounds 1 and 7

1. His Honour erred in failing to give effect to his finding of ‘special circumstances’.

7. That in consequence of the errors above and in the overall assessment of the total criminality of the offender the sentence imposed exceeded that appropriate to a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.


	
	I have found no error in relation to grounds 2-6 but before dealing with ground 7 and the ultimate question that arises under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), I will address the ground and submission originally filed on the applicant’s behalf.
	
	
	As to the reference in ground 7 to “the overall assessment of the total criminality of the offender” I should refer to the decision of this Court in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 where Spigelman CJ said at [37]:
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing Judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance Judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.”


	
	Simpson J “emphatically agreed” with those comments and added at [46]:
	


“The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing Judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance Judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance Judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance Judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	In Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [79]-[89] I expressed reservations about the authority of Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 in light of the observations of the High Court in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [24]: see also Carroll v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45 at [57] per Allsop P and Johnson J and MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230 per RS Hulme at [43]-[44] (cf Campbell JA at [2] and Hoeben J at [75]).
	
	
	The majority in Kaminic v R  (Ward JA and Fullerton J) applied Mulato v R with Ward JA observing that the comments of the High Court in Carroll v The Queen were dicta. Mulato v R (and the majority approach in Kaminic v R) has been applied in subsequent cases: see, for example, Stoeski v R [2014] NSWCCA 161 at [46] (Adamson J); Khanchitanon v R [2014] NSWCCA 204 at [24] (Adamson J). There was no appeal to the High Court from the decision in Kaminic v R and on Friday 13 February 2015 special leave to appeal was refused in Stoeski v R [2015] HCATrans 19.
	
	
	Accordingly, I consider the questions that I raised in Kaminic to be resolved. The observations of Spigelman CJ and Simpson J in Mulato should be applied in New South Wales. In the present case, Judge Hoy SC found that the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm fell “at about the middle range of objective seriousness”. He also made a reasoned assessment of the totality of the criminality involved in both sets of offences. There was nothing in the judgment to suggest that he fell into “House error” and his assessment of the objective criminality of the offences was open to him in the exercise of discretionary judgment.
	
	
	I now turn to Ground 1, the question of special circumstances and length of the non-parole period. The learned sentencing Judge imposed fixed terms in relation to all of the offences with the exception of the most serious offence being the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm (count 7). In accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), his Honour identified the reason for imposing fixed terms:
	


“Having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offences and as I consider it appropriate to impose fixed terms. Also, in light of the latter sentence the non-parole period will subsume the preceding fixed term sentences.”


	
	This is an orthodox approach to sentencing for multiple offences.
	
	
	His Honour was invited to find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2). Written submissions for the applicant merely contended “a finding of special circumstances is available.” The following is a recorded argument on 14 February 2014:
	


“COUNSEL: My instructing solicitor reminds me although I have addressed it,

I submit to your Honour you would find special circumstances and I don’t think

the Crown disagrees --

CORR: I disagree.

COUNSEL: He disagrees.

HIS HONOUR: He disagrees okay. What are you suggesting are the special circumstances, the need for a lengthier time for assimilation back in the community after a custodial sentence. It’s his first time he faces custody, a relatively young offender--

COUNSEL: I couldn’t put it any higher than that your Honour.”


	
	As was put in argument, his Honour did not receive a great deal of assistance on this and a number of other issues. Counsel did not address the question of whether the accumulation of sentences in itself would constitute special circumstances or address any submissions to the relevance of the extensive delay and periods of rehabilitation to the question of special circumstances. Where an offender seeks a finding of special circumstances, it is important that their legal representative say so in clear terms and identify those circumstances which are said to be relevantly “special”.
	
	
	His Honour made a finding of special circumstances and having identified certain matters in the course of argument, also identified the fact of the accumulation as a matter relevant to that question. His Honours judgment includes the following at [19]:
	


“A finding of special circumstances is also sought. This is based on a need for extended rehabilitation and primarily on this being his first time in custody and his relatively young age. In my view, accumulation of sentences may also be regarded as a special circumstance. Crown opposes such finding because they say any parole period comprising the statutory ratio would be sufficient to ensure his re-assimilation into the community. A finding of special circumstances is discretionary; see Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 and any such circumstances must be “sufficiently special” see R v Fidow [2004] NSW CCA 172. Having regard to all the circumstances the accumulation of those factors satisfy me that is appropriate to make an adjustment to the statutory ratio and I intend to do so.”


	
	Another matter that clearly pointed in the direction of a finding of special circumstances was the passage of time between the offences and the sentence hearing and the periods during which the offender had complied with the terms of the bond and bail. In R v ECG, Latham J rejected a submission that delay, of itself, warranted intervention. However, her Honour went on to observe at [38]:
	


“That said, there is, in my view, some substance to the submission that the passage of time between the commission of the offences and sentence was capable of constituting special circumstances. The Judge declined to find special circumstances, referring only to the applicant’s age, the likely nature of his custody and the fact that the sentences represented his first experience of custody. This Court has recognised prosecution for a stale offence as a special circumstance warranting alteration of the statutory ratio: R v Virgona [2004] NSWCCA 415. I would regard the imposition of a custodial sentence for the commission of offences 16 years ago as “sufficiently special to justify a variation”: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ.”


	
	In the present case, the sentencing Judge did make an adjustment to the “statutory ratio” when he imposed the non-parole period in relation to count 7. There was no occasion to make any adjustment with respect to the other sentences as fixed terms were imposed in relation to them. However, the complaint under ground 1 is that, in spite of the finding of special circumstances and the fact that the matter identified went beyond the circumstance of accumulation of sentences, the total effective sentence was in accordance with the “statutory ratio”. That is to say, the non-parole period (6 years) was precisely 75% of the total effective sentence (8 years).
	
	
	Similar grounds of appeal have been raised in a number of cases: see for example: R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215; R v Thornberry [2000] NSWCCA 526; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86; R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139; R v Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215; CM v R [2013] NSWCCA 341; AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31; Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279; Fina’i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134.
	
	
	As RA Hulme J observed in CM v R at [40]:
	


“Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflected in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing Judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation.”


	
	Where a sentencing Judge makes clear that they are aware that the total sentence is in accordance with the “statutory ratio”, it is rare that this Court would intervene. In Houri v R the court declined to intervene in a case where an adjustment in respect of one sentence resulted in a sentence wherein the non-parole period was marginally greater than 75% of the overall term. R A Hulme J said at [34]:
	


“I do not believe that there was any inadvertence or miscalculation by the Judge. She imposed individual sentences and partially accumulated them to achieve the precise result that she said she intended. In the first passage quoted above she said that the in the overall total sentence ‘the statutory ratio will not reduce substantially’. In the second passage she noted that ‘the total non-parole period is very close to the statutory ratio when one has regard to the total sentence, and that is what I intend in passing sentence’.”


	
	Similarly in AB v R the Court declined to intervene when the sole basis of the finding of special circumstances was “by reason of the accumulation of sentences”.
	
	
	Conversely, in cases where the finding of special circumstances was more broadly based then the accumulation itself and where the sentencing Judge has not clearly indicated their awareness of the fact that the total effective sentence will remain in accordance with (or close to) the “statutory norm” the court has intervened: see R v LWP; R v Thornberry; R v Keen; R v Street; R v Heron v R; M v R.
	
	
	In the present case, the respondent relies upon the fact that the learned sentencing Judge, in explaining the sentence to the applicant, identified the precise effect of the total effective sentence and non-parole period. After imposing sentence his Honour said:
	


HIS HONOUR: All right. What it essentially means, sir, is you are serving an effective sentence of 18 months for the breach of bonds matters, however, the current matters commence 12 months into that sentence. So that is the accumulation insofar as the current matters they then commence 12 months into those earlier sentences and the overall time that you will spend in custody is six years backdated from when you went into custody on the 14th. After that you are eligible for parole and I have made an adjustment insofar as the parole period to extend it and that will be for a period of two years. So after serving four years of the main sentence you then fall eligible for release to parole on 14 February 2020. Do you understand that so far? All right.

Insofar as parole is concerned you must understand that if you breach your parole you are under the supervision of the Parole Authority and not the Court. What that means is if there is any breach, any offences, any disregard of any directions, Probation and Parole or Parole Authority, then you can be breached. It gets reported to the Parole Authority not the Courts. The Parole Authority then have the option of revoking your parole. They ordinarily do so if I can say that unless there are extenuating circumstances. What that then means you go back into custody to serve the balance of that sentence from whenever that parole is revoked. So it is very important that obviously you do not breach it but do you understand that?”


	
	I accept the respondent’s submission that the reference to the “main sentence” is a reference to the sentence on count 7. However, contrary to a submission made orally, the sentencing Judge did not state that “the effective total non-parole period would be 75% of the total sentence”. At no stage did the sentencing Judge make clear that his intention was to impose a total sentence whereby the non-parole period would be 75% of the total sentence. His Honour did not indicate that his purpose in finding special circumstances was merely to reinstate the statutory proportions pursuant to s 44 of the Act.
	
	
	This case falls between the extremes represented by cases where there is no acknowledgement by the sentencing Judge of the total effect of the sentence and, on the other hand, those cases where the finding of special circumstances were based entirely on the accumulation or where the sentencing Judge specifically says that they are aware that the impact of the adjustment will result in the normal “statutory ratio” between the non-parole period and the overall sentence.
	
	
	Whilst it is clear that the learned sentencing Judge was aware of the total effective non-parole period and total effective overall sentence, nowhere in the Judgement on sentence, the transcript of the submissions or the explanation to the applicant of the impact of the sentence after sentence was imposed did his Honour make plain that he fully intended and was aware that the adjustment to the non-parole period on count 7 would achieve no more than resulting in the applicant spending 75% of the total sentence in custody.
	
	
	In coming to a final conclusion, it is significant that the finding of special circumstances was not based solely upon the accumulation. His Honour referred to the “need for extended rehabilitation”, the fact that it was the offender’s first time in custody and his “relatively young age”. It was after referring to those matters that his Honour said that “accumulation of sentences may also be regarded as a special circumstance.”
	
	
	As James J held in Cicekdag v R [2007] NSWCCA 218 at [46-49]
	


“It is true that in the sentence for the dangerous driving offence the sentencing Judge did vary the usual ratio between the non-parole period of a sentence and the balance of the term, so that the balance of the term exceeded one-third of the non-parole period. However, when all the sentences are taken into account, the total head sentences are six and a half years and the total non-parole periods are five years, so that the total period during which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole does not exceed one-third of the total non-parole periods and is, in fact, slightly less than one-third of the total non-parole periods.

It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, when all the sentences were taken into account, the sentencing Judge had failed to carry into effect an intention to vary the usual ratio between non-parole periods and balances of terms, so as to take into account both of the two factors the sentencing Judge had identified as requiring such a variation, namely the applicant’s mental condition and the consequent need for rehabilitation and supervision, and the accumulation of sentences.

In my opinion, this submission by counsel for the applicant should be upheld.

If the only factor identified by the sentencing Judge as requiring a variation of the usual ratio had been the accumulation of sentences, then the imposition of a collection of sentences in which the total parole period was only slightly less than one-third of the total of the non-parole periods might well have been regarded as a sufficient implementation of his Honour’s sentencing intention. However, his Honour also identified as a factor requiring a variation of the usual ratio the applicant’s mental condition and his consequent need for rehabilitation and supervision and the sentences imposed by his Honour, when considered in their totality, did not make any allowance for this factor.”


	
	In spite of the learned sentencing Judge clearly articulating the numerical results of the partial accumulation in explaining the sentence to the applicant, I have come to the conclusion that the sentencing discretion miscarried. The finding of special circumstances, based as it was around important subjective matters such as the applicant’s extended need for rehabilitation in the community, ought to have sounded in a somewhat greater adjustment to the proportion between the non-parole period and the total effective sentence. Having said that, the offences were of such seriousness both individually and in their cumulative effect that any adjustment downwards must be a modest one.
	
	
	The need for the applicant to have an extended period of supervised parole was highlighted by the things that had transpired in the course of the period of time between the domestic violence offences and the sentencing hearing. As Judge Hoy SC pointed out in his judgment on sentence, he had remained of good behaviour during much of that period, with the exception of the 2010 offences all of which occurred in the course of one hour. The learned sentencing Judge pointed out that “one can be forgiven for thinking that this [period of good behaviour] is because it has been imposed by the court”. His Honour was there referring to the fact that the applicant had been on the bond imposed by the Local Court and then on stringent bail conditions. As the learned sentencing Judge impliedly or implicitly recognised, this was a matter that justified an extended period on parole.
	
	
	For those reasons, I have reached the conclusion that ground 1 should be upheld.
	


Section 6(3) and re-sentencing


	
	Having come to the conclusion that the sentencing discretion miscarried in this way, it is necessary to consider whether a different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to be imposed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In doing so, I take into account the evidence submitted by the applicant “on the usual basis”, that is to be considered only on the question of re-sentencing if error was established. This material came in the form of a bundle of documents produced by the Department of Corrective Services under a freedom of information request. A good deal of the material tendered is not relevant but the following entries might properly inform the appropriate length of the sentence:
	


19/6/14 – He presents as genuinely keen to address issues that led to his incarceration

14/7/14 – inmate has requested fulltime education. We are currently unable to accommodate his learning needs as he is a highly literate inmate [and relevant courses had already commenced].

26/9/14 – always attends work when required, he is a good worker, always polite to officers and other inmates. [H]e doesn’t cause any problems.

20/1/15 – Follows instructions well and displays a positive attitude undertaking the required work tasks. He has helped guide other workers in the team to help complete required work projects. This inmate has been an asset to ground maintenance.

10/2/15 – always keen to undertake work, he follows instructions well and is no problem to staff.


	
	Even taking this promising material into account, I am unable to conclude that the total effective sentence of 8 years or the individual sentences imposed by his Honour should be disturbed. However, I am of the opinion that there should be some adjustment to the length of the non-parole period in order to provide for a longer period for the applicant to be supervised upon his eventual release from gaol. Such an outcome is beneficial, obviously enough, to the applicant but also reflects one of the purposes of punishment in s 3A namely “to promote the rehabilitation of the offender”. There is a community interest in his rehabilitation. The other purposes of punishment (adequate punishment, deterrence, protection of the community, denunciation, recognition of the harm done to the victim and making the offender accountable for his actions) are all served by the overall sentence and what will remain a lengthy period of incarceration.
	
	
	To achieve the outcome it is unnecessary and undesirable to interfere with the sentences imposed other than by making a further adjustment to the non-parole period imposed in relation to count 7. For the sake of clarity, my intention is that the applicant be subject to a total effective sentence of 8 years with a total effective non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed in relation to sequences 10, 5, 11, 13 and 2 are confirmed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4 are confirmed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in respect of count 7 is quashed and in lieu thereof impose a sentence compromising a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months commencing 5 February 2016 and expiring on 4 May 2019 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months commencing 5 May 2019 and expiring on 4 February 2022.
	
	
	The applicant will be eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period relating to count 7.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Charges and outcome

The appellant stood trial at Tamworth District Court on 30 October 2013 on an indictment containing three counts that between 1 and 13 May 2011 at Tamworth he:


	
	Had sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years and under his authority, contrary to s66A(2) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	Attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years, contrary to s66B Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	[In the alternative to Count 2] Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years, contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	On 6 November 2013 the appellant was found not guilty on count 1, but guilty on count 2 (thereby no verdict was required on the alternative count 3).
	
	
	On 29 November 2013 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months, commencing 1 November 2013 and expiring 31 July 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months, expiring 20 April 2021.
	
	
	The appellant has appealed against his conviction as follows:
	


Ground 1 – The verdicts of the jury are factually inconsistent and unreasonable.

Ground 2 – The trial judge erred in failing to give a warning to the jury in respect of the evidence of LB (the complainant).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	It was the Crown case that the appellant sexually assaulted his girlfriend’s 4 year old daughter when babysitting her alone on Mothers Day, 8 May 2011, by attempting to penetrate her vaginal/anal area with his penis and also putting his penis into her mouth. The appellant denied all wrongdoing.
	
	
	The complainant (LB) was aged 4 years and 3 months on 8 May 2011 and there was no dispute that the appellant was looking after the complainant on that day.
	
	
	Evidence of “complaint” was adduced relating to things the complainant said on 13 May 2011 and in addition, a video recorded interview conducted with the complainant on 18 May 2011, was admitted as part of her evidence in chief, pursuant to s306U Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	In the video recorded interview, the complainant gave the following evidence:

	When the complainant gave evidence at the trial on 31 October 2013 she was aged 6 years and 9 months. Her memory was poor.
	
	
	The following is a summary of the evidence which she gave at the trial. She had been sleeping on her mother’s bed when the appellant woke her up and told her to get up. The appellant got the banana out of his pants. She sucked the banana juice out of his “biddie widdie”, which is what he wees out of. He put hazelnut chocolate which he got out of the cupboard on the banana juice. She did not remember anything else.
	
	
	She did not remember telling anyone about what the appellant did. She kept the secret for “a hundred years”. She did not remember telling her mother. She did not tell her uncle. She said that she and her mother did not want the appellant to come back because “I think we don’t want him to do that again what he did before”. She did not remember the appellant showing anything to her on his phone.
	
	
	In cross-examination the complainant did remember speaking with the lady and the police officer as shown on the DVD. (Earlier she had said that she did not remember.)
	
	
	When she was 4, she could work the DVD player at home and she had lots of DVDs, but none of them had rude things on them. She was allowed to play on her mother’s old phone but she did not remember watching any videos on it. When asked whether it was on her mother’s old phone that she saw a video of a black haired girl sucking nana juice from a banana she said both “No” and “I don’t remember”.
	
	
	The following cross-examination occurred at T.32.1-34.26:

Q. Do you remember what time of day?

A. No.

Q. Whether it was the morning or the night time or anything like that?

A. I don’t remember any of that.

Q. You don’t remember any of that?

A. Yeah.”


	
	The complainant did not remember getting into trouble at the Milestones Early Learning Centre (Milestones). She remembered telling her teacher that the appellant had pushed her off her chair but she did not know if the appellant had ever done this.
	
	
	The Acting Director of Milestones, Ms Watters, gave evidence. She said that in February 2011 the complainant was acting inappropriately and would often not comply with teachers’ requests. She said that in April 2011 the complainant became very affectionate towards the teachers and would often try to kiss them on the lips or on the breasts. She had made three online reports to DOCS in April and May.
	
	
	Ms Watters said that on 13 May 2011 the complainant’s teacher brought the complainant to her because the complainant was swearing and telling her teachers not to touch her. She got the complainant to do some drawing and during that time the complainant said to her “ML put a banana up my bottom”. She asked the complainant “Did you have clothes on?” to which the complainant replied “No and it really hurt”. She asked “Did you tell your mum?” and the complainant replied “No and ML’s naughty”. This was the first time any explicit complaint was made.
	
	
	Under cross-examination she said that the first record of strange behaviour by the complainant was on 17 February 2010 when the complainant was noted as yelling out “fuck” over 20 times, hitting teachers and kicking and spitting. The next record was 9 November 2010 for kicking, hitting, screaming and swearing and thereafter the complainant’s behaviour had progressively deteriorated.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother gave evidence that she knew the appellant from high school when she had a relationship with him. She renewed that relationship for about a month in April/May 2010 during which time the appellant lived with her and her daughter. During that time, she was working at Subway but the appellant was not working.
	
	
	The following is a summary of the evidence which the complainant’s mother gave at trial. There was only one occasion when she left the complainant in the care of the appellant. This was on Mothers Day, 8 May 2011. The complainant and the appellant had made chocolate cupcakes with icing which were for dessert.
	
	
	On the morning of 13 May 2011 after a “poker night” she was still “pretty much asleep” and in bed when the complainant came into the bedroom and used the words “ML” and “banana”. When she did so the appellant quickly cut off the complainant and told her to shut up.
	
	
	That afternoon, when she picked the complainant up from day care, she asked the complainant what she had meant by “ML” and “banana” to which the complainant replied that ML had put a banana up her bottom (T.59.35). When they got home and they were alone she asked the complainant again and the complainant said “ML put a banana up my bottom and banana juice in my mouth”. The complainant said that the appellant got the banana from “in his pants”. She rang her friend, Amanda Gill, and asked her to come over and the complainant told Ms Gill the same thing as she had told her.
	
	
	Later that day, a conversation took place between her and the appellant when the complainant was present.
	


“A. I - Amanda and Scott were still outside and I said to ML, “We have to talk” and he responded, “Okay” and I said to him, “You will probably be offended” and he said - I think he said, “What about” and I said, “[the complainant] said you put a banana up her bottom I think” and I was pretty upset at that stage, I - he said he didn’t, [the complainant] then - I am pretty sure - like because [the complainant] was there, she could hear it, she said, “He did.” He leant down in her direction and said he didn’t, then he said to - looked me straight in the eye and said he didn’t do anything. My response was, “What am I supposed to do?”

Q. When he bent down and looked at [the complainant] and said he didn’t, did she say anything back to him?

A. Not - pretty sure she replied again that he did, but then it was left at that, I think. She was pretty adamant that something had happened.” (T.50.35)


	
	The appellant then left the house. She said that at the time she did not have any bananas in the house because it was just after the Queensland storms and bananas were too expensive. She did have chocolate icing, but not chocolate itself. She had Nutella hazelnut chocolate spread, but nothing that could be described as “lubricant chocolate”.
	
	
	The next day (14 May), she asked the complainant again what had happened and the complainant replied that she had seen a dark-haired girl do it. When asked on what, the complainant said “on ML’s phone”. The complainant’s mother remembered that while the appellant was staying with her, he had used her old phone. When she checked the phone, after some difficulty, she found two video files which appeared to have been sent from a pornographic site. One of them contained a black-haired girl engaging in fellatio. The phone was later handed to the police.
	
	
	When cross-examined, the complainant’s mother said that during 2010 until February 2011 the complainant was attending Milestones twice a week. Thereafter, the complainant attended three times a week. The complainant was reported as swearing, being angry and refusing to comply with requests. She said that when she found the pornographic video on her old phone, she asked the complainant “Did ML wake you up?” and “Did he show you this and ask you if you would do it?” to which the complainant nodded her head but did not say anything.
	
	
	In re-examination she said in May 2011 the complainant did not have a good appreciation of days and dates.
	
	
	Amanda Gill gave evidence that when she went to the complainant’s house on 13 May 2011, the complainant’s mother asked her to repeat what she had told her. The complainant said that ML had stuck his banana in her bum. When Ms Gill asked when, the complainant replied “last night”. Ms Gill said that on the same day, the complainant’s uncle spoke to the complainant and when he asked her what she meant by “banana”, she pointed at his crotch.
	
	
	The complainant’s uncle gave evidence that on 13 May 2011 when he had gone to the complainant’s home, he heard a conversation between his sister and the appellant in which he heard the appellant say “No I didn’t” and the complainant say “Yes you did”. He heard the appellant again say “No I didn’t” to which the complainant said “Yes you did”. He then saw the appellant leave with a bag of belongings.
	
	
	The uncle said that the complainant’s mother asked her to tell him what had happened to which the complainant said “ML stuck a banana in my butt and my mouth” and that he got the banana from “his pants”. He said that later she told him that the appellant “tried to stick a banana in my butt and stuck it in my mouth” and that he got the banana from his “pants”. There was no mention to him of chocolate being involved.
	
	
	The JIRT caseworker, who interviewed the complainant on 18 May 2011, gave evidence that when she asked the complainant to identify on the drawing of a boy where the banana had come from, the complainant pointed to the genital area on the front of the boy. In cross-examination, she said that before the interview there had been no mention of chocolate being involved in the allegations. If there had been, she would not have used the example of a chocolate cake at the beginning of the interview.
	
	
	Dr Andrew Gardiner examined the complainant on 19 May 2011 at the Tamworth Rural Referral Hospital. He reported that the complainant
	


“… appeared quite hyperactive. She was extraverted in the extreme with apparently none of the usual reticence that a four year old would be expected to exhibit towards a stranger … She was chatty, loquacious, buoyant in her mood, laughing and giggling. Further she was indiscriminately and inappropriately affectionate … The indiscriminately affectionate behaviour … is seen in children with reactive attachment disorder and suggests a degree of preceding emotional deprivation. It also renders them more susceptible to exploitation by adults.”


	
	He said that:
	


“Inspection of her ano-genital region was normal … The hymen was thick and folded and the transverse hymenal diameter was 2 millimetres, these are normal findings. Inspection of the anus and perianal region subsequently in the left lateral position revealed normal appearances with normal anal tone and reflex … The normal ano-genital findings neither support nor disprove the suggestion that anal penetration might have occurred.”


	
	The “Dora the Explorer” pyjama top, which the complainant said that she was wearing, was given to the police on 24 May 2011. It was subjected to DNA testing but no semen or any male DNA profile was located.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. The following is a summary of his evidence. There was only one day when the complainant was left in his care, which was Mothers Day on 8 May 2011. After the complainant’s mother had gone to work, he made the complainant breakfast which was Nutella on toast. Some time later they decided to make cupcakes. They went to the nearby supermarket for icing and chocolate chips. The complainant was wearing her “Dora the Explorer” pyjamas and a dressing gown. Back home they made the cupcakes and cooked them, then the complainant put icing on and the appellant put little icing messages on them. The complainant ate the left over mixture.
	
	
	He did remember an occasion on the morning of Friday, 13 May 2011 when the complainant came into their bedroom and started talking. He could not remember what she was talking about but he told her to shut up. It was on the evening of that day that the complainant’s mother told him that the complainant had made allegations that he put a banana up her bottom, which he denied. He said that the complainant turned around and said “Yes he did”. He replied to her “No I didn’t”. When he asked the complainant’s mother whether she believed him, she said that she did not know what to believe. He decided that he was not going to stay where he was not trusted and left.
	
	
	He agreed that while he was staying with the complainant’s mother, he had used her old phone and that once or twice he had watched a porn video on it, including one that showed a dark-haired woman having sex with a man including fellatio. He denied ever showing the complainant that video. He denied ever placing his penis near the complainant’s bottom or mouth or putting chocolate or Nutella on his penis and presenting it to the complainant.
	
	
	The trial commenced on 30 October 2013. No evidence was called until 31 October 2013. The evidence concluded on 4 November 2013 and the jury retired at 9.21am on 6 November 2013 to consider its verdict. The jury returned at 2.24pm with a not guilty verdict on count 1 and a guilty verdict on count 2.
	
	
	In the course of the summing up, the following exchange took place between counsel and her Honour:
	


“HIS HONOUR: ... Now, what are the other directions you want, Mr Carty? Or, anything so far, Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: No, thank you.

CARTY: Well, obviously the Murray direction and the Markuleski direction. I think you’ve already given that. The main thing that I wanted to ask for, your Honour, was a warning under section 165 of the Evidence Act in relation to [the complainant]. I know it can’t be based only on her age.

HER HONOUR: No because we’ve got the section that says - the very section, what is the section?

CARTY: 165B.

HER HONOUR: Yes. All right, well, why do you say? Because--

CARTY: There’s a number of factors. There’s the evidence that she had symptoms of reactive attachment disorder, that she was extraverted in the extreme, indiscriminate and inappropriate affection, which suggested preceding emotional deprivation. And there’s the evidence of her behavioural problems at the Milestones Early Learning Centre.

HER HONOUR: Yes.

CARTY: There’s the fact that she didn’t recognise herself when shown the interview in June 2012. There’s her evidence in court where she couldn’t remember any detail about the allegations, including where she was, what her body position was, if she saw the banana, how big was the banana, what colour was the banana. She said she couldn’t remember if the banana touched her body.

HER HONOUR: Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: In my submission they’re all simply matters that the jury will take into account when they’re assessing the credibility of the witness. They’re not matters that require your Honour to give a warning under 165B.”


	
	By judgment, dated 5 November 2013, her Honour rejected the application for a s165 warning. Her reasons were as follows:
	


“HER HONOUR: In respect of this matter, Mr Carty has made application that I give an unreliable evidence direction in respect of the complainant. He says so not on age alone but that together with other features. The Crown says those features he has identified are matters that the jury would take into account in assessing the credibility of the complainant and says the direction is not required.

In my view, there are good reasons why the direction need not be given. Some of those matters Mr Carty has just stated really relate to the age of the complainant and in the original interview and in terms of her recent complaint she was quite clear.

The other difficulty is that not only did the doctor say she may well have suffered from that condition, he also clearly said it made her more open to exploitation.

In any event, in all of the circumstances, those matters are ones in my view where the jury will completely understand them; they will apply them in assessing her credibility and determining whether to believe her and the Murray direction will suffice in the circumstances of this case.

Accordingly, the request for that direction is denied.”


	
	In the course of her summing up her Honour gave warnings in the following form:
	


“Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you must consider each of the offences separately, and only in relation to the evidence concerning that offence. It may be that the verdict you bring in in respect of one offence is different to the verdict you give in respect of another offence. There is no difficulty with that, if there is a logical reason for it.

It is the position though, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that if you had a concern about the credibility of the complainant, and that led to you returning a verdict of not guilty in respect of one count, then it would be essential that you give consideration and weight to that when considering another count in the indictment.” (SU 8.1)

“Now, just going back to the essential elements of the offences, I got up to count 2 and I said I would be giving you a direction concerning attempt, but before I do I just remind you again that you should give separate consideration to the individual counts. That means that you are entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty on some counts and not guilty on other counts, if there is a logical reason for that outcome.

If you were to find the accused not guilty on any count, particularly if that was because you had doubts about the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, you would have to consider how that conclusion affected your consideration of the remaining counts.” (SU 21.3)

“For example, it would be quite wrong for you to find the accused guilty of the alternative count simply because some of you found that the accused was guilty of the principal count but others were not so satisfied and would enter a verdict of not guilty of that charge. It would be unfair and contrary to your oaths to decide to break the deadlock by convicting the accused on the alternative count.” (SU 25.1)

“I remind you of separate consideration and remind you that the crucial matter for you to understand is that any doubt you may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant’s evidence ought be considered by you when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and therefore when deciding whether or not you have a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to another count. The complainant’s evidence includes reliability, credibility and truthfulness in any regard.” (SU 27.5)

“Again, it is for you to decide whether this complaint was made but if you are satisfied that it was then the question you should ask yourself is did the complainant act in the way you would expect her to act if she had been assaulted as she says she was? Is what she did the sort of conduct you would expect of a person who has been assaulted in that way? If you think that the complainant has done what you would expect someone in her position to do that may support the Crown case because you may find that there is a consistency between the complainant’s conduct and the allegation she makes against the accused.

On the other hand, if the complainant has not acted in a way you would have expected someone to act after being assaulted as she described, then that would indicate that the allegation is false. …

Of course, the fact that a person says something on more than one occasion does not mean that what he said is necessarily true or accurate. A false or inaccurate statement does not become more reliable just because it is repeated on more than one occasion and I have told you that that is what has taken place in this case.” (SU 31.9)

“Now, of course, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defence say in considering what I have told you that you would not consider that the evidence of complaint or the complaint here is not one which would assist you because of these considerations:

Firstly, when the complainant said to Miss Gill “last night” that is not consistent with the other evidence; that, as I have reminded you, [Miss Gill] specifically asked her “When did this happen?” and [the complainant] said, “Last night”; that at the time of any of these conversations she did not show any distress. She told [Miss Watters] that she did not have any clothes on but in her interview she said she had on the Dora pyjamas. And prior to the first complaint to [Miss Watters] she had made a different complaint about ML pushing her off a chair and that he had told her to lie to her mother about it. But what she said concerning that is different and the defence says contradicted by what [her mother] said about that and that is that she was there when her daughter accidentally fell off the chair.” (SU 33.4)

“Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in this case the Crown relies upon the evidence of the complainant … . Wherever the Crown seeks to establish the guilt of an accused person with a case based largely or exclusively on a single witness, it is important that the jury are told that they should exercise caution. That is what I am going to tell you now.

You must exercise caution before you convict the accused because the Crown case largely depends on you accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness. This being so, unless you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is both an honest and accurate witness in the account she has given, you cannot find the accused guilty.

Before you can convict the accused on any offence in the indictment you should examine the evidence of the essential Crown witness, the complainant, very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you can safely act upon that evidence and to the high standard required in a criminal trial. That caution is not based upon any personal view that I have of the essential Crown witness, the complainant. I told you at the outset of this summing up that I would not express my personal opinions on the evidence. But in any criminal trial, where the Crown case relies solely or substantially upon the evidence of a single witness, a jury must also always approach that evidence with particular caution because of the onus and standard of proof placed upon the Crown.

I am not suggesting to you that you are not entitled to find the accused guilty upon the evidence of the essential Crown witness, the complainant. Clearly, you are entitled to do so but only after you have carefully examined the evidence and satisfied yourself that it is reliable beyond reasonable doubt.” (SU 34.6)


	
	Apart from providing the warnings and guidance referred to, the trial judge accurately and comprehensively summarised the defence case. Relevant to the issues raised in the appeal were the following parts of that summary:
	


“Now, the key points for the defence, the defence submits that you would have significant doubts about the reliability, accuracy and truthfulness of the complainant. The complainant was at a tender age of 4 years and 3 months and she had been exhibiting behaviour problems for some time prior to the accused moving in in April 2011. And in particular, she had been showing overly affectionate behaviour towards teachers and other students.

When the complainant complained on 13 May 2011 she did not show signs of distress or fear. Her complaint to Miss Watters that she had no clothes on is inconsistent with what she said in her recorded interview. Her complaint to Amanda Gill, in the presence of her mother, that it happened “last night” is contradicted by the other evidence that shows that the accused had no opportunity to do anything on the night of 12 May 2011.

The fact that the complainant made a false complaint to Miss Watters that ML had pushed her off a chair and told her to lie to her mum about it shows that she was prepared to tell lies about the accused. It is significant that that lie was told shortly before the complainant told Miss Watters “ML put a banana up my bottom.”

In the recorded interview made on 18 May 2011 the complainant did not give any details about the allegations. She had said it happened at night time. The complainant was not able to be fully tested in cross-examination in this court. She could not remember where the alleged offences occurred in the house, her body position, if she saw the banana, how long was the banana, what colour was the banana, whether the banana touched her body. …” (SU 45.2)


	
	Defence counsel in his address to the jury said:
	


“Not only that, but she said that he told her to lie to her mother and tell her mum that she fell off and you'd consider that at least a reasonable possibility because of the lack of detail in the initial complaint and her complete inability to fill in any of the gaps at a later stage. I mean, it's not the accused's fault that she wasn't brought back in early, you know, maybe a month later after the first interview to seek to clarify what she'd said. They were just content to leave it at that, and then of course by the time we get to court she has no memory at all and is unable really to be effectively tested about her account.” (T.5.11.13 p18.49 – 19.6)

That proposition was not challenged by the Crown at any time during the trial.

THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The verdicts of the jury are factually inconsistent and are not reasonable.


	
	The appellant submitted that by reference to logic and reasonableness as an exercise in fact finding the two verdicts cannot stand together. This was because of the following considerations.
	



	
	Both counts relied entirely upon the account of the complainant. On the prosecution case, both counts related to events that occurred on the same occasion and were part of the same course of conduct.
	
	
	In the complainant’s testimony at trial, there was no significant difference in her allegations with respect to the two counts. She testified that she “sucked it [the banana juice] out of his biddie widdie” (T.16.4) and “He put the banana up my bottom three times” (T.32.18).
	
	
	There was no significant difference in the initial complaint. While there was no reference to the fellatio in what was said to Miss Watters on 13 May 2011, the Acting Director decided not to elicit a full account from the complainant but decided to refer the matter to DOCS. On that same day, the complainant told her mother “ML put a banana up my bottom and banana juice in my mouth”. That same day she told her uncle that the appellant “stuck it in my mouth and tried to stick it in my butt … he tried to stick a banana in my butt and stuck it in my mouth”.
	



	
	The appellant submitted that if the jury did not regard the complainant’s evidence as sufficiently reliable to be satisfied that the fellatio occurred, it was difficult to see how they could have been satisfied that the attempted penile penetration occurred. He submitted that there was no evidence in the trial which raised a doubt in respect of the fellatio allegation while not necessarily raising a similar doubt in respect of the attempt count. While accepting that a Markuleski warning had been given, the appellant submitted that it was difficult to understand how evidence which led to doubts about the alleged fellatio would not have also led to doubts about the attempted penile penetration.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles applicable when considering “apparent” inconsistent jury verdicts were comprehensively analysed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. Those principles have not been qualified in later cases. The plurality (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) recognised the advantage of a jury over an appellate court in relation to certain evidence:
	


“23   The case was one in which the jury's assessment of the three principal witnesses, the complainant, MA, and the appellant was vital. The alleged offences arose out of sexual activities between the appellant and boys of a much younger age. The activities were not brought to notice as a result of any complaint by the boys. When first approached by the police, they denied the activities. In court, they sought to explain this by fear and shame. Furthermore, in evaluating the effect of the evidence of MA, the jury were entitled to take account of his age at the time of the alleged events, and the possibility of some confusion on his part. None of this relieved the Court of Criminal Appeal of its responsibility in scrutinising the evidence, and making its own assessment of the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts. However, in making that assessment, the Court would properly have been conscious of the fact that there were aspects of the case that would not be reflected adequately in the written record.”


	
	The plurality also stressed the importance to be accorded to a jury verdict:
	


“34   Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. …”


	
	More recently, observations to similar effect were made by Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [135]:
	


“135   … But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

136    In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations …”


	
	On the facts of this case, there are at least two reasonable bases for the jury distinguishing between counts 1 and 2 without necessarily forming an adverse view to the complainant’s reliability or veracity. The lack of precision in her evidence and what she said in May 2011 is explained by her age at the time. The jury might also have had some doubts as to the accuracy of the evidence of family members such as her mother and her uncle, neither of whom reported the matter to the police and in circumstances where her mother had been in a relationship with the appellant. It was open to the jury to give more weight to the evidence of the non-family members, i.e. Miss Watters and Ms Gill, both of whom gave evidence that the complainant had only complained of the appellant putting “a banana in my bottom”. Alternatively, it was open to the jury to give greater weight to the initial complaints, than to those made later. The first explicit complaint was made to Miss Watters and it was restricted to “a banana in my bottom”. The initial complaint to her mother was also limited to putting a banana up her bottom. The first time that she told anyone about there being any “juice in my mouth” was when she spoke to her mother again later that evening when they were both alone at home.
	
	
	Another point of distinction on which the jury may have relied was the evidence relating to the confrontation between the complainant and the appellant. There was evidence from the mother and from the uncle that when she confronted the appellant with the complainant’s allegation that he had put a banana up her bottom and he denied it, the complainant intervened and said “He did”. The complainant maintained her allegation even when the appellant stared intently at her. It was well open to the jury to regard this as significant evidence of the appellant confronting his accuser and the complainant not being intimidated but staunchly maintaining her position.
	
	
	Another potential point of distinction is the confusion relating to the evidence of fellatio when compared to that relating to the banana in the bottom. There had been the early unfortunate mention of chocolate in the recorded interview of 18 May. The evidence concerning the banana juice and its relationship to chocolate in the recorded statement of 18 May 2011 was simply not clear. Most importantly, however, there was the evidence from the complainant and on the pornographic video of the girl with dark hair engaging in fellatio which the complainant had seen. Given the strong case put forward by the defence as to the impressionability of the complainant, and a tendency on her part to confabulate, the jury may well have thought that there was a reasonable hypothesis that the complainant’s evidence as to fellatio related to what she had seen on the video and not what had happened.
	
	
	It follows that it was open to the jury to distinguish the two counts on any of the above bases without disbelieving the complainant thereby giving rise to an inconsistency and an unreasonable verdict. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The trial judge erred in failing to give a warning to the jury in respect of the evidence of LB (the complainant).


	
	In order to understand the submissions on this ground, it is necessary to set out the relevant sections of the Evidence Act 1999.
	


“165(1)      This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

(a)    evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) applies,

…

(2)    If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a)     warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b)    inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c)    warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3)    The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4)    It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

(5)    This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6)   Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with subsection 165A(2) and (3).”

“165A(1) A judge in any proceeding in which evidence is given by a child before a jury must not do any of the following:

(a)    warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that children as a class are unreliable witnesses,

(b)    warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that the evidence of children as a class is inherently less credible or reliable, or requires more careful scrutiny, than the evidence of adults,

(c)    give a warning, or suggestion to the jury, about the unreliability of the particular child’s evidence solely on account of the age of the child,

(d)    in the case of a criminal proceeding - give a general warning to the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness who is a child.

(2)    Subsection (1) does not prevent the judge, at the request of a party, from:

(a)    informing the jury that the evidence of the particular child may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable, and

(b)    warning or informing the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the particular child and the weight to be given to it,

if the party has satisfied the court that there are circumstances (other than solely the age of the child) particular to the child that affect the reliability of the child’s evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information.

(3)    This section does not affect any other power of a judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.”


	
	The appellant submitted that warnings should have been given pursuant to s165 because of the forensic disadvantage caused to him by the complainant’s inability to remember at trial what she had said in her statement of 18 May 2011. The forensic disadvantage was that the appellant was not able to cross-examine the complainant effectively as to what she had said in the statement.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that by analogy the situation was the same as that identified by Howie J in R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328; 133 A Crim R 227. At [37] – [38] Howie J (with whom Meagher JA and Simpson J agreed) described how delay in complaint could forensically disadvantage an accused and for this reason, it was necessary for a warning to be given so as to ensure that a fair trial took place. While accepting that no delay had occurred here, the appellant submitted that the same issue arose, i.e., he was unable to properly cross-examine the complainant because of her lack of memory which was almost the same situation which would arise if significant delay in complaint had occurred.
	
	
	When asked by the Court to formulate the warning which should have been given by the trial judge, the appellant responded as follows:
	


“… Evidence has been given by the complainant in the trial in which it is clear that she has been unable to provide details of the offences, and indeed asserts that she has no substantial memory of those events and no memory whatsoever of what she told the police in the interview with them in May 2011. I must warn you that in those circumstances where she asserts that she has no memory or no substantial memory, that her evidence may be unreliable in the sense that it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the defence to test that evidence, either to test the details of the allegations that were made to the police in May 2011, or to elicit further detail which might be sought to undermine the reliability or to undermine the evidence of the complainant.

It is something that is well accepted within our courts that one of the purposes of cross-examination, and one of the reasons why the defence is permitted to cross-examine witnesses is to allow the defence to test evidence adduced by the prosecution for the purposes of seeking to demonstrate weaknesses in that evidence, or to elicit further material to raise, as I say, a doubt with respect to those allegations. The defence is substantially unable to do that in this case for the reason that the complainant, perhaps not unreasonably given her age, says that she has no real memory of what happened two and a half years ago.

This is no criticism of the complainant, it is merely a warning I give you that it puts the defence in a very difficult position, and I warn you of the need for caution in determining whether in the light of those forensic difficulties confronted by the defence whether or not you do ultimately accept the evidence of the complainant, and I warn you that you should bear in mind when you are assessing the weight you give to the complainant’s evidence those difficulties confronted by defence counsel.” (AT 4.36 – 5.13)


	
	The appellant submitted that her Honour had erred in rejecting the defence’s application for a warning under s165. He submitted that the fact that the complainant’s lack of memory at trial may have resulted from her age was not a good reason for declining to give the warning. This was because the warning did not relate solely to the complainant’s age. He submitted that the warning was not being sought because of the complainant’s age but because of the forensic disadvantage caused to him by the complainant’s inability to remember what had occurred in May 2011.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that a warning was necessary because the jury would not have understood the significance of the forensic disadvantage to which he was exposed because of the complainant’s lack of memory. He submitted that this was a subtle disadvantage which required a specific warning from the trial judge. On that issue, he relied upon what was said by Howie J in R v DBG at [37] and [38]. He submitted that where such a forensic difficulty arose, it was necessary for the trial judge to bring home to the jury the consequences which that forensic difficulty gave rise to, i.e. the inability to test a fundamental part of the Crown’s case.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that it was not sufficient for the trial judge to summarise the defence submissions and to specifically refer to that forensic disadvantage in that summary. He submitted that what was required was for the judge to give a specific warning along the lines which he suggested which carried with it the specific endorsement of the Court. The appellant submitted that what was needed was a warning to the effect that the evidence might be unreliable and that there was a need for caution in determining whether or not to accept it and the weight to be given to it.
	


Consideration


	
	As was raised in oral submissions before the Court, a proper reading of the application made at trial and how her Honour dealt with it in her judgment, makes it clear that the application was made pursuant to s165A(2). What counsel at trial was seeking was a warning which related specifically to the complainant and the various personality and psychological problems which she had which might render her evidence unreliable, i.e. the matters referred to by Dr Gardiner, i.e. that she was indiscriminately and inappropriately affectionate and may well have had a reactive attachment disorder based on some degree of preceding emotional deprivation.
	
	
	If that were the application made at trial, it was appropriately dealt with by her Honour. As her Honour pointed out, a crucial issue in the trial was the reliability of the complainant. Her unreliability and tendency to tell untrue stories was the basis of the defence case. There was no useful purpose to be served by her Honour providing a warning beyond those which she had already given in circumstances where the warning would simply restate a primary issue to be decided in the trial. The other difficulty as her Honour recognised was that the complainant’s age was inextricably linked to the arguments directed at her reliability. The psychological issue which the defence sought to include as part of the warning was two edged. It also meant that the complainant would be more liable to exploitation of the kind which occurred which might also explain her lack of distress when relating to various persons what she said the appellant had done to her.
	
	
	To the extent that this ground of appeal is based on the actual application made at trial, it should be dismissed.
	
	
	From the oral submissions in the appeal, and most particularly from the formulation of the warning which the appellant says should have been given, the issue raised in Ground 2 is different to that raised at trial. Although defence counsel at trial was aware of, and submitted that the complainant’s lack of memory gave rise to a forensic disadvantage for the defence, that was not the basis of his application for a warning.
	
	
	If that is the case, Ground 2 raises an issue which was not raised at trial and leave is required under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Because the matter was fully argued and it was asserted to give rise to a miscarriage of justice, I would grant leave.
	
	
	While there is an initial plausibility to the analogy which the appellant seeks to draw between the need to provide a warning in the case of delay, such as arose in DBG and the circumstances of this case, there are important differences.
	
	
	The forensic disadvantage for the appellant in not being able to cross-examine the complainant in relation to her statement was inextricably linked to the complainant’s age. That issue arises in most cases where sexual offending occurs to a very young child. In this case, there was nothing subtle about the forensic disadvantage. It was obvious to the jury for a number of reasons. Defence counsel had specifically referred to it. Her Honour had set it out more precisely in her summing up. The responses by the complainant in cross-examination further highlighted the issue.
	
	
	Importantly, and unlike the situation which arises in the case of delay, the defence had available to it evidence of contemporaneous complaints and a lengthy statement made within 10 days of the offending. There were differences and inconsistencies in that evidence which provided the defence with fertile ground for comment and challenges to the complainant’s reliability. Apart from the appellant’s denials in evidence, it was this which formed the core of the appellant’s defence. The jury were well aware of the issue of the complainant’s reliability since it was stressed, not only by the defence and her Honour, but by the Crown.
	
	
	The appellant’s submissions and the analogy sought to be drawn with the situation which arises where delay has occurred, significantly exaggerate the extent of the forensic disadvantage. With delay, such as occurred in DBG, an accused is prevented by the effluxion of time from making any meaningful challenge to the complainant’s evidence. He or she may not remember where they were, what they were doing and any other surrounding circumstances. That was not the case here. The appellant was fully aware of all the circumstances and able to meet them by his direct evidence and by his ability to cross-examine other witnesses besides the complainant. One also needs to keep in mind that cross-examination of a 4 year old complainant (such as is postulated here) even close in time to when complaints or statements were made may well be unproductive, or even counter-productive, as a result of the complainant’s age and the nature of the offending.
	
	
	It follows that a fair trial took place and that there was no miscarriage of justice. The jury were clearly aware of the fundamental issues, particularly the reliability of the complainant since that had been stressed by the parties and by her Honour’s forceful Murray direction. To the extent that the appellant suffered a forensic disadvantage by not being able to cross-examine the complainant on her statement, that disadvantage was modest given the availability of contemporaneous material relating to the complaint. It is a trite observation that a fair trial does not mean a perfect trial.
	
	
	I have concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, no further warning was required by her Honour to ensure a fair trial and that no miscarriage of justice took place. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave is granted to the appellant to rely upon Ground 2 of the appeal.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL for the reasons given by his Honour.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		06 March 2015",2015-03-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765998,Mohareb v Palmer [2015] NSWDC 134,"Judgment


	
	These are reasons for the rulings that I made on 5 March 2015 refusing to make the order for summary dismissal sought by the defendants and directing the plaintiff to file a further amended statement of claim.
	
	
	The defendants bring an application for summary dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim pursuant to r 12.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) by reason of asserted defects in successive statements of claim and failures to provide answers to particulars.
	
	
	The application was foreshadowed on 17 November 2014. An amended draft pleading prepared by Mr Dibb of counsel was provided and an application to strike out portions of the statement of claim, as well as for summary judgment, was listed for argument on Friday 20 February 2015.
	
	
	On 20 February 2015 neither party was ready to proceed, and I made orders which included the following:
	



	
	Defendant’s application to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim is listed for argument before Gibson DCJ on Thursday 5 March 2015 at 2:00pm (estimate 2 hours).
	



	
	Mr Mohareb has been conducting these proceedings as a litigant in person, although he has had some assistance in relation to the drafting of pleadings. It should have been clear to him, from the orders made, that the application before the court was an application for summary dismissal and not just an argument about imputations. As it happens, it was readily apparent to me, without calling upon Mr Mohareb, that the proceedings should not be summarily dismissed, but his unreadiness for the application is indicative of his lack of understanding of the litigation process. However, that unreadiness added to the time spent on this application, which must be taken into account in relation to costs issues.
	
	
	I shall first set out the matters complained of and imputations, and then outline the basis upon which summary dismissal was sought by the defendants.
	


The matters complained of


	
	The first matter complained of consists of a series of noticeboard posters posted in public areas around Scotland Island.
	
	
	The text of the first matter complained of is as follows:
	


“ATTENTION ISLAND RESIDENTS

WARNING!

[Photograph of the Plaintiff]

Nader MOHAREB

Born [D.O.B] – CAIRO EGYPT

For those of you have not had the ‘pleasure’ of meeting Nader please be aware he is highly

volatile individual, prone to manic outbursts. He is often abusive and threatening - particularly

towards women and children.

He is easily recognisable by the ridiculous bum bag he wears, from which he is prone to pull a

mobile phone and film you, and the large Bluetooth ear piece permanently lodged in his ear.

Of the many incidents which have occurred since he arrived on the island – most seem to

resolve [sic] around his objection to controlling his 2 King Charles Cocker Spaniel dogs on a

leash

whilst in public places. The dogs, like their owner, are often agitated and highly excitable.

The

dogs can be as intimidating as their supposed Master.

Nader is known to NSW Police, and should you be threatened by him you are urged to

contact Broken Bay Water Police immediately on 9910 or [mobile number].

Nader’s behaviour is often bizzare and unpredictable and residents are warned to avoid

approaching or confronting him.

Complaints about his unleashed dogs or their mess Nader refuses to pick up should be made

directly to Pittwater Council on [telephone] or by email to

[email address]”


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the first matter complained of are as follows (at paragraph 5 of the Draft Amended Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is mentally unstable.
	
	
	The plaintiffs [sic] is a sociopath.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a bully who picks on women and children.
	
	
	The community should avoid all contact with the plaintiff as there are reasonable grounds to suspect that his aggression and unpredictability may lead him to commit physical acts of violence on members of the community.
	
	
	The plaintiff is abusive and threatening toward women and children.
	
	
	The plaintiff has a history of criminal violence; or, alternatively
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being a dangerously violent man.
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being mentally unstable.
	



	
	The second matter complained of, which is not attached as it was taken down from Facebook before it could be copied, is a photograph posted on Facebook showing the first matter complained of.
	
	
	The same imputations are pleaded to arise from the second matter complained of as for the first, namely (at paragraph 7):
	



	
	The plaintiff is mentally unstable.
	
	
	The plaintiffs [sic] is a sociopath.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a bully who picks on women and children.
	
	
	The community should avoid all contact with the plaintiff as there are reasonable grounds to suspect that his aggression and unpredictability may lead him to commit physical acts of violence on members of the community.
	
	
	The plaintiff is abusive and threatening toward women and children.
	
	
	The plaintiff has a history of criminal violence; or, alternatively
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being a dangerously violent man.
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being mentally unstable.
	



	
	The third matter complained of appears to stem from the Facebook postings subsequent to the removal of the second matter complained of. The third matter complained of, looking at the document attached to the statement of claim, consists of a series of comments on the “Scotland Island Community” Facebook account posted over a period of some hours on 21 July 2014. There also appears to be a pixelated version of the second matter complained of at lines 14-17.
	
	
	The text of this matter complained of is as follows:

	The imputations pleaded to arise from the first defendant’s contribution to the third matter complained of are as follows (at paragraph 9):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a dangerously violent man.
	
	
	The plaintiff is contemptuous of accepted social conventions and decorum.
	
	
	The plaintiff is guilty of having committed a shameful or criminal act for which he deserves to be “named and shamed” and “outed”.
	
	
	The plaintiff is guilty of having committed a shameful or criminal act by which he has forfeited and deserves to be stripped of and denied his civil rights.
	



	
	Although not specifically referred to in the Draft Amended Statement of Claim, the fourth matter complained of appears to refer to the comments by the second defendant, Annette Palmer, in the third matter complained of (at lines 32-37).
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the fourth matter complained of are as follows (at paragraph 10):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a dangerously violent man.
	
	
	The plaintiff by his presence constitutes such a menace as to infringe on other people’s freedom to go for a walk.
	


The defendants’ application


	
	The defendants’ application is brought on the following bases:
	



	
	There is what Mr Lewis calls a “long and unfortunate history” of the plaintiff failing to attend to inadequacies in the pleading of this claim, as well as in answering particulars. The original statement of claim was filed on 19 August 2014 and then amended on 7 November and 18 December 2014. Nevertheless, its contents are still deficient.
	
	
	Additionally, Mr Lewis complains that this is the fifth time the matter had been in court, although it was the first time the matter had been listed for any contested application to be heard.
	
	
	Mr Lewis also relied upon plaintiff’s failure to reply to what he called “requests for particulars” on three occasions (see Exhibit A, which consists of letters dated 14 November and 17 December 2014 and 17 February 2015). Although particulars had been provided when the defendants had been acting for themselves, those particulars had been deficient and more particulars were needed.
	
	
	There was a seven month delay in these proceedings as a result of the defaults. The defendants were persons of limited means who had to borrow money in order to pay the legal costs of these proceedings.
	



	
	The circumstances in which proceedings may be struck out for failure to comply with orders, failure to provide adequate pleadings and failure to provide adequate particulars are reviewed and discussed in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288 and Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244. The failure to answer particulars is viewed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as a particularly grave step, even where those particulars are not sanctioned by a timetable: Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd, supra.
	
	
	As to the letters from the defendants’ solicitors, Mr Mohareb pointed out that the first letter, dated 14 November 2014, did not contain any request for particulars. As to the remaining two letters, Mr Mohareb reminded me that I had indicated in court when listing this argument, in relation to the letter of 17 December 2014 and 17 February 2015, that the preferable course was for the issues relating to the pleadings to be settled before parties sought particulars.
	
	
	This was in fact the course I took, on the basis that publication, including particulars as to the downloading of the internet publications by identifiable persons, must be set out in the statement of claim, rather than the subject of particulars in correspondence.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the plaintiff failed to provide these particulars in any contumelious fashion. The problem is that he has failed to understand what particulars of publication are required, and that he must set these out in the statement of claim.
	
	
	There has been delay in this matter, which includes the failure of both parties to be ready on the last occasion, and there are defects in the statement of claim. The current statement of claim is a considerable improvement upon the poorly drafted document the plaintiff initially submitted to the court. A significant part of the delay in these proceedings has been the plaintiff’s unyielding approach to the litigation generally.
	
	
	However, there is a compelling factual reason why I should not accept the defendants’ submission that there are totally inadequate particulars of publication warranting the dismissal of the defamation claims in these proceedings. As the third matter complained of shows, the first defendant admits, in his Facebook entry which forms part of that publication, that he uploaded the poster that is the second matter complained of, and the circumstances in which both he and the second defendant made posts on the website for the purposes of the third publication are such that requirements for particulars will be straightforward. It is really only the first matter complained of (namely the poster which was placed around the island) for which any application for summary dismissal could have any hope for success.
	
	
	Courts should be careful not to be too ready to accede to requests for summary dismissal of proceedings on the basis of delay, failure to answer correspondence and pleadings failures, particularly where the party in default is a litigant in person, the issues of law are complex, there are no actual failures to comply with timetables and the claim (or defence) is not unmeritorious on its face. Such applications seem to be particularly common in defamation proceedings; in both Facer v Wolfe (2013) 17 DCLR (NSW) 391; Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244 failure to answer a request for particulars, sent without the benefit of a timetable, by a party itself in breach of the timetable, resulted in summary judgment. Where possible, courts should determine cases on their merits, rather than encourage parties to exchange requests for information for a wide range of information, some of which may be irrelevant, obvious, prolix or misconceived.
	
	
	The plaintiff must, however, provide particulars of publication in relation to the each of the matters complained of, identifying:
	



	
	As to the first matter complained of, the facts and matters relied upon to establish that each of the defendants was the person who wrote and/or posted the posters, and information sufficient to ensure that some third party saw those posters;
	
	
	As to each of the subsequent publications, particulars of when and by whom each was downloaded, as well as the facts and matters relied upon to establish that each of the defendants was a publisher (and identifying each such publication with precision).
	


When those particulars of publication are provided, the defendants can consider whether they wish to bring a further application for the summary dismissal of any of the claims for defamation. The circumstances in which a court will be prepared to consider such an application where there are disputed issues of fact as to publication would, however, need to be to the level required by Simpson J in Frawley v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 248 at [12] – [20], citing Byrne v Deane [1937] 1 KB 818 and Bishop v New South Wales [2000] NSWSC 1042. For example, as to the first matter complained of, even if those particulars are no more than a suspicion that one or both of the defendants should be suspected of being an author by reason of the subsequent endorsement of this publication as well as its republication on Facebook (which I apprehend is the plaintiff’s basis for this claim), that may be sufficient, on the very low bar as explained by Simpson J, for the plaintiff to avoid summary dismissal. However, much will depend upon how the plaintiff particularises this claim.


	
	While I am not prepared to strike out the defamation claims summarily, the delays and the inadequacies of pleading over the past seven months are unacceptable. Having regard to the difficulties and expense caused to the defendants by the plaintiff’s failure to plead and particularise this case to date, I have made a costs order in favour of the defendants which is assessable and payable forthwith, rather than at the conclusion of these proceedings. The defendants are not, however, excused from their obligations to provide a memorandum of costs in assessable form should such a request be made by the plaintiff.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the defects in the statement of claim. I shall first deal with the objections to the imputations pleaded for the first matter complained of. I apprehend that the defendants are considering a jury trial and have made orders accordingly.
	


The first matter complained of

Imputation (a) – The plaintiff is mentally unstable.


	
	The objection previously taken to this imputation in correspondence, on the basis that it was incapable of being defamatory, was withdrawn.
	


Imputation (b) – The plaintiffs [sic] is a sociopath.


	
	The term “sociopath” is objectionable in form because it purports to apply a pseudo-medical diagnosis to the conduct attributed to the plaintiff. The pleader appears to be avoiding the many disparaging allegations in the matter complained of, such as having manic outbursts and behaving bizarrely and unpredictably. It will not be difficult for this imputation to be repleaded. More than one imputation will probably be necessary.
	


Imputation (c) – The plaintiff is a bully who picks on women and children.


	
	The plaintiff withdrew this imputation as it is acknowledged it does not differ in substance from (e).
	


Imputation (d) – The community should avoid all contact with the plaintiff as there are reasonable grounds to suspect that his aggression and unpredictability may lead him to commit physical acts of violence on members of the community.


	
	This imputation needs to be pleaded in such a way that there is an act or condition by the plaintiff which differs in substance from the other imputations pleaded. The imputation in its current form does not identify what that act or condition may be. This imputation was accordingly struck out with leave to replead. Again, more than one imputation may be necessary.
	


Imputation (e) – The plaintiff is abusive and threatening toward women and children.


	
	As imputation (c) is withdrawn the defendants no longer object to this imputation.
	


Imputation (f) – The plaintiff has a history of criminal violence; or, alternatively

Imputation (g) – The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being a dangerously violent man.


	
	Both these imputations come from the reference to the plaintiff being “known to police”. That does not impute convictions, or violent actions, or even suspicion of such conduct; the inference is that police know about the problems with his dogs and the other conduct referred to in the matter complained of, not that he is dangerously violent or that he has a history of criminal violence. These imputations overstate the allegations to such an extent that they are not capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	These imputations are struck out, but with leave to replead, in order to capture the sting of the plaintiff being “known to police” in the context of the conduct complained of.
	


Imputation (h) – The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by police of being mentally unstable.


	
	The matter complained of indicates that the plaintiff is known to police, the inference being, from the following sentence, that his behaviour is so bizarre and unpredictable that residents are warned (by inference, on police advice) to avoid approaching or confronting him. From the plaintiff’s submissions, he appears to be attempting to plead an imputation to this effect.
	
	
	However, the matter complained of does not infer that the police have a belief as to his mental stability (or lack thereof). This imputation should be repleaded to encapsulate the sting that is conveyed in these two sentences about the need for residents to avoid approaching or confronting him.
	


The remaining publications


	
	It is premature to deal with objections to the remaining imputations. As I indicated above, the principal reason why I did not summarily dismiss the defamation proceedings is the admission by the first defendant, Mr Matt Palmer, in his Facebook entry which forms part of the third matter complained of, that he was the person who uploaded a copy of the poster which is the first matter complained of onto the Scotland Island Community Facebook page. This publication was then removed by the person or persons with responsibility for the Scotland Island Community Facebook page, who may be taken as persons who read the second matter complained of.
	
	
	Accordingly, the second matter complained of needs to be pleaded as consisting of the first matter complained of, as published on the internet for a comparatively brief period, by either the first defendant only or, if the plaintiff asserts that the second defendant played some role, identifying what that role was. The imputations conveyed would of course be the same for the first matter complained of; if there is some extraneous material in addition to the first matter complained of, that would need to be identified.
	
	
	Subsequent to the posting of the second matter complained of on Facebook being taken down, the “Scotland Island Community Moderators” appear, from the third matter complained of (see lines 3 to 17 of the text set out above), to have re-posted this in circumstances where the plaintiff’s image was pixelated and where the relevant document does not contain the words of the matter complained of. I do not understand the plaintiff to bring proceedings against the Scotland Island Community Moderators for this publication; clearly it forms part of the context in which there are comments published by both Mr and Mrs Palmer and as such forms part of the discussion thread that is currently pleaded as the third matter complained of. The question of whether it in some way repeats the matter complained of, independently of those comments or together with them, is an issue of real difficulty.
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Palmer have made posts at separate times later on the same day. One of the difficulties with internet publications is whether these should be treated as the same or separate publications. What should be done in relation to each of these publications is that the relevant imputations, together with the line numbers for each imputation, should be set out, and a decision made about whether to plead this as a whole publication or a series.
	
	
	The correct pleading of the Facebook publication poses real difficulties even to the experienced pleader. While the plaintiff was indignant that the pleadings put forward by the two experienced barristers he consulted required any amendment, the problems caused by a series of publications which include the taking down and pixelation of the second matter complained of will require very careful drafting. I encourage the plaintiff to continue to consult skilled counsel in this area.
	


Particulars of downloading and identification


	
	As indicated above, the particulars of publication should include references to the downloading of the Facebook page by such person or persons as are known to the plaintiff. Although Mr Mohareb was inclined to be dismissive of his obligation to provide such particulars, they are essential: see Jenman v McIntyre [2013] NSWSC 1100 citing Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575, and should have been included in previous drafts of the statement of claim.
	
	
	When the amended pleading is provided in proper form, the defendants’ objections to the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded as having arisen from the Facebook page entries by Mr and Mrs Palmer respectively may be dealt with. The imputations arising from the publication by Mr Palmer of the Facebook comments may well be the same as for the poster, but I am reluctant to speculate, particularly as there seems to have been an additional publication by him, comparing the plaintiff to Satan.
	
	
	Although not raised before me, I suspect that identification will later be an issue to be raised by the defendants in relation to the third matter complained of, as the plaintiff is referred to as “this individual” rather than by name. Particulars of how the plaintiff is identifiable (namely to persons who saw the second matter complained of before it was pixelated and/or saw the poster in the neighbourhood and/or are familiar with the ongoing saga) would also be advisable.
	


The personal injury claims


	
	The application before me for summary dismissal related only to the defamation claims. However, an application to strike out the claims for assault on the basis that these were claims which would result only in nominal damages and no injury was suffered were foreshadowed when the proceedings were before me in December 2014.
	
	
	While the courts have been prepared to take a dismissive view of claims seen as “small claims” (Cranbrook School v Stanley [2002] NSWCA 290), this is not a course which should be embarked upon lightly. Although Mr Lewis describes the assault claims as very minor, this is not a conclusion that should be arrived at until the nature and extent of any ongoing disabilities can be clarified. The problem is that Mr Mohareb has not filed the statement of particulars required for claims for personal injury. In particular, if Mr Mohareb is bringing a claim for any physical injury, he needs not only to file a statement of particulars but to serve any medical evidence, including expert reports upon which he proposes to rely upon.
	
	
	These are matters which, although not referred to by either party to date, should be addressed in future directions hearings. In the course of making submissions, Mr Mohareb spoke in distressed way about what he called the “vendetta” against him by his neighbours, which included his tyres being slashed, the acts of assault pleaded, and the putting up of the poster and Facebook material which is the subject of the defamation claims. If he has a claim for injury to health, this will need to be pleaded and particularised with some care, with regard to whether this was caused by the assault, the publication of the defamatory material, or a combination of the above. Again, I encourage him to seek skilled legal advice on this topic.
	


Orders


	
	Imputations 5(a) and 5(e) will go to the jury.
	
	
	Strike out imputation 5(b) with leave to replead on the basis that “sociopath” is not conveyed.
	
	
	Imputation 5(c) is withdrawn.
	
	
	Grant leave to the plaintiff to replead imputation 5(d) to capture the sting of aggression and unpredictability.
	
	
	Imputations 5(f) and 5(g) are struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Imputation 5(h) is struck out.
	
	
	Defer the objections taken to the third and fourth matters complained of until a Further Amended Statement of Claim, in draft, is provided by the plaintiff. The Further Amended Statement of Claim must also include full particulars of publication of each of the matters complained of by each of the defendants, such order to be self-executing in nature.
	
	
	Additionally, all publications online must identify publication by downloading by an identifiable person or persons (for example, the person who took down the poster, or the persons who identified themselves on Facebook as having read that poster), such order to be self-executing in nature.
	
	
	The Second Further Amended Statement of Claim is to be provided to the court and the defendants in 28 days.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants’ costs of the application today and of the listing on 20 February 2015, such costs to be assessable and payable forthwith.
	
	
	Defendants’ notice of motion stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 23 April 2015 at 2:00pm.

		27 July 2015",2015-03-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766000,R v Kelsall (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 252,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Crown case is that the accused followed the deceased from the Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay to the deceased’s nearby home in Watson Street. It is alleged that the accused entered the deceased’s apartment and there, in the deceased’s bedroom, committed the two offences. The deceased’s flat mate was alerted to sounds coming from his bedroom. She went to investigate and found the deceased on the floor covered in blood. The immediate investigation established that he had died from the effects of multiple stab wounds.
	
	
	The issue with which this judgment is concerned is the manner of presentation by the Crown of CCTV footage showing the deceased arriving at the Oaks Hotel, having a drink and then leaving the hotel to walk home. The CCTV also contains footage of the accused in the general area whilst the deceased is in the hotel. It then shows the accused following the deceased as the deceased walks away from the hotel up until the point where he crosses Military Road at Watson Street.
	
	
	There is no objection by the accused to any of this footage. The objection is to the proposal by the Crown to present some of the footage side by side; that is, footage of the deceased sitting in the hotel alongside footage of the accused standing around on the footpath in Ben Boyd Road across from the hotel. It was contended that this manner of presentation would be prejudicial in that it could be misused by the jury.
	
	
	Mr Watson submitted that it was not clear whether the timing of the two pieces of footage has been synchronised. He said that “there’s aspects of distance between where the two people are” and “matters of distance and lighting may dissipate if the jury sees those two images together” (2.3.15 T71.35). In other words, viewing the two pieces of footage simultaneously might distract the jury from matters such as distance and lighting (2.3.15 T71.35-71.45).
	
	
	The Crown provided the disc containing the relevant CCTV footage. I have viewed in chambers what it proposes to display to the jury. It runs for about 54 minutes. Roughly half of it has footage side by side. It shows the deceased sitting in the hotel having a beer whilst a camera from within the Curry Palace across the road shows the accused on the footpath immediately outside. There is not a lot of activity involving either the deceased or the accused in these scenes. There is certainly no interaction between them and, it seems to me, the only significance of it is that it shows where each of them were, during the time when the deceased was inside the hotel. I was assured by the Crown Prosecutor that the two pieces of footage have been closely synchronised in terms of time and efforts are continuing in that respect. I do not consider that exact synchronisation is essential, given the minimal significance of these parts of the footage.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that there is anything prejudicial to the accused in the manner in which the Crown proposes to present this evidence to the jury.
	
	
	The disc which contains CCTV footage, some of which shows footage from two sources displayed side by side, is admissible.

		18 March 2015",2015-03-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766001,NSW Crime Commission v Christopher Mihelic [2015] NSWSC 166,"Judgment


	
	This is an application brought by summons by the NSW Crime Commission (“the Commission”) seeking orders pursuant to s.10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”) to restrain any person from dealing in an interest in property, the property being that listed in three schedules to the summons. The owner of the property is Christopher Mihelic.
	
	
	Section 10A provides for such applications to be heard ex parte, and this application proceeded in the absence of Mr. Mihelic.
	
	
	The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne, a forensic accountant employed by the Commission, of 3 March 2015. Ms. Bourne, who is an authorised officer within the meaning of s.4(1) of the Act, deposes that, having had access to material produced as a consequence of the investigation conducted by the NSW Police into Mr. Mihelic, and to financial information relating to the defendant, she suspects Mr. Mihelic of involvement in serious crime related activities as defined by s.6, being the commission of offences of supplying a prohibited drug (s.25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985), and supplying commercial and large commercial quantities of a prohibited drug (s.25(2) of the same Act).
	
	
	Each of these offences is a serious criminal offence as provided by s.6(2)(d) of the Act.
	
	
	Ms. Bourne formed the suspicions she holds after having corresponded with the police officer in charge of the investigation into Mr. Mihelic’s drug related activity, and having seen charge details and a statement of facts against Mr. Mihelic. Copies of relevant documentation forms part of the evidence before the Court.
	
	
	Having read the evidentiary material I am satisfied that the suspicions held by Ms. Bourne are reasonably held.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court concludes that the suspicion held by the authorised officer is reasonably held.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the defendant is a resident of New South Wales, and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is located in New South Wales.
	
	
	There is an issue as to whether notice is to be given to the defendant before the Court makes an order (s.10A(4)), but the evidence before the Court, which I accept, is that property of the nature listed in the schedules can be rapidly disposed of by those inclined to do so. In all of the circumstances, it is appropriate to make the order prior to notice being given to the defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff is given leave to file in court the summons and supporting material.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the Commission in the usual terms.
	
	
	Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor is noted) and considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 3 March 2015, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions stated therein. 
	
	
	The Court orders:
	


(i)Pursuant to section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in section 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of Christopher Mihelic, including his interest in property in the property specified in Schedule One hereto and Schedule Two hereto.

(ii)Pursuant to subparagraph 12 (1) (b) (i) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 Christopher Mihelic shall be examined on oath before a Registrar of the Court concerning his affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest.

(iii)Pursuant to subparagraph 12 (1) (b) (ii) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 Sonya Mihelic shall be examined on oath before a Registrar of the Court concerning the affairs of Christopher Mihelic, including the nature and location of any property in which Christopher Mihelic has an interest.

(iv)Leave is granted to the Plaintiff to obtain from the Registry dates for the examinations ordered in Orders 2 and 3 above.

(v)Pursuant to paragraph 12 (1) (c1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 Christopher Mihelic shall furnish to the Plaintiff, within twenty one (21) days after service of a sealed copy of these orders on Christopher Mihelic, a statement verified by oath or affirmation of Christopher Mihelic setting out the particulars sought in Schedule Three hereto.

(vi)Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and Christopher Mihelic to apply on three (3) days’ notice.

SCHEDULE ONE

2766009,Leichhardt Council v Geitonia Pty Ltd (No 5) [2015] NSWLEC 33,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	This appears to be the first criminal trial in this Court in which consent orders are to be made that the parties’ experts give evidence concurrently and confer beforehand in order to identify any matters on which they agree, matters on which they disagree and the reasons for disagreement. However, concurrent expert evidence has been given by consent in at least one earlier sentencing hearing in this Court. In civil matters in this Court’s jurisdiction, the Court is empowered to, and normally does, give such directions where there is expert evidence on both sides. In criminal prosecutions in Class 5 of the Court’s jurisdiction, the Court has no power to give such directions except with the consent of the parties: Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd (No 3) [2010] NSWLEC 135, (2010) 175 LGERA 160 (Pepper J). There is no reason why parties in a criminal matter cannot agree to that salutary process: Sutherland Shire Council v Benedict Industries Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 121 at [36] (Biscoe J)
	
	
	Briefly, the background is that the three defendants are charged with demolishing the front façade of a building on Parramatta Road, Annandale without development consent where consent was required and contrary to the terms of a development consent. Two of the defendants, Mr Bill Gertos and his company Geitonia Pty Ltd, have recently given notice of a defence that it was necessary to demolish the façade because of its condition. On that issue the prosecution has obtained a report from an expert witness and the defendants have retained an expert to provide a report in response. The prosecution expert is due to give his evidence at the end of the prosecution case (being the next day of the trial). Upon my raising the question with counsel, the prosecutor and those defendants consented to the directions to which I have referred.
	
	
	By consent the Court directs that:
	



	
	In relation to the defence of necessity, the prosecution expert and the expert for the defendants Geitonia Pty Ltd and Bill Gertos give evidence concurrently at the end of the prosecution case.
	
	
	Prior to giving their evidence, the experts are to confer in order to identify and report to the Court on any matters on which they agree, and the matters on which they disagree and the reasons for their disagreement. If time permits, they are to reduce their report to the Court to writing.

2766015,State of New South Wales v Galanis [2015] NSWSC 133,"Judgment


	
	The State of New South Wales (the State) is applying for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) in respect of Bill (William) Galanis. Mr Galanis opposes the order and, if he is unsuccessful in that opposition opposes some of the conditions sought by the State. In particular, Mr Galanis opposes a condition requiring him to wear electronic monitoring equipment and a requirement that he provide the officers responsible for his supervision with a periodic schedule of his intended movements. He also opposes an order authorising the State to release psychiatric evidence provided to the Court to his treating doctors and Corrective Services NSW, the officers of which will be responsible for the administration of any order.
	
	
	Mr Galanis also argues that it is unnecessary in the circumstances of the case that any order I am persuaded to make should have the maximum permissible duration of five years.
	


Background


	
	As contemplated by the legislation, an interim supervision order was imposed by Hall J on 4th December 2014 (State of New South Wales v Galanis (unreported)). That order was renewed, by consent, by Button J on 2nd February 2015. It expired on 3rd March 2015.
	
	
	Hall J’s order commenced on 9th December 2014. Under s 10C(2) the Court is empowered to renew an interim supervision order “from time to time” but not so as to exceed “periods totalling more than three months”. At the conclusion of the hearing before me on 25th February 2015, by consent, I further renewed the interim supervision order so that it expires on 8th March 2015.
	


Serious sex offender and unacceptable risk


	
	Upon his plea of guilty in the District Court on 23rd May 2006, Mr Galanis was convicted and sentenced by Murrell SC DCJ (as her Honour then was) for two counts of sexual intercourse under s 61I Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and a third count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The total effective sentence imposed by the sentencing judge commenced on 10th June 2005 and expired on 6th December 2014 allowing for the accumulation and concurrency fixed by her Honour. This is a period of nine years and six months. The effective non-parole period ran from 10th June 2005 to 9th December 2011, totalling six years and six months. Mr Galanis was not released to parole until 26th September 2012.
	
	
	Four further offences being three counts of indecent assault and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the victim were included on a Form 1, and taken into account when the sentencing judge dealt with Mr Galanis.
	
	
	At the time of the offending, the victim was a child, 15 years and 4 months of age. Accordingly, each of the offences contrary to s 61I Crimes Act was a serious sex offence within the meaning of s 5 of the Act because each was punishable by imprisonment for more than 7 years, namely 14 years, and the victim was then a child. Ms S Hall of Counsel who appears for Mr Galanis accepts that this is so.
	
	
	An order for Mr Galanis’ extended supervision under the Act can be made “if and only if [he] is a high risk sex offender” (s 5B). Section 5B(2) is in the following terms:
	


An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

A risk may be unacceptable even if the chance of it materialising is not “more likely than not” (s 5B(3)).


	
	If made, an extended supervision order may not exceed 5 years from the date on which it commences: s 10.
	
	
	The application was made by summons filed on 11th November 2014. It complies with s 6(2) of the Act, in that it was made within the last six months of Mr Galanis’ “current custody or supervision”. He was then serving the sentences imposed by Murrell DCJ by release on parole (s 5I). The application otherwise complies with the requirements of s 6 of the Act.
	


History of past sexual offending


	
	It is appropriate to say something more about the facts of Mr Galanis’ past sexual offending. His first offending of a sexual nature occurred when he was 16 years of age, as was his victim. She was unknown to him. He noticed her on a train on the evening of 10th June 1983. He followed his victim off the train. It was dark. On a public street, he grabbed her from behind, touching her breast and vaginal area through her clothing. He pushed the struggling victim to the ground lying on top of her moving up and down simulating sexual intercourse. He was interrupted by passers-by which allowed the victim to escape. The absconding offender was intercepted by police who arrested him. During a lawful interview with arresting officers he admitted that he decided to sexually assault the victim while she was sitting opposite him on the train. When asked to explain his offending he said “I can’t explain that; for kicks”.
	
	
	The second offence was committed on 5th January 1986 when the offender was 18. It took a similar form. The victim was walking close to her home. Mr Galanis ran towards her grabbing her around her shoulders. He fondled her breasts and vagina area through her clothing. The victims screams startled the offender who let go and she escaped. He was arrested soon after. He explained to a probation officer who was preparing a pre-sentence report that his offending was an impulse he could not control at the time. As I explain later in these reasons, these early offences occurred before the manifestation of the paranoid schizophrenia from which he now suffers.
	
	
	The serious offending for which he was sentenced by Murrell DCJ occurred between 23rd and 26th April 2005. As the medical evidence referred to below shows, by this time he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Mr Galanis was 37 and the victim, as I have said, 15. They had met before. On 24th April 2015, the victim visited Mr Galanis at his home where they smoked cannabis together. The victim rebuffed Mr Galanis’ attempts to kiss her. By agreement they met again later that evening and returned to Mr Galanis home where he drugged her with alcohol, pills and some unidentified powder. After she passed out, the offender sexually assaulted her, biting her in the process. He sexually assaulted her again by means of penile intercourse against her will, this time while she was awake and struggling with him. He attempted to “keep her quiet” by giving her cash. He pleaded guilty only after the matter had been listed for trial in the District Court.
	


Determination of the application


	
	In deciding whether or not to make an extended supervision order, I am required to have regard to the matters set out in s 9(3) of the Act. I am entitled to have regard to other relevant matters not expressly mentioned in that subsection.
	
	
	In exercising the Court’s powers under the Act, I bear in mind its objects as set out in s 3:
	


The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.


	
	Clearly protection of the community must be given primacy. Rehabilitation is another important, but by implication, secondary, object.
	
	
	In accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119, it is important to bear in mind that the legislation “is protective rather than punitive in its intent” (at [5]). The threshold question is whether Mr Galanis is a high risk sexual offender. I have set out the statutory test at [8] above.
	
	
	The statutory formula “a high degree of probability” imposes a more stringent standard of proof than the usual civil standard: State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [90]. This more stringent standard of proof doubtless reflects the severe curtailment of the civil liberties of a person who, by definition, has been adequately punished for his crime. At the same time, the object of protection of the community will justify this extraordinary curtailment of an individual’s usual civil liberties where the Court is satisfied to that high degree of probability that the offender does pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sexual offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence in light of the requirements of s 9(3), for the reasons expressed below, I am satisfied that I should make an extended supervision order under s 5C of the Act.
	


Reasons

The application of s 9 of the Act


	
	In statutory order, the first matter is the safety of the community. This, after all, is the primary purpose of the legislation. However, the context of s 9(3) seems to be directed to what the other evidence shows about the risk, if there is one, posed by Mr Galanis; after all, a person might be completely rehabilitated. The question of community safety is best considered in the light of the evidence relevant to other s 9 considerations, which I will address more or less in turn.
	
	
	Mr Galanis was examined under s 7(4) of the Act by two consultant psychiatrists, Dr Anthony Samuels and Dr Andrew Ellis. Dr Samuels’ report of 5th February 2015 is Exhibit A and Dr Ellis’ report of 13th February 2015 is Exhibit B. Both experts gave oral testimony at the hearing. Their evidence and other psychiatric evidence, clearly establish that Mr Galanis is a long-time-sufferer from schizophrenia (see PN-1 generally).
	


The longitudinal history


	
	It is convenient to refer to some of the past reports now. Dr C Costa was Mr Galanis’ local medical officer for many years. In a report of 13th July 2005 he said he had been treating him “for his underlying psychiatric condition”. He said that Mr Galanis “needs psychiatric treatment on an ongoing basis – although he does not always accept that situation”. The relevant history commenced in 1991 when Mr Galanis was displaying aggressive behaviour. He admitted to a feeling that “something had been wrong for a long time”. The diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was not made until 2002 when he complained of “paranoia and depression for a long time”. He had insomnia and was anxious during the day. Dr Costa referred Mr Galanis to a psychiatrist, Dr G Takes, who diagnosed schizophrenic disorder with auditory hallucinations, delusions of reference and persecutory delusions. Dr Costa said (PN-1, p228):
	


Subsequently he continued intermittent review by Dr Takes and not responding to Risperdal and he was changed to 5mg Zeprexa atypical anti psychotic to be taken at night (sic). There were no major changes and he has no insight into his condition but at that time no florid psychosis. He is not very compliant with medications but he does show significant improvement at times when he is compliant.

Dr Costa regarded the disorder as “severe”.


	
	Examining him on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions in May 2006, Dr Olav Nielsen, who had access to the report of Dr Costa and that of Dr Tran (see [23]), expressed the opinion that it was likely that Mr Galanis was suffering from an underlying schizophrenic illness. His responses at his interview with Dr Nielsen were “consistent with inflexible thinking and blunting in emotional responses often observed in people with schizophrenia”. Dr Nielsen expressed the view that Mr Galanis was fit to plead, and stand trial.
	
	
	Dr Tran was Mr Galanis’ treating psychiatrist in his capacity as a Justice Health Staff Specialist. He provided reports dated 24th September 2005 and 18th November 2005. Dr Tran received a history of “stressing out” and auditory hallucinations. He agreed with the diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia because the persistence of psychotic symptoms after his detoxification from illicit drugs whilst in custody. His condition was not adequately controlled by a single antipsychotic. He did not consider Mr Galanis to be “dangerous at present”. This was subject to his continuing abstinence.
	
	
	In his second report of 18th November 2005, Dr Tran observed that Mr Galanis’ symptoms had been “persistent despite intensive pharmacotherapy, i.e. adequate trials of different antipsychotics. His less than satisfactory response to treatment could be attributed to the prolonged period of untreated psychosis, which is usually a poor prognostic indicator.”(PN-1, p 218)
	


The s 7(4) psychiatric evidence


	
	Returning to the s 7(4) reports, it is evident to me that notwithstanding that Mr Galanis is currently seeing a psychiatrist once every six months, and taking a dose of Risperdal of 1 mg per day, his response to that treatment remains “less than satisfactory”. He is probably under-medicated. In oral evidence (T 14.5) Dr Ellis referred to a history given by Mr Galanis of auditory hallucinations which he said were voices from the Greek gods. Dr Ellis noticed from his behaviour during the examination that Mr Galanis was actually experiencing hallucinations late in the interview (T 14.20). Dr Ellis regarded the current dose of antipsychotic medication as insufficient to achieve good remission of symptoms in an adult male. On the other hand, Dr Samuels was not as dogmatic about the inadequacy of the dose of Risperdal currently prescribed for Mr Galanis. He would have expected a higher dose but “it depends on metabolism and some people respond quite well on low doses” (T 46.35). Mr Galanis did not exhibit signs of psychosis on examination by Dr Samuels. But there is no inconsistency between the experts. Dr Samuels explained that symptoms may fluctuate (T 57.40-58.5).
	
	
	Dr Ellis identified Mr Galanis as presenting a high risk of sexual re-offending as compared to groups of people who re-offend (T 17.5-10). There are essentially three reasons for this. First, schizophrenia is identified in the scientific literature as an independent risk factor for sexual offending especially when unmedicated, or insufficiently medicated. In this situation disinhibited behaviour, impulsivity and deviant sexual arousal may possibly interact. Secondly, Mr Galanis has an antisocial personality disorder. This disorder produces a self-centred attitude which in Mr Galanis’ case is likely to be exacerbated by the grandiosity associated with schizophrenia. Thirdly, Mr Galanis has a history of previous substance abuse, which at present is apparently controlled by his supervision on parole, pursuant to the current interim orders. If he relapses, and with his mental illness and personality disorder “may serve to disinhibit underlying sexual arousal towards objectification, violence and humiliation and worsen control of his mental illness” (Exhibit B p 14).
	
	
	Dr Samuels’ opinion is largely to the same effect. In his opinion, Mr Galanis does pose a risk of committing a further serious sexual offence (Exhibit A, p 19). He agreed that Mr Galanis suffers from schizophrenia, currently treated by a low dose of an atypical antipsychotic, against a background of previous substance misuse. But Dr Samuels put more emphasis upon what he regarded as Mr Galanis’ “severe personality disorder” (T 46.25) which leads him to have little regard for his victims, and to deny past offending (T 46.5). He is unlikely to overcome this condition; it may ameliorate over time, but it is not amenable to treatment (T 47.15 – 48.30).
	
	
	It is also important to appreciate, that, in giving his history to the psychiatrists Mr Galanis denied responsibility for committing his past sexual offences maintaining that the intercourse, in the most serious case, was consensual. He regarded his victims as persons interested in seeking compensation who colluded with the police for that purpose. He was not very forthcoming with Dr Samuels, exhibiting the attitude that as he had already seen a psychiatrist (Dr Ellis) it was unnecessary to see a second. This denial of responsibility of his offending is of significant concern in the present context.
	


Statistical Assessment


	
	Dr Samuels (Exhibit A, pp 19 – 20) set out the results of his “broad- based approach” to arriving at what he termed a “Professional Structured Clinical Judgment”. This included administration of the actuarially based Static–99R on which Mr Galanis scored 7, which places him in the high risk offender group relative to other sexual offenders. Applying the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP), Mr Galanis’ profile was in keeping with offenders representing such a higher risk. Dr Samuels concluded:
	


On the basis of my clinical assessment, anamnestic review, review of static, dynamic and protective factors, review of actuarial risk factors, and also taking into account structured professional guidelines, it is my view that Mr Galanis remains at high risk of committing a further sexual offence.


	
	Ms Narcisa Sutton undertook an assessment of Mr Galanis’ risk of reoffending on behalf of Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW) as detailed in her report on 29th July 2014. Worryingly Mr Galanis refused to participate saying “I’d rather just have my day in court” (PN-1 p 26). Necessarily, therefore, her assessment was restricted to the papers and she conducted a very thorough review of the large file maintained in relation to Mr Galanis by CSNSW. Like Dr Samuels after her, she undertook an actuarial assessment to assess the so-called static risk factors and followed RSVP to assess the dynamic factors. I have carefully considered her results. Like Dr Samuel she scored 7 for Mr Galanis on the Static–99R which placed him in the same higher risk category. Statistically, she said, the recidivism rate of offenders in this category is around 5.2 times higher than the expected rate for “typical offenders” (PN-1 p 38). She found “some risk factors in all domains covered by the RSVP” (PN-1 p 43) which, in my view, corroborates the Static-99R result. She summarised her views as follows:
	


Mr Galanis appears to have made progress in treatment in terms of his awareness of the factors and processes that put him at risk of sexual offending, including a sense of entitlement, negative attitudes towards women, and problems with stress and coping. However it is a concern that Mr Galanis appears to have retreated to a position where he blames Australian society and the police for his frequent brushes with the law, seemingly overlooking his agency in the commission of offences, including those he [pleaded] guilty to. Furthermore, the risk strategy he has adopted i.e. a very restricted lifestyle, is not sustainable in the long term (PN-1 p 44).

I accept this evidence.

Other psychiatric evidence


	
	I have referred to some, but not all, of the other psychiatric and psychological assessments introduced into evidence above at [21]-[24]. I do not propose to descend into the detail of all of it. In my review of them they tend to favour the need for an order. One is of particular note. Dr Ian Pettit, a psychiatrist, prepared a report dated 11th February 1986 for Mr Galanis’ sentencing at Campsie Local Court in respect of the indecent assault charge committed when he was 18 years old. As I have found, at that time his paranoid schizophrenia had not made itself manifest. Dr Pettit was unable to make a diagnosis of a “formal mental illness”. However, he found him to be “impulsive” and preoccupied with sex. With the benefit of hindsight these may have been manifestations of his undiagnosed antisocial personality disorder. However, notwithstanding the absence of a firm diagnosis Dr Pettit expressed the following view:
	


I believe that Bill Galanis is at risk of committing another offence of the same or a similar nature unless he receives vigorous treatment.

The vigorous treatment suggested was a combination of behaviour therapy “and intense psycho-therapy” (PN-1 page 253).

Section 9(3)(d1) and rehabilitation


	
	A Risk Management Report for the purpose of s 9(3)(d1) of the Act was prepared on 15th August 2014 by Ms Joyleen Nowrot, a community corrections officer with CSNSW. Ms Nowrot’s view is that, subject to the imposition of appropriate conditions detailed in her report (most of which are not disputed, as I have said, should an extended supervision order be made), Mr Galanis can be reasonably and practicably managed in the community. Amongst other important observations she recorded that he was, generally speaking, compliant with his parole conditions. He had returned no positive results in periodic drug and alcohol testing; he was complying with prescribed treatment for his schizophrenia (she was unaware of any acute or psychotic or effective symptoms, however see Dr Ellis’ views); he had participated in the custody based intensive treatment program in a satisfactory way, but it was unclear if he would implement behavioural change; and he had ceased to obtain benefit from individual maintenance counselling with forensic psychology services (he has now been discharged from that treatment). Generally the report is supportive of an order being made.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Galanis has complied with the requirements of such rehabilitation programs as he has been offered. The extent to which he has benefited from the CUBIT program and the ongoing maintenance is highly questionable given his ongoing denial of responsibility for his offending. His participation indicated he understood the concepts and could participate in the program, but it is unlikely he has obtained any lasting benefit along the road to rehabilitation, at this stage. This may be a function of his mental illness and antisocial personality disorder.
	


Compliance with parole and supervision orders


	
	Mr Galanis had a poor record of complying with supervision orders of various types and good behaviour bonds imposed as punishment in earlier years. On 24th August 2000, he was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service work following his conviction for a serious traffic offence. He did not comply with the order and a warrant for his arrest was issued. In May 2001 he received two s 12 bonds, again for serious traffic offences. He responded poorly to supervision, failing to report as directed and was uncooperative when he did. Again in August 2002 a supervised s 12 bond was imposed for another serious driving offence. During its currency he was permitted to travel to Vietnam for a period of three months, but breached the conditions of the bond by failing to return to Australia as required. On 22nd November 2004 he was convicted of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment having a non-parole period of 3 months. He was serving this parole when he committed the serious sexual offences in April 2005.
	
	
	He has, however, been largely compliant with his conditions of parole since his release from gaol on 26th September 2012. And he has mostly complied with the conditions of the interim supervision order since his term of imprisonment expired. However, in written submissions, the State have pointed to evidence showing that since that the 16th of September 2014 there appear to have been 56 compliance issues, including failures to take calls from supervisors on 22 occasions. He has not breached the conditions of the interim order since being given a formal written warning on 26th January 2015 (see affidavit Ms Nowrot, 25th February 2015). Even so, his recalcitrance supports the other substantial evidence indicating the need for ongoing close supervision.
	


General criminal record


	
	As can be inferred from what I have just written, in addition to his serious sexual offences and offences of a sexual nature, he has a general criminal record which includes a series of serious traffic offences. This general criminal record is possibly reflective of his anti-social personality disorder. Again, this past record bolsters the case for extended supervision.
	


Views of Murrell DCJ


	
	When sentencing him for the serious 2005 offences (on 4th August 2006) Judge Murrell said of Mr Galanis (PN-1 p 68):
	


It is always very difficult in the case of individuals with dual diagnosis to be confident that they can remain both substance free and under treatment for mental illness once they are released into the community. The history seems to be that the offender himself has not always adhered to his mental health treatment. That is very common with schizophrenics. It is unfortunate that the offender’s underlying mental illness has been greatly exacerbated by his substance abuse problem. No doubt, the two have combined over a number of years to render him at times barely functional. There is evidence before the Court – which I accept – that the offender will continue to be a risk to the community while he remains mentally ill and self-medicating with illicit substances

I consider that, once he is released, the offender will need a high level of intervention in the community over a very long period of time if there is to be a reasonable prospect of stabilising him in terms of drug dependency and mental health. Even within the prison setting, he has, at times, proven treatment resistant.

On the evidence I have heard and read, it seems to me that her Honour’s observations remain, largely, apposite. True, the evidence indicates, to his credit, that he has remained abstinent of illicit drugs since his release from full-time custody. However, it has now emerged, especially through the evidence of Dr Ellis and Dr Samuels that he also suffers from anti-social personality disorder, which cannot be treated but may ameliorate as he grows older. Moreover, I accept the evidence of Dr Ellis, as I have said, that his psychotic condition remains undertreated and there is evidence that he fails to take his medication from time to time. On Dr Ellis’ evidence he remains psychotic, suffering auditory hallucinations. The combination of the undertreated schizophrenia and the anti-social personality disorder bespeak the need for “a high level of intervention in the community over a very long period of time” as Murrell DCJ foresaw.

Other relevant information


	
	As has been pointed out by a number of the persons who have prepared reports in relation to this matter, Mr Galanis’ history of past sexual offending has been opportunistic, rather than premeditated. This causes me concern given the evidence I have accepted about the nature of his mental illness and his anti-social personality disorder. It is also concerning that he has had a recent poor history of not responding to supervisors telephone calls. Close supervision ought to greatly reduce the opportunity of further offending at times when his undertreated schizophrenia might render him disinhibited or impulsive.
	
	
	He is unable, so-far, to genuinely accept responsibility for his past offending and has a pre-disposition to blame the victim for what occurred. This may be a function of his personality disorder. Before me Dr Samuels gave evidence that persons with anti-social personality disorders of the type afflicting Mr Galanis can learn from experience. It is unlikely that any innate change in their personality function will occur, but “they realise what works and what doesn’t work” (T 55.35). Again, these considerations point to a likelihood of further sexual offending in future.
	
	
	His record (PN-1 p 3-18) extends to a number of allegations of other sexual offences. Of some he was acquitted; others were withdrawn. I have not taken these matters into account as part of Mr Galanis’ criminal record. I record, however, for the purpose of the Static-99R actuarial assessment carried out by Dr Samuels and Ms Sutton (as is evident from their reports) charges as well as convictions are taken into account (T 49.25). However, this is only one tool in a psychiatrist’s kit for assessing these matters, or to put it more formally, as Dr Samuels did, only part of a combined approach. In my opinion this approach involves no unfairness to an offender.
	
	
	Mr Galanis remains interested in sex. He has viewed pornography on the internet, and contacts women overseas on Skype. I am concerned that his artificially restricted lifestyle will fail to contain his sexual impulses leading him to offend again.
	


Finding


	
	I am satisfied to the requisite high degree of probability that Mr Galanis poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	


Conditions


	
	The amended summons filed on 24th February 2015 seeks the imposition of 47 conditions. Of them Mr Galanis contests condition 4 requiring him to wear electronic monitoring equipment and conditions 5 to 7 requiring him to provide, if asked, a weekly schedule of movements. An additional order was sought at the hearing to permit the State to provide the psychiatric and psychological evidence obtained in this litigation to CSNSW for passing on to Mr Galanis’ treating psychiatrist for his or her information. This can be seen as amplification of conditions 42 to 47 concerning medical intervention and disclosure which are not disputed by Mr Galanis per se, however he disputes this additional order. I will deal with the question of duration after I have dealt with these issues.
	
	
	Section 11 of the Act empowers the Court to make an extended supervision order directing an offender to comply with such conditions as the Court considers appropriate. Express powers are listed, but not so as to limit the power of the Court to impose conditions. Among the Court’s express powers is a power to direct the offender to wear electronic monitoring equipment: s 11(e).
	
	
	In Wilde v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 28, when dealing with the scope of the statutory power conferred by s 11, the Court of Appeal introduced a broad test, departing from a narrower approach previously adopted in decisions of the Common Law Division: see for example State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 at [96] and [99]. The unanimous Court (Beazley P; McColl JA; Ward JA) said at [53] – [54]:
	


Care always needs to be taken with use of language which is different from the statutory text. Section 11 does not require that there must be a specific demonstrated link to the past offending which is the basis of the order made under the Act. Rather, the court must be satisfied, having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act, that it is appropriate to impose a particular condition so as to address the risk of future offending of the type which was the basis of the order.

As the cases to which we have referred correctly state, it is not appropriate for the court under s 11 to impose conditions on a person directed to general future criminal conduct.

Having pointed out at [47] that the broad discretion conferred by s 11 “must be exercised having regard to the scope and purpose of the Act and its objects” their Honours went on to say at [49]:

The statutory objects listed in s 3 are twofold: the safety and protection of the community and encouraging high risk offenders to undertake rehabilitation. However, it is apparent from the language of s 3 that the listed objects do not exhaustively delineate the scope and purposes of the Act. This is apparent, in particular, from the language of subs (2), which refers to encouraging rehabilitation as being “another object of this Act“. Thus, whilst s 3(2) specifies that an object of the Act is to encourage offenders to undertake rehabilitation, the scope and purpose of the Act is such that it would be permissible for the court, if it considered it appropriate, to impose a condition directed to facilitating rehabilitation, even if that did not require the offender personally to “undertake“ rehabilitative steps as is envisioned in the statutory object in s 3(2). It may be appropriate in a particular case to impose conditions that may reduce risk factors relevant to the particular type of offending to which the order made under s 11 relates.


	
	In Cornwell v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 at [36], the Court said:
	


One issue as to the terms of the order was whether there should be a requirement that the appellant wear an electronic monitoring device. In our opinion, it is appropriate to give weight to the consideration of the safety of the community in determining what conditions to impose, and to take a cautious approach. Should the Probation and Parole Service at any time consider that the device is not necessary or counter-productive, then the order should give the flexibility of dispensation with the requirement. Accordingly, it should be a condition of the order that the appellant wear such a device, if and as directed by a Probation and Parole Officer.

…

38 In our opinion, again taking a cautious approach, there should be such a requirement. (Emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised portion of this quote gives guidance on how I should approach the question of whether it is appropriate to impose a condition requiring Mr Galanis to wear an electronic monitoring device. I note in passing here, as in Cornwall, the condition proposed incorporates a degree of flexibility in application in as much as it is in the following terms:
	


The defendant must wear electronic monitoring equipment as directed by the DSO or an officer of CS NSW. (Emphasis added)

Thus it seeks to incorporate the same degree of flexibility reducing, or at least having the potential to reduce, the onerous nature of the proposed requirement when by his conduct Mr Galanis demonstrates that this particular protective measure is no longer necessary.


	
	Moreover, in Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [121] the Court said:
	


An electronic monitoring device will certainly assist in tracking the respondent’s movements as well as deter him from risking committing the offence of breach of conditions of a supervision order.

I appreciate that this is an essentially factual observation by the Court. However, it implies a statement of principle consistent with the objects and purpose of the legislation which is relevant here. I record in passing that s 12 makes it an offence for a person to fail to comply with the requirements of an extended supervision order. The penalties for breach include a term of imprisonment of two years.


	
	Mr Galanis opposed this condition and the requirement to provide a schedule of movements by advancing essentially three arguments. First, both are unnecessarily onerous, and to that extent are punitive rather than protective of the community; secondly, given he had adopted a lifestyle that seeks to avoid going out and about, close monitoring of his movements was unnecessary; and thirdly, the interests of his rehabilitation would be advanced if he was given some responsibility for his own actions.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with electronic monitoring and the schedule of movements together because the evidence before me suggests they are complementary requirements (T 23.50 – 26.25 by Dr Ellis; T 47.25 – 48.5 by Dr Samuels). From the point of view of the psychiatrists these conditions taken together provide an incentive for the offender to comply with conditions in relation to rehabilitation. I observe that Mr Galanis has rather given up on that. At the same time there is a risk that these conditions may “heighten” persecutory beliefs in a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia (see T 27.25 – 28.45 by Dr Ellis).
	
	
	It is not only about encouragement to rehabilitation; it must also be recognised that electronic monitoring and scheduling of movements, as the Court of Appeal observed in Tillman may deter an offender from risking the consequences of breaching the conditions of a supervision order. In this sense, these conditions are fundamentally protective of the community, which gives effect to the primary object and purpose of the legislation.
	
	
	Ms Nowrot’s report explains the need for electronic monitoring and schedules of movement in detail: PN-1 pp 50-51. The advantages of monitoring movements and assessing suitability of proposed movements are obvious. In her affidavit affirmed on 25th February 2015, she described these measures as a “critical tool in the supervision and management of the defendant”. Their importance is in deterring Mr Galanis in engaging in any high risk behaviour. So far she has not found it necessary to disapprove of any of Mr Galanis’ movements proposed in any schedule other than a request that he be permitted to leave the country. He is wearing a device as a condition of the interim order, not happily it seems.
	
	
	Mr Paul Yeomans is the senior electronic monitoring officer of the external and electronic monitoring group within Corrective Services NSW. In his affidavit, also affirmed on 25th February 2015, he described electronic monitoring as a tool to support the case management process enabling checks to be kept on an offender’s whereabouts, including checks that the offender is complying with the schedule of movements. Moreover since January 2015 all offenders subject to electronic monitoring have been provided with new equipment known as the “Tracker”. It is plastic, lightweight, slim-fitting and water resistant so it can be worn in the shower “or even in a swimming pool” (affidavit at [21]). The advantage in convenience terms from the offender’s point of view is that he is no longer required to carry with him a GPS unit referred to as a “star unit”, which is roughly the size of a soft drink can. The tracker does however need to be charged. A mobile charging dock, which can be pre-charged is provided and can be easily fitted for charging purposes wherever the offender is.
	
	
	As I said already Ms Sutton was concerned that Mr Galanis has adopted what she regards as “a rigid risk management strategy i.e. limiting his social activities”. In her opinion, this reclusive lifestyle is “not viable as a single risk management strategy in the long term” (PN-1 35–36). With respect, this seems clearly correct.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the difficulties that Mr Galanis’ mental illness and personality disorder pose to the prospect of real and sustained rehabilitation, the combination of a schedule of movements and electronic monitoring may both encourage him into positive and productive social engagement and protect the community by enabling his departmental supervising officer to legitimately monitor his whereabouts.
	
	
	I also think it appropriate that the psychiatric evidence led in this case should be disclosed to Mr Galanis’ treating doctors. I appreciate he is against this. But it seems to me that both protection of his community and his prospects of rehabilitation would be furthered if his treating doctors have the benefit of the views of Dr Ellis and Dr Samuels, in particular those of Dr Ellis in relation to the adequacy of the current treatment regime. Naturally, this question must be left to the therapeutic discretion of the treating doctors. However those doctors should be given the opportunity of reconsidering the regime in the light of the views of their independent colleagues who have provided assistance to the Court. A second opinion is always likely to be of benefit to the doctor primarily responsible for the management of a patient, even if it is not adopted.
	
	
	For these reasons I am satisfied having regard to the scope, purpose and object of the Act, it is appropriate to impose these conditions so as to address what I have found to be the unacceptable risk of Mr Galanis committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	


Duration


	
	The State argued that the extended supervision order should be for the maximum term of 5 years: s 10(1A). I bear in mind that a second or subsequent extended supervision order may be made against the same offender: s 10(3). Ms Hall of Counsel argues that a lesser duration is warranted, principally for the purpose of promoting Mr Galanis’ rehabilitation. As she put it in oral argument (T 73.10):
	


Having served a lengthy sentence, having been on parole, being subject to an order, I submit Mr Galanis, if he is to be subject to the order, which it is anticipated he will be, then it is really about giving him something to aim for in terms of encouraging that rehabilitation.

She also put it in terms of leaving “a light at the tunnel” (T 73.5).


	
	Dr Ellis and Dr Samuels both supported an order of five years duration. I think it fairly summarises the evidence of both that they considered a long period of time necessary to establish a proper regime of treatment and rehabilitation, which given his mental illness and personality disorder was likely to follow a protracted course.
	
	
	Mr Galanis has complied with the requirements demanded of him in custody and on parole in relation to his rehabilitation. It is quite clear, whether because of his mental illness and personality disorder, or otherwise, despite his compliance he is not rehabilitated. This follows from the considerations I have already referred to; that he has failed to accept responsibility for his offending; has little insight into why it occurred; and his tendency to blame his victims. Acknowledging that the primary purpose of the legislation is protective and certainly not punitive, one can well understand that an offender would find the conditions of a supervision order unbearably onerous. And this may be counter-productive in terms of achieving the objects and purposes of the Act.
	
	
	I think there is something in Ms Hall’s “light at the end of the tunnel” argument. I acknowledge that the offender’s mental illness and personality disorder may of themselves be matters that make him dangerous. In fixing the duration of the order, one should not be arbitrary. From Dr Samuels’ evidence, I infer that a person with Mr Galanis’ conditions may “learn what works”, even if he cannot be cured or really changed. I would have thought that a period of three years and six months is adequate, in the first instance, to achieve the purpose of an order, if real gains in terms of rehabilitation, or education, can be made during that period. I am not confident that they can, and if this pessimism proves well-founded, doubtless a further application will be made.
	
	
	My orders are:
	



	
	Under s 5C Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 William Galanis is subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order for a period of three years and six months from 6th March 2015 (pursuant to s 10(1) of the said Act) and expiring on 5th September 2018.
	
	
	Under s 11 of the said Act, William Galanis is directed to comply with the conditions set out in Schedule A to these orders for the duration of order 1.
	
	
	Direct that access to the Court file and any document filed or tendered in support or opposition to the State’s application shall not be granted without leave of a Judge of this Court. If any application for access is made by a non-party in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to be given the opportunity to be heard.
	
	
	The State of New South Wales is permitted to provide the reports of Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Anthony Samuels furnished to the Court under s 7(4) of the Act and the transcript of their oral testimony to:
	



	
	Any medical practitioner or psychologist involved in the treatment or rehabilitation of William Galanis; and
	
	
	The departmental supervising officer responsible for the supervision of William Galanis under these orders.

2766027,R v McLean [2015] NSWDC 128,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Late last year after a relatively short judge alone trial I found Ms McLean guilty of the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to a gentleman by the name of Mr Brian Nimo.
	
	
	The facts which I found which establish that offence are set out in the judgment I gave on 19 December 2014. I will repeat very briefly what occurred in order to explain the sentence I will shortly impose.
	
	
	Mr Nimo lived in a unit complex. Also in the unit complex lived a friend of his, Mr Laurie Waters. Mr Nimo’s carpets were being cleaned so he went to Mr Waters’ unit and asked if he could spend the day there. Mr Waters had to go out but he allowed Mr Nimo to remain in his apartment.
	
	
	Shortly after Mr Waters left Ms McLean walked in. They had known each other for a number of years and indeed Ms McLean appears to have been of considerable assistance to Mr Nimo over the years, cooking and cleaning for him on occasions.
	
	
	Mr Nimo and Ms McLean were both drinkers. Both have suggested that they had limited amounts of alcohol to drink that day but a blood alcohol level later taken from Mr Nimo at hospital tends to suggest that he had drunk considerably more than he suggested and the circumstance that if Ms McLean is telling the truth and she genuinely does not recollect what she did to
	
	
	Mr Nimo because she was suffering an alcoholic black-out, also tends to suggest that she too drank more than she is prepared to admit. That heavy alcohol users would deny the level of their alcohol abuse is not at all unknown.
	
	
	What seems to have precipitated the attack on Mr Nimo was that Ms McLean went to the toilet, and when Mr Nimo realised that she had not returned he went to look for her, he found her curled up on Mr Waters’ bed. He nudged her on the shoulder and said she should not be sleeping there, at which her response was to get off the bed and begin to punch and kick Mr Nimo. He tried to block those punches. His glasses fell to the floor and, afraid that they would be trodden on, he bent down to pick them up. As he was putting his glasses back on he felt a blow to his forehead and that was the last thing that he remembered until Mr Waters came home and roused him from unconsciousness.
	
	
	Precisely what it was that Ms McLean hit Mr Nimo with is not at all clear, it may have been the walking stick which was discovered to have had a bend in it sometime after these events that I have described or it may have been something else. It was certainly unlikely to have simply been Ms McLean’s fists. It is, and I am satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt, the case that she must have used some form of weapon.
	
	
	Fortunately and somewhat surprisingly, given what Mr Nimo looked like when police first attended and the amount of blood in which he was lying, he appears to have made a relatively good recovery. I set out the injuries that he suffered, in paragraph 136 of my judgment of last year. He suffered a laceration to his head of such significance that a considerable amount of blood was lost. He suffered a fracture of one of his vertebrae which required that he wear a cervical collar for six weeks. He suffered fractures to both of his hands which required that he wear splints on them for four weeks and he suffered an injury to his right knee that required he wear a splint for six weeks.
	
	
	Although as I have just mentioned he was found to be lying in a pool of blood and his injuries appeared to be much more severe than they turned out to be, it is the case that many, if not most cases involving the element of grievous bodily harm involve much worse injuries.
	
	
	Ms McLean has had a number of challenges in her life. By using the word “challenges” I do not wish to underestimate them at all. She has had difficulties that arise, both because of what other people have done to her and because of mental conditions from which she suffers. Her parents separated when she was 11. That often affects children to a significant extent but worse in Ms McLean’s case was the circumstance that her father took up with her mother’s best friend and moved in across the road. Ms McLean told a psychiatrist that she would see her father taking out her new partner’s children but seemingly having little time for his own off-spring including of course herself.
	
	
	A little while later when she was 12, she was raped by a friend of her baby-sitter, this was not disclosed for many years because Ms McLean believed that she would not be believed.
	
	
	She moved with her family from Melbourne to Sydney and did not make the transition easily. She attended a number of high schools, she was beaten up at school and achieved a low grade in her final examinations. She began to engage in sex work as a means of paying a debt off, which was not hers in the first place, and it is in those circumstances not terribly surprising that
	
	
	Ms McLean would resort to alcohol to numb her feelings. Her feelings were of low self-esteem and Ms McLean used alcohol and sometimes drugs to escape from them. On top of this she has had, what has sometimes been diagnosed as, bipolar affective disorder.
	
	
	Ms McLean’s life has not been easy. Perhaps somewhat belatedly, indeed primarily after having been charged with the offence that I found her guilty of, she has begun to make substantial efforts to deal with some of the difficulties that she faces, in particular dealing with her problems with alcohol.
	
	
	I have no trouble at all in accepting the conclusion of Dr Emma Collins about the way in which a custodial sentence will affect Ms McLean. Dr Collins says that Ms McLean “Is psychologically vulnerable and is likely to struggle with coping in a prison environment.”
	
	
	The offence for which I found Ms McLean guilty carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, it also has a standard non-parole period of four years. I have taken both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period into account in formulating the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence. I note also that the offence could be dealt with summarily. In my view it would have been quite wrong for it to have been dealt with in that manner. It remains a theoretical possibility that it could have been but, as I say it would have been inappropriate if that were to have occurred.
	
	
	Ms McLean of course does not get a discount for pleading guilty on the basis that that plea would provide a utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system. On the other hand as I noted in the judgment of last year, this trial was conducted in an efficient manner, much evidence was not disputed and so I will take into account in Ms Mclean’s favour, that circumstance.
	
	
	This offence was clearly unplanned and spontaneous and, at least as far as the extent of the injuries is concerned, out of character for Ms McLean. She does have a criminal history with offences of assault on it but she has never been to gaol and although her step-father speaks about Ms McLean’s temper it certainly does appear to be the case that what Ms McLean did to Mr Nimo on this occasion is very much unusual behaviour for her. Indeed as I have already noted Mr Nimo was a person whom she usually helped, not harmed.
	
	
	A great deal of evidence related to the need for Ms McLean to be assisted in various ways in order to overcome her problems with alcohol and to reduce as far as possible the chances that she will commit further offences in the future. Evidence was called by the Crown today about the ability of such treatment to be provided in the custody situation. Certainly treatment can be provided but I have no hesitation in accepting that it is quite likely that treatment inside gaol is more difficult to obtain and thus less effective than treatment outside gaol. Waiting lists can be lengthy, resources are stretched, the prison population is at high levels and the sometimes, seemingly inexplicable movement of prisoners from gaol to gaol all interfere with optimum psychological treatment being available to inmates. I will certainly take that into account but it is not the case that just because treatment is better outside than inside, a custodial sentence should not be imposed.
	
	
	It is difficult to assess Ms McLean’s prospects of rehabilitation given the largely unexplained reason that she would have attacked Mr Nimo in the first place, although I do accept that she is making substantial efforts to now overcome her problems with alcohol.
	
	
	Another matter that Ms Cook relies on, which I will certainly take into account in Ms McLean’s favour, is the delay which has come about between the commission of the offence and today when Ms McLean is finally facing sentence for it. This matter was listed for trial on two occasions before it eventually started before me. Ms McLean has had this matter hanging over her head for a considerable period of time which I repeat is something I will take into account in her favour.
	
	
	It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did. Although as I have said there are many, if not most cases where the grievous bodily harm occasioned to a victim is worse than that occasioned to Mr Nimo, there remain features which point to this being a particularly serious offence.
	
	
	Whilst it may well be the case and indeed it probably is that Mr Nimo did not look as bad as he did when police arrived and filmed him on a mobile phone, there is no doubt that he must have been obviously injured when Ms McLean abandoned him, having been responsible for those injuries. He was a vulnerable person, his age, the fact that he needed a walking stick on occasions and indeed his level of intoxication that day all suggest that he was scarcely able to defend himself against a sudden and unprovoked attack, with a weapon of some sort, by Ms McLean.
	
	
	25    Ms Cook presses upon me the suggestion that an alternative to full-time custody should be imposed. The difficulty with that submission in this case is that I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is required, such that no alternatives become available.
	
	
	There are clearly special circumstances in this case, not only is this Ms McLean’s first time in custody but the many psychological matters that are referred to in the reports and which I have referred to in these remarks on sentence, demonstrate the need for an extended period of supervision on parole at the expense of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Ms McLean you are sentenced to imprisonment, taking into account five days pre-sentence custody. That sentence will have commenced on 1 March 2015. I set a non-parole period of 15 months and a head sentence of two years six months. The non-parole period will expire on 31 May 2016 on which day Ms McLean is to be released to parole.

2766036,"Chidiac, Neil – Application pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 157","Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 31 March 1988 Mr Neil Chidiac was charged with conspiracy to import a trafficable quantity of heroin into Australia contrary to s 233B(1)(cb) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). Following a jury trial, he was convicted on 15 February 1989. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty years, with a non-parole period of fourteen years.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the “Review Act”), Mr Chidiac has applied for an inquiry into his conviction.
	


The basis for the application


	
	In support of his application Mr Chidiac contends that there is a body of material now available that raises a real doubt as to his guilt. Mr Chidiac makes three complaints. First, Mr Chidiac contends that one of the two principal Crown witnesses, Mr Alfred Oti (“Oti”) was, by his own admission, lying when he testified that Mr Chidiac took part in a conspiracy to import heroin into Australia from the Solomon Islands. He claims that Oti’s admission has now “positively exculpated” him. He claims that the other principal witness, Mr Wilson Kwalu (“Kwalu”), is a “self-confessed perjurer and conspirator”.
	
	
	Second, Mr Chidiac contends that the bulk of the evidence the Crown used to corroborate Oti’s and Kwalu’s testimony, namely his alleged possession of a pager in May 1985 that Oti claims to have used to contact him and the suspicious nature of his trip to Honiara in May 1985, have now been contradicted by evidence on affidavit from independent witnesses.
	
	
	Third, Mr Chidiac states that at his trial the Crown did not call a witness known as “George”, who was responsible for providing the AFP with the information that led to Mr Chidiac’s arrest. He states that George has now given evidence, confirmed by evidence from a former AFP officer, Alan Taciak, exculpating Mr Chidiac.
	
	
	As I will explain, the last two of these contentions overstates the position and the first has its difficulties. Nevertheless, I am persuaded that there is the requisite doubt concerning Mr Chidiac’s conviction.
	


Convictions and Sentences


	
	The indictment presented against Mr Chidiac stated:
	


“that between about the 1st day of May 1984 and the 4th day of July 1985 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with Samir Helias, Alfred Oti, Wilson Kwalu and divers other persons to import into Australia prohibited imports to which Section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin.”


	
	In January 1989, Mr Chidiac and a co-accused, Mr Michael Asfour, stood trial before Smyth DCJ and a District Court jury. As noted, they were convicted on 15 February 1989. On 24 February 1989 Mr Chidiac was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years to date from the date of his arrest on 31 March 1988 (R v Chidiac (District Court (NSW), Smyth DCJ, 24 February 1989, unrep)). Mr Chidiac appealed against his conviction and sentence to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. On 15 December 1989 that Court dismissed the appeal against conviction and refused leave to appeal against the sentence (R v Chidiac (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Loveday J, 15 December 1989, unrep)).
	
	
	Mr Chidiac, and his co-accused, then applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court on the grounds that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, and that the trial judge failed to give an adequate direction concerning corroboration of the evidence of the accomplices. On 1 March 1991 Mr Chidiac’s application was refused (Chidiac v R; Asfour v R [1991] HCA 4; 171 CLR 432 (“Chidiac”)).
	
	
	On 27 March 1995, an application was made to this Court for an inquiry into Mr Chidiac’s conviction under s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), as it then stood. On 28 April 1995 Dunford J was appointed to determine whether an inquiry should be held. On 5 July 1995 Dunford J adjourned the matter pending the outcome of a petition submitted by Mr Chidiac to the Governor-General seeking a pardon, under former s 474C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). On or about 15 December 1996, the Commonwealth Attorney-General refused to refer the matter to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. Mr Chidiac contends that his s 474D application was never determined. The Court has not been able to locate any record to indicate it was. I am proceeding on that basis.
	
	
	On 10 February 1997 Mr Chidiac was released on parole after serving nine years imprisonment. The balance of his non-parole period has now expired.
	


Statutory Context


	
	Sections 78 and 79 of the Review Act provide:
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:

(a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(3B) …

(4)  Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	On its face and subject to the matter noted at [19], these provisions confer a number of powers on this Court, including the power to direct that the matter be the subject of an inquiry (s 79(1)(a)); that the matter be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal (s 79(1)(b)); that the matter be deferred (s 79(3A)); and that the application be refused (s 79(3)) on the basis of grounds including, but not limited to, those specified in s 79(3).
	
	
	In Application of Victor Markarov under s 78 of Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5] Bellew J noted three matters concerning these provisions (which his Honour derived from Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2008] NSWSC 251 (“Holland”) at [2] to [12] per Johnson J)).
	
	
	First, his Honour noted that a consideration of this application is an exercise of administrative, not judicial power (Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48 to 50 (“Varley”); Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [124] (“Eastman”)). This process may be activated when the criminal justice system has “run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence” (Holland at [10]). In Holland, Johnson J noted that s 78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with another avenue of appeal after the appeal process has been exhausted, nor an opportunity to run the trial again on the papers (Holland at [9]).
	
	
	Secondly, the test to be applied in proceedings of this nature is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case (s 79(2)). Under the now-repealed, but similarly phrased s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900, it was said that the requisite doubt or question may be formed where the material submitted causes the person considering the matter “unease or a sense of disquiet” in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand (Holland at [6], citing Varley at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245). This requires available material which “as a matter of practical reality” gives rise to a sense of unease or disquiet (Holland at [8]). That formula has been applied in applications made under s 79(2) (Holland at [6]).
	
	
	Thirdly, in Holland Johnson J stated (at [11]):
	


“The nature of the jurisdiction under Pt 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application for an order directing an inquiry or referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.”


	
	Consistent with this I have determined the matter on the papers. I have considered all the documents annexed to the application of Mr Chidiac and to the submissions of the Attorney-General.
	
	
	As noted, Mr Chidiac was convicted of an offence created by a federal statute. Questions arise regarding the power of the Court to consider this application and exercise all or any of the powers conferred by s 79(1) of the Review Act in relation to federal offences. Detailed submissions were made on behalf of Mr Chidiac to the effect that, by the operation of s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), the Court could order an inquiry under s 79(1)(a) of the Review Act if s 79(2) was satisfied. However judges of this division have consistently concluded that, with federal offences, this provision and its predecessor only empowers the Court to order a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal and not order an inquiry (Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; (1999) 46 NSWLR 148; El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330 at [23]; Toro-Martinez [2008] NSWSC 34 at [8]; Re Bolus – Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 806 at [5]).
	
	
	I agree with the reasoning in Pearson and will follow it. However I note that s 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) vests the Court of Criminal Appeal with a number of supplementary powers which may enable the Court to conduct any factual investigation as may be necessary to address any doubt or question that is raised as to Mr Chidiac’s guilt. I will approach this matter on the basis that, if any such doubt or question appears within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Review Act, then I would not decline to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal simply because a more appropriate referral would be for an inquiry if that was available.
	


The Crown case


	
	At trial the Crown case was that Mr Chidiac and Mr Asfour conspired with Messrs Oti, Kwalu, Helais and others to import heroin into Australia. A detailed summary of the Crown case was set out by Dawson J In Chidiac at 448-449:
	


“The prosecution case was as follows. A man identified only as George introduced himself to Oti and Kwalu in Honiara in the Solomon Islands in 1979 or 1980. Both Oti and Kwalu are Solomon Islanders. Oti was a senior officer in the Solomon Islands Customs Service and Kwalu, a relative of his, was a taxi driver. George sought assistance in locating two missing suitcases which he eventually said contained hashish. George then made arrangements with Oti and Kwalu to post drugs from Malaysia to Honiara concealed behind framed pictures. The drugs were to be collected by Oti and Kwalu and sent on to Sydney.

Nothing further happened until 1984 when George contacted Oti by letter and by telephone. George said that there would be a parcel of drugs sent towards the end of the year. Oti was to collect it and to tell George when it arrived. It was then to be sent on to George. Oti informed Kwalu of the development and George kept in contact with Oti by telephone from Sydney. At about this time Oti was introduced by George to the applicant Asfour on the telephone and Asfour also spoke to Oti about drugs. Oti gave George the fictitious names of Tahai and Moli to use as addressees on the parcel.

A parcel arrived in Honiara late in October 1984. It was postmarked Penang, Malaysia, and was addressed to either Tahai or Moli at a post box number. It contained framed pictures in the back of which were plastic packages of pink powder resembling icing sugar in texture. In total they weighed 800 to 1000 grams.

Oti telephoned George in Sydney and arrangements were made for Kwalu to bring the packages to Sydney and for George to pay his expenses. Kwalu carried the packages, taped to his legs, by air to Brisbane on 29 November 1984. There he was met by George and Asfour. All three travelled by bus to Sydney, the packages having been transferred to a briefcase carried by George or Asfour. Kwalu returned to Honiara from Brisbane by air on 6 December 1984. Oti later paid Kwalu $1000 with funds sent from Sydney.

During December 1984 George again contacted Oti. He said that more of the same ""stuff"" would come in January or February in a manner similar to that of the first parcel. The parcel arrived and Oti told George of the fact. Oti, at George's suggestion, told Asfour by telephone that the drugs had not yet arrived. Money was sent to Honiara and in February 1985 Oti flew to Sydney with the packages contained in the parcel. He delivered them to George and a man introduced to him as George's brother, Sam. Oti returned to Honiara. Asfour telephoned Oti, expressing anger at being deceived about the last parcel. Asfour said that he would send someone to see Oti in Honiara.

Early in May 1985, George telephoned Oti and told him that he would be sending someone named Sam to discuss the redirection of further packages. In mid-May George told Oti that it would not be Sam but someone named Neil. Neil is the first name of the applicant Chidiac. On 27 May 1985, Chidiac arrived in Honiara with his family and telephoned Oti. Oti met Chidiac at the Mendana Hotel where Chidiac was staying. Chidiac referred to George, the previous parcels, the dangers involved, and other ways in which drugs could be brought to Honiara and smuggled into Sydney. The next day Oti again met Chidiac, this time with Kwalu. There was further discussion of drug smuggling and payments that would be made. Chidiac gave Oti a piece of paper with a telephone number, 211-1100, written on it. The number was that of a paging service to which Chidiac was a subscriber.

Shortly thereafter Chidiac left Honiara and telephoned Oti from Vanuatu. Chidiac returned to Sydney on 6 June 1985. George again telephoned Oti and told him to expect a further parcel. More packages arrived as before. This time the powder was white. Oti telephoned George and then Chidiac. The latter said he would send Oti money for the airfare from Honiara. The money arrived and on 1 July 1985 Kwalu flew from Honiara to Brisbane with the packages taped to his body. On 3 July 1985 he telephoned George. Asfour then telephoned Kwalu and the next day Kwalu travelled by bus to Sydney where he was met by Asfour and was later introduced to Samir Helais. Helais was a bookmaker's clerk who worked for Chidiac, the latter being a bookmaker by occupation. Kwalu went to Asfour's house with Asfour where he gave the packages to Asfour. Asfour and Helais divided the white powder between them. Kwalu remained in Sydney for a short time during which he met George. He returned to Honiara and further funds were sent from Sydney to Oti.

The prosecution case was supported by evidence, for the most part from Oti and Kwalu. The man identified as George was not called as a witness and it appears to have been common ground that Helais had fled the country. At the time he gave evidence, Oti was in prison. In December 1985 he had made a further journey to Sydney carrying heroin and was caught. He pleaded guilty to a number of offences, including conspiracy to import heroin. For that offence he was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment with a minimum term of ten years. Kwalu was brought from Honiara to give evidence. Both Oti and Kwalu were indemnified against prosecution in relation to their evidence in this case.”

The issues at the trial


	
	The trial judge suppressed the identity of the person known as “George” in the above extract. The Crown did not call him to give evidence. The trial judge directed the jury that, in light of that failure, “an inference which the jury can draw is if George had been called he could not have given evidence which would implicate Chidiac or Asfour” (see Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298). One aspect of this application concerns the position of George. (As there is no reason to believe the suppression order is not still in effect, I will refer to him as George, even though some of the material uses his full name).
	
	
	The Crown did call Messrs Oti and Kwalu. Each gave evidence directly implicating Chidiac. At the time of the events that were subject of the trial, Oti was almost 40 years old and was employed as a Senior Collector with the Customs Department of the Solomon Islands. As noted by Dawson J in Chidiac, he was apprehended in December 1985 after having made a further journey to Australia carrying heroin. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for that offence but he was indemnified from prosecution for the conspiracy the subject of the charge against Mr Chidiac. I have received little material on this application concerning Kwalu, but it is known that he was also indemnified from prosecution.
	
	
	During the trial the credibility of both Oti and Kwalu was vigorously attacked. Both admitted having told lies to the police, having told lies on oath and having changed their stories from time to time. On their own account they had personally engaged in transporting illegal drugs. In his summing up to the jury, the trial judge warned (at 358-359):
	


“You as judges of fact have got to decide whether these two self-confessed liars have told the truth or not. What I am bound to tell you is that being accomplices as they are that it is dangerous to convict on their evidence unless it is corroborated. Not only are they accomplices, not only are they down and out villains, not only are they drug smugglers themselves but they are self-confessed perjurers and liars.

I have been sitting on these courts for something like eight years and I have never heard two witnesses so readily admit that they have lied on oath. Now, that does not mean to say that they may not be telling the truth, but what I am saying to you is you will look carefully at what they said before you would hang a dog on their evidence. Really, it is really appalling and you heard it all as much as I did.”


	
	In Chidiac Dawson J observed that while this warning suggested that the trial judge had formed an unfavourable view as to the reliability of Oit and Kwalu, their versions were essentially the same. His Honour also observed that some of the discrepancies in their evidence, particularly with regard to the sequence of events, were capable of explanation upon the basis of improved recollection as they were asked to repeat their story (Chidiac v R at p 455 per Dawson J). According to his Honour, Oti and Kwalu admitted that they had told untruths, but their cross-examination did not reveal they had any great aptitude for deception. The material supplied in support of this application casts doubt on that assessment, at least so far as it concerns Oti.
	
	
	During his trial Mr Chidiac made an unsworn statement. A copy of that statement was attached to an affidavit sworn by Mr Chidiac in support of this application. In his statement, Mr Chidiac denied any knowledge of George or Kwalu. He said that he had planned a family holiday but he delayed the trip to be the best man at his brother’s wedding. He said that during his speech at the wedding he mentioned his upcoming trip and that later Samir Helias told him to get in touch with a friend of his, namely Oti. Oti held a senior position in customs. He said that during the holiday he contacted Oti who met him at his hotel. He said that he bought Oti some drinks but he became “fully intoxicated”. He recalled Oti speaking “about the island a little bit” but that he “spoke mostly of the shop he wanted to rent or buy or whatever”. Mr Chidiac said that he saw Oti briefly the following evening but he “tried to fob him off” by giving him $20 for drinks. He said that he rang Helias about Oti and told him that “I was not impressed whatsoever with his attitude”. He said he never rang Oti from Sydney. Mr Chidiac also addressed the circumstances in which he acquired a pager service. I will address this below.
	
	
	Thus, at the trial it was common ground that Chidiac employed Helias, that Chidiac went to Honiara in 2005 with his family, that he met Oti while in Honiara, that he telephoned Helais from Honiara and that he was at some point a client of “voice call” which operated a paging service. However it was disputed that he ever discussed the importation of drugs with Oti, that he ever met Kwalu, that he gave Oti a piece of paper with a telephone number of his paging service, that he telephoned Oti from Vanuatu, that he ever received a call from Oti in Sydney, or made a call to Oti from Sydney, and that he ever sent or arranged for money to be sent from Sydney to Oti in Honiara.
	


Corroborative Evidence


	
	As noted, one ground upon which Mr Chidiac sought special leave to appeal to the High Court concerned the form of the directions given by the trial judge in respect of the evidence that was said to corroborate, or be capable of corroborating, the evidence of Oti and Kwalu. As part of that argument it was contended that there was no such evidence. Special leave to appeal on that ground was refused on the basis that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not err in rejecting that contention. Mason CJ noted that it had been conceded in the Court of Criminal Appeal that there was corroborative evidence (Chidiac at 440.5).
	
	
	Nevertheless in the course of addressing the contention that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory, three of the judgments in Chidiac addressed the evidence that was said to corroborate, or be capable of corroborating, the evidence of Oti and Kwalu so far as it implicated Mr Chidiac (at 440 per Mason CJ, at 455 per Dawson J at 464 - 466 per McHugh J). The most detailed analysis of that evidence was undertaken by McHugh J (at 464 to 466):
	


“8. The first piece of corroborative evidence against Chidiac was his admission that he had met Oti in Honiara on the occasion that Oti and Kwalu swore that there was a discussion concerning the importation of drugs into Australia. However, Chidiac was there with his family, allegedly for a holiday, and, although he admitted the meeting, he denied that the conversation took place. In addition, he explained his meeting with Oti by claiming that Helais had asked him to introduce himself to Oti. In these circumstances, the admitted meeting throws little light on whether there was a conversation in the terms alleged by Oti. I do not think a reasonable jury would have held that the conversation was confirmed by this piece of ""corroborative"" evidence.

9. The second piece of corroborative evidence against Chidiac was his admission that, after meeting Oti, he telephoned Helais in Sydney from Honiara. But on Chidiac's uncontradicted version the purpose of the call was to complain about Oti's conduct. Again I do not think that a reasonable jury would have regarded this telephone call as confirming the evidence of Oti and Kwalu.

10. The third piece of corroborative evidence against Chidiac was the strongest. Oti swore that, during his conversation with Chidiac, Chidiac handed him a piece of paper with the number 211-1100 on it. At the same time Chidiac said: ""If you ring up, and most of the time I won't be there, just leave a message and say 'This is Alf'"". Chidiac denied the conversation and that he had given Oti the number. However, in his dock statement, Chidiac admitted that from November or December 1985, some six months after he was in Honiara, he became a subscriber to a paging service. The number of that paging service was 211-1100.

11. Chidiac's rental agreement with the paging service was tendered in evidence. The only subscriber's signature on the agreement was that of Chidiac. But alongside the name of the party to the agreement was the word ""JACOB"". Immediately above that word the date of the agreement was shown as ""21-6-84"". On the same line as the word ""JACOB"" was a diagonal line which intersected the right corner of the bottom loop of the ""B"" in that word. Alongside the diagonal line were the words ""NEIL CHIDIAC"" written with a different pen and in a different style of writing. The top corner of the document disclosed a payment of $584 on ""21-6-84"". However, a search of the records of the paging company showed no payment by Chidiac until he made a payment ""in advance"" in November 1985.

12. Upon this evidence, the Crown contended that Chidiac had been a subscriber to the paging service since June 1984 and that this corroborated Oti's evidence that in May 1985 Chidiac had given him the number of the paging service together with instructions as to how to contact Chidiac on that number. Chidiac, on the other hand, contended that the date ""21-6-84"" was linked to the person ""JACOB"" who either had been or had intended to become a subscriber. In addition, he submitted that the fact that his first payment was not made until November 1985 showed that he had not been a subscriber in May 1985 as implicitly alleged by Oti.

13. On its face, however, the paging agreement was one made and signed by Chidiac on 21 June 1984. No doubt the insertion of the word ""JACOB"" is curious and so is the use of a different pen and writing for that word. But nothing in the document suggests that ""JACOB"" became a subscriber. There is no surname after the word ""JACOB"" except the word ""CHIDIAC"". Moreover, the effect of the evidence was not that Chidiac had made his first payment in November 1985 but that no record of any payment from him could be found before that date. Upon these facts, a reasonable jury was entitled to find that Chidiac had been a subscriber to the paging service since June 1984.”

14. Once that finding was made, the case against  Chidiac  wore a very different complexion. Upon making that finding, a reasonable jury was entitled to conclude that the assertion by  Chidiac  in his dock statement that he was not a subscriber to the paging service until November or December 1985 was a lie, borne out of a consciousness of guilt, for the giving of his number was altogether inconsistent with his claim as to the nature and result of his meeting with Oti. Moreover, once the reasonable jury found that  Chidiac  was indeed a subscriber to the number 211-1100 in May 1985 and that he had lied about it in his dock statement, it was open to them to find that he had given that number to Oti for the purpose to which Oti had deposed.

15. Consequently, although a reasonable jury would approach the evidence of Oti and Kwalu with great caution, the evidence concerning the paging number convincingly confirmed their evidence that  Chidiac  was involved in the conspiracy to import drugs into Australia and had given Oti a telephone number by which he could be contacted.”


	
	The analysis of Mason CJ (at 440.5) and Dawson J (at 445) of the corroborative evidence was similar, although their Honours did not diminish the weight to be attributed to Chidiac’s meeting with Oti in Honiara or his telephone call to Helias, or elevate the weight to be attached to the pager contract, as McHugh J did in the above passage.
	
	
	As noted the discussion of the corroborative evidence in the judgments in Chidiac was undertaken in the context of considering whether the jury’s verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory, that is whether a jury acting reasonably must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. This necessitated that considerable deference be afforded to the advantage enjoyed by the jury in having the opportunity to hear and observe Oti and Kwalu give evidence (at 443.6 per Mason CJ, at 452.9 to 453.1 per Dawson J, at 458 per Toohey J, and at 462.1) although there were differing views in respect of the degree of deference that should be afforded (at cf 453.1 per Dawson J with 457 per Toohey J and 459 per Gaudron J). Hence in the above extracts of McHugh J does not record findings of fact but only findings “a reasonable jury was entitled” to make.
	
	
	Also, in discussing the so called corroborative evidence, their Honours were referring to it in the sense of evidence that “confirm[s] or tend[s] to confirm the accused's involvement in the events as related by the accomplice” (Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 211.9). Standing alone, the matters discussed in the above passage were not capable of demonstrating Mr Chidiac’s participation in a conspiracy to import heroin.
	


Alfred Oti


	
	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Chidiac that a doubt or question arises as to Mr Chidiac’s guilt by reason of new material that has been obtained suggesting that Oti perjured himself in implicating Chidiac.
	
	
	In 1994 a private investigator travelled to Fiji and interviewed Oti (the “1994 Interview”). During that interview Oti adopted a handwritten statement which stated (tab 13):
	


“I was originally sentenced to 20 years with a minimum of 10 years and later (when I appealed) I was sentenced to 7 years with a minimum of 5½ years.

After I was sentenced (about 2 years later), I was approached by [name of Detective] and one other police who told me that they had known about my other involvement in importing of drugs into Australia and they mentioned Neil Chidiac as one of my conspirators. I was asked to tell everything about this particular importations, otherwise I would spend a very long time in gaol, that I had a family to go back to, etc. They also added that they had been trying to get Neil Chidiac but they couldn’t. They told me to make statements against Neil but most of what I alleged was not correct or true because of the pressure. I only made the statements and later gave evidence against Neil because I was afraid Police might give me additional sentence to what I had already got.

However, as far as I am concerned, Neil had not had any conversations with me about importing of drugs. I came into his hotel room in Mendana Hotel to chat and to say hello to him and his family. He was not involved with me or Wilson Kwalu or any other person that I know in importing drugs. I’ve never received any money from Neil for any reason apart from $40 or $50 odd dollars that I had asked for in the Hotel for ‘booze’.”

I saw Neil again the next day when I was with my friends besides Wilson but I never saw them having conversation nor did I discuss the importation of drugs with them.

I continue to give evidence against Neil until he was convicted because I was still in gaol and I was afraid of getting more sentences. But now I am out of gaol and served my time I could now give the true events or statement of the drugs importation that implicated Neil and landed him …

Therefore, I am no longer afraid of getting more sentences from the Police.

I am now reformed and I’ve been a dedicated Christian since I had got out of gaol. During the time I was involved in drugs importations I was drinking alcohol very heavily (about 7 days a week) and it was affecting my memory. However, I have been off alcohol for over 10 years now.

From the very beginning, I had always felt sorry for Neil, so now, I believe the truths I am now telling will help to get him out of gaol. I believe he is an innocent man and I regret having telling lies and confusing statements about him. I repeat again that Neil was not involved in any drugs importations that I am aware of.

I am making this statement for the purpose of telling the truth about Neil and for no other purpose.”


	
	The balance of the 1994 interview is instructive. Oti nominated “George” as the organiser and financier of a number of drug importations, including the importation the subject of the charge against Mr Chidiac (p6 to p 9). Oti confirmed that the investigating detectives told him that they “have been trying to get Neil Chidiac”, but he denied that he told the police at any time that the statements he made implicating Mr Chidiac were untruthful (p 15.1), or that they suggested the role played by Mr Chidiac in the drug importation racket (p 20.10). He also stated that he had assumed Mr Chidiac was involved in importing drugs because of his association with, inter alia, Helias (p19.10). Oti said he told them of George’s involvement, but the police were not “interested in asking questions” about him (p15.10).
	
	
	During the interview Oti was asked about a letter he wrote to Kwalu while in custody. The letter was taken to Kwalu by one of the investigating detectives (see [42]):
	


“Q: Can you tell me what was contained in that letter?

A: mmm Almost the same things I told him on the phone. I just told him to co-operate with [the Detective] for whatever questions he asks.

Q: Did you tell him what you had said about Neil Chidiac in that letter. Did you write out what you said about him.

A: No No

Q: Did you ask him to make a statement against Neil Chidiac to corroborate what you had said.

A: Something along that line. Yes I did.

Q: Can you remember what those words were?

A: I say something along the lines that Err if Terry asking anything about Neil or anybody else just to answer they Err answer him err correctly say the truth. Tell them the truth.

Q: In the truth did you what the truth was? As Err or make any suggestions to him about what to say?

A: No. I didn’t make suggestions.

Q: You understand what I saying is that you have now said that the information you gave was false.

A: mmm

Q: How did Wilson come to corroborate something that was false? Which you Err nnnow say is false?

A: Err Probably I could have mentioned something in the letter Err but I can’t remember. What I said.”


	
	The last answer in this passage appears to show Oti anticipating that the questioner was exploring a theory that Oti included (false) details concerning Mr Chidiac in the letter in an endeavour to manufacture corroborative evidence from Kwalu.
	
	
	During the interview, Oti was also asked about Mr Chidiac’s pager. He denied being aware that Mr Chidiac had a pager when he visited Honiara but states that he was subsequently told by George that Chidiac had a pager and was given his number (p42). Oti stated that he never contacted Chidiac. However he later stated he was given the pager number by one of the investigating detectives while in gaol and that he did not have the number prior to that (p 43 to 44).
	
	
	In 1997 Oti was interviewed by reporters from the “Witness” program (the “1997 interview”). During that interview he reiterated what he stated in the above statement. The television program that was broadcast included footage of Oti writing the statement in [34] and extracts from the 1997 interview. Included in the materials provided in support of this application is a transcript of the entire 1997 interview. Four points should be noted about that interview.
	
	
	First, in the 1997 interview Oti said the investigating police had suggested Kwalu’s involvement to him and he had confirmed it (A192). He suggested that they may have learned of it through “George”, the alleged organiser.
	
	
	Second, in the 1997 interview Oti was asked about the letter to Kwalu. He said that the investigating detective told Oti that he would be travelling to Honiara to see Kwalu and suggested that he, Oti, write a letter to Kwalu (A49). Oti said that he gave the letter to the detective who took it to Kwalu (A56). He said that he did not see the detective read the letter but suspected that he did (A59).
	
	
	At Mr Chidiac’s trial the detective agreed that he took a letter from Oti in gaol to Kwalu in Honiara (Tab 7 p231). The extract of the trial transcript that has been provided in support of this application does not record any question being asked of the detective as to whether he read the letter or was otherwise aware of its contents.
	
	
	It is instructive to compare what Oti said about the contents of the letter in the 1997 interview with the 1994 interview as set out in [32]. In the 1997 Interview, he was asked:
	


“Q. 50 What was in the letter that you gave to [the Detective]?

A I can’t remember all of the contents of the letter, but I – I mentioned to Wilson that he had to co-operate with [the Detective] and not to mention any other names except Neil’s name, because [the Detective] was going to come over to him to talk about Neil.

…

Q54 Did you tell Wilson the story he should tell about Neil Chidiac, about the meeting that was supposed to happen here?

A Yes, I told him in that letter to – to say that we met Neil here and discussed something about drugs and that when he went over to Sydney that he met Neil.”

Thus, by this time Oti was claiming that his letter advised Kwalu of the supposedly false details to include in his testimony against Mr Chidiac. In the extract from the 1994 interview, set out in [32], he initially denied doing so but then suggested he “could have mentioned something in the letter.”


	
	Third, during the 1997 interview the reporter asked Oti about the pager service. Oti said that Chidiac never gave him the number of “Neil’s pager” but instead it was “George”. In particular he was asked:
	


“Q 316 Did Neil ever say to you, “When you ring the pager service, ask for Neil and say, “This is Alf””?

A.  Right, yeah, that’s right. Yeah, that’s what George told me.

…

Q318 Neil never said that?

A.  No, he didn’t say that.”

Unlike the 1994 interview, Oti did not suggest the police gave him the pager number.


	
	Fourth, from “Q360” of the 1997 interview onwards, Oti alleged that at some point he changed his statement to conform with Kwalu’s statement. He said he did this at the request of the prosecutor, then a senior barrister. He said the barrister visited him in jail and “told me that the statement that [Kwalu] gave [the Detective] and the statement that I gave [Kwalu] a bit – some bits are needing alteration” (A374). He said that some days later the police provided him with a copy of Kwalu’s statement and that he, Oti, provided an additional statement to “match Kwalu’s”.
	
	
	This aspect of the 1997 interview is significant. The television program that was broadcast emphasised Oti’s efforts to reform his alcohol problem through religion. It included extracts from the video interview in which Oti exonerated Chidiac and expressed regret for implicating him in the conspiracy. However, a viewing of the entirety of the video, especially these later extracts, shows Oti as being both highly suggestible and manipulative. He is prepared to take morsels of information from the questioner and then elaborate upon them in his answers. Thus the part of the interview in which he implicates the prosecutor commences with Oti attempting to recall the name of the barrister but not identifying his role. He is then asked by the reporter as follows:
	


“Q 360 [Name] was the prosecutor. Do you remember him?

A Yes I do.

Q 361    And what do you remember? Tell me

A I remember at one stage after I have – I had given evidence against Neil I was transferred down to another gaol, a special unit in Long Bay gaol. [the barrister] and others visited me to – to tell me that my evidence, the statement that I gave against Neil, was not in line with the evidence that Wilson gave.”


	
	Viewed as a totality, and not in light of the sympathetic treatment given in the television program that accompanied it, the 1997 interview does not reveal Oti to be a reformed liar seeking to expunge his conscience. Nevertheless the material still raises concerns about any conviction that rests substantially on his evidence. In his efforts to explain how he (apparently) falsely implicated Mr Chidiac in a conspiracy to import heroin, Oti appears to be prepared to implicate others in a conspiracy to pervert justice and appears to have done so only after their names were suggested to him.
	
	
	Otherwise I note the submissions on behalf of Mr Chidiac also referred to an interview he conducted with (then) Detective Mark Standen on 23 December 1985 (tab 2). The submissions noted that, in that interview, Oti did not mention Mr Chidiac. This takes the matter nowhere. The subject matter of that interview was the importation that led to Oti’s arrest in 1985 and not the earlier importation that was said to involve Mr Chidiac.
	


Kwalu


	
	I was not provided with any material addressing the position of Kwalu. As best as I can ascertain he travelled from the Solomon Islands to give evidence against Mr Chidiac. He does not appear to have had as stronger a motivation to lie about Mr Chidiac’s involvement as Oti. Although he received an indemnity from prosecution, there does not seem to have been much prospect of his being extradited and prosecuted. However he was a relative of Oti’s and the tenor of the above is that Oti expected him to assist police, presumably to aid Oti in obtaining favourable treatment.
	


The Pager 


	
	In his unsworn statement to the jury Mr Chidiac said the following about the pager:
	


“Now, I come to the part, the story of the voice call. I bought a Voice Call privately for $200 some time in November 85 or December 85. I rang up the girl at the time on the switch board, I can’t remember the name, and I told her I bought a private beeper, I wish to transfer it in my name. The girl at the time she said we don’t do this service. Because you can not purchase beepers through private people. The only way you can purchase the beeper is through us. We buy the beeper and you lease it from us, maybe it for financial purposes.

She said the best way to deal with this is to see Benny Pinnychis he was the sales manager at the time or something like that. I rang him up and made an appointment after a couple of days and I saw Benny Pinchas. I explained to him the situation of the beeper and he brought a contract with the name of Jacob’s on it. I don’t know how the name got to it. But that is the contract with Jacob’s on it. He said ‘don’t worry about it we use this contract nothing to worry it will transferred in your name in no time’ and the same sales pitch and everything is smooth. I agreed to that. I made three months in advance lease on the beeper and there has been no previous record to say I paid earlier payments than that. That was in December 85.

So the time when Alfred Oti supposed to ring me and make this fantastic way of contacting me I didn’t have a beeper at the time. I didn’t even know the number myself. Somebody read the contract and seen 1984 on it, said he must have had a beeper but someone has made a mistake. This beeper was a bit of dud beeper, malfunctions a lot. Using too many batteries. Every two days you have to load the battery in it. I complained about it later on and that was the only beeper available.

Later on knew beepers came on the market and I purchased another beeper from Benny Pinchor and I cancelled the previous beeper service on it. That is why the it appears here in some papers saying that my account is overdue. They didn’t cancel it. The they let it run although I am not using it. And another, name, Carnagie on the envelope, that is the person I rang him later on, we have a bit argue about it and I say I refuse to pay service on the beeper although I cancelled it and I don’t wish to have the second beeper. I think your services are not required any more.

There was no secret about my beeper at all. I printed on my letterheads in my company December 85, I wasn’t hiding the fact I possessed a beeper. It was the companies name, which appeared today. Same name, same form.”


	
	In support of the application Mr Chidiac’s solicitors supplied an affidavit from Tony John Hughes. Mr Hughes explained that in 1987 he commenced work in the telecommunications industry. He said that around that time the industry had introduced alpha numeric codes but that, prior to that time, all pagers were either linked to a dedicated phone number or required the caller to know the beeper owner’s unique pager number, which they would supply when telephoning a common call centre.
	
	
	The effect of Mr Hughes’ evidence was that a person in Oti's position who was seeking to contact Mr Chidiac would have needed more information than simply the number of Chidiac’s paging service, which was 211–1100. Instead Oti would either have needed a unique pager that identified Mr Chidiac or the paging company would have had to operate an answering service which would have allowed Oti to request that a message be left for Mr Chidiac. Mr Hughes also stated that it was possible for a person to buy or rent a pager and subsequently transfer it to someone else, as stated by Mr Chidiac in his unsworn statement.
	
	
	Based on his affidavit it was submitted that Mr Hughes’ evidence negates a ‘critical assumption’ of McHugh J’s reasoning in Chidiac, “namely that it was possible to contact Mr Chidiac directly by knowing only the paging number 211-1100 and providing a cryptic code phrase upon calling that number”. It was contended that the fact that it was not possible “confirms that Oti was lying in his account”.
	
	
	I do not agree. In Chidiac McHugh J was not confronted with any challenge to Oti’s evidence concerning the pager on the basis that it was not possible to contact Mr Chidiac by merely possessing the number of the paging service company. The matter addressed by McHugh J concerned Mr Chidiac’s denial that he did not possess a pager service at the time of the alleged conspiracy, namely May 1985. His Honour reviewed the contract and concluded that it was open to a reasonable jury to find that he did subscribe to a pager service with voicecall at that time.
	
	
	Otherwise there are a number of difficulties with this aspect of the application. First, Mr Hughes commenced working in the telecommunications industry in 1987. I am sceptical of his capacity to opine about the position of the paging company’s operations in 1985. Second the transcript of the evidence given by Oti at Mr Chidiac’s trial on the question of the pager has not been provided. It is not clear whether he described some system that did involve, for example, telephoning the paging company and requesting the operator to send a message. Third, according to his unsworn statement, Mr Chidiac was a subscriber to the paging company from late 1985. If in 1985 it was necessary to do more than simply call their number to contact him then it is to be expected that Mr Chidiac would have known that and raised it with his Counsel. It seems that did not happen. To the contrary, in his unsworn statement Chidiac said that his pager number was on his business letterhead. No doubt he was implying that Oti could have obtained the pager service number from that source and not from him. It seems highly improbable that if Oti had not accurately described the system for contacting Mr Chidiac on a voice call pager some issue would not have arisen about it at trial and on appeal.
	
	
	That said, the significance of the material about the pager service should not be overstated. By itself, it only provided mild support for Oti’s evidence implicating Mr Chidiac. There appears to be a number of means by which Oti could have obtained Chidiac’s pager details. As noted, he appears to have a propensity for digesting morsels of information and incorporating them into his narrative. It is true that McHugh J concluded that the pager contract “convincingly confirmed” Oti and Kwalu’s evidence but that was only because his Honour held that a reasonable jury was “entitled” to conclude that Mr Chidiac lied in saying he had a paging service in May 1985. In turn this depended upon a reasonable jury being “entitled” to conclude that the contract proved he did so. A finding to either effect was not compelled by the evidence.
	


Mr Chidiac’s trip to Honiara


	
	Mr Chidiac’s solicitors also supplied a letter from Mr Kenneth Low dated 19 October 2012. Mr Low practiced as an architect in New South Wales in the early 1980s. Mr Low was engaged by Mr Chidiac to design his house in Clovelly. He stated that, after he was involved in a car accident in 1983, he closed his architectural practice and returned to Fiji. He recalled that, at the end of May or in early June 1985, Mr Chidiac visited him in his offices in Fiji to discuss the progress of the renovations. In an affidavit sworn in support of this application Mr Chidiac stated that he originally planned only to visit Mr Low in Fiji but at the instigation of his travel agent he added a trip to Honiara to the itinerary.
	
	
	It was submitted that this material provides an innocent explanation for how it was that Mr Chidiac came to be in Honiara and then meet Oti. However I do not consider that it advances the matter very far. Mr Chidiac made no mention of this in his unsworn statement. The fact that Mr Chidiac visited Mr Low in Fiji provides little justification for him then travelling to Honiara. That said, while the fact that Mr Chidiac met Oti in Honiara, as he agreed he did, is capable of arousing some suspicion, of itself it is not incriminating. As noted by McHugh J in Chidiac this did not confirm the evidence of Oti or Kwalu to the extent that they implicated Mr Chidiac.
	


Failure to call George


	
	The summary of the Crown case in Chidiac at [21] described the role of the person known as “George”. At [22] I noted the direction given by the trial judge concerning the Crown’s failure to call him as a witness.
	
	
	In support of this application, an extract from the evidence of the investigating detective at Mr Chidiac’s trial was supplied. The detective agreed that “George” had a ""prominent part to play in the conspiracy"", the subject of the charge against Mr Chidiac. The detective was also asked whether he was instructed not to make inquiries about George. He replied ""not in so many words"" but added ""it was an understanding I had with conversations with senior police I would not make certain inquiries in relation to George"" (T226.9.)
	
	
	Mr Chidiac’s solicitors also provided an affidavit from Mr Alan Taciak. Mr Taciak is a former AFP officer. He confirmed that George was a registered informant of the AFP’s Sydney drug unit. Mr Taciak states that in 1986 he was appointed as George’s controller. Mr Taciak states that he was directed by a Detective Inspector within that unit to ""give further information against Neil Chidiac which he did”. Mr Taciak states that “George … received a reward” for doing so. He opined that the information supplied by George concerning Mr Chidiac was false information and that at the time of Mr Chidiac’s trial the AFP was aware of his whereabouts.
	
	
	There was also supplied an unsigned statement from “George” prepared some time around November 2003. The origins of the statement are explained by an affidavit from a private investigator sworn on 14 November 2003. The investigator explained that the statement was prepared following a conference between a senior barrister, acting for Mr Chidiac, and George. He said the statement was then amended in accordance with instructions from George but he was not willing to sign it.
	
	
	In his unsigned statement George recalled being been told by Mr Taciak that it was believed that Mr Chidiac ""was involved in drugs"" and he was asked to verify this. He said that he made inquiries and was told that Mr Chidiac was a ""very smart man and could be the mastermind of Sam [Helias]”. George stated that he was then requested by the Detective Inspector to make a statement implicating Mr Chidiac as a drug dealer. The statement records that he refused, telling the detective “I do not believe that it was true”.
	
	
	Mr Chidiac’s submissions in support of the application contended that from this material it was possible to ""infer that questionable dealings"" were behind the Crown’s refusal to identify ""George” at the trial and call him as a witness. It was also contended that it is clear that the information that George supplied to the AFP and which lead to the charge against Mr Chidiac was false and that ""serious questions must be asked about the methods and practices employed during the AFP investigation"". Finally it was contended that, instead of there merely being a basis for drawing a Jones v Dunkel inference against the Crown by reason of the failure to call George, in light of George’s statement, there was and is a basis for a much stronger inference, namely that if George had been called at the trial he would have exonerated Mr Chidiac.
	
	
	I note four matters in relation to this issue.
	
	
	First, in contrast to the practice prevalent at the time of Mr Chidiac’s trial, the current approach is that where the Crown does not call a material witness whom it would be expected to call, that does not warrant the drawing of adverse inferences in respect of its case as per Jones v Dunkel. Instead it is treated as a matter relevant to “whether the jury … should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused” (Mahmood v Western Australia (2008) 232 CLR 397 at [27]). However nothing in this matter turns on this.
	
	
	Second, to the extent that the submissions in support of this application invite speculation about “questionable dealings” by the AFP in handling George then the invitation must be rejected. Even if I had held some suspicions or misgiving about police conduct that is not the same as having the requisite sense of unease about a particular conviction.
	
	
	Third, the Crown contended that the unsigned statement from George is not evidence at all as it is unsigned. This echoes a repeated theme of the Crown’s submissions concerning the alleged inadequacy of the unsworn form of the material provided in support of this application, much of it being either interviews or statements and not affidavits. That may be so but generally all fresh material set out in statements provided in support of these applications including affidavits is “hearsay”. Nevertheless it can and must be considered and given the appropriate weight (see [18]). For the purposes of this application, the affidavit from the investigator provides a sufficient basis for concluding that George told the investigator and the senior barrister what is set out in the unsigned statement. That said, the statement of George is inconsistent with the statement provided by Mr Taciak. Mr Taciak states that George provided information implicating Chidiac whereas George states that he only provided an initial assessment that Chidiac might be the controller of Helias and claims to have otherwise told them that Chidiac was not involved. The statement of Mr Taciak tells against the third submission noted in [64]. His statement suggests that if George had been called to Mr Chidiac’s trial he would, or at least might, have implicated Mr Chidiac (although Mr Taciak’s personal opinion was that that would have been false).
	
	
	Fourth, Mr Taciak’s statement suggests that there may have been a proper reason for not calling George at the trial, namely that he had clearly been involved in criminal conduct and there was reason to believe he would not be a witness of truth. However, no such explanation appears to have been provided to the trial judge and the decision not to call him was not explained by the Crown in its submissions in support of this application either. The fact that the investigating detective inferred that he was not to make inquiries in relation to George, and that the detective did not make these enquiries, is troubling.
	
	
	The end result is that there was an unjustifiable and admitted failure by the investigating detective to make inquiries into a person he believed to be the organiser of the relevant conspiracy, and there was and is, an unexplained failure by the Crown to call that person as a Crown witness. Moreover material has now been provided, albeit relatively weak hearsay, that is capable of suggesting that the witness could have exonerated Mr Chidiac and did tell one investigating detective that he was innocent. The potential significance of this relevant to the satisfaction of the statutory test is addressed below.
	


Conclusion


	
	Leaving aside the evidence of Messrs Oti and Kwalu, there are undoubtedly some aspects of Mr Chidiac’s conduct in 1985 that arouse suspicion. Mr Chidiac employed Helias who was clearly involved in the drug importation ring. He travelled to Honiara and, at Helias’ suggestion, met with Oti who also was involved in drug importation. If Mr Chidiac was not involved in the importation of drugs then Mr Helias was incurring a very significant risk in having his employer meet one of his drug contacts, especially someone as unreliable as Oti.
	
	
	However of itself this material was and is not capable of supporting Mr Chidiac’s conviction. At best it constitutes objective facts consistent with Oti and Kwalu’s account. While the evidence concerning the existence of the pager contract may have been the “strongest” piece of corroborative evidence against Mr Chidiac (see [28]) that is not much of an achievement in Mr Chidiac’s case. Oti only implicated Mr Chidiac after he was arrested for another offence. There are a number of means by which Oti could have obtained his pager contact details in the meantime.
	
	
	The case against Mr Chidiac rested exclusively on the testimony of two confessed criminals and perjurers, namely Messrs Oti and Kwalu. The guilty verdict was sustained by the need to give appropriate deference to the undoubted advantage the jury enjoyed in hearing their evidence and observing it being delivered (see [31]). However, at this point the strength of that deference is diminished because, while Oti admitted at the trial that he had lied, he did not admit, as he has since, that he lied about Mr Chidiac’s involvement.
	
	
	I have been provided with evidence that Oti has twice retracted claims of Mr Chidiac’s involvement. While I have misgivings about a number of aspects of the statements he made in the 1994 interview and the 1997 interview, those misgivings only reinforce the concerns about his evidence at the trial implicating Mr Chidiac. In light of that material there are strong reasons to doubt whether any reasonable tribunal of fact, properly instructed, could act on any aspect of his evidence implicating Mr Chidiac even with the three items of corroborative evidence identified by McHugh J in Chidiac. That evidence and the evidence of Oti and Kwalu had a reinforcing quality about it, but that only means that undermining one part has the potential to affect the force of the rest. The Crown case was weak and once a substantial part of it is diminished, namely Oti’s testimony, the remainder loses some, and perhaps much, of its force.
	
	
	In many other cases the mere fact that an important Crown witness recants will not of itself give rise to the requisite sense of unease about the conviction. There are many reasons why a witness may recant. However, in this case, even if one does not accept the veracity of Oti’s retractions, it only highlights the fragility of a conviction that depended upon his evidence. An already weak case has been weakened further. In the end result I am left with a sense of “unease or a sense of disquiet” in relation to the conviction (see [16]). I consider that there does appear to be a doubt about Mr Chidiac’s guilt within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Review Act.
	
	
	Of itself the circumstances surrounding the failure to call George and the limited material that has been obtained concerning him since does not lead me to have the requisite sense of unease about Mr Chidiac’s conviction. However it should not be considered alone. It provides some additional support for my conclusion that the requisite doubt has been established.
	
	
	This application has been made more than 20 years after Mr Chidiac’s conviction. Notwithstanding the conclusion in [75], I considered whether to decline to make any order under s 79(1) of the Review Act by reason of the delay in the making of this application. I will not do so for three reasons. First, the Crown did not make any submissions to that effect. Second, I have already noted that Mr Chidiac made an application to this Court in 1996 but no record of it having been determined can be found. There is a real potential for injustice to refuse this application where a previous application was not determined. Third, the effects of delay can be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal or any judicial officer to whom the matter is referred. In particular, if the effect of delay is such that a particular matter cannot be properly investigated then presumably that would tend to support the maintenance of the conviction rather than undermine it.
	
	
	Accordingly, pursuant to s79(1)(b) of the Review Act, I refer the whole of Mr Chidiac’s case for review of his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

2766043,R v Goodwin [2015] NSWSC 2107,"EX-TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Blake Goodwin applies for bail. He was born in June 1993 and is some weeks short of his 22nd birthday.
	
	
	He was arrested on 23 December last year and charged with a series of offences including larceny, supplying a prohibited firearm to an unauthorised person, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and for present purposes significantly throwing explosive with intent to maim a named victim.
	
	
	These matters are listed for mention in the Central Local Court on 9 April this year when it is anticipated that the balance of the brief will be served. Mr Goodwin has been in custody bail refused since the date of his arrest. The Crown opposes bail.
	
	
	The applicant is charged with a show cause offence and needs initially to demonstrate that there are reasons why his continued custody should not be continued. He is a young man and is in gaol for the first time. Those matters appear to me to demonstrate a sufficient indication that he has shown cause why his continued custody is not justified.
	
	
	The Crown has indicated that it is concerned about a number of matters described in the Act as bail concerns. It is sufficient for present purposes to deal only with two. The first is that there is a concern that the applicant may commit a serious offence and/or endanger the safety of victims or the community.
	
	
	Although I am not called upon to determine the truth or otherwise of the allegations which found the charges facing the applicant, the brief facts include the proposition that the applicant, armed with a container of petrol, followed or chased the victim some distance spreading petrol on the ground and ultimately to some extent upon her, which he attempted unsuccessfully in the events that occurred to ignite.
	
	
	That behaviour in the context of the applicant’s limited but to some degree indicative criminal history, seems to me seriously to inform the proposition that bail conditions of the sort I am able to impose cannot operate sufficiently to mitigate the bail concerns that the Crown has identified.
	
	
	I am troubled that a refusal of bail will lead to a considerable period on remand for a young man in custody for the first time. Bearing in mind that the activity upon which I am presently engaged is definitively a balancing activity, it seems to me that on balance, for the reasons I have identified, bail should be refused.

2766050,Hazell v R [2015] NSWCCA 26,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Justice Blanch in the District Court of New South Wales on 17 December 2013 as follows:
	



	
	On a count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 5 January 2013 and expiring on 4 January 2015. This is an offence contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On a count of aggravated detain for advantage to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 5 January 2013 and expiring on 4 January 2017 with an additional term of 2 years expiring on 4 January 2019. This is an offence contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On a count of reckless wounding to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 5 January 2013 expiring on 4 January 2016. This is an offence contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	



	
	The applicant was therefore sentenced to a total sentence of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 5 January 2013 and expiring on 4 January 2019, with a total non-parole period of 4 years expiring on 4 January 2017.
	
	
	All offences occurred on 5 January 2013 and the applicant has been in custody since his arrest on that day. He pleaded guilty to all three offences in circumstances attracting a 25 percent discount. The applicant contends that the sentences imposed were attended by error and liable to be set aside as manifestly excessive. He seeks leave to appeal and has raised three grounds of appeal as follows:
	



	
	In considering the applicant’s mental health issues, his Honour erred in failing to take into account:
	



	
	The causal link between the applicant’s mental health issues and the commission of the offences; and/or
	
	
	The more onerous conditions of custody faced by the applicant.
	



	
	The sentences imposed were otherwise manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in declining to set a non-parole period for the third count being an offence that carried a standard non-parole period.
	


Background


	
	His Honour recited the facts in uncontroversial terms. Although his Honour’s remarks are detailed, they are particularly instructive for present purposes. At pages 1 - 4 of his sentencing remarks his Honour described what happened as follows:
	


“The facts of the case are that the offender and the victim began a relationship in 2012. The agreed facts indicate that that relationship was marked by domestic violence which was unreported. On one occasion the victim’s mother asked the offender to leave the premises because of it and he subsequently apologised. There were assaults prior to this assault but nowhere as serious as the matters being dealt with here.

On 5 January 2013 the offender and his partner had been at the Lithgow Hotel, and he invited five friends back to the premises where they were living. There was an argument between the victim and the offender, and she went outside to smoke. He went outside and she said to him ‘stop showing off, I’m sick of you doing this all the time and treating me like shit’. The offender then raised his fist and told the victim to lock herself in her bedroom and not come out. Instead she went to her mother’s house, and when she got there she sent him an SMS saying that she was home and ‘I’m so sick of being treated like shit so have fun’. This was in the early hours of the morning and at about 6am the victim’s mother went off to work. She went inside and lay on a couch.

Shortly after, the offender came to the premises and knocked on the door, and he pushed his way into the house and saw her and he said ‘what the fuck are you doing?’ and she said ‘what does it look like? I’m at mum’s because you are starting on me.’ He then told her to go home. She refused. He then grabbed her by the arm and said ‘I swear on junior that I am not going to hurt you.’ He then dragged her by the hand to the car. Junior is their infant child.

As soon as the victim got in the front door of the property where they were staying, the offender threw her against a wall of the property and her mouth began to bleed. She said ‘stop please, you promised me’. He said ‘you are nothing but a slut. Who are the guys you met up with?’ He then kicked the victim in the mouth and stomped on her head. He then grabbed the victim’s hair and dragged her to the bedroom. He threw her onto the bed. She pretended she was passed out while the offender punched her in the head a few more times. Finally the offender punched her two more times before she pretended to regain consciousness. He then kneed her in the face and resumed punching her, predominantly in the back of her head, and pulling her by the hair, and at this stage she did lose consciousness. Those facts constitute the assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

After the victim regained consciousness on the bed, her face felt puffed up. The victim saw the offender standing over her, holding a large kitchen knife in his hands. The offender said ‘I’m going to kill you’ three or four times before scraping the knife across the victim’s arms and stomach. The offender punched the victim in the face again. This caused a wound to the inside of the victim’s cheek. The offender then threw the knife at the victim’s head. It missed and landed on the bed. Those facts constitute the reckless wounding.

The offender grabbed the knife, and as the victim was laying face down on the bed he hit her approximately five times to the back with the knife. He then grabbed her hair and turned her onto her back. He then hit her with both fists until she passed out. When she regained consciousness she noticed that when she coughed, blood came out of her mouth. The offender said to her ‘this is what you get for cheating. You’re going to cop this every day for trying to leave’. The victim asked for an ice pack. The offender said ‘no. If anyone sees this black eye, I’m going to kill you.’ He left the room and came back with a frozen rissole which was put on her eye, and he then gave her some ice cubes which she sucked on due to dehydration. The victim sat up because she felt sick. The offender kept saying to the victim that she would cop it again until she learned her lesson. He shut the bedroom door and punched the victim in the mouth.

At around 2.30pm the victim’s mother began ringing the victim’s phone number, but the offender would not give the phone to her. At this stage the offender told the victim he was going to put her in the manhole above the bathroom and torture her. The offender gave the victim her mobile phone and told her to SMS her mother that they were at Nanki’s and not home. The victim did this. People were knocking on the front door and the victim’s mother called out ‘Anthony, let Alana go.’ The mother called the police. The police arrived. The offender then returned and started pacing saying he was sorry and did not want to go back to gaol. He began crying and saying he did not mean it. He also said ‘shut up and don’t look at your mum. Say I didn’t do it.’ Police then entered the premises.

The victim was taken to hospital on a stretcher. Her injuries were both eyes bruised and swollen significantly, inhibiting sight. Bruising and swelling to the forehead, a scratch to the left collarbone redness and bruising to the right shoulder and upper arm with faint circular marks a carpet burn to the right elbow swelling and redness to the left wrist faint circular marks approximately 25 millimetres in diameter on the left shoulder area bruising to the left elbow, bicep and upper arm red marks behind the left ear, large red mark visible on the lower back, four individual triangular outlines consistent with the outline of a knife blade, and a cut to the inner right cheek.

At the time of his arrest, the offender said to the police ‘I didn’t do anything. I don’t know what happened. It occurred sometime last night. I don’t know what happened. I was asleep.’ In his ERISP he said he could not remember anything between having a drink in his lounge room the night before when the police arrived. The police noted he had skin off his fists and a slight laceration on his right chin.”


	
	The applicant’s criminal history was detailed in a pre-sentence report that was provided to his Honour. The applicant was born in March 1985 and was 28 years of age when sentenced. He had what his Honour considered to be a significant criminal history. The applicant was previously sentenced on 28 May 2010 at the Sydney District Court for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 18 days with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 days. He was released on parole on 6 July 2011. His Honour considered that offending to have involved the sort of violence for which his Honour was required to sentence him. The applicant had a history of other offences that his Honour described as “relating to violence or being unable to control himself” which his Honour characterised as “a matter of concern.”
	


Ground 1


	
	His Honour specifically referred to the Probation and Parole report that referred to the applicant’s background in these terms:
	


“Mr Hazell experienced a dysfunctional upbringing characterised by alcoholism, violence and neglect. He is a person with a long term substance abuse history. He suffers from depression and anxiety, and he has an intellectual disability. His criminal history consists mainly of violent offences. The [applicant] demonstrated some insight of his need for treatment regarding his mental health issues and substance abuse.”


	
	The report of Dr Furst dated 25 September 2013 is central to this ground of appeal. It deals with the applicant’s condition in more detail. As his Honour observed, the report indicates that the applicant’s father was an alcoholic who was very violent towards him, subjecting him to regular physical abuse and domestic violence episodes in the household. The applicant had learning difficulties at school, smoked some cannabis from the age of 15, smoking significant amounts by the age of 18. His cannabis use was associated with transient paranoid symptoms. The applicant used amphetamines and ice from the age of 18, as well as cocaine. He drank heavily from the age of 14.
	
	
	Dr Furst observed that the applicant was unable to give details of the offences because he could not remember. He also noted that after the applicant went into gaol he went to the Acute Crisis Management Unit and was on suicide watch for a period of time. He remained there for five months.
	
	
	Dr Furst reviewed other reports that had been prepared. They included a report by Dr Allnutt in 2010 indicating an extremely low level of intellectual functioning. Dr Allnutt also thought that there was some paranoid thinking but could not be certain. Dr Furst also referred to a report by Dr Thomas Oldtree Clark dated 1 March 2013. Dr Clark’s conclusion was that the applicant suffered from schizophrenia although Dr Furst did not consider that diagnosis to have been clearly articulated, particularly in the light of atypical features in presentation, heavy substance abuse, low intellectual functioning and apparent personality dysfunction.
	
	
	At page seven of his sentencing remarks, his Honour said this:
	


“Dr Furst having gone through all of that material did not conclude that [the applicant] suffered from schizophrenia but said that he did suffer from substance use disorder being poly substance dependence, also mild range intellectual disability, and a personality disorder and also chronic dysthymia. He also referred to his apparent lack of memory for his offending actions and said that if that is accepted, it is possible that he suffered some type of alcohol related amnesic episode or blackout. He recommended that if he is incarcerated that he be placed in a specialised unit for management of inmates with developmental disabilities. He also concluded that,

‘he…has a number of negative prognostic risk factors including childhood victimisation, low intellect, impulsivity, a substance use disorder, episodes of anger, aggression and serious violence, and probably an underlying personality disorder’.”


	
	In the present circumstances the principles to apply are not in doubt: see Director of Public Prosecutions v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]. The burden of the applicant’s contentions is that his Honour failed to apply the principles in this case.
	
	
	Dr Furst drew a causal link between the applicant’s mental state and the offending conduct, in association with substance and alcohol abuse. The applicant contended that his Honour did not consider this. It was also contended that his Honour failed to consider that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily upon the applicant given his conditions.
	
	
	However, his Honour included the following passage in his sentencing remarks:
	


“I have gone through those reports in some detail because one other significant factor to be taken into account in sentencing is the fact that if a person is suffering from a significant mental condition, then the principles of general deterrence have less significance than they might otherwise have, and in addition to the discount that I have already indicated of 25% for the plea of guilty, there should also be a discount where it is found that there are matters affecting his intellectual functioning.”


	
	His Honour went on to say this:
	


“There does have to be a sentence of some significance in relation to a course of conduct which can only be described as episodes of continued violence that must have terrorised the victim in this case. There cannot be any other outcome than a significant gaol sentence, particularly in the case of someone who has a history of violent conduct which has led to one quite significant gaol sentence in the past. There are special circumstances to disturb the statutory ratio because of his need for rehabilitation in respect of his drugs and alcohol, and the need that he has for assistance in respect of his intellectual functioning and whatever mental condition he does in fact have. The offences involved here are offences that all occurred as part of the same course of conduct and because of that the sentences in my view should all be concurrent, but there should be a sentence which ultimately reflects the total criminality.”


	
	Finally, as counsel for the applicant has pointed out, his Honour recommended that a copy of the reports of doctors Furst and Hepner should be attached to the warrants so that they go to the gaol with the applicant in order that the prison authorities are aware of his mental health and related problems.
	
	
	In my opinion it is abundantly clear that his Honour was aware that he was dealing with an offender with significant and well documented mental health and intellectual issues, associated as well with substance and alcohol abuse. It is not to my mind an error for a sentencing judge in such circumstances to fail in effect to refer to and recite on a point by point basis the factors so clearly identified and explained in De La Rosa. Putting aside the issue of whether his Honour had before him specific evidence of the way in which the applicant’s time in custody would be more onerous for him in the circumstances, it seems to me to be inherent in what his Honour has said that he has taken that (presently assumed but unproved) prospect into account. His Honour’s sentencing remarks are replete with references to medical reports and the competing concerns about the extent of the applicant’s several disabilities. A failure by a sentencing judge in general, or this judge in particular, to articulate the details of his concerns, within the structure of a thorough consideration of the applicant’s particular circumstances, does not generally constitute error and does not do so here. In fact, on one view his Honour’s specific mention that “there should also be a discount where it is found that there are matters affecting his intellectual functioning” is arguably standing alone a complete answer to this ground of appeal.
	
	
	It is also clear that his Honour’s reasoning sufficiently accommodated the prospect that the offending was linked to the applicant’s mental health issues. The fact that he does not say so in terms does not amount to an error in this case. That is for the simple but significant reason that none of the medical experts says so in as many words. Dr Furst’s opinion about this is linked to alcohol and substance abuse, as follows:
	


“His apparent lack of memory for his offending actions makes it possible he suffered some type of alcohol-related (and/or benzodiazepine-related) amnesic episode or ‘blackout’. The effects of his acute intoxication were probably the main factors triggering his high level of aggression towards the victim. However, his intellectual disability, poor coping skills under stress, and his underlying borderline personality disorder also contributed to the sustained violence towards the victim at the time of the offences in question…”


	
	However, there would appear to be little doubt that the offences were committed by an offender with serious mental health and related problems and it would be unrealistic to fail to proceed upon the basis that the two were connected to some extent at least. In this respect I consider that there is a clear theme running throughout his Honour’s careful analysis that recognises such a connection. His Honour did not fail to take it into account. Rather, the seriousness of the offending and the applicant’s criminal history would appear to have been factors that required the imposition of a proper sentence notwithstanding the special and particular circumstances of the applicant. There is not in my view any basis to conclude that his Honour misapprehended the relationship between these competing factors or misapplied the respective emphases to be given to them.
	


Ground 2


	
	I am unable to accept the submission that the overall sentence in this case is manifestly excessive. The circumstances of the offending are referred to earlier. The mitigating personal circumstances of the applicant were considered by his Honour. The applicant also received the not inconsiderable benefit of significant concurrency, with all sentences commencing on the same date, so that the applicant’s sentence in practical terms coincides, and is coextensive, with the individual sentence for the aggravated detain for advantage offence. As already noted, that is an offence contrary to s 86(2) (b) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	It is clear that the applicant subjected the victim to a violent attack over a sustained period. In that last respect I accept that there may be some doubt about the precise length of time over which the events took place but I am satisfied that the description I have chosen is accurate.
	
	
	I cannot accept in all of the circumstances of this case that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were unreasonable or plainly unjust. On one available view, the sentences were lenient. The applicant used a knife to terrify the victim, amounting to a serious aggravating feature of the offending. The applicant was also on parole at the time of the commission of these offences for earlier offences involving violence. There is nothing apparent to me to indicate that his Honour’s sentencing discretion was not properly exercised.
	


Ground 3


	
	This ground is predicated upon the expectation that this Court would decide to re-sentence the applicant. For reasons that will be apparent, the ground has no independent utility unless resentencing takes place, having regard to the sentences actually imposed by his Honour and the structure of those sentences. It is therefore unnecessary further to consider this ground.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my opinion the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Harrison J.

2766052,De Wet v R [2015] NSWCCA 23,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Conlon DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales on 30 April 2014 as follows:
	



	
	On a count of specially aggravated detain for advantage, to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 13 August 2012 and expiring on 12 August 2016. This is an offence contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On a count of inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, to imprisonment for 9 years commencing on 13 August 2013 and expiring on 12 August 2022 with a non-parole period of 6 years expiring on 12 August 2019. This is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	



	
	The applicant was therefore sentenced to a total effective head sentence of 10 years imprisonment commencing on 13 August 2012 and expiring on 12 August 2022, with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 12 August 2019.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to both counts. He received a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea in the order of 10 percent. The applicant contends that the sentences imposed were attended by error and are liable to be set aside as manifestly excessive. He seeks leave to appeal and has raised three grounds of appeal as follows:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in not assessing the objective seriousness of each offence separately.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in accumulating the sentences.
	
	
	The sentence on the second count is manifestly excessive.
	


Background


	
	The circumstances that give rise to the offences were described in detail by his Honour in his sentencing remarks. The applicant’s contentions necessarily draw heavily upon his Honour’s consideration and treatment of these facts and the relationship between the two offences. Some detail is therefore important. Those events included the following significant matters:
	


“In the months of June and July 2012 the offender Simon De Wet had a grievance against the victim, Timothy Mansfield. During those months Mr De Wet and his associates made attempts to find Mansfield and Mansfield then went into hiding actively avoiding Mr De Wet. During July 2012 De Wet was living at the house of Matthew and Nicole Dennison at an address in Bellambi. Police lawfully installed a covert listening device at that property. On 20 July 2012 the listening device recorded De Wet raging against an associate of his named Harley Anton about his inability to find the victim and his desire to hurt him. Amongst other things De Wet said, ‘You want to know how I treat people who piss me off, I fucking hurt cunts mate’. He told Anton to find the victim. He said that if he could not hurt the victim he would hurt Anton. Anton indicated that he thought the victim would be at his mother’s house, that is the victim’s mother’s house.

Police were also lawfully intercepting De Wet’s phone as well as the phones of some of his associates including the co-offender Joel Ropiha. On 24 July 2012 a conversation between De Wet and Ropiha was recorded in which De Wet asked Ropiha, ‘When are you going to fucking come down here man, I want to fucking rip this kid up’. He said, ‘There’ll be nothing left for the Juggernaut when he comes down here’ (Juggernaut is Joel Ropiha’s nickname). Ropiha replied, ‘Just give me, listen bro just give me one more night mate all right’.

On 25 July 2012 Ropiha met up with De Wet at the address in Bellambi, also present were the co-offenders Brody Allen, William Dalton Moana and Kristy Roth and another uncharged male offender. There was a discussion about attacking Mansfield much of this being recorded on the listening device. Amongst other things De Wet said to Ropiha, ‘Can you smash someone’s door in before you go’. He told Ropiha, ‘Get a machete and chop the furniture out the front’. Ropiha asked whether Timmy (the victim) would be there and De Wet said, ‘There would be a good chance he’d be upstairs’. De Wet said, ‘Just bash him and see you later. Just smash all the windows and trash the furniture’. He said to Brody Allen, ‘Oh yeah um rubber gloves please Brod, latex will do, just double up, we are just throwing stuff we don’t want fingerprints on’. Ropiha said he did not want to go because Mansfield might not be there. De Wet said, ‘Well don’t go, I’ll send Dalton and Brody’. Dalton is the co-offender William Dalton Moana. Moana said, ‘I don’t want to go either’.

Kristy Roth then volunteered to phone the victim whom she knew and find out where he was. Then she offered to go to his mother’s house and see if he was there, she said, ‘I’ll just go up to the door his mum loves me’. De Wet agreed so Roth rode a bicycle down to the victim’s mother’s house which was also in Bellambi. There she went inside and spoke to the victim and his mother. She asked the victim what he was doing that night and he indicated that he was not going out. As she left the house Roth left the front door ajar in order to facilitate entry into the house by the others. Roth returned to De Wet and the others and told him that Mansfield was home and that he was staying in. She told them that she had left the door open for them. She also told them that there was money in the drawers of the house and an ounce of pot. De Wet said, ‘Don’t worry they are going to get things out of him, more than money and they are going to bring him’.

Brody Allen then drove Ropiha, Moana and the other male offender to the victim’s mother’s house. Allen remained in the car. The others found the front door open and barged inside. They all wore jumpers with hoods drawn over their heads. They yelled out, ‘Who’s Tim’. The victim looked out from his room and said, ‘I’m Tim’. Ropiha punched the victim in the face and said, ‘Let’s go’. He and the others then took the victim back to Brody Allen’s car and Allen drove them to an area near the Bellambi swimming pool. De Wet was in phone contact with Brody Allen, he sent Allen a message which said, ‘Make him eat something disgusting, maybe break his teeth, step on his face’.

Ropiha, Moana and the other male offender walked Mansfield to the bottom of some stairs near the pools and told him to sit. A couple of minutes later Simon De Wet came walking down the stairs from behind Mansfield. De Wet said to Mansfield, ‘Holy shit it’s you hey, where have you been’. He stood in front of Mansfield and punched him in the face. Ropiha then kicked Mansfield in the face, stood on his face with his foot applying strong pressure. Mansfield felt immediate pain and felt blood running down his face. His eye swelled to the point where he could not see out of it. De Wet, Ropiha and the other male offender then repeatedly kicked and punched Mansfield who was on the ground while Moana stood by ready to assist. The beating went on for what felt to the victim ‘like forever’. At one stage during the assault De Wet picked Mansfield up by the throat restricting his breathing and held him in the air. Then when Mansfield thought that he was going to be choked De Wet dropped him and he fell to the ground on to his hands and his knees. De Wet resumed kicking and punching Mansfield in the ribs and back. One of the others said, ‘He is fucked, he’s fucked’. They dragged him over to some grass and De Wet and Ropiha continued to beat him, this went on for some time. They rolled Mansfield onto his back and De Wet and Ropiha started pushing their heels into his chest causing considerable pain and making it hard to breathe. The victim was then rolled back onto his hands and his knees and he started crawling up the grass hill. The offenders kicked him some more times then De Wet jumped onto Mansfield’s back and bit him on the top of his right ear. The bite avulsed a piece of skin and cartilage from the top of the victim’s ear. De Wet spat the piece of ear on the ground and he and the co-offenders left.

Mansfield had a friend who lived nearby so he ran to that friend’s house. Mansfield’s mother had called triple-0 as soon as the men had kidnapped him from their house earlier and when Mansfield turned up at his friend’s house after the attack the friend got in contact with Mansfield’s mother and so the police located him.

He was taken to hospital where he was found to have a nasal bone fracture, bruising and significant swelling of his face and body, multiple abrasions and the bite injury to his ear. Although the piece of ear was later found it was not reattached. Photos of the injury to the ear and of the avulsed ear portion are contained within exhibit A.

Police found the avulsed piece of ear later that night. It was swabbed and a DNA profile was obtained. That DNA profile matched the DNA profile of the offender De Wet.

The listening device was still operating in Matthew Dennison’s home and later in the night after the offences, De Wet was recorded gloating to Matthew Dennison. Amongst other things he said, ‘I’m feeling pretty good for the night Matty’, Matty asked, ‘What’s that’, De Wet told him, ‘Timmy didn’t get set up, he wouldn’t … so we went and kidnapped the cunt, we abducted him, we didn’t abduct him we repossessed him because he’s fucking our bitch.’

The next morning the same listening device recorded De Wet speaking to a female talking about Timmy, he said, ‘Yeah you don’t see things like that every day, you know what I mean, when was the last time, Tyson Holyfield 2.’ …”

Subjective case


	
	The applicant was born in December 1976 in South Africa and came to Australia in 1991. He was 37 years of age when sentenced. He has what was conceded to be an unfortunate criminal record, including offences of violence, dishonesty, drugs, resisting police, offensive language, trespass, property damage, driving offences and deal with the proceeds of crime. He was previously imprisoned for violence offences.
	
	
	The applicant informed Joan Horsell, a senior community corrections officer, who prepared a pre-sentence report dated 13 February 2014, that he was under the influence of illicit drugs when the offences were committed. He agreed that his drug use was not an excuse for his actions and that he “knew what he was doing at the time.” He said that he became angry when the victim did not repay a loan and appeared to be mocking him. He was adamant that he did not plan to kidnap the victim and he was at a loss to explain his actions when he bit off his ear. However, the agreed facts include a statement by the applicant that he hurt people who “pissed him off.” Ms Horsell also observed that the applicant was recorded apparently gloating about having kidnapped the victim and to have emulated an infamous incident in professional boxing by biting off part of the victim’s ear. He told Ms Horsell that he was, however, ashamed of his behaviour and accepted that he needed to take full responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	Dr Scott Clark, a consultant psychiatrist, prepared a report for sentencing purposes. His opinion for presently relevant purposes was as follows:
	


“In the 6 months prior to his arrest in July 2012, Mr De Wet had worsening mood, paranoid thinking, and auditory hallucinations. These occurred in the context of increasing and heavy use of stimulants including crystal methamphetamine and benzodiazepines. The symptoms, their duration, and history of drug use provided by Mr De Wet is consistent with a diagnosis of Substance Induced Psychotic Disorder and possibly Substance Induced Mood Disorder. Mr De Wet described experiencing psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and paranoid ideas around the time of the incident, and in the presence of psychosis judgement is often impaired and reality-testing compromised. Both psychosis and instability of mood can contribute to irritability and aggressiveness. Although I did not have access to the Justice Health treatment notes, there is evidence indicating Mr De Wet was clinically assessed and prescribed psychopharmacological treatment shortly after incarceration, and continues on medication to the present time.

Mr De Wet’s pattern of drug use is consistent with Amphetamine and Anxiolytic Dependence, and I would consider the possibility of alcohol misuse. These conditions were reportedly present at the time of the offence.”

Ground 1


	
	The applicant’s principal case is that his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences failed adequately or properly to distinguish between the two offences in that he regarded the facts globally without considering each offence separately or individually. This ground relied upon what was said in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] as follows:
	


“[45] To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.”


	
	The applicant contended that his Honour ought first to have assessed the objective seriousness of each offence in order to “fix an appropriate sentence”. In circumstances where separate sentences are imposed for discrete offences, the principle of totality is offended where the antecedent step of assessing objective seriousness is not separately undertaken or identified.
	
	
	The Crown contended that his Honour made no such error. He set out the agreed facts, dealt with objective seriousness and concluded that the facts could not support the suggestion that the applicant suddenly lost control when confronting the victim. He wanted the victim found and hurt. His Honour found that there was considerable planning involved including locating the victim and despatching co-offenders to capture him. His Honour found that the applicant was the ringleader. The attack upon the victim was described by his Honour as vicious. It involved more than one assailant and was sustained and brutal. The victim was repeatedly punched and kicked, was unable to defend himself and was hopelessly outnumbered. His Honour found that the attack involved gratuitous cruelty, including the continuation of the beating after the victim was obviously spent and biting off a portion of his ear. The applicant did this last act after jumping on the victim’s back which his Honour described as both sickening and an act of savagery. The applicant was callously boasting after the event of what he had done, reflecting his “sheer callousness”.
	
	
	His Honour referred to Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 47 and continued as follows:
	


“Of course one could envisage a similar offence involving the victim remaining captive for a longer period of time and possibly suffering worse injuries or indeed where weapons were used. However the fact remains in the present case that the victim had absolutely no chance of escape and he had done absolutely nothing to warrant the savage beating meted out to him by this offender…Objectively this is an example of extremely serious offending conduct.”


	
	I am unable to agree that his Honour fell into error in the way for which the applicant contends. The kidnapping offence was a preliminary and essential step toward the commission of the infliction of grievous bodily harm. It is unambiguously clear from his Honour’s recitation of the facts and from his description of the seriousness of the offences that he is speaking about each separately and individually, even though naturally enough in sequence and as part of a continuous act of criminality. The applicant’s contentions are in my view to a great extent unrealistic when taken in the scheme of a consideration of his Honour’s sentencing remarks in particular or the way in which a sentencing judge ought to expose his or her reasoning about the seriousness of an offence or offences in general. There are cases in which sentencing tribunals fall foul of the requirements enunciated in Pearce. This is not one of them. Moreover, his Honour expressly contemplated the requirements of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and in my view gave practical effect to the purposes set out in that provision.
	
	
	This ground of appeal should be dismissed
	


Ground 2


	
	The sentences were accumulated by one year. His Honour specifically took account of what was said by Hoeben CJ at CL in Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 in these terms:
	


“[44] There is no rule that sentences for offences committed on the same day, or as part of the same criminal enterprise, should be served concurrently. A sentence should not be ""concurrent simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct"" (R v Jarrold (Howie J at [56]). The question to be asked is whether the criminality of the offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence (Cahyadi v R). If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative, otherwise there is a risk that the sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the offences can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality (Cahyadi v R at [27]).”


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour should have commenced both sentences upon the same date. I disagree. Not only do I consider that his Honour was correct to accumulate the sentences in the way that he did, he would arguably have fallen into error to have done otherwise.
	
	
	The two offences were committed on the same day. The first was the practical and operational foundation for the second. Even though the two offences could be described as all part of the one course of criminal activity, in my opinion the discrete planning and execution of the kidnapping offence, effected with the assistance of others, whom the applicant recruited and instructed, in a scheme to track down the victim and take him to a secure location to be beaten out of sight of rescuers, is demonstration enough of the independent nature of this offence. It was deserving of punishment all by itself, which the applicant’s contention, if accepted, would have wholly avoided.
	
	
	The touchstone of the criminality in the kidnapping offence is the unlawful deprivation of liberty. It was specially aggravated by reason of the fact that it was committed in company. Bodily harm was also caused to the victim. In contrast, there is no independent element of detention in the second offence. It consisted of the vicious, intentional and prolonged infliction of grievous bodily harm. It was a serious and wholly separate offence.
	
	
	No aspect of the manner in which his Honour structured the sentences reveals error. This is not a case where the objective criminality of one offence comprises all those facts that go to make up the other offence. The sentence for neither offence in this case can be said to comprehend or reflect the criminality of the other: see, for example, R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52].
	
	
	This ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 3


	
	The Crown acknowledged in this Court that his Honour’s sentences were capable of being described as harsh, stern or heavy. That concession is uncontroversial. Correspondingly, the applicant’s offences are capable of being described as vicious, sustained and brutal. His Honour so described them. The victim was punched and kicked during a beating that seemed to him to last “forever”. At one stage the applicant picked up the victim by the throat, thereby restricting his breathing, and held him in the air. When the victim thought that he was going to choke, he was dropped so that he fell to his hands and knees, and the kicking resumed. This continued even notwithstanding that the victim was apparently completely at the applicant’s mercy. In that condition his ear was bitten off.
	
	
	The burden of the applicant’s submissions with respect to this ground is that the sentences are in effect statistically anomalous having regard to figures published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. That submission was developed by emphasising that the grievous bodily harm, which is the subject of the second offence, was, or at least should be, limited to the loss of the victim’s ear and perhaps also the victim’s fractured nose. The other injuries sustained by the victim could not have been sufficient to qualify as grievous bodily harm. He contended in the circumstances that the ear and nose injuries were not at the most serious end of the spectrum, even taking into account the permanent disfigurement resulting from the ear injury. He contended that, after allowing for a discount of around 10 percent for the plea of guilty, a starting point of somewhere around 10 years must have been selected, and that such a sentence was disproportionate to the seriousness of the relevantly inflicted injuries.
	
	
	In order to succeed under this ground the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. It is not enough to show that the sentencing judge could have taken a different course or that the appellate judges would have done so: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.
	
	
	The relevant question on appeal is whether the sentence is within a proper range. It is not a question of whether other sentences can be said to be more or less lenient by undertaking a detailed analysis of other cases, as there is often a wide range of differences in objective and subjective circumstances to which a sentencing judge may have attached particular weight: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368.
	
	
	Appellate intervention on a ground that a sentence is “manifestly excessive” is not justified simply because the result arrived at is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle even though it is not apparent from the sentencing judge’s statement of reasons, or where the sentence imposed is so far outside the range available that there must have been error: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [59] citing Dinsdale v the Queen (2000) 175 ALR 315. In Hili at 303, the High Court said:
	


“A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that the range is the correct range, nor that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits.”


	
	In this case it is not correct to isolate the physical injuries that constitute the grievous bodily harm as if to suggest that no other acts committed by the applicant have relevance if they were not shown to be directly causative of those injuries. The element of intent that is central to this offence can be seen to subsist in the sheer length and ferocity of the beating out of which the injuries have sprung. The evidence does not reveal that the victim’s nose was fractured because of a kick or a punch, or indeed some other aspect of the prolonged physical attack, but that does not mean that these actions are not central to a proper assessment of the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	In my opinion, the sentence imposed was entirely warranted on the agreed facts. His Honour did not fail in some way to apply proper principle. The sentences are not to my mind unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	I would also dismiss this ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.

		11 March 2015",2015-03-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766055,SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA:    The applicant seeks to challenge the sentence imposed in the District Court on a plea of guilty, with respect to a single offence of robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The sole ground of challenge is that the assistance he gave to authorities warranted a greater discount from his sentence than the 25% allowed by the sentencing judge (Maiden DCJ).
	
	
	In the course of oral submissions on sentence, the judge canvassed with both counsel the possibility that a greater discount could be available, although, when combined with a discount of 25% for an early plea, it would result in an overall reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate by a total of 50%. Neither counsel suggested that any additional discount would properly be available in the present case. Unless those submissions revealed manifest error, resulting in a miscarriage of the sentencing process, these circumstances do not warrant a grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	The miscarriage was said to arise because both counsel expressed the view that the authorities did not support a total discount in excess of 50%. That proposition, it was contended, was wrong. Pursuant to s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a specific limitation is placed on the extent of the discount, but it is expressed in broad evaluative terms, namely that the resultant lesser penalty ""must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence."" While it will often be the case that a reduction from the otherwise appropriate sentence of more than half may be considered ""unreasonably disproportionate"", there is, nevertheless, a discretionary judgment to be made by the sentencing judge in the circumstances of each particular case, ""the nature and circumstances of the offence"" not being the sole criterion. Further, the authorities do not impose an arbitrary limit of 50% for the combined discount, as they could not properly do given the statutory regime. Indeed, as Davies J indicates, there are authorities which expressly envisage that a greater discount might be available, at least in unusual circumstances.
	
	
	It is not in doubt that the kinds of factors which may increase the discount in a particular case will involve an assessment of the value of the assistance to law enforcement authorities, the degree to which it demonstrates genuine contrition on the part of the offender, the effect on the offender's circumstances of imprisonment and the risks which may accrue to the offender and to his or her family as a result of giving such assistance, as well as other matters. The level of discount in each case will depend upon an evaluative consideration of such matters.
	
	
	While it is possible that both counsel thought there was some arbitrary limit, the alternative reading of the submissions, which is plausible in the circumstances of the case, as outlined by Davies J, is that they did not think a discount in excess of 25% for assistance was reasonably available on the evidence. If that is the correct understanding of the submissions, there can have been no miscarriage of justice in the judge acting upon those submissions.
	
	
	There are two specific factors which suggest that that understanding is the one to be preferred. First, the kinds of cases in which a discount in excess of 25% is allowed tend to be ones involving organised criminal activities, where the risk of harm to the offender or his or her family is quite significant. Although giving evidence for the prosecution undoubtedly carried risks for the applicant, there was no evidential basis on which to conclude that there were greater than usual risks. Secondly, in considering the possibility of a higher discount, the trial judge appeared to focus primarily upon the value of the assistance to the prosecution. While that was undoubtedly an important consideration, it was not necessarily one which, taken in isolation, justified an unusually high discount.
	
	
	Because there was a legitimate argument in favour of the view that there had been a miscarriage in the present case, I would grant of leave to appeal. Nevertheless, the appeal must be dismissed.
	
	
	There is one further point which deserves more attention than appears to have been given either at the sentencing hearing or in some of the cases discussing the proper interpretation of s 23(3). In considering whether a sentence might be ""unreasonably disproportionate"" to the nature and circumstances of the specific offence, there is generally a focus on the total reduction from what might otherwise be seen to be the appropriate sentence. Thus, in the present case, the discussion focused upon whether it was possible to exceed a discount of 50%. In my view, that approach is incorrect. The disproportion is to be assessed by undertaking a comparison between the proposed penalty as reduced for assistance to the authorities and the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed. For example, in a case where a person has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and thus attracted a discount of 25% on that account, and a further 25% for assistance to authorities, the reduction to be assessed for proportionality is not the reduction from (say) a 10 year term to 5 years, but the reduction from 7.5 years (after reduction for a guilty plea) to 5 years. That follows from the language of the section itself: subs (1) refers to the court imposing ""a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose … having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities"", while subs (3) refers to the ""lesser penalty that is imposed under this section"".
	
	
	A similar exercise is required under s 22 with respect to a lesser penalty imposed on account of a plea of guilty. The statutory language makes clear that in each case these are separate exercises. The available discounts are conferred pursuant to statutory recognition of the separate public interests involved. That is not to say that a sentencing judge should not properly have regard to the overall effect of two elements by way of reduction of sentence, if only because there may be common elements in respect of each reduction which might require some adjustment to avoid double-counting.
	
	
	This is not an entirely novel point. In R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; 219 A Crim R 415 I said, with respect to the operation of s 23(3), that ""for the Court to state the penalty which it would 'otherwise have imposed' no doubt refers to the appropriate penalty disregarding only the assistance to authorities."" That proposition was adopted in Horne v R [2014] NSWCCA 133.
	
	
	In what appears to be the most recent discussion of s 23 in this Court, namely Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323, McCallum J addressed each discount separately, noted that the sentencing judge ""was not constrained by the fact that the applicant had not pleaded guilty to stop at 25 per cent discount for assistance to authorities"" and concluded:
	


""The only constraint was that imposed by s 23(3) which, as has been observed by this Court, will not generally be met by allowing a combined discount of more than 50 per cent.""


	
	As this reasoning suggests, the sentencing court will be mindful of the combined effect of the two discounts; nevertheless, even where a discount is required for a plea, the terms of s 23(3) should be separately applied with respect to the discount for assistance, as they are when there is no separate discount for a plea.
	
	
	There is another sense in which disproportion may not be properly reflected in the actual ""proportion"" by which a sentence is reduced. The reduction could be measured by reference to years, rather than a percentage. In terms of length of imprisonment, a percentage reduction will give a greater benefit, the more serious the offender's criminality. On the other hand, the person who plays the lesser role in the offending and may face a relatively shorter sentence than the co-offenders against whom the assistance is provided, may nevertheless be at equal or greater risk as a result of providing assistance to the authorities than an offender who committed more serious offences. Thus a 25% reduction of a four year sentence is one year; the same proportionate reduction of a 12 year sentence is three years. The mechanical exercise (applying a percentage reduction), may, in some cases, fail fully to serve the purpose of the reduction for assistance to authorities. (The percentage reduction is appropriate in the case of a guilty plea.)
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 13 March 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	He was committed for sentence to the District Court. On 29 May 2013 he was sentenced by Judge Maiden SC to a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing 8 November 2012 and expiring 7 May 2015 with an additional term of one year and six months expiring 7 November 2016.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on one ground only:
	


The Sentencing Judge erred in that he failed to allow a sufficient discount for past and future assistance to the authorities in accordance with s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Facts


	
	The facts may be shortly stated.
	
	
	In about early August 2012 one of the co-offenders, Damien Hudson, approached the Applicant with regard to obtaining a large amount of money. The plan was to rob the Stockton Bowling Club where the Applicant had been employed as a barman/general hand for about a year.
	
	
	The Applicant provided detailed information to Hudson about the premises including which entry door was not covered by CCTV and where to go when they gained access to the Club. The Applicant was made aware that a gun would be used in the robbery. The robbery was planned for 26 August 2012 after the conclusion of an annual event known as the “Blubbers Ball”. By reason of that event, 26 August was the busiest trading day of the year for the Club. The Sentencing Judge found that this information was also provided by the Applicant to the co-offenders.
	
	
	On the afternoon of the robbery the Applicant met Hudson and the other co-offender Peter Laupama. Hudson gave money to the Applicant to buy a pre-paid phone. He was told to use that phone to signal to Hudson and Laupama when to enter the Club.
	
	
	The Applicant commenced his shift on that day at 4.00pm. Towards the end of the shift only the Applicant and one other staff member, Sue Stirrat, remained on the premises. The patrons had left after trading ceased at 10.00pm. The Club was secured and the Applicant then rang the co-offenders.
	
	
	The Applicant had almost finished emptying the cash from the poker machines. Ms Stirrat was in the office placing the money in the safe. At that point Laupama and Hudson came in through the door which had been identified by the Applicant. They were carrying shotguns and wearing balaclavas and gloves. They ran through the poker machines area. The Applicant pointed his finger to the strong room where Ms Stirrat was working. She was confronted by the two men arriving with their shotguns pointed at her.
	
	
	Hudson and Laupama removed the money from the open safe and then removed the remaining moneys that had been emptied from the poker machines by the Applicant. In total, $34,520 was taken. The police were called soon after Hudson and Laupama left.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards police were alerted to a vehicle on fire in Cox Lane, Fullerton Cove. They found a white Holden Commodore Sedan destroyed by flames. Located about three metres from the vehicle was a shortened double barrel shotgun. Investigators were able to identify DNA on the trigger as having the same profile as Laupama.
	
	
	About three or four days later the Applicant went to Hudson’s residence where he was paid $4000 for his participation in the robbery.
	
	
	Investigators became suspicious that the Applicant had been involved. On 8 November 2012 police attended the Applicant’s home and put their suspicions to him. The Applicant admitted that he had set the robbery up. After being arrested he participated in an ERISP where he made full admissions. A few weeks later he identified Hudson and Laupama from photo arrays. He subsequently undertook to give evidence against the co-offenders. Laupama pleaded guilty. The Applicant gave evidence at Hudson’s trial.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant was born on 28 November 1972 and was aged almost 40 years at the date of the robbery on 26 August 2012. Judge Maiden found that the Applicant had an unfortunate childhood in that he had a stepfather who was an alcoholic and subjected the Applicant to abuse. The Applicant manifested destructive behaviours while in school and, although completing Year 10, had never had permanent employment. He abandoned an apprenticeship in boiler making.
	
	
	He had a longstanding history of both alcohol and drug abuse. His criminal record commenced in 1991 and consists of some relatively minor drug offences, minor property offences, a number of offences involving driving whilst suspended or disqualified, and one conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	His drug use involved using methamphetamines costing about $300 a time. He incurred considerable debts including to his landlord. It seems that his drug use and indebtedness was responsible for his becoming involved in the present offence.
	
	
	He had been in one longstanding relationship from about 1995 to 2009 from which two children were born. The relationship was marred by his drug use and that ultimately brought it to en end.
	


Findings by the Sentencing Judge


	
	Judge Maiden found that there was planning involved in the offence and that the overall offending was to be viewed as serious and of much more gravity than in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.
	
	
	His Honour found that the Applicant was remorseful. He provided the Applicant a discount of 25% for his plea and a discount of 25% for his assistance to authorities. His Honour did not indicate how much of that discount was for the past and how much for the future.
	
	
	Little material was available about the detail of the assistance provided by the Applicant. His Honour noted simply that the Applicant provided advice and willingness to give evidence against his co-accused. One aspect of the information provided was an identification of one of the culprits. His Honour noted that the Applicant had been in protection because of his fear of retribution by persons related to the co-offenders.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge adopted a starting point of eight years which he then reduced by 50% for the two discounts mentioned.
	
	
	In relation to the extent of the assistance, it appears that the co-accused Hudson was only implicated by the information provided by the Applicant to the police. Although Laupama’s DNA was found on the trigger of the shotgun found near the burnt-out car, when interviewed by the police the Applicant identified both co-accused from photo board identity line ups.
	


The Applicant’s submissions


	
	The Applicant accepts that the discount to be given for assistance is within the area of the exercise of judicial discretion. He contended, however, that an error of the House v The King type was made by the Sentencing Judge who was led into error as a result of both counsel who appeared before him. That error was said to be the failure of the Sentencing Judge to have regard to authorities in this Court suggesting that a combined discount of more than 50% could be given for plea and assistance. Counsel failed to mention any such authorities. Those authorities were said to include FS v R [2009] NSWCCA 301; (2009) 198 A Crim R 383 and SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249.
	
	
	The Applicant also drew attention to exchanges between the Sentencing Judge and counsel during the sentencing hearing as follows:
	


HIS HONOUR: Well, 25 per cent for the plea.

OUTRAM: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Twenty-five per cent for giving evidence against these two?

OUTRAM: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Not higher?

OUTRAM: Perhaps if I could say this, your Honour: In relation to Mr Hudson, the only direct evidence against him is [SL]. There is some evidence, as your Honour would have seen, in relation to the motor vehicle. That would be corroborative of what [SL] says in respect of Mr Hudson on the motor vehicle.

In respect of Mr Laupama, the Crown's case is somewhat stronger in that at the scene of the burning car the firearm was found. On the trigger of that firearm --

HIS HONOUR: Was DNA,.

OUTRAM: DNA consistent with that of Mr Laupama, which itself is highly corroborative of what [SL] says. At this stage –

…

HIS HONOUR: Can I say this to you? Where I thought he would get benefit is in the discount for giving evidence. This isn't a matter where there's strong cases against the other two and obviously, in respect of the first named co-offender, this evidence might be seen to be critical. So, can I give him more than 25 per cent as a discount there for that assistance which has put him into protection?

FITZGERALD: If your Honour is to allow 25 per cent on his plea, I could not maintain more than a submission of 25 per cent on the assistance.

HIS HONOUR: Can't get him up to 60 in total?

FITZGERALD: Your Honour, the indication cases say to me that the most that your Honour could allow us on the total discount would be 50 per cent, no matter how it's equated.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I keep reading those cases and I must say that in this case this is where the utilitarian value of assistance is at the highest level and that other ones where most likely people plead and they're always going to do so and it's the threat of it and the consequences are less and I can't see how they both can be 25 per cent.

…

HIS HONOUR: … Mr Crown, in terms of the percentages for discounts, can I get it up to 60 per cent?

OUTRAM: No, I say ""No"", your Honour. I agree with my friend, 50 per cent. One aspect that my friend didn't address your Honour, on special circumstances. Your Honour will find special circumstances. (emphasis added)

Consideration


	
	In R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151 Latham J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) said:
	


[50]   I can discern no error in the approach taken by his Honour in the quantification of the discount appropriate to the respondent’s plea of guilty. I accept, as the Crown has submitted, that the degree of contrition inherent in the respondent’s plea of guilty was minimal, given the overwhelming nature of the Crown case. Indeed, the respondent’s false account to third persons of his role in the commission of the offence militated against the recognition of any significant contrition. Be that as it may, the plea of guilty was indicative of a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, insofar as any trial of the offence would have been complex and lengthy. The gravamen of the Crown's complaint on this appeal resides in the quantification of a composite discount of 45 percent in order to take account of the respondent’s plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities.

…

[54]   While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender.

…

[56]   Bearing these considerations firmly in mind, I regard a discount of 45 percent as excessive in the circumstances of this case. The respondent’s assistance could not, in my view, be characterised as assistance of a very high order. Whilst the respondent's evidence in the prosecution of Jeff and Eric contributed to the case against them, it was but part of the material upon which their convictions were based. As I have already noted, there was little in the way of contrition (expressions of remorse to the psychologist and to the Probation and Parole officer were of dubious value), and no evidence of any personal risk to the respondent or to any member of his family. There was no evidence of any hardship occasioned to the respondent, arising directly out of the provision of assistance to the authorities in the Netherlands. His Honour was being unduly generous to the respondent in assuming that such a risk necessarily resulted from the respondent's assistance. His Honour's approach to this issue on 15 July 2005 was, in my opinion, the correct one. I consider that a composite discount of 35 percent would have been appropriate to the recognition of both the respondent's plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, such as it was.


	
	Those passages were quoted with approval by Buddin J in SZ v R . Buddin J then went on to say:
	


[52]   I acknowledge, as did Latham J in Sukkar (supra), that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for. There may well be a case in which the assistance proffered is of a quite extraordinary kind. Alternatively there may be a case in which the offender is entitled to an additional discount, in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, on account of having disclosed information which was otherwise unknown to the authorities. Indeed, composite discounts in excess of 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this Court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender. See, for example, R v NP [[2003] NSWCCA 195]; R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 and R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151.

[53]   However, in light of the authorities to which I have referred and particularly given the statutory mandate contained in s 23(3) of the Act, it is my opinion that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case. Counsel for the applicant went so far as to suggest that a combined discount of 75%, comprising a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty to which would be added a further 50% for assistance to authorities, may be available in an appropriate case. In view of the matters to which I have referred, I regard such a submission as being simply untenable. Apart from any other consideration, the aggregation of discrete discounts is at odds with the observations of Gleeson CJ in Gallagher [(1991) 23 NSWLR 220] which are recited in the extract from El Hani [[2004] NSWCCA 162] which appears at par 31 of this judgment. See also R v NP (supra) at pars 30 and 47.


	
	In FS v R Rothman J said:
	


[22]   Moreover, there is no “standard deduction”. There is a percentage deduction to obtain a result, below which sentencing judges should not reduce a sentence, unless there are exceptional, or very exceptional, circumstances, because, inter alia, a “discount” of such magnitude would usually take the sentence to a level lower than could properly reflect the objective circumstances of the offence.


	
	In OS1 v R [2012] NSWCCA 102 I noted (Allsop P and Schmidt J agreeing) that 50% combined discounts were not uncommon for early plea and assistance: Satorre v R [2006] NSWCCA 298; R v Mangano [2006] NSWCCA 35; (2006) 160 A Crim R 480; R v Lo [2007] NSWSC 105; (2007) 178 A Crim R 451; R v KR & PR [2008] NSWSC 970; R v AB [2006] NSWSC 69; and R v Hogden [2012] NSWSC 24.
	
	
	In OS1, as in R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195, a combined discount of 60% was given but in both cases it was because the Applicant in each case was to give evidence against a number of members of a criminal organisation. Such an undertaking can well be regarded as exceptional. That type of assistance can put not only the offender at risk but his or her family also.
	
	
	It is not exceptional for an applicant simply to provide information on the identity of a co-accused or even to give evidence against the co-accused. That sort of assistance often results in the offender requiring protective custody, but such hardship is inherent in the offer and the discount that results.
	
	
	Although the Sentencing Judge referred in passing during submissions to the utilitarian value of the Applicant’s assistance being of the highest level, that remark was not repeated in his Remarks on Sentence. In any event, the Applicant’s assistance in the present case must be seen in the light of other decisions so that appropriate comparisons can be made. Judged by the factual circumstances of the present offending it is doubtful if the Applicant could have offered more assistance than he gave and undertook to give. However, that does not make the assistance exceptional.
	
	
	There is the further matter of the concession made by the Applicant’s counsel at the sentencing hearing that he could not maintain a submission or more than 25% discount for assistance if 25% was allowed for the plea. Two things flow from this. First, it tends to show that no error was made by the Sentencing Judge on the material and submission put forward. Secondly, there are no exceptional circumstances or compelling material that demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the discount given: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [81]. Had the Sentencing Judge been directed to the cases referred to above it would have been apparent to him that the assistance in the present case did not rise as high as would be required to provide a discount above 50%.
	
	
	Finally, regard must be had to s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That sub-section provides:
	


A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.


	
	In the present case, if the sentence had been discounted by either 55% or 60%, the final sentence, particularly if the ratio of 62.5% had been maintained between the non-parole period and the total term, would have been unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. Leniency was extended by the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	No error has been demonstrated in the discount provided by the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2766072,R v Moore (No.2) [2015] NSWSC 214,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 28 October 2012, James Kevin Moore killed Dennis Burns in Collingwood Street, Coffs Harbour in the State of NSW.
	
	
	He did so by striking a blow with a wooden mattock handle directly to the head of Mr Burns. The blow caused a 70mm longitudinal laceration to the scalp of Mr Burns, underlying fractures to the left vertex and right fronto-temporal areas of the skull, which caused an extensive acute subdural haematoma. This haematoma caused major damage to his brain and principal organs. Mr Burns died on 30 October 2012, when his life support system was turned off.
	
	
	Mr Moore left the scene of the assault and was not arrested until the evening of 1 November 2012. He has been in custody ever since. He was charged with murder.
	
	
	On 14 November 2013, Mr Moore was committed by the Local Court at Coffs Harbour to the Supreme Court for trial on a charge of murder. On 7 March 2014, when first arraigned in the Supreme Court, Mr Moore pleaded not guilty. On 19 November 2014, when arraigned in front of the jury, Mr Moore pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, and the trial proceeded.
	
	
	On 28 November 2014, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder. A conviction for the offence was entered by the Court on that day.
	
	
	It is now time for Mr Moore to be sentenced for his crime.
	
	
	The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of life imprisonment for the offence of murder. A standard non-parole period of 20 years is fixed by the legislation. The maximum term and the standard non-parole period stand as guideposts for the purpose of the determination of an appropriate sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
	


Judicial Task on Sentencing


	
	In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing. That is, how a judge, in each individual case, must go about the task of fixing a sentence which accords with the legislation, the principles of the common law and one which is appropriate in the particular factual circumstances of this case.
	
	
	In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Moore by applying well-identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2]:
	
	
	The principles of law are well established and can be conveniently summarised in the following way:
	


“1.   Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge, and not with the jury…;

2.   Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings …;

3.   The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making … is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. This may produce the result that, in a particular case, the view of the facts which the judge is obliged to take is different from the view which the judge would have taken if unconstrained by the verdict …;

4.   A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt …;

5.   There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender…. However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender …”.

R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1.


	
	It is no part of the sentencing function for me to attempt to discern the basis upon which the jury reached their verdict. But rather, in sentencing Mr Moore, I am obliged to do so, upon findings of fact which I alone make, but with the constraint that those facts must be consistent with the jury’s verdict.
	
	
	Sentencing is not an exercise of mathematical precision leading to a single correct answer. Rather, having determined the appropriate facts which relate to the offence, the proper approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing in this case, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock at [28].
	
	
	I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
	


The Facts


	
	In order to make findings of fact which are consistent with the jury’s verdict, those findings will reflect my view that Mr Moore is guilty of murder, that he was not provoked into committing the offence, and that when he delivered the blow to the deceased which caused his death, he was not acting in self-defence.
	
	
	I find the facts of the matter, which are consistent with the verdict of the jury to be as follows.
	
	
	Mr Moore, the offender, was born in September 1988, and so was just 24 years old at the time he killed Dennis Burns. Dennis Burns, the deceased, was an older man who was aged 47 when he died.
	
	
	Mr Moore and Mr Burns had known each other for some time in the context that they shared an interest in the consumption of cannabis and, seemingly, Mr Moore supplied cannabis to Mr Burns.
	
	
	Mr Burns squatted in an abandoned house at 47 Collingwood Street, Coffs Harbour. By October 2012, he had been there for about four months. He lived there by himself. It was apparent that Mr Burns had established a modestly comfortable life there.
	
	
	On the morning of 28 October 2012, Mr Moore visited Mr Burns at his house. The visit lasted approximately 15 minutes and Mr Moore left, seemingly on good terms with the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Moore intended to undertake a trip to a town north of Coffs Harbour to purchase cannabis. Ordinarily, he would include as a component of that purchase, an amount of cannabis for Mr Burns. Prior to the visit on this day, Mr Burns had expressed concern to Mr Moore about both the quality and weight of the drugs being supplied. At about 10.30am, prior to leaving to visit his drug supplier, Mr Moore sent a text to a number of people indicating that he was increasing the price of the cannabis which he was purchasing, and which was to be supplied to them, by an amount of about $20 per ounce. In so doing, he said to at least one of his clients, that he needed the money “to get my boy’s dick cut within three days of birth”.
	
	
	The increase in price of the drugs was relayed to the deceased, Mr Burns, by a mutual friend of Mr Moore and the deceased. It is apparent that Mr Burns was not pleased by the price increase. The deceased told a visitor to the house in which he was squatting, that he would be happy to pay an extra $20 for fuel to enable Mr Moore to go to the town north of Coffs Harbour, but he was not prepared to pay $20 extra per ounce as part of the purchase price.
	
	
	Commencing at about 11.30am, the deceased started drinking Vodka Cruisers. As well, he commenced smoking an apparently legal herb mixture called “Puff”. It was known amongst the deceased’s friends that he tended to become aggressive when he drank. As one witness expressed it, the deceased would get “revved up” when he drank alcohol. Smoking cannabis did not make the deceased aggressive.
	
	
	Having visited his drug supplier at about 12.30pm, Mr Moore let it be known that the drugs he had obtained were of very good quality, and of entirely sufficient weight. This message made its way back to the deceased, who took umbrage at the content of the message, and Mr Moore’s failure to purchase drugs on his behalf – apparently at the standard, or original price, without the $20 increase proposed by Mr Moore.
	
	
	Over the next few hours, there was considerable communication by both telephone and text message between the offender, Mr Moore, and Mr Burns. It is clear that over time the communication between them deteriorated until it became aggressive and offensive. At about 2.20pm in the course of a telephone call from the deceased to the offender, the deceased threatened to sexually assault Mr Moore’s partner, who was at that time pregnant with their baby. Their baby was due a short time later.
	
	
	In response to that threat, Mr Moore sent the deceased a text message reprimanding him with respect to the threat, and told him that he had taken it “too far”.
	
	
	At about that time, the offender involved his mother, Ms Michelle Moore. He rang and reported to her the effect of his communication with the deceased. A few minutes later, she arrived at his house with her partner, Mr Brendan Price. Ms Moore was apparently very aggressive and said that she wished to “go and sort this bastard out”.
	
	
	After that point in time, the dispute further deteriorated involving, as it did, the offender’s mother, Ms Moore, and her partner, Mr Price.
	
	
	By about 3.00pm, in the context of ongoing deterioration in the communication, the offender sent a direct warning to the deceased that, if the deceased made a further bad telephone call, or sent a bad text message, to him or to his mother, that would be “sufficient”. He said “this is your warning … pull up”.
	
	
	By about 3.30pm it is clear that the deceased had issued a challenge to the offender by text message, telling him that he was waiting for him to come and visit. At about that time, in response, the offender gave what he described as a final warning to the deceased, and admonished him not to take the offender and his mother for a joke. The deceased continued to send the offender messages pointing out that he was waiting for the offender to arrive.
	
	
	When Ms Moore arrived at the offender’s house, she said to him that they should go down to the deceased’s house and sort him out. The offender warned Ms Moore that the deceased was a “knife man” and known to have knives. Ms Moore was apparently not deterred. Ms Moore by that stage had imbibed alcohol and was observed to be a bit intoxicated. She had arrived at the offender’s house carrying a small hobby hammer and a roll of thick cardboard which fitted, rather like an armguard, over her arm to protect it. When she was told that the deceased was known as a knife man, she went to the downstairs area of the offender’s house, accompanied by him, to see what weapons they could take. The offender, at the urging of his mother, removed the iron head from a mattock handle and took that handle with him. It was about 900mm long.
	
	
	The offender, Ms Moore and Mr Price set off in a motor vehicle to the deceased’s premises. When they arrived at the premises, the offender got out of the car and waited outside the premises. He telephoned the deceased and informed him that he was outside. The deceased came out of his premises and there followed a verbal and physical altercation involving in varying ways, each of the deceased, the offender, Ms Moore and Mr Price. It is clear that each of the participants in this verbal and physical altercation were armed with one sort of weapon or another. The offender had the mattock handle, Ms Moore had the small hobby hammer, Mr Price had a fishing rod, and the deceased had two black handled kitchen knives.
	
	
	The initial confrontation was between the deceased and Ms Moore. Verbal insults were exchanged. Ms Moore was clearly being aggressive, as was the deceased. There was some physical shoving between them. The deceased then produced his knives and held them out towards Ms Moore. She backed away. At that stage the offender and Mr Price were standing to either side of the deceased and slightly away from the fray. The offender then moved in, swinging the mattock handle at the deceased.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the sequence of events which followed involved the following steps:
	



	
	first, there were two blows by the offender to the deceased. One of them to the deceased’s right hand in which there was a knife. This blow caused a laceration to the right hand and a fracture of the second metacarpal bone. I am satisfied that the knife fell out of, or was hit out of, the deceased’s hand at that point;
	
	
	Ms Moore moved in with the hammer, causing the deceased to retreat a short distance back along the driveway from Edgar Street. As this was happening, she struck the deceased on his forehead causing a small laceration. The deceased bled profusely from that scalp laceration. The hammer was knocked out of Ms Moore’s hand and she retreated;
	
	
	the deceased advanced holding the second knife. He was waving it at both the offender and Mr Price, and at one stage threatened to throw it at Ms Moore. By that stage the group had moved towards Edgar Street away from the site of the initial assault;
	
	
	at that stage the offender advanced upon the deceased and swung the mattock handle towards his head. The deceased raised his left arm in a defensive motion. The mattock handle struck the deceased’s left arm, causing a fracture of the ulna. The force used was significant. It caused the deceased to fall to the ground. In the process, the knife which the deceased was carrying was dislodged and ended up about two metres away from the deceased, on the ground;
	
	
	by that stage the deceased was prone on the ground and disarmed. Thereafter the offender mounted a brutal assault on the deceased which consisted of blows across his chest to the front which fractured a number of ribs, a blow across his shoulder blade at the rear, and then finally a blow to the deceased’s head which caused the injuries I have described above.
	



	
	During the course of the assaults, the offender was heard to say on three occasions to the deceased, the first two at around the time the melee started, and the last occasion as he was leaving, “I’ll kill you”. This phrase was accompanied by a number of expletives.
	
	
	Although he threatened the deceased with these words, I am not satisfied that he meant them to be taken literally. I am abundantly satisfied that the accused perpetrated the assault intending to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. The expert evidence satisfies me that the blows were delivered, particularly to the head, with significant and severe force. The bony fractures suffered by the deceased are testament to that. It was a vicious, brutal and unremitting assault.
	
	
	Bystanders came to aid of the deceased. He was clearly badly injured. An ambulance was called and he was transported to Coffs Harbour Hospital. From there he was moved to the John Hunter Hospital at Newcastle and placed on life support. He died two days later when his life support system was switched off.
	


Police Investigation


	
	After the physical confrontation, the police secured the crime scene and undertook forensic examinations. The offender, having left the scene, disposed of the mattock handle by putting it alongside a fence on a nearby property, went home, showered and changed his clothes. The three participants returned to the offender’s house where it was apparent to the offender’s partner, that he was very quiet and appeared worried.
	
	
	On 30 October 2012, police executed a search warrant at the offender’s house. He was not home at the time.
	
	
	On 1 November 2012, apparently in a state of depression over what had occurred, the offender went to a headland location where he was discovered by a friend a short time later, squatting down about two metres from the edge of the cliff. He was hysterical and crying uncontrollably. He told his friend he just wanted to die.
	
	
	The offender was taken to the Coffs Harbour Hospital. The police were notified and attended at the Coffs Harbour Hospital and placed the offender under arrest.
	
	
	Later that evening the offender participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he gave a version of the events.
	


Specific Statutory Considerations


	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, identifies a number of matters which the Parliament has provided as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. As well, there are matters that mitigate any sentence to which regard must also be had. It is appropriate to commence with the aggravating factors which I regard as relevant and applicable in these circumstances.
	
	
	In having regard to the aggravating factors, where such a factor may be regarded as being an integral part of the offence, it is not to be considered separately.
	
	
	It is an aggravating factor if the offender has a record of previous convictions, which is the case here: s 21A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Mr Moore, despite his youth, has a lengthy criminal history which started at about 14½ years of age. Between April 2003 and September 2006, when he reached adulthood, Mr Moore was dealt with for 28 separate offences, which mostly involved common assaults, damage to or destruction of property, breaking and entering, and finally culminating in an aggravated robbery conviction.
	
	
	Since becoming an adult, Mr Moore has achieved a record of convictions for various drug offences, property offences, driving offences (including offences of driving whilst disqualified and in a manner dangerous to the public). For these last two offences, he served a term of imprisonment of 15 months concluding in May 2011. He was again before the Court in 2012 for a charge of driving whilst disqualified for which he was initially sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On appeal, he was placed on a bond.
	
	
	In addition to these offences, in December 2007, Mr Moore was found guilty of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he also served a term of imprisonment. This is a conviction for a serious personal violence offence and, accordingly, is particularly relevant here as this offence involves him being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence. I note that the conviction was nearly 5 years before this offence.
	
	
	Whilst I take these previous convictions into account as an aggravating factor in the determination of the appropriate sentence for this offence, I am not punishing Mr Moore again for the criminality involved in these earlier offences which I have discussed: Veen v R (No.2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, but they do point to the need to give weight to personal deterrence and the protection of society.
	
	
	The offence was committed in the company of Ms Moore and Mr Price. That is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The offence was part of a planned criminal activity. I am satisfied that before they set out from his home, the offender agreed with his mother and her partner that they would go and “sort the deceased out” and in so doing, probably to inflict physical injury upon him. That, I am satisfied, was their intention at all times. I am not satisfied that there was any sophisticated plan to kill the deceased. To the extent described, the killing occurred in the course of a planned criminal activity. That is an aggravating factor to which I will have regard: s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	It is an aggravating factor if the offence involved the use of violence or of a weapon: s 21A(2)(b) and (c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, having regard to the nature of the offence, I do not think it appropriate to give any weight to these aggravating factors over and above that which would ordinarily be applied to an offence of this kind.
	
	
	Of particular importance, is that at the time of the offence, Mr Moore was the subject of a bond which had been imposed by the District Court on 25 July 2012. On that date he was before the District Court on an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified. The conviction for that offence was confirmed, but in lieu of the term of imprisonment which was originally imposed, Mr Moore was ordered to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years commencing in July 2012 and expiring in July 2014. It follows that within a few short months of entering into that bond, Mr Moore was disregarding it, by committing this offence. This is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I have earlier described the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence. It took place at the home of the deceased, Mr Burns, although he did not own or have legal permission to live there. Nevertheless, Mr Moore’s counsel conceded that the fact that the offence took place in the home of the deceased was an aggravating factor for the Court to take into account: s 21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The offence also took place within public view. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the public safety was endangered. I do not take this into account as an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Each of the aggravating factors described above will be taken into account.
	
	
	There are mitigating factors to which the Court is required to have regard. Principally, if the Court is persuaded that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, has good prospects of rehabilitation, and has shown remorse, then the sentence which would otherwise be imposed may be mitigated.
	
	
	It is appropriate to assess whether Mr Moore is unlikely to re-offend, and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g) and (h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These can be conveniently considered together in this case. If the offender is to rehabilitate himself, thereby reducing his prospect of re-offending, then he must address his existing drug dependency and the associated issues, which seem linked to this offence. If he can address such issues, then his youth, the fact that he has children for whom he will be responsible, and the deterrent effect of a lengthy jail term ought to all tell in his favour.
	
	
	The offender, according to his affidavit, has taken positive steps whilst in custody to turn his life around. It is to be hoped that he maintains this approach.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, he has some prospect of rehabilitation which must, because of his drug dependency, be regarded as guarded. Similarly, I would regard his likelihood of re-offending to be something about which it is too early to form any conclusion. Such likelihood will depend entirely on his course whilst in custody.
	
	
	If an offender shows remorse by demonstrating that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledging the injury and loss caused by him, the Court may have regard to this as a mitigating factor in the sentence imposed: s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	To an extent in his electronically recorded interview, the offender displayed remorse. In his affidavit, he has clearly, and in my view, persuasively, shown his remorse. I accept that every day he wishes to turn back time, that he is truly and deeply sorry for everyone affected by his actions. I am satisfied that he is remorseful and that should be taken into account in mitigation of his sentence.
	
	
	If an offender provides assistance to law enforcement authorities, then that will be a mitigating factor to which the Court may have regard: s 21A(3)(m) the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown has acknowledged that the offender conducted his defence in a manner that facilitated the administration of justice, although it was submitted that this feature would have no weight. I do not accept that the assistance of the offender to the administration of justice should be given no weight. It will be taken into account, and weighed in the balance of all other matters.
	
	
	Each of these mitigating factors will be taken into account.
	


The Offender’s Criminality


	
	It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective criminality involved in the offender’s offence. This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to the offender, and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature and circumstances of the offence: Muldrock at [27].
	
	
	In my assessment, the criminality is serious. The offender has beaten the deceased to death. He has gone to the deceased’s house in the company of others intending to have a fight with him. He has armed himself for the purpose of that fight. In the course of the fight he has inflicted many, very serious, injuries on the deceased. The last of those injuries inflicted being a blow delivered with significant force to the head of the deceased whilst he was on the ground and unarmed, was a brutal and cruel action.
	
	
	I assess the seriousness of the offence as being slightly above the mid-range of seriousness of objective criminality.
	


Subjective Circumstances of the Offender


	
	The offender is now 26 years old. He was 24 when he killed the deceased. He is still a young man.
	
	
	The offender’s personal and family history can best be described as chaotic, dysfunctional and tragic.
	
	
	He did not know his natural father, Mr Norman Ward, until he was 14 years old. At that time, he discovered that his mother had lied to him, by telling him that his father was dead. Tragically, just as he started to develop a relationship with his natural father, Mr Ward died of a brain tumour, or perhaps a drug overdose.
	
	
	The offender has not had a stable family or home life. He has lived with a number of step-fathers, as his mother changed her relationships.
	
	
	Shortly after he turned 14, the offender was placed in foster care by the Department of Community Services. In that year, the Department received 28 reports about the offender which related to serious and personal conflict between him and his mother, Ms Michelle Moore. The offender’s initial placement into foster care happened because of conflict between him and his mother which resulted in her tying him up and sedating him.
	
	
	The offender’s life was chaotic for a number of reasons, as he moved between youth refuges, staying with friends, returning home to his mother and, perhaps, occasional homelessness. He became a drug user during this time and descended into a life in which criminal activity played a role.
	
	
	The offender’s education was limited. He attended High School until about halfway through Year 9. He did a number of TAFE courses after that.
	
	
	His drug dependence started at the age of 9. By the age of about 13 or 14, he was using cannabis heavily. He occasionally used Ice. I accept, as he said, “My life was driven by my cannabis use, and not much else”.
	
	
	At the time of this offence, he was in a relatively stable relationship which had subsisted for about 12 months. His partner had two children by a previous relationship, and she was pregnant with their first child. Clearly, the offender’s life had commenced to stabilise. He had ceased using Ice, and had reduced his cannabis use. He was in casual employment. Since going into custody this relationship has ceased. He has no ongoing contact with his newly born son, or his two stepdaughters.
	
	
	This dysfunctional upbringing, in which the offender has had no male role model, but has had early exposure to drugs, and a volatile and complex relationship with his mother, helps explain his current circumstances, his past criminal history and how he came to commit this crime. However, it does not excuse his crime.
	


An Appropriate Sentence


	
	In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Moore, I commence with the reminder that murder involves the criminal taking of a human life. It is a violation of the sanctity of human life which is a concept at the heart of a civilised community.
	
	
	Ordinarily, a conviction for murder warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment, and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct, are of significant importance. In Mr Moore’s case there is also a need, having regard to the fact that this conduct occurred whilst he was at conditional liberty, to ensure that any sentence which is imposed will act as a specific deterrent to him from engaging in unlawful conduct.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances as the law permits: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and as was submitted by counsel for Mr Moore. In my view, the usual period of parole will be adequate to assist Mr Moore to re-integrate into the community at the completion of his non-parole period.
	
	
	I have discussed all of the facts which are relevant to the decision including the relevant subjective circumstances of the offender, and it is now necessary to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	This was a serious offence involving the killing of a man over a minor dispute about drug supply. The victim was confronted by three armed people. All self-control was lost. Rational behaviour was set to one side. The victim was bashed about the head with a weapon and died from the blows inflicted by the offender.
	
	
	There is nothing which adequately justifies the conduct of the offender. That he was young, immature, and clearly influenced by the temper and malevolence of his mother may partly explain what happened. I am not satisfied that he was acting in self-defence.
	
	
	I have taken into account the facts as I have found, and all of the factors and matters to which attention has been paid in these remarks. I determine the appropriate overall sentence to be one of 24 years imprisonment. Of that sentence, I determine that Mr Moore must spend 18 years in jail before being eligible for parole.
	


Commencement Date


	
	The sentence should commence on the day that Mr Moore was arrested and taken into custody, namely 1 February 2012.
	


Offence of Serious Personal Violence


	
	I am required to warn Mr Moore, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is about to be formally sentenced. At some future point in time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody or else ought be the subject of an extended supervision order, impacting upon his liberty.
	


Sentence


	
	Mr Moore, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:
	



	
	A non-parole period of 18 years commencing on 1 November 2012 and concluding on 31 October 2030.
	
	
	A balance of term of 6 years commencing on 1 November 2030 and concluding on 31 October 2036.
	
	
	You will not be eligible to be released before the expiry of your non-parole period.

		22 May 2015",2015-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766073,R v AX [2015] NSWDC 75,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR:  AX, I sentence you in respect of count 1 to 18 months imprisonment and in respect of count 2, I propose to sentence you to one year nine months imprisonment. I propose to suspend the terms of imprisonment pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I indicate that if I partially accumulated the sentences I would have sentenced you to a total sentence of two years.
	
	
	The prisoner, AX, appears today for sentence in relation to two offences to which he pleaded guilty on arraignment before me in November of last year. Those two offences are, firstly, that he, between 9 July 1993 and 31 December 1994 at Greystanes in the State of New South Wales did assault AA and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon her, she then being a child under the age of ten years namely, seven or eight years. The victim is his daughter.
	
	
	The second count alleged that he, between 19 July 1993 and 31 December 1994, at Greystanes in the State of New South Wales, did assault AA and, at the time of that assault, did commit an act of indecency upon her she being a child under the age of ten years, namely seven or eight years.
	
	
	Both of these crimes are contrary to s 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment at the time of the offending. Since the introduction of standard non-parole periods, set out in Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, these crimes have now what appears to be an anomalous standard non-parole period of eight years, but which the legislature obviously has approved.
	
	
	The prisoner pleaded guilty to these counts on the indictment after he had been tried before me in relation to allegations of sexual assault committed against other members of his family, particularly siblings. He was acquitted of those charges.
	
	
	The matters with which I am concerned were to be treated as a separate proceeding which would have been tried separately, had he pleaded not guilty. The relevance of those other matters for which he was acquitted is, particularly in this matter, that the complainant reported these matters to police in October 2012. The offender was arrested and charged on 25 July 2013. As I would understand it, at the time of charging in relation to these matters, the prisoner had, in fact, already been charged in relation to the various allegations brought against him by his siblings.
	
	
	The significance of that matter is, in part, to be found in the fact not revealed in the statement of facts, but which was advised to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor when the matter was before me late last Friday afternoon, that the complainant had made allegations against the accused in August 1999 which were the subject of, as I understand it, a partial police investigation but which allegations were withdrawn in September 1999.
	
	
	The pleas of guilty to the counts on the indictment followed some negotiations which apparently had been ongoing during the course of the trials in respect of which the accused was acquitted. I accept that whilst the pleas of guilty were entered at a time when it was expected that the trial relating to this particular complainant would proceed, the Crown had anticipated, as had the accused, that the accused would plead guilty. Thus, it was not strictly the situation of pleas of guilty entered at the doorway of the court as the trial was about to commence.
	
	
	I have heard submissions from learned counsel for the prisoner and the Crown and, as I understand it, it is generally agreed, and I certainly agree with the proposition, that the accused is entitled to the benefit of a discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. The relevant discount in this matter can be assessed at 12 per cent upon the otherwise appropriate penalty, just slightly higher than the 10 per cent which is in legitimate sentencing discretion when sentencing an offender who pleads guilty on the day that the trial is expected to start. That assessment of the quantity of any particular discount comes from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thomson and Houlton of 1999.
	
	
	With regard to the facts and circumstances of the matter I note, as I have said earlier, that the victim in these matters is the prisoner's daughter. She was born on 19 July 1986. The generality of particulars as to her age and as to the date of the commission of the offences arises from a lack of particularity in the complainant's recollection of the specific occasion that particular events occurred, as I would understand the situation.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on xxxx. This means, obviously, that he would have turned 36 years of age in June 1993 .
	
	
	The victim was his younger child. The prisoner has an older child, a boy who was born in xxxx. At the time of the offending, the prisoner, the mother of the children who was the prisoner's wife and the children lived together in a residence at Greystanes. The family lived together at that address until 1998. They continued to live together as a family unit until a time in 1999 when the marriage between the prisoner and his wife completely broke down and the wife left the marriage. The children went with the mother and it would seem that the children have not spoken to, or had contact with, the prisoner since that separation. It would seem, from what I understand from the matter, that the separation had a number of contributing factors, not all revealed of course in the agreed facts, although some were referred to in the course of the litigation to which I earlier referred relating to the siblings of the prisoner.
	
	
	There was evidence in the previous trial that has been specifically adverted to in this proceeding that, at the time of that separation, the prisoner must have had some form of breakdown. He was found by police living or hiding in the roof cavity of the then family home, having been resident there, so to speak, for a period of something like ten days before police took him into some form of custody to be taken to a mental health facility.
	
	
	The facts of count 1 are that when the victim was seven or eight years of age, she was at home with the prisoner and he called her into his bedroom. He was lying in bed. She walked to the side of the bed and he pulled the blanket away. He was naked and exposed his penis and he said to the victim ""hold my penis and move your hand up and down"". He ""grabbed"" her right hand and placed it on his penis and moved her hand in an upwards and downwards motion. She pulled her hand away and ran out of the bedroom. She did not disclose this to anybody, for obvious reasons. She was scared and confused about what had occurred.
	
	
	The facts suggest, for the purposes of at this stage reflecting upon the factual circumstances, that the incident occurred over a relatively short period of time. The prisoner did not ejaculate, although it is clear that the accused was causing her to masturbate him for some period of time.
	
	
	As the facts describe it in relation to count 2, ""on a later occasion around the same year"" the prisoner again called the victim into his bedroom. Again he removed the blanket, exposed his penis and grabbed her right hand. She pulled her arm away, in the context of having previously experienced this type of event. He told her to ""come on"", firmly placed her hand on his penis and told her to move her hand up and down. He then moved her hand up and down on his penis.
	
	
	The facts specifically state in this regard that the victim indicated ""that it did not last long"". The prisoner obviously took his hands off her fingers and as soon as he did that, she pulled her hand away and ran out of the bed room. Again, she did not disclose that at the relevant time.
	
	
	The matter came to light in a period ""around 1994"" when a diary in the possession of the victim, which she had kept since 1992, was found by the victim’s mother to have an entry disclosing the behaviour forming the subject matter of the two counts with which I am concerned. The prisoner was confronted by the mother. The prisoner told the victim to rip the page out of the diary, which she then did. It is said in the facts that there were ""no further sexual acts by the prisoner against the victim after the discovery of the diary"".
	
	
	The prisoner has given evidence which was not challenged by the Crown that the prisoner had apologised to his wife and to the victim, promised that he would not repeat the conduct again and the family continued to live together, albeit I would imagine in considerably strained relations for this event alone.
	
	
	The victim ""remembers there were a number of other occasions when masturbation occurred and also occasions when the prisoner offered to give her chocolates if she masturbated him"". The significance of that evidence is, as the authorities make clear, that in proper context the two offences with which I am concerned were not ""isolated incidents"". But the number of times that these other incidents occurred and the character of their repetition could not be established beyond reasonable doubt. I will come back to the relevant authorities that deal with an analysis of offending of this type shortly.
	
	
	The prisoner has findings of guilt in October 1980 and June 1981 in the Court of Petty Sessions, as it was then called, for offences of ""wilful and obscene exposure"". For one offence, he was placed on the then equivalent of a section 10 bond for a period of 12 months; on the other occasion, he was fined $200. It would seem that the second offence was in breach of the bond that he had been given the year before, given its timing. But there is no evidence of any action upon the earlier given ""recognizance"".
	
	
	There is a finding of guilt in November 1999 for contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order. This conviction fits in with my understanding of the chronology of events concerning the separation of the prisoner from his wife and would obviously be concerned with matters relating to their early relationship after that separation. Obviously, it is an offence that postdates the offending behaviour. So, in that sense, is not directly relevant to the assessment of character and the significance of the convictions.
	
	
	On the other hand, in the context of the evidence that was before me in the trial that I am obviously required to consider to some extent in this sentencing procedure, I do not see that conviction as representing something of significance in this sentencing exercise. It appears to be very much tied up in the early period of separation. It was dealt with by a bond pursuant to then s 558 Crimes Act 1900, the relevant provision relating to the making of recognizances after a conviction is recorded at that period of time. The prisoner has no other findings of guilt since that conviction was recorded.
	
	
	The prisoner, as I understand it, may have had one day in custody in the context of appearing at court from police custody in 2014, which I have taken into account.
	
	
	I have a body of evidence relating to the personal circumstances of the prisoner in the form of a Community Corrections Report prepared on 29 January 2015 which was tendered in the Crown case, as is usually the case; a report from Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist retained by the prisoner's solicitors; character references from the prisoner's now wife and his ""stepdaughter"", the daughter of his current partner; and the evidence of the prisoner, who also relies on the statistics provided. I will refer to those matters shortly.
	
	
	There appears to me to be no real issue as to the general subjective circumstances of the prisoner, particularly in light of the acquittals of the accused in respect of the allegations made against him by his sisters.
	
	
	The prisoner was born in Italy, as I understand it in Naples. He came to Australia at the age of 12 and was at an age where it was difficult for him to settle into school with his language difficulties, a problem not confronted by his younger siblings. Because of, it would appear, some pressure within the family for him to assist in the family's financial well-being, he left school at an early age. He claims of suffering some mental and physical abuse from family members which is, to my mind, of no significance in this proceeding.
	
	
	He worked as a baker, as I understand it, or trained in that particular craft, and has been involved in matters concerning baking and food preparation in the hospitality industry and the like since he left school somewhere around the age of 14 or 15.
	
	
	I accept the evidence establishes, from what I heard at the trial so far as it is relevant in this proceeding and what I received in this particular sentencing procedure, that the prisoner has been regularly employed. He is an industrious worker. There is no doubt, as I understand it, when he was living with his wife and children that he was not neglectful of their financial means, although that is not to say that he has always been financially secure.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence before me, and also reported to Community Corrections and Dr Nielssen, that in the early 1990s he commenced to consume amphetamines. These were introduced to him in the context of being a baker, working very long hours and getting up early in the morning, as a means of sustaining him in those onerous conditions.
	
	
	He also continued to abuse alcohol and amphetamines up until the breakdown of his marriage. It would appear that at that time there were various financial strains upon the family. Part of the evidence at the trial was a dispute that arose between himself and his siblings concerning moneys that he borrowed from his parents, at least when his father and mother were alive, and which, at the death of his mother the last parent to survive, remained unpaid.
	
	
	He has however, since the separation from his wife, steadied his financial circumstances. It would appear that since around about 2003 or thereabouts he has been successful in business and currently conducts a business in the form of a restaurant in the southern part of the St George area. His wife works in that business and there are quite a number of employees, as I understood the evidence, ten or 11 employees, that work from time to time.
	
	
	The prisoner, according to the Community Corrections Officer and in the assessment of Dr Nielssen, has no particular current mental health issues. There was the evidence that I was aware of concerning his breakdown in 1999 and his ""scheduling"", that does not seem to me Dr Nielssen was referred to, in the subpoenaed material that was produced to this Court and was referred to at some stage during the earlier trial. There is no issue of any mental health matter, other than perhaps an underlying condition of depressive symptoms and anxiety arising from other external factors, contributing to his offending on this occasion. Certainly, I have not been required to consider whether the various matters which were summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De la Rosa, a 2010 decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	To the officer of the Community Corrections Service he acknowledged the wrongness of his actions and the negative effect upon his daughter. There is no victim impact statement in this matter. I draw no inference, if I can use the expression, adverse to the victim or favourable to the contention that the prisoner's conduct has had no effect upon the victim by that fact. But, on the other hand, I have no evidence, other than what might be inferred from the character of the offending and its impact upon the family dynamic, of long term damage or specific injury suffered by the victim from this conduct.
	
	
	I have mentioned part of the history of this matter is that when the wife left the marriage, the children had no further contact with their father and that continues to be the case.
	
	
	The prisoner acknowledged that his actions were wrong, attributing his offending behaviour to his illicit drug use at the time. In fairness to the prisoner, as was pointed out by Dr Nielssen the prisoner, whilst he speaks good English as I understand it, has English as a second language. I am not trying to excuse the expression of what he said to the Community Corrections officer in a manner favourable to him, but for the purposes of my fact-finding even noting the affect upon him of taking prohibited drugs, there appears to be nothing in the offending that can be explained by the consumption of illicit drugs. If it is claimed that it heightened his sexuality in some way, it does not explain why that heightened sexuality had to be satiated or satisfied by a sexual assault committed upon his daughter, as opposed to increased sexual activity with his wife, or some other person who he may choose who was above the age of consent and was a proper person with whom to have a sexual relationship.
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact in this context that there is some history that there was a breakdown between himself and his wife in a range of ways but that can offer no excuse or even explanation for a sexual assault of this type.
	
	
	He was subjected by Community Corrections to an actuarial test or assessment as to his risk of reoffending and is assessed to be at a ‘medium to low’ risk of offending. The report states that he is self-employed, as I have earlier indicated; has a stable income with no financial stress; he acknowledged his actions were wrong and denied any current issues with alcohol, drugs or mental health. He is thought to be appropriate for supervision by Community Corrections and should be monitored for engagement with recommended sexual offender treatment and I will recommend those matters in the bond that I have foreshadowed I will order.
	
	
	He is suitable for Community Service, but he is thought to be a person who would not benefit from a Community Service order and there were no current programs to address his identified needs. ‘Community service’ is not a matter I would contemplate, in any event, in this matter.
	
	
	Coming back to Dr Nielssen's report, I have dealt with many of the matters of history. Some of that history I have taken into account relates to the context of conflict between he and his family members. He explained the two convictions for indecent exposure as extending from being caught masturbating in his motor car, extending from his sexual frustration and lack of privacy at the time, rather than any particular excitement arising from exposing himself. I could not conclude that there was a necessary link between that conduct and the conduct towards his daughter in the context of there being something in the order of a 13 or 14 year break between the two episodes.
	
	
	In my view, ultimately I have concluded that the prisoner does not have a significant history of criminal convictions for the purposes of this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen reflected upon his stable relationship. The prisoner has adopted the religious lifestyle of his now wife. He denied that he was attracted to prepubescent children, or being especially attracted by teenage girls and his current wife, who has a daughter, as I understand it, now aged 22 according to the history given to Dr Nielssen, does not complain about any impropriety on the part of the prisoner.
	
	
	There is no family history of mental illness. He gave some indication of some symptoms consistent with depressive illness. It was noted that there were risk factors for depression for him, including hardships associated with adjusting to migration, the effects of physical and emotional abuse during his upbringing and being saddened by the loss of his children. However he did not describe being pervasively depressed and there appeared to be no evidence of impairment in social function at the present time. He reflected upon some sadness and ""underlying mood"" of appearing depressed. However, he was found not to be suffering any mental illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen, who is a well-respected psychiatrist, gave consideration to the possibility that the prisoner had a disorder of abnormal sexual intercourse (a paraphilia) in the form of exhibitionism, but in the context of his history of denying any particular excitement from his conduct, he could not be satisfied such a disorder existed.
	
	
	He may have had a substance abuse disorder at an earlier time but that no longer occurred. The prisoner had told him that cannabis and amphetamines particularly were used at the time of the offences. Dr Nielssen said these drugs are:
	


“...likely to have contributed to his behaviour because of the increased sexual interest and the loss of judgment and inhibition associated with the use of those drugs.”


	
	Again that may be so, but it does not explain why he would act this way towards his daughter as opposed to some other person more mature.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen said that sexual offenders generally have a lower probability of recidivism than other categories of offender and intrafamilial sex offenders are reported to have an even lower rate of recidivism, probably because of the opportunistic nature of their offending. 
	
	
	The doctor reflects upon the absence of any reported misconduct towards the stepdaughter and she does not complain of any misconduct. There is no history of anti-social conduct or recent substance abuse disorder which may be contributors to recidivism and on the Static 99R actuarial assessment, he scored between 1 and 2 out of a maximum score of 12 which indicates a ""low probability of re-offending"". No psychiatric treatment is recommended.
	
	
	As I said, the references from the wife of the prisoner and her daughter are very positive. The industry of the prisoner and his good conduct within the family unit is noted and the daughter, as I have earlier said, has said that the prisoner has never acted inappropriately towards her at any time.
	
	
	Of course, I have earlier referred to the prisoner's evidence, some of which I have summarised, as I have worked my way through the material available. With respect to his evidence, he repeated his regret for his conduct.
	
	
	The submissions of the parties were most helpful. Counsel for the prisoner concentrated on the need for the Court to approach the sentencing of the prisoner having regard to what are described as ""sentencing standards at the time of the offending"". I will come back to the import of decisions such as R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 at a later time.
	
	
	It was also brought to my attention by learned counsel for the prisoner particular statistics. I am not criticising counsel but these statistics were of little assistance in some respects. Whilst they are for the ‘old’, as it is described, s 61M(2) aggravated indecent assault of a child under ten, before the introduction of standard non-parole periods, it is to be borne in mind that standard non-parole periods were introduced not on the introduction of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but a number of years after that, in approximately 2003 or 2004. Thus, the statistics provided do not to my mind necessarily provide a reliable picture of events in 1994 or reflect a range of offenders; in the material provided to me 21 cases over a period of time, between the introduction of s 61M(2) Crimes Act replacing s 61E Crimes Act before 1993 up until the introduction of standard non-parole periods. The statistics are for 2007 to 2014.
	
	
	In that regard, however, one of the judgments to which I was referred by learned counsel for the Crown very helpfully contains a summary of particular statistical information that is in fact current to the year 1994 relating to sentencing of offenders in the District Court in 1994. That information provided in PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84 (in the judgment of R S Hulme J at [71]) notes from Judicial Commission statistics of 1994, that where the principal proven offence was masturbation of the victim or offender, 39% of offenders received a full-time custodial sentence for an offence pursuant to s 61M(2). Apparently the period of time covered by the statistics included consideration of offences under s 61E, the provision, as I understand it, that was substantially replaced by s 61M of the Act. There are other statistics pre- Standard Non-Parole Periods for the period 2000 to 2002 which are not relevant.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of statistics, if I might deal with that issue at the point where I am referring to the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, I note what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734, particularly at p 739. Bald statistics are of limited use, he said. They are less useful than surveys of decided cases which enable some detail of the specific circumstances to be set out. Caution needs to be exercised in using statistics, but they do provide some assistance in ensuring consistency and may provide an indication of general sentencing trends. They may indicate an appropriate range, particularly where a significant majority or a small minority, fall within a particular range, and also may be useful for the Court of Criminal Appeal in a way that does not assist this Court. Where the circumstances of particular offences vary greatly, however, they may be of little use, such as with manslaughter.
	
	
	One of the issues relevant to statistics, although I do not think it applies necessarily to this type of offending but does particularly in relation to manslaughter and accessorial liability in relation to the crime of murder, is that statistics setting out non-custodial options will not reflect the fact that people originally charged with murder may spend a number of years or a lengthy time in custody before the matter is ultimately disposed of by the Court which may not be reflected in the final orders.
	
	
	I have had regard particularly to the observations in PWB insofar as they are reliably contemporaneous. The statistics cited, however, do not deal with the range of options otherwise exercised apart from full-time custody. I bear in mind, of course, that in 1994 through until 2001 Courts in this jurisdiction did not have the power to order the terms of imprisonment to be suspended.
	
	
	With regard to the character of the offending, counsel for the prisoner pointed to the absence of touching of the complainant. She was not undressed. She was fully clothed at relevant times. The offences were of short duration. There was no ejaculation. It was submitted that there was no prolonged sexual abuse.
	
	
	A submission was made that the Court might conclude that the two offences were committed one day after the other. But that is not in accordance with the substance of the agreed facts and, in any event, the offences have to be seen in the context of other conduct, albeit not particularised.
	
	
	It was submitted, and I accept, that the prisoner's plea of guilty was an important matter to take into account, not just for its utilitarian value. It was described as ""courageous"" by counsel for the prisoner. It was a recognition by him that the complainant would be believed and it relieved the complainant of the ordeal of coming back here to give evidence in relation to a man who has long been out of her life.
	
	
	The prisoner had apologised, his account uncontradicted, at an early time and the prisoner's continuation in the domestic unit for a period of what appears to be four or five years afterwards was a reflection of not only his rehabilitation, but also of, at least for a period of time, the acceptance of his apology. There was clear contrition, it was submitted, which I accept to be so from a short time after the offending and there was a cessation of offending, which is an important matter. The prisoner's offending conduct did not cease simply because his testosterone levels started to diminish or he was arrested or the children were taken from him.
	
	
	It was also submitted on behalf of the prisoner that there were 20 years of rehabilitation, which was an important matter to take into account. This I do. He had reformed himself and continued to make a contribution in the community.
	
	
	I was reminded of the fact that there was evidence from him, again not challenged by the Crown, that he was conducting a substantial business that he had developed, since the separation from the daughter, in circumstances where at one point he believed he may be prosecuted in relation to this matter but had the allegations withdrawn from him. He had gone on to develop a successful business upon which other people were dependent, not just his family but other employees which I take into account. I do not take it into account as an exceptional circumstance, but it is one of a number of matters favourable to the prisoner to be taken into account in this case.
	
	
	It was submitted no issue of specific deterrence arose, which I accept. But, of course, as the Crown pointed out in its oral submissions in response, general deterrence remains a relevant matter for obvious reasons.
	
	
	The Crown took issue with some of the submissions made by learned counsel for the prisoner. I have already dealt with one aspect concerning the timing of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown asked me to have regard to the decision of PWB as providing some guidance to the Court, particularly in the table of cases that are attached to that decision. I will come back to that table of cases in a moment.
	
	
	The Crown accepted there should be a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea and the Crown, as I said earlier, pointed out in the context of the issue of delay, that the complainant had in fact made a statement about these matters on 26 August 1999 but withdrew that statement in September 1999.
	
	
	With regard to consideration of matters that were raised in submission and otherwise are required to be taken into account, naturally I have regard to the ‘purposes of sentencing’ under s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There are other purposes of sentencing that do arise here, particularly general deterrence. I do not believe at this point, although it may have been different in 1994, that the protection of the community or of the child is an issue. The prisoner has to be made accountable for his conduct, but, notwithstanding what was said to be 20 years of rehabilitation, I am also required to promote his rehabilitation. I have to denounce his conduct obviously and I must recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime which must be recognised or identified by inference without any particular evidence to assist me.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the learned Crown's very helpful and detailed written submissions pointed to a number of matters. The Crown referred to the fact that the offence ""involved the actual or threatened use of violence"". I cannot accept that this is an aggravating factor in this offending. There is reference to the facts that the accused grabbed the complainant's hand and held the complainant's hand at one point of each exercise for a short period of time, but this is not actual or threatened violence as those words would be commonly understood.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that an aggravating factor was that the prisoner had a record of previous convictions and this is described as being sentence for personal violence offences and the like. In this matter, I could not conclude that his prior findings of guilt in relation to wilful and obscene exposure represent ""relevant aggravating factors"" in this matter in the way that that provision in s 21A(2) is contemplated. In fact, I have already indicated I conclude on balance in favour of the prisoner that he does not have a significant record of criminal convictions.
	
	
	I accept the Crown's submission, which is self-evidently true, that the accused abused the position of trust and authority in relation to the victim. The victim was entitled not to be sexually assaulted in the way she was in her own home. The cases from superior courts are all at one in stating that the parents of children have a particular obligation to protect their children and not commit acts of violence and sexual violence against them.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors that arise, apart from the matters I have already identified, I have concluded, having regard to his age and his progress over 20 years, that he is unlikely to re-offend. Hence the need not to be concerned about, at this point, the protection of the community. The offences were not planned or organised criminal activity. The prisoner has shown remorse for the offending in the way contemplated by s 21A(3)(i), accepting responsibility for his action and acknowledging the harm done to the victim.
	
	
	The plea of guilty is a relevant mitigating factor but he receives a discrete discount for that. I have concluded that he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation, evidenced best by his conduct over the last 20 years.
	
	
	With regard to the more general or, perhaps in another way of putting it, more specific sentencing principles that relate to this type of offending, I was particularly taken to a number of authorities which reflect upon, or include, the observations of the five judge Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal that determined the decision of R v MJR. Another particular case that was cited and which I now refer to was the decision of MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213. Basten JA gave a separate judgment, the lead judgment in the case would appear to be the judgment of Garling J, agreed to by RA Hulme J. I particularly refer to [78]-[94]. I do not propose to go into the detail of that aspect of the judgment beyond noting from MJR that sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of the offence is to be recognised when sentencing practice has moved adversely to the offender. What has moved adversely to the offender since the commission of these offences is the introduction of the standard non-parole periods provided for this offence, in the context of consideration of the requirements of s 54A, s 54B and the principles laid out by the High Court in the decision of Muldrock.
	
	
	When I concern myself with the issue of a sentencing pattern, however, I found some difficulties in this matter. Of course, I have not just been sitting in my Chambers since last Friday when I did about five or six matters up until about half past five, including this matter, reflecting upon this case. I have been involved in another trial and a number of other matters. But I have done my best to go through the material presented to me and consider, particularly, the very helpful material presented by the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown sought to refer to, at from the bottom of page 3 to page 5 of its written submissions, a number of supposedly ""comparative"" cases, being in fact decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal over a period of time, both at the time of the commission of this offending in 1994, 1995 or 1996 and more recently when offenders have come forward for sentencing in relation to offending in 1993 or 1994.
	
	
	It is quite apparent just looking at the summary provided by the Crown that a number of the judgments referred to have no relevance to this case for a range of reasons, including the character of the relationship, the character of the offending or, alternatively, the intensity of the offending, the frequency of the offending, or, most importantly, because the sentences for s 61M(2) offences were sentences imposed in the context of other sentences that were fixed for far more serious offending such as sexual intercourse.
	
	
	By reference to the ‘Table’ to PWB, a very good example of that is in the decision of Ruhle, a decision of 25 July 1995. It was correct in that matter, where the offender was sentenced to a minimum term of one year and an additional term of one year, that the prisoner was convicted of an aggravated indecent assault pursuant to s 61M(2). But the prisoner was also convicted of an offence contrary to s 78H, homosexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10, for which he received a total sentence of three years. That was an act of forcing the victim to perform fellatio upon him. I am not criticising the Crown for drawing my attention to the judgment, if it be noted for the principles that are set out in the judgment of Cole J about the weight to be given to general deterrence and retribution for offenders committing offences against young children. But at the same time the actual sentence imposed has to be seen in the context of other crimes.
	
	
	When one looks at PWB, a number of the cases referred to which were obviously cited for the purposes of that particular judgment which concerned itself with offending that occurred over a period of time between the early 80s through to the early 90s. A number of the offences were concerned with s 61E which carried a lesser maximum penalty. Where offences are cited that arise under s 61M(2) in almost every situation the relevant sentence has to be seen in the context of other offending, usually involving crimes of a more serious nature; for example, R v L which had two aggravated indecent assault convictions but also sexual intercourse with a six year old child. Otherwise, there were other aspects of the matter that reflected upon a situation different than here. Another example from the Crown's list, and again I am not taking the Crown to task, it was helpful in many ways, it cited a decision of Rose from 23 May 1996, where the Crown appealed against sentences which involved a good behaviour bond found to be grossly inadequate. What does not appear in the Crown's history or summary is the fact that the respondent to that particular appeal had ""prior sexual offences"" according to the Table of cases cited in PWB.
	
	
	I appreciate every case is different both as to the objective facts and the subjective facts and one must be cautious in relation to relying upon comparative cases. At the same time, sometimes comparative cases may very closely relate the circumstances of the matter, I could not find any particular case cited in the matters referred to by the Crown or even in the schedule of cases of which there are many cases referred to in PWB, that provided sufficient similarity to provide a reasonable comparison to this case but some general guidance was provided.
	
	
	There is one other feature of comparative cases particularly relying upon decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal which obviously have greater wisdom and are of enormous help to judges. The cases heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal are cases that either the Crown has chosen to take on appeal as inadequate sentences at first instance or have been chosen by the appellant to be manifestly excessive, or complaining about some other error. As the statistics referred to by Justice Hulme in PWB make clear, of course the reality of the sentencing trends of 1994 or relevant to cases arising from events in 1993 and 1994 is not necessarily reflected in specific decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal representing only a very small proportion of the matters dealt with in the court below.
	
	
	This brings me to what Justice Garling has said about judicial recollection at [89]- [92] of which judges are often guilty. I have been guilty of this myself. Reflecting upon one's own experience doesn't necessarily reflect the real situation. Judicial recollection can be unreliable, alternatively someone might reflect upon something seen only through the prism of their own particular view point of a particular matter. Sometimes, of course, judicial recollection can be solely a matter of chance. With regard to other judgments I have had regard to MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261. It is not a ""comparative"" case but I note amongst other things the observations of Justice Hidden about the fact that an offender standing for sentence for offences which involve allegations of other sexual activity means that whilst the offender is only sentenced for the crimes for which he's been convicted, the crimes have to be seen in their proper context and can deny the offender the leniency if in fact they were ""isolated incidents"" (see [15]).
	
	
	I am also mindful of the observations, of which there are many, concerning the need to ensure protection of children.  Particularly the Crown refers me to R v Gavil [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110]. In PWB I note what Justice Hulme said ""other things being equal indecent assaults by those such as parents who are entrusted with or undertake the care of children are significantly more heinous than those by others"". Of course PWB was a case involving the abuse of siblings, but over an extended period of some years with many more acts than which I am concerned now.
	
	
	The issue of breach of trust, in any event, is particularly referred to by the learned Crown in his written submissions and other authorities are cited on this aspect. Another issue, however, that arises in this matter, again referred to briefly in the Crown's written submissions, is the issue of delay in prosecution.
	
	
	The Crown cites the observation that:
	


""delay is not a mitigating factor in circumstances where the offender was not left in the state uncertain suspense and where there was no delay arising from the operation of the criminal justice system such that the offender's fate was not determined for many years in particular when the offender had the benefit of delay by reason of findings about good prospects of rehabilitation...[in the context of child sexual assault offences]""

(see SM v R [2014] NSW CCA 137).


	
	That is absolutely true, and of course this prisoner does get the benefit of the progress of his rehabilitation, as I have already pointed out. But, it is unusual in this case in the sense that the prisoner was left in some particular position of suspense given the fact that firstly he was aware of the disclosure of these matters way back in 1994 and he reformed his ways immediately, as I would understand it, on the evidence available to me.
	
	
	When the family broke down in 1999, he again became aware of the threat of disclosure because it became obviously apparent from what he understood that his daughter on the breakup of the marriage had gone to the police and made a statement, but he also had the fact that the allegations against him were withdrawn. Of course, he could have volunteered a plea of guilty there and then, but in the context of what I understand to be the chronology of events the allegations were withdrawn before he was even charged as I would understand it. Even if that was not absolutely correct, really no realistic opportunity was provided to him to confront the matter and get rid of it by admitting his guilt in a Court in the circumstances made known to me.
	
	
	Then he went about rebuilding his life in the manner in which I have described, not only getting the benefit, I hasten to say, with the favourable points I have found, but also having to come back and face these allegations when he might have reasonably concluded for better or for worse, through no fault of the victim, that these matters were behind him. In my view, in that context, some of the observations that were made about the relevance of delay in sentencing such as were discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Todd v R and again by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 arise for consideration.
	
	
	In fact, in the decision of PWB, the issue of delay is expressly discussed, delay being a factor in that case in respect of a course of offending that occurred between 1982 and 1993, 1994. That particular appellant did not have to confront allegations against him until 2006 after he had married and long since left the family home and stopped abusing his siblings. Delay may justify a significant measure of leniency to an offender depending upon the circumstances of the matter which can vary. It was so observed by Justice R S Hulme and he set out reference to Todd and other decisions at [49] of that decision. It seems to me, with respect, it cannot be said that some consideration of leniency, perhaps the leniency of suspending the sentences as I have proposed, cannot be afforded to the prisoner given the unusual circumstances to which I have referred.
	
	
	In that regard, concerning the decision to impose terms of imprisonment but suspend them, I particularly take into account the observations of Justice Howie in the decision of Zamagias ([2002] NSWCCA 17) and particularly the observations concerning the true effect, although it may not seem so to the casual observer, of the recording of a conviction, the imposition of a term of imprisonment, albeit suspended without the need to immediately serve the term of custody.
	
	
	There is also the issue of the restraint of liberty which of itself is a significant burden placed upon the prisoner. In that regard I note some of the observations of Justice Harrison in more recent times particularly, I hasten to say, in relation to pursuant to s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the decision of R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51. It might be thought, of course, that in this case there is no need to suspend the sentence to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner, having regard to the evidence unchallenged of his rehabilitation to which I have earlier referred. That having been said, there are other matters to be taken into account as have been discussed by Justice Howie in Zamagias and Justice Johnson in Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455, relevant to the extension of that particular leniency, that arise.
	
	
	I have had regard of course to the need to consider the totality of the offending in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v R [1998] 194 CLR 610. I am appreciative as I have been from the introduction of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, before the matter was ever discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that in determining the terms of imprisonment be suspended in accordance with what Justice Howie observed in Zamagias there was a need to identify the appropriate term of imprisonment for each offence and consider the relevant principles relating to the issues of totality, and then turn one's mind as to whether in those circumstances it was open, given the items of s 12, to suspend the relevant term of imprisonment. If I concluded that the total term of imprisonment would be greater than two years, I would have not ordered the suspension of the items of imprisonment. I would have imposed a total term of imprisonment that would have reflected an effective non-parole period, I hasten to say, approximately 50% of the sentence to be imposed bearing in mind that there are special circumstances in this matter, particularly the need for the prisoner to seek professional assistance to return to community living should he be imprisoned.
	
	
	I do not have to make that decision at this point of time. I also have not concluded that the total sentence to be imposed in the context of sentencing practice at the time would be greater than two years, having regard to both the objective seriousness of the offending and in the circumstances characterised by counsel for the prisoner, but noting the relationship of the victim to the prisoner and taking into account all relevant mitigating factors that I am required to take into account.
	
	
	In relation to count 1, you are convicted. In relation to that count, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of one year and six months. That term of imprisonment is suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The conditions of your bond that you will be required to enter into will be that you will be of good behaviour. Secondly, you will attend upon this Court if required to do so for sentencing if you are called up for sentencing, and thirdly you will advise the Court of any change of residential address.
	
	
	You are required to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service for the term of the bond, and a further condition of the bond will be that you are to report to the Community Corrections Service at Hurstville within seven days of today. With regard to the conditions of your supervision, they will include a requirement for you to undertake all psychological and sexual assault counselling directed by the Community Corrections Service of the Department of Corrections.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 you are convicted. You are sentenced in relation to that offence to a term of imprisonment of 21 months. That term of imprisonment is suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The conditions of the bond that you will be required to agree to in order not to serve a term of imprisonment will be identical to the conditions that I have fixed in relation to the other bond.
	
	
	You must understand that if you are in breach of the bonds that I fix, I have the power to revoke those bonds. I have the power to make one sentence partially accumulative upon another. I also would be required, I would imagine, to fix a non-parole period in your case. It may transpire if I was required to fix a non-parole period in breach of those bonds that I would not necessarily contemplate a non-parole period of the manner that I indicated would have been fixed had I been of the view that the total term imprisonment was greater than two years.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, are there any technical matters?
	
	
	TATLOCK: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters from you Mr Clarke?
	
	
	CLARKE: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR:  AX, you are fortunate that I have made the order that I have. The conduct that you have admitted to is not excused or even explained by the use of amphetamines it at the time. It provides some context, but it's really no excuse or explanation in behaving in this way, and if it is the truth that you are, if I might use the colloquial which you might not understand, but if you were in the mid 90s ""oversexed"" and were constantly desirous of sexual contact with females, again that's absolutely no excuse or explanation for what you did. You should be utterly ashamed of yourself and remained ashamed of yourself for the rest of your life. The shame that you carry with you, of course, and I'm not trying to criticise you personally, I'm just making the point the shame that you would carry with you is very much reflected in the fact that your children at this stage have had no contact with you since you separated from your wife. I appreciate the dynamics of family are such there may be many explanations for that, but one might have thought, at least in the case of your daughter, your conduct towards her when she was very young was one such contributing factor. You can leave the dock.

2766075,"Milat, Ivan Robert Marko - Application under Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209","___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Ivan Robert Marko Milat, once again applies for an inquiry under s.78(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 into his conviction on seven counts of murder and one count of detaining for advantage.
	


Conviction, Appeal and Previous Applications for Review


	
	Following a trial before Hunt CJ at CL and a jury between March and July 1996, the Applicant was convicted of seven offences of murder and one offence of detaining for advantage. In relation to each of the offences of murder, he was sentenced to penal servitude for life. The Applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for six years for the offence of detaining for advantage.
	
	
	On 26 February 1998, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against the Applicant’s convictions: R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Newman J, BC9800394).
	
	
	On 28 May 2004, the High Court of Australia refused an application for special leave to appeal: Milat v The Queen [2004] HCA Trans 179.
	
	
	The Applicant has made five unsuccessful applications for review of his convictions under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 or its statutory predecessor, s.474D Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The first application was refused by Barr J on 27 October 2005: R v Milat [2005] NSWSC 920; 157 A Crim R 565.
	
	
	The second application was refused by McClellan CJ at CL on 14 December 2006: Application of Milat [2006] NSWSC 1391.
	
	
	The third application was refused by McClellan CJ at CL on 17 July 2008: Application of Milat [2008] NSWSC 732.
	
	
	The fourth application was refused by McClellan CJ at CL on 11 November 2010: Application of Milat [2010] NSWSC 1292.
	
	
	The fifth application was refused by Adamson J on 22 April 2014: Application by Ivan Robert Marko Milat Pursuant to Section 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2014] NSWSC 434.
	


Repeated Applications for Review of Convictions


	
	Sections 78 and 79 lie within Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Part 7 has its origins in a legislative scheme which was an innovation in New South Wales. It is remedial legislation designed to overcome injustices that sometimes arise in the administration of criminal justice: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCA 172; 66 NSWLR 151 at 154 [5], 155 [8] (Spigelman CJ). The decision of the High Court of Australia in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at 564 [47] did not concern the s.474D issue touched upon by Spigelman CJ.
	
	
	The Applicant contends that there is a doubt or question as to his guilt: s.79(2).
	
	
	The statutory history of ss.78 and 79 (and their predecessors) and their interaction with the principle of finality, were considered in Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783 at 792-796 [33]-[55].
	
	
	A feature of the present statutory scheme is of particular significance to this application. It relates to circumstances where repeated applications for review are made.
	
	
	Section 79(3) provides as follows:
	


“(3)    The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)    it appears that the matter:

(i)    has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)    has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)    has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)    has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)    the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”


	
	The provisions now contained in s.79(3) were first introduced as part of extensive statutory reforms contained in the Crimes Legislation (Review of Convictions) Amendment Act 1993. As Spigelman CJ observed in Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority (NSW) at 154 [6], the 1993 Act followed the preparation by the Criminal Law Review Division of an issues paper entitled “Review of Section 475 of the Crimes Act 1900” (November 1992).
	
	
	The 1993 Act inserted ss.474C-474F into the Crimes Act 1900. As enacted in 1993, s.474E(3) provided:
	


“(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter is the same as a matter that has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the repealed provisions; and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”


	
	In the second reading speech for the Crimes Legislation (Review of Convictions) Amendment Bill 1993, the Attorney General, the Hon JP Hannaford, said with respect to Clause 474E(3) (Hansard, Legislative Council, 27 October 1993):
	


“The bill also provides for some limit to be placed on subsequent and further applications for a section 475 inquiry, by adopting a test similar to section 22A of the Bail Act. The Government is concerned that in removing restrictions on the post-conviction inquiry procedure, some additional safeguards are required against the waste of judicial resources that can flow from repeated unmeritorious applications for inquiries. Consequently, either the Governor or the Attorney General in the case of petitions, or the Supreme Court in the case of applications to it, will be entitled to refuse to consider an inquiry if the matter is substantially the same as one that has already been dealt with and there are no special circumstances justifying further action.”


	
	The model for the “special facts or special circumstances” test introduced in s.474E(3) was the test then contained in s.22A Bail Act 1978 with respect to repeated bail applications.
	
	
	It may be seen that the balance being struck by the provisions then contained in s.474E(3), and now contained in s.79(3), involved an appropriate remedial process for applications for a post-conviction inquiry and the need to guard against “the waste of judicial resources that can flow from repeated unmeritorious applications for inquiries”.
	
	
	In a case to which s.79(3) applies, the Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. This course may be taken where one or more of the circumstances identified in s.79(3)(a)(i)-(iv) arises and, in addition, the Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action: s.79(3)(b).
	
	
	Where repeated applications for an inquiry into conviction have been made, the threshold question posed by s.79(3) will arise for consideration.
	


The Present Application


	
	As with the Applicant’s five previous applications, the present application has been prepared by the Applicant and is in handwritten form.
	
	
	The Applicant summarises the grounds of his present application as follows:
	


“(1)   Unease over trial judge misdirections in law to the jury:

(a)   given the misdirections in law went to the jury’s verdict.

(2)   The availability of evidence from the trial suggests that the issues in the appeal grounds were never fully addressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.”


	
	In seeking to address the test posed in s.79(3)(b), the Applicant submitted that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify taking further action in this case, namely the “right to a trial according to law, to be given the opportunity to challenge the evidence that the trial judge put to the jury in the course of his sum up [sic] directions”.
	
	
	In relation to the first ground, the Applicant contends, in essence, that the trial Judge erred in law to the extent that his Honour’s directions conveyed that the Crown was not required to establish whether the Applicant committed the offences alone or in company.
	
	
	In relation to the second ground, the Applicant contends that “the failure of the Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate relevant evidence of the nature of the Crown case at trial, that the relevant evidence was that the Crown did not undertake to establish that the accused participated either alone or in company in any of the acts of murder … that failure by the Court of Criminal Appeal permitted the miscarriage of justice to go uncorrected”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the present application under s.79(3) upon the basis that the matters raised have already been dealt with in dealing with the five previous applications made by the Applicant and that there are no special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
	
	
	Having considered the material furnished in support of the application for the purpose of determining the s.79(3) threshold test, I express my agreement with the Crown submission that the Court should refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application under s.79(3).
	
	
	I accept the Crown submission that, although there are minor differences in the way in which the Applicant’s submissions are cast, the present application repeats the claims made in his third, fourth and fifth applications. Once again, the basis of the Applicant’s complaint is that the Crown had an obligation to prove the precise nature of his involvement in the offences and, in particular, whether he acted alone or as part of a joint criminal enterprise. The Applicant argues, once again, that the Crown failed to do this and that Hunt CJ at CL nevertheless directed the jury in a manner which the Applicant seeks to challenge. This submission was considered and rejected by McClellan CJ at CL in considering the third and fourth applications and by Adamson J in considering the fifth application.
	
	
	I accept the submission of the Crown that the Applicant appears either unable to understand, or unwilling to accept, the Court’s determination on these issues.
	
	
	I am satisfied that matters raised by the Applicant have previously been dealt with on applications made by him for review of his convictions: s.79(3)(a)(ii). Further, I am not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action in this matter: s.79(3)(b).
	
	
	The present application exemplifies a repeated unmeritorious application for an inquiry of the type to which the 1993 amendment, and the present s.79(3), are directed. The application should be rejected at the statutory threshold.
	
	
	I refuse to consider or otherwise deal with this application for review in accordance with s.79(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.

	ADAMS J: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J:
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence

On 29 January 2013, William John Zechel, Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga, Tahi Paul Puru and Daniel Warren De Jong were each sentenced on one count of specially aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The serious indictable offence was larceny and the circumstance of special aggravation as defined in s 105A(1) of the Crimes Act was the use of a shotgun/rifle.


	
	Against a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years, the following sentences were imposed:
	


De Jong: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months to commence on 4 October 2011 and to expire on 3 May 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 3 May 2024.

Tuimaualuga: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months to commence on 21 November 2011 with a balance of term of 4 years.

Zechel: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 10 November 2012 and to expire on 9 November 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 9 November 2024.

Puru: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 8 July 2012 with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months.

(Puru was sentenced in the same proceedings to a fixed term of 3 years for an unrelated break, enter and steal committed on 16 June 2011, which also took into account an offence on the Form 1. In the result, he was sentenced to a total effective sentence of imprisonment of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years. The sentencing judge fixed the commencement date for the effective sentence at 7 November 2011. It seems that was an error and the sentence for the fixed term should have been ordered to commence on 7 July 2011. The custody records indicate that error has since been corrected. The sentence for the break, enter and steal offence has since expired. There is no challenge to that sentence.)


	
	The sentences imposed on De Jong and Zechel reflected a 25 per cent discount for their early pleas on committal. Tuimaualuga’s sentence was discounted by 10 per cent as his plea was entered somewhat later. Puru, who pleaded guilty on arraignment, had his sentence reduced by 25 per cent.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	Each of the applicants seek leave to appeal their sentences as manifestly excessive. In making good that challenge counsel for the applicants referred to a large number of authorities. For ease of reference they have been summarised and reproduced in a schedule which forms part of this judgment.
	
	
	The applicants Zechel, Puru and De Jong also assert, as a separate ground of appeal, that the learned sentencing judge was in error in assessing their offending as approaching or “close to” a worst case of offending against s 112(3) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Although not relied upon as a separate ground of appeal, as part of the challenge to the sentence imposed on Tuimaualuga as manifestly excessive, his counsel submitted that the range of conduct comprehended by s 112(3) was such that, even accepting that Tuimaualuga’s offending was objectively serious, it was significantly less serious than close to a worst case, and the sentence was, for that additional reason, unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	
	
	Of the three additional filed grounds of appeal relied upon by De Jong, only two were ultimately pressed, each dealing with the applicant’s subjective circumstances in certain respects, including what was said to be a failure to consider the application of the Fernando principles (R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58), given the applicant’s age and Aboriginality. In his counsel’s oral submissions, both grounds merged into the single complaint that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to the extent of the dysfunction and social deprivation he was exposed to as a relatively young person, including the extent to which his use of drugs from an early age contributed to the criminality inherent in the offending for which he was to be sentenced.
	
	
	Zechel’s counsel also submitted that the date fixed by the sentencing judge for the commencement of his sentence on 10 November 2012 was in error and that, irrespective of the success of the ground of appeal alleging manifest excess, this error should be corrected. That error was finally identified in a supplementary ground of appeal and supplementary submissions. I am satisfied that the commencement date was fixed in error and the correct date, after taking into account Zechel’s broken periods of pre-trial custody, should have been 20 September 2012 and not 10 November 2012.
	


The proceedings on sentence


	
	The evidence tendered by the Crown in the joint sentence proceeding included a statement of facts, which appears to have been almost exclusively drawn from the statement of the principal victim, who was one of three adults in the house the applicants broke into and entered. The statement of facts was supplemented by a further statement prepared by a solicitor with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions detailing the circumstances in which each of the applicants was arrested.
	
	
	The criminal records of each of the applicants were also tendered by the Crown. Pre-sentence reports were tendered by the Crown in the sentence proceedings of Tuimaualuga and De Jong.
	
	
	None of the applicants gave evidence on sentence. Tuimaualuga relied upon a psychological report from Ms Caroline Hare.
	


The reasons for sentence


	
	Although the principal victim differentiated between the offenders according to their physical appearance and their conduct whilst in the house, including whether they were armed, what they were armed with and the nature of the threats that they delivered, the sentencing judge referred to the conduct of the offenders without differentiating between them. In effect, his Honour treated them for sentencing purposes as if they were part of a joint criminal enterprise. His Honour noted that there was no submission from the Crown or the offenders that he should do otherwise.
	


The facts


	
	In the early hours of 4 July 2011 the male victim was at home with his girlfriend and her four children. The children ranged in age from two to ten. The adults and the infant were asleep in the lounge room while her brother and the other three children slept in another room. At about 3am they were woken by a loud banging at the front door. After gaining entry, one of the offenders armed with a single barrelled rifle pointed the rifle at the male’s head and told him to “shut up”. (Although the statement of facts describes one of the offenders carrying a “double barrelled firearm” the sentencing judge does not refer to it in the sentencing remarks.)
	
	
	The offender with the rifle then pointed it at the woman a few inches from her face, and pulled the trigger. The trigger clicked but did not discharge a bullet. That offender repeatedly yelled, “Where’s the fucking money, where are the phones, where are your wallets?”.
	
	
	All four offenders then went into the kitchen and started pulling out drawers and tipping them onto the ground. One offender grabbed meat from the freezer whilst another grabbed the contents of a coin tin.
	
	
	One offender then left the kitchen and walked towards the bedrooms. As he walked past the male, he hit his left temple, either with his fist or with the butt of his rifle, causing pain and residual soreness but without inflicting any physical injury. The woman’s brother and the three other children were in one of the bedrooms. He informed the other offenders, one of whom joined him in demanding money and phones from the adult male in the bedroom. The other two offenders remained in the kitchen searching through the cupboards before also entering the hallway leading to the bedrooms.
	
	
	One of the offenders threatened to assault the male victim if he did not reveal the location of cash and drugs. Despite the male victim claiming he had neither, the offender repeated his demands. Two laptops were seized from one of the bedrooms.
	
	
	At this time, one of the offenders was holding a knife roughly 30cm in length in his left hand and a taser in his right hand. He pointed the knife at the male victim and told him to put the laptops in a laptop bag. He then pointed the knife at the woman and said, “What’s the fucking password for the laptop?”. Although she told him there was no password, she was forced to turn the computer on to confirm that was the case.
	
	
	The offenders then demanded the keys to the victim’s car in order to search it. The male victim told the offenders that he did not know where the keys were. The offender who was armed with the taser activated it causing it to emit a spark and a loud electrical noise. He then threatened the victim with the taser saying, “Do you fucking want it?”.
	
	
	As the offenders left, one of them said, “If we find out you have got more money, we will be coming back”.
	
	
	Although the woman’s brother and her three older children remained in the bedroom at all times, the eldest child (a ten year old girl) was said to have understood what was happening elsewhere in the house. The infant, although present in the lounge room throughout the incident, was unaware of what was occurring.
	
	
	The applicants Zechel, Tuimaualuga and De Jong were arrested by police after the car in which they were travelling was stopped soon after for the purpose of a random breath test. The car was searched. Weapons and stolen items were located. Puru, who was not in the car, was arrested a short time later.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge commenced his remarks on sentence with the following observation:
	


Home invasions are all serious offences but some are worse than others. The offence I am about to describe is getting close to the worst kind of offence of that type. … the four offenders … carried on their terrifying and violent conduct in the presence of not only frightened adults but also in the presence of children. Common decency and humanity might have led two these offenders altering their behaviour once they became aware that they were going to commit their serious, violent and terrifying conduct in the presence of young children. One might have thought they would immediately turn and leave, but they did not. They persisted in what they had planned to do. They deserve to go to gaol, each of them, for a long time simply to reflect the objective gravity of the criminal conduct.


	
	After observing later in the sentencing remarks that the maximum penalty for an offence is reserved for offending in the worst category, and the fact that it is possible to imagine criminal conduct of a worse kind than that under consideration is not the test to be applied in determining whether particular criminal activity comes within the worst category, the sentencing judge said:
	


It has to be said that the behaviour of the four men that morning is approaching the worst category of offending of this type.


	
	His Honour appeared to base that finding on what he (with respect, rightly) found must have been the intense fear engendered by the behaviour of the offenders in the house rather than the infliction of physical violence, which he accepted was relatively minor when compared with other instances of home invasion. He described the conduct of the offenders as “serious”, “terrifying” and “violent” and, in particular, that pointing the rifle at the head of the female occupant and pulling the trigger only inches away from her face was designed to “create awful feelings and apprehension” to ensure that all occupants of the house would comply with the demands made of them.
	
	
	In so far as the children were concerned, his Honour accepted that only the youngest was actually present in the lounge room where most of the activity took place and that the other children remained in the bedroom. His Honour went on to say:
	


The invaders cannot suggest that they were not even aware that the two year old was there because at one stage they suggested that her face be covered. This was relied upon by the offenders, or at least some of them as suggesting that they retained a modicum of decency and feelings towards the young child. I find that difficult to accept. Even if such actions do show a small amount of compassion, it is swamped, it is overwhelmed by the inhumanity that they otherwise displayed early that morning.


	
	His Honour did not refer to the fact that, according to the victim’s statement, the infant did not seem to understand what was happening and that she did not seem to him to be upset.
	


The applicants’ subjective circumstances


	
	Although his Honour did not differentiate between the offenders in his assessment of the objective seriousness of their offending, he concluded that there were differences in their subjective cases, and that different sentences would be imposed to reflect that fact. The precise basis for the differentiation of six months in the total sentences of 12 years imposed on Tuimaualuga and Puru on the one hand, and 12 years and 6 months on De Jong and Zechel on the other, is not clear from the sentencing remarks. His Honour also made a finding of special circumstances with a corresponding adjustment to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and additional term for each of the applicants although he gave no reasons for doing so. It is again unclear from the sentencing remarks what aspects of the applicants’ subjective cases were relied upon to support a finding of special circumstances and what features of their subjective cases bore upon the appointment of an appropriate sentence for each of the offenders. The only reference to the fact that special circumstances were found was after sentences had been imposed where his Honour said, “It will be obvious I have made a finding of special circumstances in each case”.
	
	
	De Jong and Puru submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to their respective subjective cases in particular respects and that their sentences were excessive for that reason. Although neither Zechel nor Tuimaualuga make a similar complaint (and although none of the applicants complain about any unjustified disparity between their sentence and that of any co-offender referable to differences in their subjective circumstances), the evidence bearing upon the subjective circumstances of each of the applicants should be set out at least in summary.
	


Mr Zechel


	
	Zechel was aged 40 at the time of sentence. Although he had a criminal history, his Honour was satisfied that it revealed that the subject offending was out of character. Otherwise, he observed that he knew little of the applicant’s subjective circumstances. No pre-sentence report had been prepared for the purposes of the sentence proceedings and the applicant did not give evidence. His Honour rejected the submission advanced on Zechel’s behalf that he was remorseful, there being no evidence to justify that finding.
	


Mr Tuimaualuga


	
	Tuimaualuga was aged 39 at the time of sentence. He is the eldest child to Samoan parents. He was born in New Zealand and later migrated to Australia. None of his siblings has a criminal history. Tuimaualuga’s criminal history revealed no offences of break, enter and steal and only one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which was dealt with by way of a fine. His Honour also observed that Tuimaualuga had spent seven years as a youth worker and that his arrest and charge have been a source of great shame to him, after encountering some of his former clients as a remand prisoner. His Honour also noted that Tuimaualuga has a sound work history and was working in the mining industry earning a good income at the time that he committed the offence.
	
	
	His Honour noted that Tuimaualuga told the psychologist that he was using excessive quantities of drugs and alcohol at the time of the offence and had no memory of being involved in the home invasion. His Honour accepted that this explained the lateness of his plea of guilty in that it was only after Tuimaualuga spoke with his co-offenders that he accepted that he was in fact present during the home invasion with them.
	
	
	Despite the lateness of the plea and the fact that Tuimaualuga gave no evidence on his own behalf, the sentencing judge accepted that he was genuinely remorseful.
	


Mr De Jong


	
	De Jong was aged 25 at the time of sentence. His criminal history, which commenced when he was a juvenile, included repeated appearances before the Children’s Court. His criminal record as an adult included what his Honour described as “some relatively serious matters … such as break, enter and steal and aggravated robbery”. He was the subject of two s 9 bonds at the time of the offending.
	
	
	His Honour noted that De Jong was the second of four siblings and that he lived with his parents before his arrest. The applicant described a supportive relationship with all his family members, which was confirmed by his mother in an interview with the Probation and Parole Service, but blamed irregular contact with his biological father for his dysfunctional upbringing.
	
	
	De Jong did not complete high school after being expelled during Year 8. He has problems with literacy and numeracy, which various orders for probation and community supervision have endeavoured to address. He has never been employed but has been in receipt of a disability pension following an injury to his foot at the age of 15.
	
	
	He commenced using drugs at a relatively early age and was using alcohol to excess at the time of the offending. (Although his Honour made no reference to it, in the pre-sentence report this was said to have commenced at 13 with daily cannabis use, alcohol abuse at age 15 and the use of “ice” at age 18.) His Honour was satisfied that substance abuse was “likely to have been the major factor” in the applicant’s offending.
	
	
	In considering the impact of that finding on sentence his Honour said:
	


Various courts have looked at the issue of whether drug use and drug addiction can be a mitigating factor. True it is that Mr De Jong’s use of drugs began at an early age but many people would be concerned at any suggestion that a person who decides to continue to use drugs and to continue to commit offences to satisfy that drug addiction should receive a lower penalty simply because of that circumstance. Mr De Jong’s drug addiction may explain what he did but a motivation consisting of a desire to continue to commit other offences (buying and using drugs) by committing this serious offence can not (sic) have a significant effect by way of reducing the sentence that I must impose upon him.


	
	His Honour was satisfied that De Jong’s expressions of remorse to the author of the pre-sentence report were genuine and that he showed some insight into his offending by acknowledging that his lack of pro-social activities and his choice of antisocial peers contributed to his offending behaviour, and that he needed assistance in the future in order to avoid any repetition of that conduct.
	


Mr Puru


	
	His Honour noted that Puru, being 25 at the time of sentence, was significantly younger than Zechel or Tuimaualuga but that he had a more extensive criminal record, including offences of violence.
	
	
	Puru also had a disrupted childhood, including a period of time where he was living on the streets. His parents intervened and arranged for him to live in New Zealand with his father’s family. That intervention was not entirely successful as he committed a number of offences in New Zealand. On his return to Australia, Puru lived with his mother for a short time before leaving to live on the streets.
	
	
	His Honour noted that Puru had some work qualifications but no significant employment since leaving school. He was working in a factory but had been unemployed for about four months at the time of the offences after his employment was terminated for non-attendance.
	
	
	Puru commenced using drugs and alcohol at a very young age and was described by his Honour as a “heavy user of drugs” by his mid-teens. Puru was indebted to drug suppliers at the time of his offending, which his Honour was satisfied motivated him to commit the offence, along with the desire to “get more drugs”. Puru acknowledged that his drug use was related to his offending behaviour.
	
	
	In considering the impact of that finding on sentence, his Honour said:
	


I have to say that using drugs is a very selfish activity. It also must be remembered that it is an illegal activity. It does not at all reflect well on Mr Puru that what motivated him to get involved in this most terrifying offence was simply so that he could pay off drug debts and get more drugs.

…

What I have learnt about Mr Puru, when dealing with this matter, is that he will, unless he changes his ways, continue to use drugs and that will result in a continuation of offending unless he is prepared to do something about the way he has lived his life until now…

Some general observations


	
	Although, as noted earlier, the sentencing judge considered that there were differences in the subjective circumstances of each of the applicants, the basis upon which De Jong and Puru were sentenced to 12 years and 6 months and Tuimaualuga and Zechel 12 years was never made clear. In addition, although his Honour departed from the standard non-parole period by an increment of one year in the non-parole period as part of the sentences imposed on Puru and Tuimaualuga, and one year and eight months in the sentences imposed on Zechel and De Jong, he made no reference to the operation of s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which obliges a sentencing judge to give reasons for setting a non-parole period longer than the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	As to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period his Honour said as follows:
	


The maximum penalty for the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal is 25 years imprisonment. It carries a non-parole period of 7 years [sic]. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in formulating the appropriate sentences in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.


	
	In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the High Court said at [29]:
	


A central purpose of Div 1A is to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. The reference in s 54B(4) to ""mak[ing] a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period"" is not to be understood as suggesting either the need to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending. It does require the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The obligation applies in sentencing for all Div 1A offences regardless of whether the offender has been convicted after trial or whether the offence might be characterised as falling in the low, middle or high range of objective seriousness for such offences.


	
	The Crown submitted that the Court would infer that the finding that the offending approached a worst case which led the sentencing judge to impose non-parole periods for each of the applicants which exceeded the standard non-parole period. Assuming that was the unstated reasoning of the sentencing judge, it follows that if the assessment of the offending as close to or approaching a worst case was in error, as contended for by the applicants on the appeal, it will be likely, perhaps inevitable, that, subject to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the appeals will be allowed and this Court will re-sentence the applicants.
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37, the approach to the interpretation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act in Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 was held to be correct. At [42] the Court said:
	


… When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.


	
	Leaving to one side for the moment the applicants’ challenge to their sentence as manifestly excessive (which in a practical sense involves consideration of the separate ground of appeal mounted by Puru, Zechel and De Jong that his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicants’ offending disclosed patent error), for the Crown to invoke s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act in this case it must satisfy this Court that the applicants’ offending was nonetheless above the mid-range of objective seriousness, even if not approaching a worst case, and that the sentences imposed, including, in particular, non-parole periods greater than the standard non-parole period by a year in the cases of Tuimaualuga and Puru and a year and six months in the cases of De Jong and Zechel, were otherwise appropriate. Subject only to De Jong succeeding in the separate challenge he mounts to the way in which the sentencing judge dealt with his subjective circumstances, if the objective seriousness of the offending is as grave as the Crown submitted on the appeal, it may follow that no lesser sentence is warranted in law such that each of the appeals would be dismissed.
	
	
	The applicants’ counsel relied upon a representative number of cases involving breaches of s 112(3) of the Crimes Act objectively much graver than the offence for which the applicants were sentenced but which attracted sentences less severe than that imposed upon the applicants, and in some cases markedly so. There are other cases to which the Court was referred where what appears to be offending of comparable seriousness has attracted sentences markedly less severe than those imposed in this case, including some cases where the offending was aggravated by being committed whilst on conditional liberty and where the offender or offenders had records for violence. The cases to which the Court was referred include sentences imposed both before and after the introduction of Part 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The applicants’ counsel accepted the limitations on the use that can be made of extrinsic material when challenging a sentence as manifestly excessive (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]). They submitted, however, that in this case, when the whole of the circumstances that have informed sentences in the cases to which the Court was referred for both comparable and more serious offending are examined, the conclusion is inescapable that the sentences imposed on the applicants were manifestly excessive, that is, demonstrably “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. The same authorities are relied upon in support of the ground of appeal that identifies patent error in the sentencing judge categorising the offending as approaching a worst case.
	


Was there error in the assessment that the offending was or approached a worst case?


	
	The determination of whether a case is in the worst category of offending, or approaching the worst case category relative to the particular offence under consideration, is undertaken on the basis that there are no specific criteria applying to the assessment. Rather, it depends upon an evaluation of the particular features of the offence under consideration, as established by the evidence, including any aggravating features required to be taken into account as a matter of law.
	
	
	In Little v R [2010] NSWCCA 210 at [31], where that principle was recently restated, Hall J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Simpson J agreed) endorsed the correctness of the approach to whether a case is in a worst case category as requiring the identification of particular features of the offending of very grave heinousness and the absence of factors mitigating the seriousness of the offending, as distinct from subjective features of the offender which might operate in mitigation of sentence. The Court went on to say:
	


… In cases of violence, the effects of the offence upon the victim or victims in terms of physical injury and consequent impairment and disability and emotional and psychological consequences are to be considered.


	
	Section 112(1) of the Crimes Act provides:
	


112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence

(1) A person who:

(a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or

(b) being in any dwelling-house or other building commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the dwelling-house or other building,

is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years.


	
	Circumstances of aggravation capable of constituting a breach of s 112(2) are defined in s 105A(1) as follows:
	


circumstances of aggravation means circumstances involving any one or more of the following:

(a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument,

(b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons,

(c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person,

(d) the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person,

(e) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty,

(f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.


	
	The offence for which each of the applicants were sentenced involved multiple offenders (ss (b)), some of whom were armed with weapons (ss (a)), who entered the victims home knowing persons were present (ss (f)), and where at least one offender inflicted corporal violence (ss (c)).
	
	
	At the time the offence was committed by these applicants, the circumstances of special aggravation capable of constituting a s 112(3) offence were defined in s 105A(1) as follows:
	


circumstances of special aggravation means circumstances involving either or both of the following:

(a) the alleged offender wounds or intentionally or recklessly inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person,

(b) the alleged offender is armed with a dangerous weapon. In considering the number of aggravating or specially aggravating factors present is necessary to consider the severity of those factors both individually and in combination.

(The Crimes Amendment (Reckless Infliction of Harm) Act 2012 (NSW) amended the definition following Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119.)


	
	In this case, the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending for which each of the applicants was sentenced, including whether it could properly be described as close to or approaching the worst case category (a matter the sentencing judge raised directly with counsel for each of the applicants), had to be considered in the context of an offence which covers a diverse range of offending. The objective seriousness of a breach of s 112(3) will necessarily vary depending first upon the particular serious indictable offence nominated in the charge as the offence committed after the premises were broken into and entered and the maximum penalty provided for that offence. For example, larceny (the serious indictable offence involved here) is punishable by a term of 5 years while sexual assault and other offences of violence, also serious indictable offences for the purpose of the section, provide greater maximum penalties. The circumstances of special aggravation, and in any particular case the interplay of other aggravating or mitigating factors, are also relevant considerations in an assessment of objective seriousness. Those same factors may, in a given case, also justify a finding of offending in a worst case category where the features of the offending are extremely grave with nothing to mitigate them.
	
	
	Similar observations in the context of assessing the objective seriousness of offending against s 112(2) were made by Simpson J in R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [27] and by Howie J in Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [34]-[37], observations which apply equally in the context of offending against s 112(3) providing for a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment for the specially aggravated form of the s 112(1) offence.
	
	
	In Gray v R [2007] NSWCCA 366 at [28], also in the context of the Court considering a severity appeal for an offence against s 112(2), Adams J emphasised the importance of differentiating between offences committed in breach of s 112(2) where force is used and those where actual injuries were inflicted. Again, those observations are of equal application when sentencing for a breach of s 112(3).
	
	
	It is clear that a breach of s 112(3), which requires proof that the offence was committed in circumstances of special aggravation, may involve wounding or the intentional or reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm, in addition to the offender being armed with a dangerous weapon. In this case, the circumstance of special aggravation was limited to the fact that the offenders (or one or more of them) were armed with a dangerous weapon.
	
	
	The offence also involved aggravating factors (not amounting to circumstances of aggravation or special aggravation), including that the offence was committed in the victims’ home, in the presence of children and involved multiple victims in the sense that the adult occupants were threatened with physical violence: see ss 21A(2)(ea), (eb) and (m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (although the sentencing judge did not refer to the statutory features of aggravation in s 21A in such terms).
	
	
	The sentencing judge did not undertake any analysis of the applicants’ offending, either referable to the constituent elements of the offence as particularised in the charge or as established by the evidence, preferring, it appears, to support the finding of offending approaching the worst case of a home invasion at a level of considerable generality, describing the offenders’ behaviour as “serious, violent and terrifying conduct in the presence of young children”. Although his Honour referred to the fact that there was what he described as “limited actual violence”, he went on to say:
	


… but, as I hope to have made clear, the intense fear that must have been occasioned in the residence of the home (sic) that morning is enormous.


	
	Without minimising the seriousness of the offence for which each of the offenders were to be sentenced (and noting that counsel did not submit that the gravity of the offending was anything but serious), in characterising the offending as a “home invasion” it follows that it involved breaking and entering a private residence. Given the fact that the applicants, or some of them, were armed when they broke into the home in the early morning, and that his Honour found the offence was planned, it is unsurprising that the occupants, roused from sleep and confronted by the armed intruders, would be terrified and that the terror would mount as repeated demands were made to produce drugs or money that were not available to be surrendered, some threats being made at gunpoint. What distinguished this case from others to which the Court was referred on the appeal, some of which were found to be at or above mid-range offending, was that no violence was inflicted and no physical or psychological injury was inflicted. In my view, for his Honour to have described the offending in these circumstances as close to or approaching a worst case was an error. The evidence did not support that finding. It is an error which has infected the sentencing judge’s fact finding exercise and his Honour’s approach to the assessment of worst case offending. For that reason, the sentence is properly reviewable by this Court (see AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 339 at [40] and [55]).
	
	
	Neither sentencing statistics nor past sentencing decisions fix a range within which a sentence might or should fall. Sentences imposed in other cases do not dictate whether a sentence under challenge is beyond the exercise of a permissible sentencing discretion, although they may inform that question (see Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [28] and [41]). I am satisfied, however, that the primary ground of appeal advanced by each of the applicants (that their sentences were manifestly excessive) is amply demonstrated by a review of sentences imposed in other cases of home invasion reflected in the attached schedule. In particular, Shrikantharajah v R [2012] NSWCCA 209 and Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259; 215 A Crim R 208 are both cases where offending of an objectively much graver kind has attracted sentences of markedly less severity.
	
	
	Despite the seriousness of the offending, which I would assess as less than mid-range, principally because no actual violence, as distinct from threats of violence, was inflicted, no serious injury suffered and there is no evidence of trauma suffered by the children, the sentences imposed on each of the applicants, including the imposition of non-parole periods that exceeded the standard non-parole period, were so excessive as to be “unreasonable or plainly unjust”.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Before turning to the question of re-sentence, it is necessary to refer to the ground of appeal advanced by De Jong that the sentencing judge minimised the impact of his dysfunctional upbringing and his exposure and addiction to drugs from a very early age. While the weight to be attached to those matters would ordinarily need to be considered as part of the evidence on re-sentence, supplemented by any material capable of further informing his subjective circumstances at this time, the material upon which his counsel relied on re-sentence included a report from Dr Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, a report that was not before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Dr Furst reported that De Jong had an unstable and “unfortunate” childhood and noted alcohol and drug use by one or both of De Jong’s parents during his childhood. He also noted De Jong’s history of learning difficulties and that he had been diagnosed with ADHD at age 10 or 11. As to the applicant’s drug and alcohol use, he noted that he commenced using cannabis around the age of 9, graduating to amphetamines and alcohol in his early twenties. Dr Furst also noted the trauma that De Jong suffered following the injury to his foot when he was aged 15. Dr Furst reported that De Jong did not present with any clinical indicators of a major mental illness or psychosis. However, he presented with a “simple manner” and was not very expansive under questioning, which, in Dr Furst’s view, raised the possibility that he suffers from a mild intellectual disability.
	
	
	Dr Furst also reported that the neglect De Jong suffered as a child predisposed him to developing a conduct disorder as he progressed through adolescence. Nonetheless, he was of the view that the primary clinical concerns that De Jong presented with on assessment relate to an unstable personality structure, drug dependence and adjustment issues in custody. Dr Furst recommended that De Jong remain under the supervision of mental health services administered by Justice Health, that he continue to take the anti-depressant medication prescribed to him and undertake treatment for substance abuse.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, were this Court to find error and move to re-sentence, De Jong’s sentence should be remitted to the District Court in order that the issues relating to his mental functioning might be further explored and in order that the Crown might make, in that forum, an informed decision as to the ultimate position it should take in sentencing submissions. I regard that as the appropriate course.
	


Evidence led on re-sentence by Mr Zechel and Mr Tuimaualuga

Mr Zechel


	
	An affidavit from the applicant, dated 9 April 2014, annexing a psychological report from Ms Rima Nasser, dated 14 March 2014, was read without objection. In the affidavit, the applicant deposed to having been continuously employed in positions of trust and responsibility during his time in custody and having completed a number of numeracy and literary courses. He had commenced a drug rehabilitation program but was unable to complete it as the convenor left that position. He is currently on a waiting list to resume that program and other programs directed to his adjustment on his release to parole.
	
	
	The psychological report from Ms Nasser included a detailed history based on what the applicant told her during his assessment interview. In Ms Nasser’s opinion, neither Zechel’s history nor his presentation indicated an entrenched proclivity for violence or aggression, nor did he appear inherently anti-social. In her view, his substance abuse and gambling problems have resulted in poor impulse control (contributing to his offending behaviour). Ms Nasser reported that the applicant has average intellectual functioning and described his offending behaviour as best understood within the context of a hedonistic lifestyle. She also reported that he was motivated to participate in psychological and substance abuse intervention programs, and recommended that he be treated by a psychologist to assist him in managing stress with a view to his long-term rehabilitation.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated insight into his offending, having acknowledged the terror that must have been experienced by the victims and is ashamed of his participation in inflicting that terror. Ms Nasser reported that he expressed remorse and empathy for the victims, which I accept as genuine.
	


Mr Tuimaualuga


	
	An affidavit from the applicant, dated 22 August 2014, was read without objection on re-sentence, in which he deposed to his willingness and desire to address his “core mental health issues” and, in particular, issues relating to his drug and alcohol dependency. The applicant stated that, on the recommendation of a psychologist from Justice Health, he had commenced a course of anti-depressant medication, which has assisted him in reducing his anxiety and in addressing his depression. He also raised concerns about the limited access he believes he would have to psychologists and intervention programs whilst in custody.
	


Mr Puru


	
	No evidence was provided in the case of re-sentence in respect of Puru.
	


Decision on re-sentence


	
	Counsel did not submit that this Court should attempt to differentiate between the criminal conduct of any of the three applicants for the purposes of re-sentence (or, for that matter, the criminal conduct of the applicant De Jong, whose matter is to be remitted to the District Court). Neither did any counsel seek to urge upon the Court that the subjective circumstances of their client (individually by the evidence led on re-sentence in the cases of Zechel and Tuimaualuga) should, relative to any co-offender, attract greater weight in the ultimate assessment of an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	That does not relieve this Court of undertaking that exercise as part of the instinctive synthesis of all matters material to the appointment of an appropriate sentence. Some features of the subjective cases of each of the applicants, notably their favourable prospects of rehabilitation, which if not specifically accounted for in the finding of special circumstances by the sentencing judge well support a finding of special circumstances in the re-sentencing exercise. While there are other features of the applicants’ subjective circumstances which differ, for example some differences in their ages and criminal antecedents, I do not consider they warrant being reflected in any difference in the undiscounted sentences.
	
	
	I also note that the offence for which the applicants are to be re-sentenced carries a standard non-parole period of 7 years, which, together with the maximum penalty of 25 years operates as a statutory guidepost. In this case, I propose a departure from the standard non-parole period given my finding that the offending conduct falls below the mid-range of offending in conformity with the comparative cases in the attached schedule.
	
	
	After allowing for a 25 per cent for the plea of guilty in the case of Puru and Zechel, and 10 per cent in the case of Tuimaualuga who pleaded guilty proximate to the date of trial, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The appeals of each of William John Zechel, Tahi Paul Puru, Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga and Daniel Warren De Jong be allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed in the District Court in respect of the charge laid under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act be quashed and in respect of William John Zechel, Tahi Paul Puru and Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga, the following sentences be imposed:
	



	
	William John Zechel: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 20 September 2012 and to expire on 19 March 2017, with a balance term of 3 years to expire on 19 March 2020.
	
	
	Tahi Paul Puru: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 8 July 2012 and to expire on 7 January 2017, with a balance term of 3 years to expire on 7 January 2020.
	
	
	Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months to commence on 21 November 2011 and to expire on 13 April 2017, with a balance term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 20 November 2020.
	



	
	Direct that the matter in respect of Daniel Warren De Jong be remitted to the District Court for re-sentencing in accordance with these reasons.
	



	
	After the reasons of the Court were published, the Court’s attention was drawn to an error with respect to the expiration date of the non-parole period and the total term for Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga in the orders of the Court made on 13 March 2015. This was the result of a calculation error. The non-parole period should expire on 20 March 2017, not 13 April 2017, and the balance of term should expire on 20 October 2020, not 20 November 2020. Accordingly, order 2(c) made on 13 March 2015 is vacated. Order 2(c) will now read:
	


Billy Pusa Tuimaualuga: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months to commence on 21 November 2011 and to expire on 20 March 2017, with a balance term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 20 October 2020.

		24 March 2015",2015-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766080,KG v R [2015] NSWCCA 33,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The applicant has been charged with a number of sexual assault offences relating to her three daughters and one count of concealing a serious indictable offence in relation to one of those daughters (the principal complainant). The allegations against the applicant include instructing the principal complainant how to engage in sexual intercourse with her father (to “make noises” when her father had sexual intercourse with her and, on a separate occasion, how to use her tongue to make her father’s penis erect); as well as a number of acts of indecency; aggravated acts of indecency; aggravated indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant is also charged with aggravated acts of indecency against the principal complainant’s two sisters, relating to incidents where it is alleged that the applicant demonstrated an act of masturbation in front of her three daughters and instructed them to perform acts of masturbation on themselves.
	
	
	The applicant’s co-accused is her husband, the children’s father. He has been charged with a considerably larger number of sexual assault offences relating to the principal complainant, as well as a number of sexual assault offences relating to one of the principal complainant’s sisters, and a charge of detaining the principal complainant for advantage in circumstances of aggravation. The co-accused’s alleged conduct relating to the principal complainant includes violent and sadistic acts. For example, 22 of the 73 charges against the co-accused in relation to the principal complainant, involve penetration of the principal complainant’s vagina, and on one occasion her anus, with various implements. The Crown does not allege that the applicant had knowledge of, or was party to, the use by the co-accused of the implements nor of the other violent acts alleged against him, although it will adduce evidence that the applicant was aware that the co-accused was “disciplining” the principal complainant in the “chook shed”, this being the place where many of the sadistic and violent incidents are said to have taken place, and that she was aware that on occasion the principal complainant was absent from the house for one or more nights.
	
	
	The joint trial of the applicant and the co-accused is listed to commence on 13 July 2015 in the District Court in Sydney.
	
	
	On 16 September 2014, Christie ADCJ refused an application by the applicant for a separate trial from that of the co-accused. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), from that decision. An extension of time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal is also sought.
	
	
	The Crown does not oppose the extension of time sought but does oppose the grant of leave to appeal from his Honour’s interlocutory order. The Crown maintains that the applicant has not shown any error warranting appellate intervention in the House v The King sense (see: [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 to 505).
	


Background


	
	The background of this matter can be gleaned largely from the above introduction.
	
	
	The conduct with which the co-accused has been charged relates to incidents of a sexual nature which are alleged to have occurred between 1997 and 2011. The principal complainant has alleged that, from the age of five, her father sexually assaulted her, commencing with acts of digital and penile intercourse, fellatio and later cunnilingus. She also has alleged that, from about the age of eight, her father sexually assaulted her with implements, by inserting in her vagina, and on one occasion her anus, certain tools. There are also allegations made by the principal complainant of violent behaviour by the co-accused at a creek on the property in which the family lived. The co-accused has also been charged with sexual offences against one of the principal complainant’s two sisters, relating to conduct occurring when the father gave her massages. No violent or sadistic conduct is complained of by this complainant.
	
	
	The sexual conduct alleged against the applicant is said to have occurred between 2001 and 2009. The alleged conduct involves the physical demonstration of, and giving instructions as to, masturbation to all three of the daughters. The complaints made by the principal complainant go further and involve the applicant giving her instruction as to how to pleasure her father sexually, how to fellate her father and how sexual intercourse was meant to feel (involving the applicant touching the principal complainant’s clitoris and digitally penetrating her vagina), as well as conduct by the applicant touching the outside of the principal complainant’s vagina.
	
	
	Three of the counts charged against the applicant (counts 53, 54 and 57) related to an incident in December 2004 when it is alleged that both of the accused sexually assaulted the principal complainant. This is the only incident where it is alleged that both the accused were present and involved in the conduct of which complaint was made.
	
	
	At the time of the application for a separate trial, there were 104 substantive counts, of which the co-accused was charged with 88 counts and the applicant was charged with 16 counts. There were also 28 statutory alternative charges in that indictment. The Crown has since amended the indictment to remove the 28 statutory alternative charges and certain other counts. On the amended indictment, the co-accused remains charged with 87 counts of a sexual nature and the applicant with 15 counts of a sexual nature. The principal complainant is the subject of 85 counts. To avoid confusion, where reference is made in these reasons to particular counts, the reference is to those counts as numbered in the indictment as it was before Christie ADCJ at the time of the separate trial application.
	


Basis of application for separate trial


	
	The applicant has sought a separate trial on the basis that she will suffer prejudice in circumstances where, it is submitted, the jury will be overwhelmed by the prosecution case against the co-accused and will seek to use the significant body of evidence which is available to corroborate the case against the co-accused in order to find against the applicant. In this regard, emphasis is placed on the recognition that sexual cases are particularly likely to arouse prejudice against which a direction to the jury is unlikely to guard (see De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; (1986) 22 A Crim R 375 at 378).
	
	
	The applicant submits that each of the three circumstances in which Hunt J (as his Honour then was) recognised (in R v Middis, (Supreme Court (NSW), 27 March 1991, unrep)) that a separate trial would usually be ordered is applicable in this case.
	
	
	First, it is submitted that the evidence against the applicant is significantly weaker than, and different from, that admissible against the co-accused. The applicant points to the Crown’s concession that evidence of the use of tools is inadmissible against the applicant; and notes that it is not alleged that the applicant was aware of the alleged violent and sadistic acts of the co-accused or party to them.
	
	
	The applicant points to the evidence that the Crown intends to adduce which is capable of corroborating the account of events given by the principal complainant as against the co-accused, including: expert medical opinion as to injury or damage to her hymen; handwriting analysis in respect of particular diary entries made by her; scientific evidence and various video recordings of the location where the alleged offences were committed by the father, as well as the discovery of particular implements on the property where the principal complainant said she had hidden tools used by the co-accused. Reference is also made to a pre-text telephone call between the second complainant and the co-accused in which the applicant submits the co-accused made significant admissions against interest in respect of the alleged sexual offences against the second complainant, the making of which would not be admissible against the applicant.
	
	
	Second, it is submitted that the evidence of violent and sadistic acts by the co-accused is material that is highly prejudicial to the applicant but not admissible against her.
	
	
	In this regard, the applicant points to the evidence of sexual violence by the co-accused that it is said has no probative value in her trial. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the only counts of a sexual nature charged on the indictment in which it is alleged that the applicant aided or acted in concert with the co-accused are count 16 (in which it is alleged that the applicant was an accessory before the fact to her husband’s conduct by instructing her to “make noises” when her father had sexual intercourse with her to “make it better” for both the principal complainant and the father) and counts 53, 54 and 57 (which relate to the incident in December 2004 involving both of the accused).
	
	
	Reliance is also placed on the fact that the alleged offences of the co-accused extend over a longer period (1997 – 2011) than those of the applicant (2001 – 2009) and that the applicant was absent from the home when many of the offences alleged against the co-accused were said to have been committed.
	
	
	Third, it is submitted that the Crown case against the applicant is weaker than against the co-accused and there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.
	
	
	It is submitted that the giving of a direction to the jury as to the impermissible use against the applicant of the evidence accepted as not being admissible against her would not be sufficient to overcome the prejudice to her by reason of that evidence being before the jury (citing Verma v R (1987) 30 A Crim R 441). Indeed, the applicant contends that the Crown’s contention that the issue of prejudice can be dealt with by directions to the jury because the complaints against the applicant are distinct and can be compartmentalised, reveals the flaw in the Crown’s argument that any break in the nexus between the respective offences would render the case against the applicant unintelligible.
	


His Honour’s reasons


	
	His Honour gave ex tempore reasons for his refusal to order separate trials. In those reasons, his Honour had regard to the authorities on which the applicant relied and to the principles articulated therein (such as R v Middis; De Jesus v The Queen and Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292).
	
	
	His Honour did not accept that the Crown case against the applicant was significantly weaker than that against the co-accused, though he accepted that it was considerably less in volume. Rather, his Honour considered that the central issue in the trial of the applicant was very likely to be the credibility of the complainants (and, to a large extent, the principal complainant).
	
	
	His Honour rejected as “totally wrong” the submission made by the applicant that, in a joint trial, the vast majority of the evidence to be adduced at the trial would be admissible only against the co-accused and that there was only a small amount of one complainant’s evidence that was admissible against both accused. His Honour also rejected as “totally wrong” the applicant’s submission that separate trials would not necessitate the repetition of evidence by the complainants “to a great extent” (the applicant having accepted only that separate trials would necessitate the repetition of some evidence by one of the complainants; and that not to a great extent).
	
	
	His Honour noted that the Crown had made it clear that the Crown did not claim that the applicant had anything to do with the “atrocious” acts alleged against the co-accused and recognised that there would need to be a direction from the trial judge that the Crown did not suggest that the applicant was party to any of the violent and sadistic acts alleged to have been committed by the co-accused.
	
	
	His Honour said that the only evidence not admissible against the applicant was the evidence of “these dreadful and atrocious acts in the shed and down by the creek and other places” but went on to comment that there were some occasions on which the applicant must have known that some sort of discipline was being enforced upon the principal complainant because the principal complainant had complained on one occasion she was dragged through the kitchen out to the shed, and there were other occasions where the inference might be drawn that the applicant may at least have known that the principal complainant was the subject of some disciplinary action, at the hands of the co-accused (though not necessarily of a sexual nature).
	
	
	His Honour also considered the inconvenience to the witnesses, particularly to the principal complainant, of a separation of the trials. In that respect, his Honour had regard to what was said by Toohey J in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41, as to the competing considerations of prejudice, additional court time and expense incurred by separate trials; the undesirability of inconsistent verdicts, the need to achieve finality; and the convenience of witnesses.
	
	
	His Honour noted the Crown’s submission to the effect that inconvenience and emotional trauma would accompany an order for separate trials, the principal complainant having had ongoing issues in relation to her mental health. His Honour accepted that it was undeniable that there was a factual commonality between a number of the offences and said that the necessity to adduce evidence of the fact, or at least part of the history, of sexual assaults by the co-accused as context evidence was indisputable.
	
	
	His Honour was not prepared (and said his conscience would not allow him) to require the principal complainant to give evidence before two juries. His Honour therefore declined to order a separate trial.
	


Consideration of application for leave to appeal


	
	The decision by his Honour not to order a separate trial was one that involved an evaluative exercise. His Honour was required to (and did) assess and balance the risk of prejudice to the applicant if she were not to have a separate trial against considerations of the kind referred to in R v Demirok [1976] VR 244, including that it is against the interests of justice that there be inconsistent verdicts and the convenience of the witnesses.
	
	
	For this Court to intervene in relation to such a decision, error in the House v The King sense must be established: namely, that his Honour erred in his application of the law; made a material error of fact; or took into account an irrelevant consideration or failed to take into account a relevant consideration; or that the decision was so unreasonable or plainly unjust as to bespeak error of such a kind. The only “errors” identified by the applicant on the present application were those that it is said his Honour made in rejecting the submissions referred to at [22] above.
	
	
	Whether or not there was a degree of overstatement in the rejection of those particular submissions as “totally” wrong, the basis on which his Honour rejected those submissions was not wrong in principle, nor was it unreasonable. The case against both accused must inevitably turn largely on the credibility of the complainants – and, in particular, the principal complainant. Much of the evidence going to the history of sexual abuse will be admissible (and will inevitably be sought to be adduced) on the trial of the charges against the applicant. Such evidence is clearly necessary to put in context the offences charged against the applicant.
	
	
	Count 16, for example, requires there to be evidence of the previous sexual acts by the co-accused in relation to the principal complainant to render explicable what would otherwise seem on its face to be wholly implausible – a mother instructing her daughter on how to make sexual intercourse between the daughter and her father better for both of them. So too would such evidence be relevant to explain the daughter’s acquiescence in the conduct of the father the subject of count 17 (in which the co-accused is charged with sexually assaulting the complainant on 31 December 2000).
	
	
	The Crown submits that the history of sexual acts counters the improbability that a mother would, all of a sudden, encourage her daughter to engage in sexual intercourse with her father. Implicit in the applicant’s alleged conduct the subject of counts 16, 29 and 70 is an awareness by the applicant that there was or had been some sexual intercourse between father and daughter in the past. It is submitted that the mother is unlikely to have made the suggestion to the complainant unless she knew that the principal complainant and her father had previously engaged in sexual conduct and hence that this evidence is relevant to a jury’s assessment of the complainant’s credit, in particular, to her apparent submission to the acts and instructions of her mother in the absence of complaint.
	
	
	Similarly, it is submitted that the discussion that the principal complainant says she had with the applicant later in the same night that the alleged offence the subject of count 21 occurred, links the conduct alleged against the applicant in count 16 and the co-accused in 21 (count 21 is of sexual intercourse of the co-accused with the principal complainant when she was under 10). The alleged discussion is one in which the principal complainant says she asked her mother whether her having made noises while the co-accused was sexually assaulting her would have made it better for the co-accused, and stated that she did not enjoy sexual acts with the co-accused; and says that the applicant then told her she would demonstrate to her how sexual intercourse was meant to feel, touched the principal complainant’s clitoris and digitally penetrated the principal complainant’s vagina.
	
	
	The Crown rejects the suggestion by the applicant that context evidence could be led simply by the principal complainant giving evidence that her father had been molesting her since she was five years’ old. Given that the principal complainant’s credibility is critical for the acceptance of that evidence, the suggestion by the applicant that evidence of the history of the sexual assaults by the co-accused would not be led in a separate trial against the applicant cannot be accepted.
	
	
	Similarly, the conduct in count 70 (that the applicant told the complainant to use her tongue in order to make her father’s penis erect and said “Is that what you do when Dad’s penis isn’t hard?”) requires the history of the co-accused’s sexual offences to be put in evidence in order to provide an explicable context for the alleged offence.
	
	
	Again, evidence of the sexual offences by the father must be relevant and admissible to place in context the conduct alleged in count 29 (that the applicant explained and demonstrated to the principal complainant with her tongue how to make a penis erect).
	
	
	Yet again, proof of counts 53, 54 and 57 (the December 2004 incident) which are related to counts against the co-accused (counts 50, 52 and 56), will require context evidence to render explicable the principal complainant’s acquiescence and compliance with her parents’ directions.
	
	
	The Crown also points to count 126 (which charges the applicant with an act of concealing a serious indictable offence) proof of which it submits will require the totality of the evidence relating to the charge against the father, as well as evidence of the history of assaults by the father, to explain his conduct and his attempt to keep the principal complainant quiet.
	
	
	The Crown submits that it is important to give the whole picture of the evidence so that the jury is not left with doubt as to the principal complainant’s failure to complain of the abuse or question why the principal complainant remained at the home.
	
	
	It is apparent from the above that the conclusions his Honour reached (to the effect that there would be a volume of evidence involving the father’s conduct that would be admissible as context evidence in the mother’s trial and that there would be a need for substantial repetition by the principal complainant of evidence as to the history of the sexual assaults if the trials were to be separated) were neither unfounded nor unreasonable.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, erred as to the facts, or failed to take into account any material considerations. Nor is the refusal to order separate trials unreasonable or plainly unjust in the sense that it bespeaks error of some such kind.
	
	
	Insofar as reference is made as to the emotive description by the experienced trial judge of the alleged offences (his Honour describing them as atrocious) and it is suggested that one could not expect a jury not to be similarly affected, strong directions can and would be expected to be given to the jury so as to quarantine the counts of sexual violence (such as those given by Bell J when her Honour was then sitting in the Supreme Court in Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62). This may be a case where an appropriate course would be to sum up to the jury and have the jury deliberate first on the charges against the applicant before dealing separately with the charges against the co-accused. In any event, there is no error shown in relation to his Honour’s conclusion that in this case the prejudice to the applicant occasioned by the joint trial is one that can be addressed by appropriate directions.
	


Conclusion


	
	There was no objection to the extension of time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal. Such leave should be granted. As the merits of the matter have been fully argued, the application for leave to appeal should be granted. No error on the part of Christie ADCJ in the exercise of his discretion has been demonstrated. The appeal should therefore be dismissed. The orders should be as follows:
	



	
	Grant leave to extend the time for filing of the application for leave to appeal to 23 October 2014.
	
	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Ward JA.

		21 November 2016",2015-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766081,R v Knight [2015] NSWCCA 34,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The respondent has been charged with one count of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and two counts of sexual assault contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, each relating to an incident involving a teenage girl (“T”), who alleged that she had been asleep in her boyfriend’s caravan when she woke to find the respondent assaulting her. She and the respondent were alone in the caravan at the time. His trial commenced on 3 November 2014 in the District Court at Griffith before Lerve DCJ.
	
	
	In advance of the trial, the Crown had served a tendency notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The tendency evidence identified in the notice comprised the evidence contained in five specified paragraphs of a statement by another, younger, teenage girl (“A”) deposing to an incident in which she said she had been asleep on a sofa after smoking some “cones” and had woken to find the respondent on top of her, kissing her and “pretty much smothering [her]”. There were other people in the house at the time but she did not think that there was anyone else in the room at the time she awoke to find the respondent on top of her.
	
	
	The respondent is facing a separate trial in relation to the alleged offences against A arising from that incident. At the time of the commencement of the trial involving the complainant T, the trial in relation to the complainant A had been listed to commence on 3 December 2014.
	
	
	The tendency sought to be proved by reference to A’s evidence is the accused’s “tendency to act in a particular way, namely to take the opportunity … indecently and sexually [to] assault teenage girls whilst they are vulnerable and unable to consent because they are asleep”.
	
	
	The respondent has also been charged with other sexual offences against two sisters, L and M. He was acquitted by a jury, after a trial before Lerve DCJ, of the charges relating to the complainant L. His trial in relation to the charges involving the complainant M has not yet been listed for hearing. No evidence from L or M (or their mother) is the subject of the tendency evidence sought to be adduced in the trial involving the complainant T.
	
	
	On the first day of the respondent’s trial, after hearing argument in the absence of the jury on the admissibility of the proposed tendency evidence, the trial judge ruled that the tendency evidence was admissible. His Honour had queried during the course of argument whether the proposed use of the tendency evidence of A was a backdoor way of having a joint trial in relation to the allegations involving both T and A, but his Honour concluded that the fact that it was alleged by two teenage girls that the respondent had acted in a similar way gave the evidence substantial probative value and his Honour considered that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect, which his Honour articulated as being that the jury might conclude, think or reason that, because the accused had acted in that fashion on a previous occasion, he had acted in the fashion alleged by the Crown on this particular occasion.
	
	
	The following day (4 November 2014), considering a motion by the respondent to adjourn the trial involving T until after the conclusion of the trial involving A, his Honour said he would revisit the ruling made on 3 November 2014 and decided that, in the interests of justice, the tendency evidence should be excluded.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed from the ruling on 4 November 2014, pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Court’s jurisdiction is said to arise on the basis that this is a ruling on the admissibility of evidence which eliminates or substantially weakens its case against the respondent.  The Crown seeks orders from this Court to the effect that the evidence is admissible as tendency evidence.
	


The respective rulings


	
	His Honour accepted, on 3 November 2014, and did not the following day resile from this conclusion, that the evidence of A had significant probative value. The Crown’s submission had been that the probative value lay in the manner of assault or modus operandi of the respondent, namely that each of the two girls was asleep and hence unable to consent at the time of the alleged offences. (A, of course, was not old enough to consent even had she been awake at the time.)
	
	
	The respondent conceded on the application before Lerve DCJ that the evidence had probative value but submitted that it did not have significant probative value, pointing to: the lack of connection between the facts of the matters; that the incidents were some three years apart; that there was a difference in the ages of the complainants (T was 16 at the time of the alleged offences against her; A was 13); that there was a difference in the conduct complained of (there being no penetration in the case of A); and inconsistencies in the accounts given by A of the events involving her.
	
	
	In ruling on the application, his Honour referred to what was said by Campbell JA (with whom Howie and Rothman JJ agreed) in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; (2009) 201 A Crim R 451, namely that all that a tendency need to be, to fall within the chapeau to s 97(1)of the Evidence Act, is a tendency to act in a particular way, even if that tendency had not been shown to be manifest on very many occasions.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and for that reason ruled that the evidence was admissible. His Honour also observed that very careful directions would need to be given about the use of the evidence.
	
	
	What followed his Honour’s ruling was that the respondent’s Counsel then foreshadowed an application for an adjournment of the trial involving T - on the basis that it involved proof before the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, of the matters involving A, and placed the accused in an impossible position affecting his fundamental right to silence. Such an application was formally made the following day.
	
	
	On that occasion, the respondent indicated that, in the forthcoming trial involving the alleged offences against A, there would be in issue a question of identification; a question of complaint and a question as to the surrounding circumstances of the alleged offence. The respondent argued that adducing the tendency evidence of A in the trial involving T would compromise his right to silence in the forthcoming trial involving A because, if he felt compelled to give evidence in the first trial (and no election to do so had been made by that stage), then any evidence he gave would be admissible in the subsequent trial.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept the submission that any evidence the respondent chose to give in the T trial would necessarily be admissible in trial involving A. The Crown indicated that its position was that it would not be permissible for the Crown simply to tender in the trial concerning A whatever the respondent might say in the trial concerning T, assuming there was no admission made by the respondent at the first trial as to the conduct alleged against A.
	
	
	The respondent also raised a concern as to the issue of contamination or concoction. In A’s statement, though not in the paragraphs that the Crown had identified in the tendency notice, A referred to requests that had been made of her by the mother of L and M for her to make a statement as to the respondent’s conduct ([23]). In effect, it was submitted by counsel then appearing before his Honour that cross-examination of A as to the delay in making of her complaint to the authorities and the circumstances in which it was ultimately made (namely, in response to the request by the mother of L and M) would bring in issues that would not otherwise be before the jury in an unfair and prejudicial way (presumably there referring to the allegations made by L and M).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this issue was a red herring and that there could be no issue of concoction or contamination because there had been an earlier complaint made by A to a friend some twelve months before.
	
	
	His Honour indicated (at T 52.20) that it was the issue of contamination that had concerned him on 3 November 2014 and said that if the defence could persuade him that cross–examination of the mother of L and M would be inevitable, then he might be persuaded to revisit the ruling made the day before. His Honour made clear (at T 52.47) that this was the issue (i.e., contamination) that was exercising his mind at that stage.
	
	
	There was then some discussion as to why the defence would need to cross-examine the mother of L and M (who the Crown did not propose to call) in circumstances where there had been an earlier complaint as to the alleged assault by A.
	
	
	His Honour’s apparent concern, as articulated during the course of the debate (at T 65.20), was that the defence would be entitled to cross-examine A as to her motive for coming forward and to put to her that it was a false allegation; and that such cross-examination could give rise to difficulties. His Honour indicated that he was not persuaded that the defence would inevitably cross-examine the mother of L and M but considered that there was a more fundamental issue as to the potential cross-examination of A.
	


His Honour’s 4 November 2014 reasons


	
	In his Honour’s ex tempore reasons for his decision to reverse the ruling of the previous day, his Honour set out his understanding of the defence submissions to be: that the ruling had the effect of impacting significantly on the right to silence of the accused to the point where it was an abuse of process; that any evidence given by the accused in the trial relating to T would be admissible in the trial relating to the allegations brought by A; and that there was a very high prejudice to the accused because he would be compelled to give evidence not only to deny the allegations of T but also to deny the allegations of the tendency witness A. His Honour was not persuaded that the respondent’s argument, thus stated, had any validity whatsoever.
	
	
	His Honour then referred to the issue as to contamination. His Honour noted that there was evidence that would be led by the Crown to the effect that the tendency witness (A) had complained to a friend of hers at an earlier time but that there was no formal complaint to the authorities until 2012, after A had been approached by the mother of L and M.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept that it was inevitable that counsel for the accused must cross-examine the mother of L and M. However, his Honour did consider that it was tolerably plain that what had been alleged by A would be denied by the accused and that counsel would be entitled to put to A in cross-examination that it was a false complaint and to cross-examine A as to the reasons for delaying the official complaint to the authorities.
	
	
	His Honour considered that, on the face of it, the only reasonable interpretation that could be placed on [23] of A’s statement was that she had made the formal complaint about the conduct of the accused only in response to a number of requests by L and M’s mother, following disclosures by L and M in respect of the accused. His Honour said:
	


It follows from that, it seems to me, that to properly represent the interest of the accused, [counsel for the defence] would need to cross-examine [A] as to the reasons of her delaying any formal or official complaint. The Crown argues that that difficulty can be overcome by [A] giving evidence to the effect that she came forward after speaking to a friend. It is all very well to say that juries will be told not to speculate but that, it seems, to be leaving the evidence in an unsatisfactory position and it would ultimately, in my opinion, deprive the accused of an appropriate area of cross-examination of a witness, which would seem significant.


	
	His Honour noted that the admission of tendency evidence was in the nature of a discretion (referring in that context to what was said by Simpson J in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308). His Honour concluded that the interests of justice were such that he should revisit the ruling on admissibility and said:
	


… given what seems to me would be depriving an accused from a significant area and an important area of cross-examination of a significant witness, the interest of justice are such taken with other matters [which] cause[d] me some little disquiet or concern yesterday, I revisit my ruling and I exclude the evidence of tendency.


	
	It is tolerably clear, from what his Honour said in his ex tempore reasons, that his Honour was not there revisiting the conclusion that the tendency evidence had substantial probative value. His Honour did not expressly state a conclusion that the probative value of that evidence did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect of the evidence, although his Honour referred more than once to revisiting the ruling as to the tendency evidence which would have required consideration of that issue. His Honour’s invocation of the interests of justice seems to indicate that his Honour was there concluding that the evidence should be excluded under some general but not articulated discretion.
	
	
	Clearly what concerned his Honour was the impact that admission of the tendency evidence would have on the ability of defence counsel to cross-examine A as to the reason for the delay in making her formal complaint (or, perhaps, as to the motivation for the making of the formal complaint), in support of the proposition that the allegation by A was a false allegation.
	


Jurisdiction


	
	The Crown maintains that, although the evidence of T would be enough to establish the offence charged against the respondent, the case would be substantially weakened without the tendency evidence. It refers to R v Smith [2008] NSWCCA 247; (2008) 190 A Crim R 8 at [24] and R v GAC [2007] NSWCCA 315; (2007) 178 A Crim R 408 at [64]–[69].
	
	
	In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228, Spigelman CJ noted that even a case which is otherwise likely or very likely to succeed may be substantially weakened if evidence of cogency or force is withheld. His Honour said (at [40]) that the Court should determine whether a ruling on the admissibility of evidence substantially weakens the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted that evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury.
	
	
	The significant probative force that this evidence has must mean that the Crown case will be substantially weakened if it is excluded. The Court therefore has jurisdiction to determine the appeal.
	


Determination of appeal


	
	In Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136, Basten JA (with whom Fullerton and R A Hulme JJ agreed), noted that for this Court to intervene in relation to a ruling as to the admissibility of tendency evidence there must be shown to be an error in the House v The King sense ([1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 449 at 504 – 505), the decision of the trial judge as to whether or not the evidence is admissible being one based on an evaluative judgment bearing the characteristics of a discretionary exercise of power.
	
	
	That being the case, what the Crown must establish to warrant appellate intervention in the House v R sense is that his Honour erred in his application or understanding of a relevant principle of law; made a material error of fact; failed to take into account a relevant consideration or conversely took into account an irrelevant consideration; or that his ruling was unreasonable or unjust so as to bespeak error of that kind.
	
	
	No error was demonstrated in the manner in which his Honour dealt with the application to adduce tendency evidence on 3 November 2014. Nor was it submitted in this Court that it was not open to his Honour to revisit that interlocutory ruling.
	
	
	The relevant error, to which the Crown points as warranting appellate intervention, is as to the assessment by his Honour on 4 November 2014 of the asserted prejudice that would be occasioned to the respondent if the tendency evidence were to be admitted.
	
	
	The Crown maintains that it was not reasonably open for his Honour to determine that the proper interests of the accused required that A be cross-examined about the delay and motivation in making the official complaint to police and to conclude that if counsel for the accused did so cross-examine A then the jury would learn of other allegations, including the one of which the accused had been acquitted. It is submitted that his Honour’s conclusion in this regard was based on an unrealistic assessment of the asserted prejudice.
	
	
	The Crown submits that his Honour was required to assess the assertion of potential unfairness realistically. The Crown maintains that it clearly would not lead any evidence from A of her complaint to the mother of L and M and notes that it had not indicated any intention that the mother of L and M be called as a witness. It is submitted that if any explanation needed to be given as to the reason for the subsequent later report to police, after the complaint A had earlier made to a friend, it could be overcome by A giving evidence to the effect that she came forward after speaking to a friend.
	
	
	Further, the Crown submits that, given the absence of any evidence of concoction and the speculative state of the evidence, it could never be in the interests of the respondent to cross-examine A as to the motivation for the delayed official complaint (in circumstances where there had been a recent complaint years before giving her statement to the police) and that no competent counsel would explore such an area.
	
	
	The Crown maintains that there was nothing about the evidence of A sought to be tendered on the tendency application that made its potential for unfair prejudice incapable of being addressed by appropriate judicial direction.
	
	
	When the matter was before his Honour on 3 November 2014, the perceived prejudice to the accused was put in general terms. No submission was made prior to the initial ruling as to difficulties that might ensue in the cross-examination of A if the evidence were to be admitted. His Honour referred to the obvious prejudicial effect that the evidence might have on the reasoning of the jury namely that if the respondent had previously acted in this fashion it was likely that he would have acted in the way the Crown alleges he acted on the occasion involving T.
	
	
	In R v Ford, Campbell JA says (at [55]) that the difference between s 101 and s 137 in referring to prejudice is not one of substance. Similarly, in Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55, Hoeben CJ at CL considered that the concept of “prejudicial effect” for the purposes of the balancing exercise required by s 101 of the Evidence Act, is to be understood in substantially the same way as “unfair prejudice” (see [47]).
	
	
	At [48], his Honour noted three potential dangers of unfair prejudice in that case: first, that the jury would use the evidence in the way in which they were directed not to use it; second, that the jury would be so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the accused’s account and would disregard the directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner; and, third, that the jury might be disinclined to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt.
	
	
	At [49], his Honour noted that the danger of unfair prejudice had been variously described in the cases and went on to refer to R v Watkins [2005] NSWCCA 164; (2005) 153 A Crim R 434 at [50] (where Barr J referred to a real danger in that case that the jury’s recognition of the appellant’s prior guilt was likely to divert them from a proper consideration of the evidence) and R v GAC (where Giles JA at [83] referred to the primary danger as being that, notwithstanding any directions given by the trial judge, the jury might reason no more rationally than that if the respondent had molested others he did the same to the complainant and that emotion and not rationality would govern).
	
	
	In Saoud v R, Basten JA (at [59]) gave an indication of the kind of prejudicial effect that might be taken into account when carrying out the balancing exercise in s 101 of the Evidence Act in an applicable case:
	


This was not a case in which the allegations involved a form of deviant behaviour inherently likely to raise prejudice; it was not a case in which there were uncharged acts and a risk that the jury would not assess those acts thoroughly according to the criminal standard before taking the allegations into account; it was not a case where there was a plethora of facts, which might give rise to confusion or distraction from the primary issues. Finally, it was not a case in which there was any issue of collaboration or contamination of the complaints, which would need to be assessed by the jury before determining what weight they might give to the evidence.


	
	In the present case, his Honour had already taken into account what he considered to be the obvious prejudice of the jury applying impermissible tendency reasoning. This was not a case where there were uncharged acts; nor was it suggested that there was a plethora of facts that might cause confusion or distraction. It was not submitted that there were particular facts that gave rise to a risk of emotion infecting the jury’s decision-making process.
	
	
	The question of contamination or concoction was raised before his Honour (after the initial ruling that the evidence was admissible) and it was in relation to that aspect of the matter that his Honour expressed concern. If the issue was solely as to concoction or contamination that could have been tested on a voir dire of A’s evidence.
	
	
	His Honour’s concern related not to the probative value of the tendency evidence or its reliability as such but as to whether, if it were to be admitted, the defence would be deprived of a proper opportunity to cross-examine on the motivation for A to make a formal complaint to the authorities.
	
	
	His Honour accepted not only that the defence would inevitably wish to cross-examine A as to the delay in and motivation for, the making of her complaint to the authorities but also that this would prejudice the defence by bringing into the trial issues relating to the L acquittal. The latter does not necessarily follow.
	
	
	The legal basis on which his Honour reversed the 3 November 2014 conclusion is not clear. The respondent submits that although the precise statutory basis for the finding with respect to prejudice was not referred to in the ruling, it is clear that his Honour considered the further matters referred to in his judgment, in weighing the prejudicial effect under s 101 of the Evidence Act. Alternatively, the respondent submits that ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act would have provided a further basis for his Honour to consider whether the consequences in respect of the conduct of the trial flowing from a decision to admit the evidence or to reject the evidence on the basis of prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	As noted earlier, it is not clear that, in revisiting his earlier ruling, his Honour addressed the matters which were required to be balanced for the purposes of s 101 of the Evidence Act, taking into account the additional matters that the respondent had there raised. Error has therefore been shown. If his Honour was there reconsidering the balancing exercise that had earlier been carried out then, in having regard to a possible forensic decision of counsel as to the cross-examination of A about early complaint, he took into account an irrelevant consideration. It is not apparent that there was any relevant danger in admitting the five paragraphs of the statement identified in the tendency notice. Any danger of unfair prejudice would, on that hypothesis, arise from the forensic decision of the respondent’s Counsel as to the cross-examination of A and the answers she might or might not give.
	
	
	The difficulty in identifying the basis on which his Honour reversed his initial ruling on the tendency and coincidence evidence raises sufficient doubt as to his reasoning process to demonstrate error in the House v The King sense in relation to the ruling on 4 November 2014. What his Honour seems to have been doing on 4 November 2014 was not carrying out afresh the balancing exercise required by s 101 of the Evidence Act but, rather, was taking into account considerations that may or may not later become relevant depending on what particular course is taken by the respondent in relation to the cross-examination of A and what evidence is given by A.
	
	
	The conclusion that his Honour erred in so doing does not necessarily preclude argument, perhaps on the basis of an application to exclude particular evidence under ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act, at a later stage in the trial as to the admissibility of particular evidence. I note that in R v Nassif [2004] NSWCCA 433, Simpson J, with whom Adams J and Davidson AJ agreed, expressed the obiter view that, in a criminal proceeding where s 101 of the Evidence Act has been applied in relation to tendency and/or coincidence evidence, there is little if any further room for the operation of either ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act. Whether this is a case where room for the subsequent operation of either those sections might arise is a matter for argument perhaps at a later day. Nevertheless, it demonstrates why it is not appropriate for this Court to make a ruling that the evidence is admissible. If there were to be an application made on some other basis or at some later time to exclude part or all of that evidence during the course of the trial that would be a matter to be determined in the principled exercise of the trial judge’s discretion.
	
	
	Moreover, there is some suggestion that the Crown may seek to join the trial involving T and A, in which case other considerations may become relevant.
	
	
	The appropriate orders in my opinion are as follows:
	



	
	Allow the Crown’s appeal.
	
	
	Set aside the decision on 4 November 2014 to exclude the tendency evidence identified in the Crown’s tendency notice.
	



	
	This will have the effect that his Honour’s ruling of 3 November 2014 that the tendency evidence is admissible stands.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) appeals against a ruling made in the District Court at Griffith on 4 November 2014. The ruling, as recorded in the judgment, was to exclude evidence of tendency upon which the DPP proposed to rely.
	
	
	Section 5F(3A) permits an appeal by the DPP against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.
	
	
	No issue has been taken in the present appeal as to the capacity of the evidence substantially to weaken the prosecution case. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
	
	
	The relevant facts are set out in the judgment of Ward JA, with which I agree. For the purposes of these observations, the material facts may be stated briefly as follows:
	



	
	The respondent is charged with sexual offences against two women. Chronologically, the first offence is alleged to have been committed against a 13 year old girl (A) in 2010. Three offences are alleged to have been committed against a 16 year old girl (T) in 2013.
	
	
	There are some points of similarity in the circumstances in which the offences are alleged by the DPP to have been committed. Equally, there are some divergences.
	
	
	Trial dates had been fixed for separate trials of the allegations made by each complainant. The trial of the offences the subject of the allegations made by A was fixed to commence on 3 December 2014. (It was originally fixed to commence at the Wagga Wagga District Court on 12 May 2014, but was not reached.)
	
	
	The trial of the charges the subject of the allegations made by T was fixed to commence (and did in fact commence) in the District Court at Griffith on 3 November 2014.
	
	
	On 14 April 2014 the DPP served on the applicant’s solicitor a notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) of its intention to rely on tendency evidence in the trial concerning T’s allegations. The tendency evidence identified in the notice was drawn from the statement of A, concerning the offence she alleged had been committed against her.
	
	
	On 3 November 2014 a jury was empanelled. Following that, the issue of the admission of the proposed tendency evidence was canvassed.
	
	
	On the same day, the trial judge ruled that the tendency evidence would be admitted. He gave reasons. In the course of giving reasons, he made the necessary findings under s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	After his Honour had ruled, defence counsel sought adjournment of the trial. The basis for this application was said to be that the respondent was, by the ruling that the tendency evidence would be admitted, placed at a tactical disadvantage in the trial. The asserted tactical disadvantages were the subject of detailed debate the following day, 4 November. At an early stage, the trial judge indicated that he thought the application was “a back door method of asking me to revisit the ruling I made yesterday”.
	
	
	The discussion continued, with defence counsel continuing to maintain that admission of the tendency evidence would have an adverse effect on the manner in which he conducted the respondent’s defence, especially with respect to cross-examination of the tendency witness, A. It is unnecessary to go into the various assertions that were made.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the debate, the trial judge delivered judgment. He addressed the difficulties it was contended the respondent would encounter in the cross-examination of witnesses. His conclusion was expressed as:
	


“I revisit my ruling and I exclude the evidence of tendency.”


	
	The reasons for this determination are not clear. In particular, no findings were made concerning the issues posed by s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act. It is important to note that no application was made to his Honour to reverse the ruling he had made on 3 November. The application before him on 4 November was for adjournment of the trial of T’s allegations.
	
	
	That is sufficient, in my view, to warrant allowing the DPP’s appeal and setting aside the order of 4 November. So to order would restore the judgment and order of 3 November, that the tendency evidence was admissible.
	
	
	There is an additional reason for reaching the same conclusion. The statutory basis for the second ruling was not given and is not clear. But it is unlikely to have been the test required by s 97(1)(b) (which makes tendency evidence inadmissible unless the court thinks that the evidence, alone or in conjunction with other evidence, would have significant probative value). That is, in part, because the quality of the evidence had not changed overnight, from when his Honour made his first assessment; and from examination of the evidence from a realistic perspective, it must be concluded that its probative value was significant.
	
	
	That leaves the test required by s 101. It seems to me most likely that his Honour was persuaded by the argument that, notwithstanding that the evidence had significant probative value, that probative value did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. The prejudicial effect, so far as the rather diffuse argument put to his Honour can be understood, was that the applicant would be handicapped in his conduct of the trial concerning T’s allegations, in his cross-examination of A, particularly as to her motive for making her allegations at the time that she did (which was some time after the event).
	
	
	The DPP urged that this Court make an order that the evidence of A is admissible as tendency evidence in the trial of T’s allegations. That, in my opinion, would be an inappropriate exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction. The initial determination, of 3 November, was not the subject of any appeal or application for leave to appeal in this proceeding. The correctness or otherwise was not an issue in this Court. It has not been shown to have been affected by error.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Ward JA.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Ward JA and Simpson J.

2766096,R v AN (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 308,"Judgment


	
	On 19 December 2014 I delivered Remarks Sn sentence, citation R v AN (2014) NSWSC 1879, in which at paragraph [100] I, in effect, reserved the question of whether an order should be made under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	The proceedings were listed this morning for the purposes of dealing with an application for an order under that section.
	
	
	Since the remarks on sentence a report from Juvenile Justice has been produced dated 16 February 2015 which became Exhibit “F” in the sentence proceedings. The report was prepared by Stefanie Wong and Sarah Abusharif of Juvenile Justice NSW.
	
	
	Mr Spencer of counsel on behalf of the offender has submitted that the report provides an evidentiary basis for the making of an order under s 19(4)(b) of the Act. Whilst he acknowledged that the report does not expressly deal with the availability of educational programmes of the quality and nature referred to in Exhibit F in adult correctional institutions, he submitted that the evidence otherwise strongly supports the application and that the omission in the report to address the lastmentioned matter does not stand in the way of the making of an order for the offender’s continued detention in a juvenile detention centre.
	
	
	The Crown has in effect submitted that the above report is relevant to issues arising under s 19(4) and that the order sought may be made given that the evidentiary material is now supportive of the application and, further, that an inference can be drawn that the equivalent is not available in such an adult institution.
	
	
	The authors of Exhibit F interviewed the offender on three occasions, 6 January 2015, 28 January 2015 and on 13 February 2015. Exhibit F, is a very detailed report and I commend the authors of it for the diligence and speed with which they have produced a report of such quality.
	
	
	It indicates that the offender commenced attending the Girrakool school full-time on 21 January 2015 and that steps have been taken to have him admitted to the School for Higher School Certificate studies and, additionally, for him to be enrolled in a Diploma of Engineering course at a university by distance education. The nature of the schooling indicates that he will have available direct supervision of his work and there will be small pupil to teacher ratios, all of which I have no doubt are specially tailored for the education of juvenile offenders. Such education facilities are, I infer, different from those that would be available for a person of his age in an adult prison.
	
	
	Apart from the educational facility and associated arrangements that are now in place and operating for the offender, the report indicates that there are also specific therapeutic programmes that are available to assist the offender dealing with, amongst other things, issues designed to address the particular risks of re-offending that might otherwise exist. It is plain from the report that these therapeutic programmes are tailor-made and directed to assisting the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.
	
	
	The provisions of s 19 of the Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act place constraints on the making of orders for detention of offenders in juvenile institutions and an order cannot be made unless a finding of special circumstances supported by evidence is made under s 19(4). In this case the “special circumstances” are said to relate to the availability of the educational programmes to which I have referred as well as the vocational training. That would be sufficient to justify an order under s 19, although, as I have already noted, Exhibit F also refers to therapeutic programmes within the meaning of s 19(4) that are available to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender.
	
	
	Section 19(4A) states that a finding of special circumstances may not be made simply because of a person's youth. The evidence makes it clear that the offender does have special education needs as well as therapeutic needs in the sense to which I have already referred that require special, rather than ordinary, educational or vocational training that may not be available elsewhere. Unless his educational needs as identified in the evidence are met, his capacity to gain insight and re-integrate into the community in the future may not improve. Accordingly, it is desirable in this case that an order be made under s 19 where the evidence before the Court indicates that it ought be made in the interests of the community as well as the offender.
	
	
	I note a finding of special circumstances under s 19 does not permit an order to be made that goes beyond the offender's twenty-first birthday.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I make a finding of special circumstances; that is on the basis of the educational and vocational training and therapeutic programmes that are available and are suitable to meet the offender's needs in the institution where he is presently held. On that basis I make an order pursuant to s 19(1) and 19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 directing that the offender serve his non-parole period as a juvenile offender until the day upon which he attains the age of twenty-one years.
	
	
	In terms of sentencing the offender on that basis, it is my intention that he will be able to remain in a children's detention centre as a juvenile offender until the day he turns twenty-one whereupon he may be transferred to an adult prison.

		26 March 2015",2015-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766110,Council of the City of Sydney v Trico Constructions Pty Ltd [2015] NSWLEC 56,"Judgment


	
	Trico Constructions Pty Limited (‘Trico’) has pleaded guilty to an offence against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (‘EPA Act’) of carrying out development without consent. The development concerned was the demolition of part of a pressed metal ceiling in the mezzanine level of a listed heritage building in the Sydney Central Business District.
	
	
	A sentencing hearing has been held over the last two days. The Court’s task is to determine and impose an appropriate sentence for the offence. The prosecutor, the Council of the City of Sydney (‘the Council’), and Trico each also applied for an order for costs in their favour.
	


The facts of the offence


	
	Trico is a construction company that has been operating since 1999. It specialises in largely industrial, commercial and medium density construction projects and fit-outs in the Sydney area. It has undertaken a number of projects on heritage buildings.
	
	
	Around 10 September 2012, Trico was employed by George Group (Australia) Pty Limited (‘the George Group’) to undertake investigative works in Reid House located at 69-75 King Street, Sydney.
	
	
	The George Group had recently purchased Lot 5 in Reid House, which was the mezzanine level. At the time, Trico was employed by the George Group to undertake construction and fit-out works at a nearby building at 66 King Street, Sydney.
	
	
	In the week of 10 September 2012, Mr Patrick George of the George Group asked Mr Charles Mellick, a director of Trico, to undertake investigative works on the mezzanine level so that the George Group could appreciate the general condition of the premises to enable them to scope further works. The premises at that time had not been tenanted for about 10 years and were in a poor state.
	
	
	Mr Mellick attended the premises on 11 September 2012 and observed the mezzanine level. The mezzanine level had windows along the northern facade fronting King Street. Parallel to the northern facade were three rows of timber columns, with two columns in each row. The space between the windows and the first row was later designated as bay 1, the space between the first and second rows was designated bay 2, the space between the second and third rows was designated bay 3, and the space to the south of the third row was designated bay 4. There was a further space south of the wall designated as bay 5. Supported above each row of columns was a beam which had pressed metal cladding along the sides or fascia of the beam.
	
	
	On 11 September 2012, Mr Mellick observed that there was a suspended ceiling between each bay. He could not see what was underneath the suspended ceiling. Mr Mellick said the suspended ceiling in bays 1 and 2 were water damaged.
	
	
	Mr Patrick George asked Mr Mellick if Trico could take down the suspended ceiling. Mr Mellick arranged for a work crew to undertake the investigative works on 12 September 2012. He said this work crew had been working on the nearby building at 66 King Street but their work was finishing at that site and it was convenient to move them across the road to Reid House.
	
	
	On 12 September 2012, the work crew removed the suspended ceiling to allow the architecture beneath the suspended ceiling to be inspected and assessed.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, Mr Mellick attended the premises and observed that the suspended ceiling had been removed from bays 1 and 2, exposing a pressed metal ceiling. Mr Mellick observed the pressed metal ceiling was not in good repair and had many holes and tears in it. Mr Mellick formed the view at the time, based on his experience as a builder, that the pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 was so damaged that it was irreparable and needed to be removed.
	
	
	Mr Mellick said that Mr Phillip George of the George Group directed Trico to take down the pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 because it was so damaged. Mr Mellick duly instructed the work crew to remove the ceiling in bays 1 and 2. The work crew did so over the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012.
	
	
	During the removal of the pressed metal ceiling, the work crew also removed the sprinkler system. Unfortunately, a rogue sprinkler pipe began to discharge water, flooding the camera shop on the ground level. As a result of the water discharge, the fire brigade attended to turn off the pipe. This also led to an inspection of the premises.
	
	
	On Monday 17 September 2012, members of the management committee of the body corporate of the building (including Mr Ginter) and Mr Mellick attended a meeting at the premises. Trico was instructed by the body corporate not to do any more work on the premises until approval from the Council had been obtained. Mr Mellick said that Trico complied with this instruction and did nothing further to the ceiling of the mezzanine level.
	
	
	However, there does seem to have been other work associated with installation of a new metal framework in bay 3 to install a new sprinkler system and to support a new suspended plasterboard ceiling. The Council alleged that in the course of the installation of this metal framework new holes were made or existing holes enlarged in the pressed metal ceiling and cladding on the fascia.
	
	
	The Council relied on the evidence of Mr Ginter. Mr Ginter initially said that when he visited the premises on 11 December 2012 he noticed a large hole in the metal ceiling in bay 3 where, on 17 September 2012 he recalled there had been an intact ceiling. On cross-examination, Mr Ginter was shown a photograph taken around 14 September 2012 showing a hole in the ceiling in bay 3 in the same location as the hole Mr Ginter said he saw and had photographed on 11 December 2012.
	
	
	Mr Ginter said he did not inspect the size or dimensions of the hole in the ceiling on his visit on 11 December 2012. However, Mr Ginter said he had looked at the holes that had been there beforehand in order to provide advice on the number of metal ceiling panels (of 4 ft by 2 ft) that would be required to restore the ceiling in bay 3. He thought he would have noticed if there had been big gaps in the ceiling.
	
	
	Later, after Mr Ginter was shown and compared the photographs, he accepted that the size and dimensions of the hole shown in the photograph of 14 December 2012 might be the same as the hole in his photograph (image 2) of 11 December 2012.
	
	
	Mr Mellick also gave evidence about this hole in the metal ceiling in bay 3. He said, as a result of the events of 15 and 16 September 2012, and in particular the flooding of the ground floor camera shop, he attended about 20 meetings at the site. He observed the ceiling at these meetings. He said the ceiling was littered with holes. He said he did not see any enlargement of the holes over the course of his 20 meetings.
	
	
	The Council has not established, to the requisite standard of beyond reasonable doubt, that the hole that existed in the metal ceiling in bay 3 on 14 September 2012 was enlarged by Trico after 17 September 2012 and before 11 December 2012. Mr Ginter’s initial evidence that the hole he observed on 11 December 2012 did not exist on 17 September 2012 was proven to be incorrect.
	
	
	There is no evidence of the actual size or dimensions of the hole on 17 September or on 11 December 2012. The photograph of the hole taken on 14 September 2012 is from a distance and at an oblique angle, so that the perceived width of the hole is foreshortened. Mr Ginter’s photograph of the hole, taken on 11 December 2012, is taken more directly underneath the hole. It is not possible to compare the widths of the holes in the respective photographs. Mr Ginter accepted in cross-examination that the size and dimensions of the hole depicted in each photograph were about the same. Mr Mellick had more occasions to observe the condition of the ceiling at his 20 meetings on the site during the period. He did not observe any enlargement of the existing holes, including this one. There is also no direct evidence of any work done to the hole to enlarge it.
	
	
	The Council also alleged that new holes had been punched through the pressed metal fascia on the southern side of the beam between bays 2 and 3. The Council again relied on the evidence of Mr Ginter. Mr Ginter observed, on 11 December 2012, that there was a metal framework that had a piece abutting the beam. Mr Ginter thought that there were holes punched in this piece through to the pressed metal fascia of the beam.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Ginter accepted that he could not see the holes, but that was because they were within the channel of the piece. Mr Ginter accepted that he had made a deduction that there must be holes for mechanical fixing because he could not believe that they would have used double sided tape to fix the piece to the beam.
	
	
	Mr Mellick denied that there were any holes punched in the pressed metal fascia of the beam. He said that the metal framework for the suspended plasterboard ceiling was attached by rods from the joists through the existing holes in the metal ceiling. Mr Mellick said the weight of the suspended plasterboard ceiling and the metal framework would be too great to be mechanically fixed (such as by screws) to the beams, and it would be pulled off.
	
	
	Mr Mellick looked at the photographs showing the piece of the new metal framework abutting the beam and said that he could not see any mechanical fixing points. If the new framework were to have been mechanically fixed to the beam, he said he would have expected to see a line of fixing points, but there were none.
	
	
	The Council has not established beyond reasonable doubt that Trico punched holes in the pressed metal fascia of the beam between bays 2 and 3. Mr Ginter’s evidence does not establish that there were actually holes punched. Rather, he simply made a deduction that holes were punched because he assumed that double sided tape would not have been used to fix the piece of the framework to the beam.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Mr Mellick that in fact the framework was attached by a different means of rods inserted through the existing holes in the ceiling. The piece observed by Mr Ginter was pushed up against, but not mechanically fixed to, the beam. Hence, it was not necessary to punch holes through the metal fascia of the beam.
	
	
	The consequence of the above findings is that the conduct constituting the offence committed by Trico is limited to the demolition of the pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 over the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012.
	


Subsequent events to remedy the damage


	
	On 5 November 2012, Mr Patrick George made application to the Council for consent to carry out internal and external alterations to the mezzanine level of Reid House.
	
	
	The development application proposed two different types of works for the ceiling in the mezzanine level. For bays 1 and 2, it was proposed to ‘reinstate’ new pressed metal ceilings (ceiling type A) to replace the ceiling that was removed on 15 and 16 September 2012 and for bays 3, 4 and 5 it was proposed to retain the existing fabric of the pressed metal ceiling and install a new plasterboard ceiling over it (ceiling type B).
	
	
	A statement of heritage impact by heritage consultants accompanied the development application. That statement noted that:
	


The condition of the pressed metal ceilings is very poor due to extensive damage caused by the installation, and successive changes to, services and by later dropped ceilings. A large part of the 1906 ceiling was inadvertently removed during stripping-out works.


	
	On 11 February 2013, the Council granted development consent to carry out the alterations and additions to the mezzanine level of Reid House, subject to conditions. One condition (Schedule 1A(2) of development consent D/2012/1865) required the design of the building to be modified as follows:
	


(a)   The proposed new pressed metal elements for ‘Type A ceilings’ including ceiling panels, beam fascia and soffit panels, cornices (including cornice corners), cover beads and modillions, are to be of the exact same pattern as the original that have been demolished. Sample sections or drawn details at 1:5 scale should be submitted. These are to be left as the exposed finish and painted.

(b)   The existing original pressed metal ceilings (including ceiling panels, beam fascia and soffit panels, cornices (including cornice corners), cover beads and modillions) in the Zone marked Type B are to be fully restored. Details of the methodology are to be submitted.


	
	On 30 May 2013, the Council approved an application to modify the development consent to change the wording of certain conditions, including those dealing with the ceiling. Condition 2(a) was modified to read:
	


The proposed new pressed metal elements for ‘Type A ceilings’ including ceiling panels, beam fascia and soffit panels, cornices (including cornice corners), cover beads and modillions, are to be similar in character and scale to the existing components that have been demolished. These are to be generally in accordance with drawings CD01(A), CD02(A), CD102(A) and CD103(A) prepared by Lawton Hurley Pty Ltd, as approved by Council emails dated 28 February 2013 and 14 March 2013.


	
	The development was then carried out in accordance with the development consent (as modified), including installing the new pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 and restoring the existing pressed metal ceiling in bays 3, 4 and 5.
	
	
	A certificate of practical completion was issued for the works at the premises on 12 June 2013.
	


The offence provisions


	
	At the time of commission of the offence on 15 and 16 September 2012, Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2005 (‘LEP’) applied to the land. Reid House was a heritage item listed in sch 8 of the LEP. Clause 68 of the LEP provided that certain types of development could only be carried out with development consent, including:
	


(a)   demolition of a heritage item or building in a heritage streetscape,

(b)   structural or non-structural alterations to the exterior or interior of a heritage item.


	
	“Demolish” a heritage item was defined in the LEP to mean “to damage, deface, destroy, pull down, dismantle or remove it in whole or in part”.
	
	
	The damaging, destroying, pulling down, dismantling or removal of a ceiling of a building listed as a heritage item involves the demolition of the heritage item as well as the making of a structural or non-structural alteration (depending upon the extent of the work) to the heritage item.
	
	
	As a consequence, Trico’s action of demolishing the pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 of the mezzanine level of the listed heritage item of Reid House, without first obtaining development consent, was in breach of cl 68 of the LEP and hence s 76A of the EPA Act. By doing a thing that was forbidden to be done by s 76A of the EPA Act, Trico committed an offence against s 125(1) of the EPA Act.
	


Purposes of sentencing


	
	Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (‘CSP Act’) provides that the purposes of imposing a sentence on an offender include, of relevance to the offence committed by Trico:
	


(a)   to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)   to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(e)   to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)   to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)   to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	The sentence of the Court is a public denunciation of the conduct of the offender. The sentence must ensure that the offender is held accountable for his or her actions and is adequately punished or given his or her just desserts.
	
	
	The sentence needs to deter the offender from committing similar crimes in the future. This is important for an offender such as Trico which is in the business of construction and accordingly will be called upon to carry out demolition and alteration of buildings that might be protected by environmental planning instruments or development consents, including by being listed as a heritage item. The sentence of the Court needs to deter offenders from taking such action other than in accordance with lawful authority.
	
	
	Although, as I find below, Trico is unlikely to re-offend, because of its genuine remorse and actions taken after the offence to avoid re-offending, this does not mean that there is no need for the sentence to include any component for specific deterrence.
	
	
	Most importantly, the sentence of the Court needs to operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by persons who might be tempted to do so by the prospect that, if they are caught, only light punishment will be imposed. This is particularly so in the context of unlawful development, having regard to the policy considerations articulated in a number of cases, including Mosman Municipal Council v Menai Excavations Pty Ltd [2002] NSWLEC 132; (2002) 122 LGERA 89 at [32]-[35]; Sutherland Shire Council  v  Turner [2004] NSWLEC 774 at [24]; and Carlino v Leichhardt Municipal Council [2005] NSWLEC 198; (2005) 144 LGERA 235 at [32]-[34].
	
	
	For environmental offences, the purpose of sentencing on general deterrence is of central importance. Many of the cases in which courts have so stated are set out in the judgment of Cameron  v  Eurobodalla Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 47; (2006) 146 LGERA 349 at [71]-[80] and Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd  v  Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [103]-[106]. Persons will not be deterred from committing environmental offence by nominal fines: Environment Protection Authority  v  Capdate Pty Ltd (1993) 78 LGERA 349, 354; Bentley  v  BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [139]-[141], [150]-[151].
	
	
	There is a need for the upholding of the integrity of the system of planning and development control. This system depends on persons taking steps to obey the law by ascertaining when development consent is required and then obtaining development consent before carrying out development. Development must be carried out in accordance with the terms of any development consent obtained: Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd  v  Sutherland Shire Council at [104] and [105].
	
	
	The sentencing purpose of general deterrence is particularly relevant where the offender is in a business or industry that undertakes development or action that is regulated by the system of planning and development control. Persons and corporations engaged in demolition, excavation, and building and development work need to be warned by the sentence imposed by courts in cases involving unlawful demolition, excavation, and building and development work that all necessary consents must be obtained and complied with: Kari  v  Ghossayn Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 532; (2006) 150 LGERA 231 at [68(e)] and Pittwater Council  v  Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12; (2009) 165 LGERA 289 at [47].
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	In sentencing for the offence the Court is to consider the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence and the offender, and the aggravating, mitigating and other factors in s 21A of the CSP Act.
	
	
	The objective circumstances of relevance to this case include the maximum penalty, the objective harmfulness of the offender’s conduct (the actual environmental harm caused and the undermining of the regulatory system of development control), the offender’s state of mind and reasons for committing the offence, the foreseeability of risk of harm to the environment, the practical measures to avoid harm to the environment, and the offender’s control over the causes that gave rise to the offence.
	


Maximum penalty


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is relevant in determining the objective gravity of the offence. It reflects the public expression of the NSW Parliament of the seriousness of the offence. It also provides a sentencing yardstick for the case before the court. A yardstick is an instrument of measurement. The maximum penalty for an offence is used to measure the relevant features of the particular instance of an offence against a worst case.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the commission of the offence in this case is $1.1 million.
	


Actual environmental harm caused


	
	The objective seriousness of the offence is affected by the objective harmfulness of the offender’s actions. The causing of “substantial” injury, loss or damage by commission of the offence is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(g) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	I find that the commission of the offence caused actual objective harm in that part of the original fabric (the ceiling) of a building listed as a heritage item was demolished. The pressed metal ceiling was expressly recognised as part of the heritage significance of the building. The heritage inventory report for Reid House, as accessed in December 2012, noted that the pressed metal ceilings had “high significance”. The currently available heritage inventory report for Reid House states that: “The building’s interiors have significance through retaining a high level of original features including... pressed metal ceiling systems” and that the “pressed metal ceiling systems” have “high significance”.
	
	
	Ms Margaret Desgrand, a senior heritage specialist employed by the Council, opined that:
	


I consider that the removal of the original pressed metal ceilings and associated components has an adverse impact on the heritage significance of the mezzanine level of Reid House.

As stated previously, the heritage inventory report for Reid House, available to the public at www.heritage.nsw.gov.au, identifies the pressed metal ceilings as being of high significance and therefore need to be retained and conserved.

The removal of the pressed metal ceiling systems has an adverse impact on the heritage character of the mezzanine interior of Reid House and therefore on the heritage significance of Reid House.


	
	Ms Desgrand noted the proper approach to conservation of the existing fabric of a heritage building:
	


I have considered and regularly apply the Australian ICOMOS Burra Charter and its accompanying guidelines in assessing proposed work to heritage items. The Charter and Guidelines are considered the best practice standard for cultural heritage management in Australia. One of the key objectives of contemporary conservation practice is that as much of the significant original fabric of the building should be retained and conserved in order to preserve the essential integrity of the heritage resource for future generations. While any conservation activity will affect the building in some way, the aim, consistent with responsible re-use or management aims, should be to minimise the work necessary. In this way the authenticity of the item will be retained as far as possible within a process of evolutionary change and good maintenance practice. Article 3 of the Burra Charter indicates that conservation is based on a respect for the existing fabric of a place and should therefore involve the least possible physical intervention in order not to distort the evidence provided by the fabric. Articles 5 and 6 of the Burra Charter indicate that the management of a heritage place should be based on an understanding of its significance, and that relative degrees of significance lead to different conservation outcomes. Where elements have been identified as of Exceptional or High significance they should be retained and conserved.


	
	Finally, Ms Desgrand concluded:
	


The pressed metal ceilings, cornices and beam linings formerly in the two northern bays are of high significance and therefore should have been retained and conserved.


	
	The ceiling that was removed from bays 1 and 2 was damaged. Mr Mellick’s evidence was that the ceiling had many holes and tears in it. Many of these holes and tears, he said, were large. He colloquially described the ceilings as being “in a shocking state”. He formed the view that the ceiling was so damaged that it was irreparable and needed to be removed.
	
	
	Trico submitted that the loss of the original pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 needed to be put in context. First, it comprised part of but was not the whole of the heritage item. The ceiling removed was from only two of the five bays on the mezzanine level of Reid House. The remaining pressed metal ceiling systems in other bays on the mezzanine level and on other levels of the building were not removed and no other fabric of the heritage listed building was proven to be adversely impacted.
	
	
	Secondly, the ceiling that was removed was damaged. Thirdly, the removed ceiling has been replaced with a new pressed metal ceiling similar in character and scale to the original ceiling, pursuant to the development consent (as modified). Trico noted that it has been awarded a merit award (runner up) for best heritage fit-out (under $5 million) awarded by the Master Builders Association for the mezzanine level of Reid House.
	
	
	I find that the commission of the offence caused actual harm to the heritage item, in that part of the existing fabric of the building that contributed to its heritage significance (as I have described above) was removed. The fact that the existing fabric of the ceiling was damaged did not mean that it did not have heritage significance or that its removal was justified.
	
	
	Although Mr Mellick was of the view that the ceiling was so damaged that it was irreparable, no studies were undertaken in accordance with proper conservation practice to ascertain whether the holes and tears in the existing ceiling could be repaired, either by restoration or by reconstruction, rather than demolishing and discarding the ceiling.
	
	
	Mr Ginter assessed the damage to the existing ceiling in other bays and concluded that damaged panels could be restored or reconstructed so as to conserve the fabric of the ceiling. It is unknown whether such conservation work could have been done to the damaged existing ceiling in bays 1 and 2 because there never were proper studies undertaken. The impact of any proposed change to the existing fabric on the heritage significance of the building needed to be analysed by reference to the statement of significance and the policy for managing the building that needed to be prepared. The analysis might have suggested that any proposed change to the fabric should be modified to better retain the heritage significance.
	
	
	The adverse impact on the heritage significance by the removal of the original ceiling has been partially, but not wholly, remedied by the reconstruction with a new pressed metal ceiling similar in character and scale to the original ceiling. The replacement of the original fabric with new fabric, even of similar character and scale, does not restore the building or wholly compensate for the diminution in heritage significance caused by the loss of the original fabric.
	
	
	I find that the commission of the offence caused actual harm of medium seriousness. Such harm can be considered to be “substantial” and an aggravating factor in terms of s 21A(2)(g) of the CSP Act.
	


Undermining of the regulatory system of development control


	
	The commission of the offence also undermined the objectives and integrity of the regulatory system of development control. Carrying out development without consent or not in accordance with a consent tends to undermine the objects of the EPA Act and the due processes prescribed for prior application, assessment and approval of the carrying out of development.
	
	
	Offences which undermine the integrity of the regulatory system are objectively serious. Use of the criminal law ensures the credibility of the regulatory system.
	
	
	The actions of Trico in demolishing part of the original fabric of the heritage listed Reid House without first applying for and obtaining development consent offended against the legislative objective expressed in the statutory offence and also thwarted the attainment of the objects of the Act.
	
	
	Trico by its actions foreclosed the opportunity for prior assessment of the action of removal of the original pressed metal ceiling and the option of the Council refusing consent to the removal because of any unacceptable impacts on the heritage character of the mezzanine interior and the heritage significance of Reid House. The option of preserving and restoring the damaged existing pressed metal ceiling of bays 1 and 2 was also foreclosed by Trico’s action of demolition of the ceiling.
	


No heightened state of mind or financial gain


	
	A factor to be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of a strict liability offence, such as the offence against s 125(1) of the EPA Act, is the state of mind of the offender. A strict liability offence that is committed intentionally, recklessly or negligently will be objectively more serious than one not so committed.
	
	
	Another factor increasing the objective seriousness of an offence is if the reason for commission of the offence is to make a profit or to save incurring an expense, or to avoid the cost of obtaining and implementing a statutory permission such as a development consent. The committing of an offence for financial gain is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(o) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	Mr Mellick of Trico explained that prior to Trico demolishing the ceiling in bays 1 and 2 of the mezzanine level, he was unaware that Reid House was a listed heritage item. He was not told by the George Group that it was a listed heritage item. His observations of the condition of the mezzanine level, and in particular the suspended ceiling and upon exposure the pressed metal ceiling, did not alert him to the fact that it might be a listed heritage item. It did not occur to him that the taking down of either the suspended ceiling or the pressed metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 would have required development consent.
	
	
	Mr Mellick accepted, however, that with hindsight, he should have checked whether Reid House was listed as a heritage item under the LEP. He knew that most heritage listed buildings are listed in a schedule of the LEP and he could have accessed that schedule to check whether Reid House was listed. Mr Mellick accepted that, if he had known that the building was a heritage listed item, he would not have removed the ceiling without development consent.
	
	
	Mr Mellick did not say, and no other evidence established, that Trico removed the ceiling to make a profit or to save incurring an expense, such as the cost of applying for and obtaining development consent.
	
	
	I find that the Council has not established, beyond reasonable doubt, that Trico intentionally, recklessly or negligently carried out the demolition of the ceiling in breach of the requirement to obtain prior development consent or for financial gain. A mistake was made in demolishing the ceiling, but it was not done so with a heightened state of mind or to make a profit or to save incurring an expense.
	


Foreseeability of risk of environmental harm


	
	Trico could reasonably have foreseen that its action in demolishing the ceiling in bays 1 and 2 that constituted the commission of the offence would be likely to cause harm to the heritage listed building. On the evidence, Trico did not actually foresee this harm, because of its ignorance that the building was a listed heritage item. However, a reasonable person in Trico’s position would have made enquiries that would have revealed that the building was heritage listed and hence would have foreseen that removing part of the fabric of such a building would cause harm to the heritage significance of the building.
	


Practical measures to avoid environmental harm


	
	There were practical measures that Trico could have taken to have avoided that harm. Trico could have checked whether the building was listed as a heritage item under the LEP and, upon ascertaining that it was so listed, ensured that development consent was sought and obtained before carrying out the demolition of any ceiling in the building.
	


Control over causes of offence


	
	Trico had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence. Its work crew demolished the ceiling.
	


Conclusion on objective seriousness


	
	In conclusion, considering all of these objective circumstances, I find that the objective seriousness of the offence is at the low end of the range for this type of offence.
	


Subjective circumstances of the offender


	
	Within the limits set by the objective seriousness of the offence, the Court may take into account factors personal to Trico. These include in this case the lack of prior convictions, the plea of guilty, the remorse shown by the offender and the unlikelihood of re-offending.
	


No prior convictions


	
	Trico does not have any prior convictions for any environmental offences: see s 21A(3)(e) of the CSP Act.
	


Delayed plea of guilty


	
	Trico has pleaded guilty to the offence, a fact the Court is required to take into account: s 21A(3)(k) and s 22(1)(a) of the CSP Act. A plea of guilty has utilitarian value to the criminal justice system. A court takes account of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty by imposing a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed: s 22(1) of the CSP Act. However, a lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s 22(1A) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	In determining the extent of any discount that should be given for a plea of guilty, the court is required to consider when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty: s 22(1)(b) of the CSP Act. As a general rule, the earlier the plea, the greater the discount, while the later the plea, the lesser the discount: R  v  Thomson; R  v  Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [160]; R  v  Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510 at [8]-[13]; R  v  Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]; Morton  v  R [2014] NSWCCA 8 [32]-[35].
	
	
	In this case, there was a delay in Trico entering its guilty plea. Trico originally entered a plea of not guilty to the charge in the original summons. A trial was embarked upon on 10 and 11 November 2014. Around midday on the second day of the trial, the Council applied for leave to amend the charge dates of the summons. The summons originally charged that the demolition of the ceiling occurred between about 18 September 2012 and about 12 December 2012. In fact, it occurred on the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012. The Council sought to amend the charge date to commence on 15 September and end on 11 December 2012. Trico opposed leave being granted.
	
	
	The Court heard argument on the application for leave to amend the summons on 11 and 12 November 2014. The Court gave judgment on the application on 13 November 2014. The Court granted leave and the summons was amended to change the dates within which the offence was alleged to have been committed. Trico then sought an adjournment to consider its position in light of the amendment of the charge period. The Court granted an adjournment to 18 November 2014. On 18 November 2014, Trico withdrew its plea of not guilty and instead entered a plea of guilty to the charge as amended.
	
	
	The Council submitted that this delay in the entry of the guilty plea reduced the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty to be at the lower end of the 10 - 25% range held to be appropriate for a discount in R  v  Thomson at [152], [160].
	
	
	Trico submitted that it was entitled to defend the original charge because the charge date in the summons did not coincide with when the offence occurred. However, after the Court granted leave to the Council to amend the charge dates to coincide with when the offence occurred, Trico no longer had a reasonable defence and it therefore changed its plea from not guilty to guilty. This was done within a week of the amendment of the summons and should be considered to be done at the earliest opportunity after the summons was amended. Trico therefore submitted that it should still be entitled to a discount at the higher end of the range for entering a plea of guilty to the amended charge at the earliest opportunity. Trico ultimately submitted that the discount should be 15%.
	
	
	I find that the utilitarian value of Trico’s plea of guilty is reduced by the delay in Trico entering the plea of guilty. It may be that, on one view, the delay in the plea of guilty was not Trico’s fault. The prosecutor had specified in the charge the commencement date of the period in which the offence was alleged to be committed as 18 September 2012, which was three days after the conduct constituting the offence was actually first committed on 15 September 2012, but then at the trial applied for and obtained leave to amend the commencement date to be 15 September 2012 so as to include the conduct within the charge period. Trico pleaded guilty within a week after the charge was so amended. This might be considered to be the earliest opportunity.
	
	
	Generally, however, the reason for the delay in entering a guilty plea is irrelevant because, if a guilty plea is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value to the criminal justice system of the guilty plea when ultimately made is reduced: R  v  Borkowski at [32]; Morton  v  R at [32], [33].
	
	
	Hence, by way of examples, the utilitarian value of a delayed guilty plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced where there is a plea bargain, or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the prosecutor, or where the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: R  v  Borkowski at [32].
	
	
	Another example is if a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge. The advantages to the criminal justice system are less, even though the plea might have been entered at the earliest opportunity after the lesser charge was substituted. Less advantages to the criminal justice system justify a smaller discount: R  v  Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [5]; Morton  v  R at [32]. In the last example, the delay in the plea of guilty is not the offender’s fault. However, the lower discount “is consistent with the nature of the discount as being at least in part a recognition of practical advantages, and not merely a recognition of mitigation of culpability”: R v Dib at [6].
	
	
	In this case, the trial commenced and proceeded for a day and a half before an application was made to amend the summons. Trico did not enter its guilty plea until after it was unsuccessful in opposing the amendment to the summons and after an adjournment of a week from the Court’s decision granting leave to the prosecutor to amend the summons. Costs were incurred by and inconvenience caused to the parties, the witnesses and the court system by the trial having to be conducted. The delay by Trico in entering the guilty plea meant that there were less practical advantages to the criminal justice system and greater costs to the criminal justice system than if the plea had been entered early. There was a lower utilitarian value of the plea and hence the discount should be reduced from the maximum of 25%.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the entry of the guilty plea when it did occur thereafter had utilitarian value for the criminal justice system. The trial no longer had to continue and instead a sentence hearing could be conducted.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I consider that the guilty plea still had utilitarian value, although less, and the discount should be reduced from the maximum of 25% to be 15%: see R  v  Borkowski at [31]; Inspector Selby  v  University of New South Wales [2013] NSWIR Comm 20 at [20]; Morton  v  R at [36].
	


Remorse for the offence


	
	Apart from the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, genuine remorse of an offender is a further mitigating factor. However, s 21A(3)(i) of the CSP Act states that remorse by an offender for the offence will only be a mitigating factor if:
	


(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).


	
	The existence of genuine remorse is also relevant to the weight to be given to individual deterrence and the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender: R v Thomson at [116].
	
	
	I find Trico is remorseful for committing the offence. It has taken responsibility for its actions and acknowledged the harm caused to the heritage building. The harm has also been remedied partially by the installation of ceilings of similar scale and character to those removed. Mr Mellick , a director of Trico gave evidence by affidavit and in court. He said:
	


On behalf of Trico, I sincerely regret the removal of the heritage pressed metal ceilings in Bays 1 and 2 over the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012. It should not have occurred, and is totally uncharacteristic of the way Trico intends to go about its business, and has since these events, gone about its business. It will not be repeated.


	
	Mr Mellick also said that Trico has taken steps to avoid reoffending:
	


As a consequence of the events of 15 and 16 September 2012, Trico has invested heavily both in terms of personnel and money to develop, implement and maintain accreditation for International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) management systems for Quality, Safety and Environmental. This involves a series of regular internal and external audits to ensure that all pre-start conditions are being met including obtaining approval from Council. These measures have been taken to prevent an incident like the one which occurred on 15 and 16 September 2012 occurring again.

Unlikely to reoffend


	
	Another mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence is if the offender is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g) CSP Act. I find that by reason of Trico’s genuine remorse for the offence and the steps taken to avoid carrying out development without development consent, Trico is unlikely to re-offend.
	


Appropriate penalty


	
	In determining the appropriate penalty, the Court should be consistent with the pattern of sentencing for like offences. The Council and Trico referred to the sentences imposed in other cases involving demolition of buildings or structures listed as heritage items, including: Mosman Municipal Council  v  Waratah Village Partners Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 101; City of Sydney Council  v  Schwartz [2003] NSWLEC 261; Ku-ring-gai Council  v  Vinci [2007] NSWLEC 287; and Willoughby City Council  v  BCPD Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 163.
	
	
	I have considered the penalties imposed in these decisions and the objective and subjective circumstances that led the judge concerned to impose those penalties. I consider that the penalties I propose to impose in this case are not inconsistent with those decisions.
	
	
	Considering the purposes of sentencing, balancing the objective and subjective circumstances, and having regard to the pattern of sentencing in other cases involving unlawful development regarding heritage items, I consider that the appropriate penalty is $55,000, which should be discounted by 15% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. This amounts to $46,750.
	
	
	In finding that a fine of this amount is appropriate, I recognise that the fine is only part of the penalty imposed on Trico. I consider below the parties’ respective applications for cost orders in their favour. For reasons I will shortly give, I have determined that the Council should not be ordered to pay costs to Trico by reason of the adjournment but that Trico should be ordered to pay costs (although in a reduced amount) to the Council. I have given consideration to this fact that Trico will be ordered to pay the Council’s costs and the likely amount of those costs in determining the amount of the fine.
	


Costs


	
	Both Trico and the Council seek an order that the other party pay their costs, although under different powers and for different reasons.
	
	
	Trico seeks an order that the Council pay Trico’s costs under s 257F of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, while the Council seeks an order that Trico pay the Council’s costs under s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act. Trico seeks in the alternative that the Court exercise its discretion under s 257B to make no order as to costs or, in the further alternative, only order Trico to pay the prosecutor’s costs from 18 November 2014 (ie after Trico entered a guilty plea).
	


Whether order for costs on adjournment


	
	I will start with Trico’s application for an order for costs under s 257F of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 257F provides:
	


(1)   A court may in any proceedings under this Part, at its discretion or on the application of a party, order that one party pay costs if the matter is adjourned.

(2)   An order may be made only if the court is satisfied that the other party has incurred additional costs because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made.

(3)   The order must specify the amount of costs payable or may provide for the determination of the amount at the end of the proceedings.

(4)   An order may be made whatever the result of the proceedings.


	
	Trico notes that the proceedings were adjourned: first, from 13 November 2014 when the Court delivered judgment granting leave to the Council to amend the charge period in the summons to 18 November 2014 when Trico withdrew its plea of not guilty and instead entered a plea of guilty to the amended charge, and secondly, from 18 November 2014 to 16 March 2014 which was the first day of the sentence hearing. The precondition in s 257F(1) to the exercise of the power to order costs was therefore satisfied.
	
	
	Trico accepted that subs (2) of s 257F is a limitation on the power under subs (1): an order may only be made under subs (1) if the court is satisfied of the matters specified in subs (2). However, Trico and the Council differed as to how to interpret the matters specified in subs (2).
	
	
	Trico submitted that once the pre-condition in subs (1) is satisfied (“the matter is adjourned”), the court need only be satisfied that “additional costs” have been incurred by Trico “because of the unreasonable conduct or delays” of the Council. Trico submitted that there is no further causal nexus required between the “additional costs” and the adjournment of the matter. The reference to “additional costs” is simply a reference to costs that are incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delay. Trico referred to the second reading speech of the Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 that introduced s 257F as supporting this construction:
	


The Act will be amended to provide that the Supreme Court and other higher courts may make costs orders against a party in summary criminal proceedings, on an adjournment, due to unreasonable conduct or delays.


	
	Trico submitted that in this case there was unreasonable conduct and delays of the Council. The Council commenced the proceedings on 25 July 2013 by summons claiming an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act in respect of the offence and claiming that Trico be dealt with according to law for commission of the offence.
	
	
	The Council specified, in the summons and in the order sought for Trico to answer the offence charged in the order, a commencement date of the charge period of 18 September 2012, when it knew that the primary conduct of the demolition of the ceiling in bays 1 and 2 of the mezzanine level of Reid House that constituted the offence, commenced on 15 September 2012.
	
	
	The summons commencing the proceedings was accompanied by affidavits that the Council intended to be relied on as establishing prima facie proof of the offence charged. Two of the affidavits that accompanied the summons (those of Mr Ginter dated 9 April 2013 and Mr Pettersson dated 18 March 2013) established that the ceiling in bays 1 and 2 had been removed by Monday 17 September 2012.
	
	
	Mr Ginter, in an email to the Council’s heritage expert, Ms Desgrand, on 11 December 2012 noted that: “Over the course of a single weekend they demolished/destroyed 50% of the original pressed metal ceilings on the floor.” The “single weekend” was the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012. Mr Ginter’s email was annexed to Ms Desgrand’s affidavit dated 24 July 2013, which also accompanied the summons commencing the proceedings. Mr Pettersson also established that the ceiling had been there on 12 September 2012.
	
	
	The Council’s solicitor had also been informed by Mr Appadoo, a compliance investigator with the Council, on 19 December 2012 that “most of the pressed metal ceilings were removed after the water damage before 14/09/12,” and sometime between 19 and 21 December 2012, that when Mr O’Brien, who was appointed to replace the entire sprinkler system within the mezzanine level, commenced work on 17 September 2012, “the ceiling was completely removed.”
	
	
	In these circumstances, Trico submitted, the Council’s conduct in specifying in the summons and the order that the commencement date of the period within which the offence of carrying out the development of demolishing the ceiling of the mezzanine level of Reid House without development consent was 18 September 2012, rather than 15 September 2012, was unreasonable. Trico submitted that the Council’s conduct in delaying making application for leave to amend the summons to the second day of the trial was also unreasonable.
	
	
	The Council filed and served further evidence establishing that the demolition of the ceiling occurred over the weekend of 15 and 16 September 2012. This included a second affidavit of Mr Ginter dated 29 October 2013 in which he referred to and attached his email of 11 December 2012 to Ms Desgrand stating that the demolition of the ceiling occurred over the course of a single weekend.
	
	
	On 29 October 2013, the Council served its statement of facts under s 247E of the Criminal Procedure Act. That statement said that the metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 was intact on 12 September 2012, Trico was engaged in works over the weekend of Saturday 15 to Sunday 16 September 2012, but by Monday 17 September 2012 the metal ceiling in bays 1 and 2 had been removed (paras 7-10). The Council must have known at this time that the commencement date of the charge period that it had specified in the summons was after the demolition of the ceiling, which constituted the offence, had already occurred, yet the Council delayed until the trial on 11 November 2014 making application to amend the charge period.
	
	
	Trico submitted that this unreasonable conduct and delay of the Council caused Trico to incur costs that it would not have had to incur if the Council had not acted or delayed unreasonably (which Trico said were the additional costs). Trico submitted that the Council, acting reasonably, should have drafted the summons and order to correctly specify 15 September 2012 as the commencement date of the charge period from the outset, but if it had not done so, it should have applied for leave to amend the charge period much earlier than it actually did.
	
	
	Trico identified those categories of costs that it incurred, but it would not have had to incur, had the Council not acted and delayed unreasonably. These categories of costs included: the cost of engaging Mr Gatt, a fire safety engineer, and Mr Swartz, an IT specialist, to give evidence.
	
	
	Trico submitted that Mr Gatt was engaged to establish that the Council could reasonably have formed the opinion that the work of removal and replacement of the fire sprinkler system and installation of fire proofing plasterboard, which caused the ceiling in the mezzanine level to be demolished, was required as a matter of urgency to ensure public safety. Under cl 68(2)(c) of the LEP, development consent is not required for demolition of a heritage item “if in the opinion of the consent authority, the proposed development is required as a matter of urgency to ensure public safety.”
	
	
	Trico submitted that it engaged Mr Gatt to give this evidence because the charge period in the summons excluded the demolition of the ceiling in bays 1 and 2 and only included the alleged enlargement of the hole and punching of new holes in the ceiling and cladding in bay 3. Trico considered it worthwhile incurring the cost of engaging Mr Gatt to defend the charge when the charge period was drafted so as to be limited to only the alleged damage to the ceiling in bay 3. However, it submitted that it would not have incurred those costs if the charge period had, from the outset, been drafted so as to include the demolition of the ceiling in bays 1 and 2. Hence, Trico submitted, the costs of engaging Mr Gatt were caused by the unreasonable conduct or delay of the Council.
	
	
	Trico engaged Mr Swartz to examine photographs of the mezzanine level to determine when they were taken. The purpose of this evidence was to establish what work was done to the ceiling in the bays within and without the charge period of the summons. Trico submitted that this was a worthwhile exercise when the charge period was drafted so as to be limited to only the alleged damage to bay 3, but would not have been worthwhile if the charge period had been drafted so as to also include the demolition of the ceiling in bays 1 and 2. Again, therefore, Trico submitted that the costs of engaging Mr Swartz were caused by the unreasonable conduct or delay of the Council.
	
	
	Another category of cost Trico submitted was caused by the unreasonable conduct or delay of the Council was the various interlocutory attendances and applications before Sheahan J concerning the timing of Mr Gatt’s evidence. If the summons had correctly specified the charge period from the outset, or had been promptly amended, Trico submitted it would not have engaged Mr Gatt and hence incurred the costs of these interlocutory attendances and applications concerning Mr Gatt’s evidence. Those costs were, therefore, also caused by the Council’s unreasonable conduct or delay.
	
	
	The next category of cost Trico submitted it had incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delay of the Council was the cost of arguing the Council’s application to amend the summons on 11 and 12 September 2012, with judgment being delivered on 13 September 2012. Trico submitted that if the Council had correctly specified the charge period from the outset, there would obviously have been no need for the Council to have applied to amend the summons to correct the charge period.
	
	
	Alternatively, if the Council had promptly made application to amend the summons, then in all likelihood Trico would not have opposed the application, especially if the application had been made when the limitation period for commencing a fresh prosecution had not expired. There would have been no utility in Trico opposing the amendment because, even if Trico had been successful, the Council could have commenced a fresh prosecution in relation to the offence of demolishing the ceiling in bays 1 and 2. Trico therefore submitted that, either way, it would not have incurred the cost of arguing the Council’s application to amend the summons and that cost too can be seen to have been caused by the unreasonable conduct or delay of the Council.
	
	
	Trico also submitted that all of the other costs of preparing for and running Trico’s defence at the trial that it incurred were caused by the Council’s unreasonable conduct or delay. If the Council had correctly specified the charge date from the outset or promptly amended it, Trico submitted it would have entered a guilty plea and not defended the charge. The costs incurred in defending the charge as originally drafted up to the time when the Council applied to amend the charge period were, therefore, also caused by the Council’s unreasonable conduct and delay.
	
	
	The Council submitted that none of the categories of costs claimed by Trico fell within the limitation in s 257F(2), as none of them are “additional costs” incurred by reason of the adjournment of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Council accepted that the pre-condition in subs (1) was satisfied: the matter was adjourned twice, once from 13 November and the second time on 18 November 2014. The Council also conceded that its conduct in specifying the commencement date of the charge period in the summons and order as 18 September 2012 rather than 15 September 2012, and in delaying making application to amend the charge period until the second day of the trial, could be described as “unreasonable conduct or delays” for the purposes of subs (2). The Council also did not contest that Trico had incurred costs in the categories of costs it claimed.
	
	
	However, the Council submitted that those costs were not incurred by reason of the matter being adjourned and hence were not “additional costs” within the meaning of that term in subs (2). The Council submitted that the reference point for determining whether costs are “additional” is not “the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made” in subs (2) but rather “if the matter is adjourned” in subs (1). Costs are “additional costs” only if they are incurred by the matter being adjourned.
	
	
	The Council submitted that the statement in the second reading speech relied upon by Trico in fact supported the Council’s construction.
	
	
	In this case, the Council submitted, the categories of costs claimed by Trico cannot be described as having been incurred by the matter being adjourned. They are not “additional costs” - costs that would not have been incurred if the matter was not adjourned but which had been incurred by the matter being adjourned. Rather, the costs were incurred irrespective of the matter being adjourned.
	
	
	The Council submitted that, unless the costs incurred are found to fall within the term “additional costs”, they cannot be the subject of an order for costs under s 257F(1). If the costs are not additional costs, it is irrelevant whether the costs can be seen to have been incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party. The causal nexus with the unreasonable conduct or delays that must exist before the Court has power to order costs if a matter is adjourned is only with “additional costs” incurred, not any costs incurred.
	
	
	I agree with the Council’s construction of s 257F and the argument that the costs claimed by Trico are not additional costs that the Council can be ordered to pay. Before a court may order one party to pay costs under s 257F:
	



	
	the matter must be adjourned (“if the matter is adjourned”);
	
	
	the other party must incur “additional costs”; and
	
	
	the Court must be satisfied that these additional costs have been incurred “because of the unreasonable conduct or delays” of the party against whom the order is made.
	



	
	The reference point for determining whether costs are “additional costs” is the adjournment of the matter, not the unreasonable conduct or delays of a party. A cost is an additional cost if it will be incurred if the matter is adjourned but will not be incurred if the matter is not adjourned. It is an “additional” cost in the sense that it is additional to the costs incurred if there is no adjournment.
	
	
	It is only these “additional costs” that the court can order a party to pay. If the costs incurred are not “additional costs” they do not fall within subs (2) and cannot be the subject of an order for costs under subs (1).
	
	
	However, there is a further limitation in subs (2) - the additional costs must have been incurred “because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made”. An order under s 257F(1) cannot be made with respect to every cost that is an additional cost, only those additional costs that are incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made. If the court is satisfied that the additional costs are incurred because of some other cause than the conduct or delay of the party against whom the order is made, or because the conduct or delay of that party falls short of being unreasonable conduct or delay, then the required causal nexus in subs (2) will not be met and the court has no power to make an order that the party pay those costs.
	
	
	Section 257F, therefore, requires costs to have two causal relationships: first, the cost must be incurred by the matter being adjourned - this makes them additional costs; and secondly, these additional costs must be incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made.
	
	
	I do not accept Trico’s construction of s 257F that conflates these two causal relationships into only one. Trico’s construction was that a cost will be “additional” if it is incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party against whom the order is made. This gives the word “additional” no work to do - it would be redundant in the subclause. Trico’s construction would result even if the word “additional” were omitted. The only test would be if the cost was incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party. If that causal nexus is established, the court could make an order but if it is not established, the court could not make an order - there is nothing additional about the costs that the court can order compared to the costs it cannot order.
	
	
	Trico’s construction also does not give sufficient attention to the link between subss (1) and (2). The order referred to in subs (2) is clearly the order that can be made under subs (1). An order under subs (1) can only be made that the party pay costs “if the matter is adjourned”. Subsection (2) then provides that an order under subs (1) that a party pay costs can only be made if the court is satisfied that the other party has incurred “additional costs”. The use of this term limits the costs that the court may order under subs (1). The court can only make an order under subs (1) that a party pay the “additional costs”. Hence, subs (1) is to be read as empowering the court to order that one party pay the additional costs incurred if the matter is adjourned. This reading then makes plain that what causes a cost to be an additional cost is the matter being adjourned.
	
	
	This requirement that the cost be “additional costs” necessarily must be satisfied before the next requirement in subs (2), that the additional costs be incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party, can be satisfied. The court cannot begin to be satisfied that additional costs have the necessary causal nexus with the unreasonable conduct or delays of the party until it has first ascertained what are the additional costs that have been incurred.
	
	
	Applying this construction of s 257F, none of the categories of costs identified by Trico can be described as “additional costs”. They were not costs that would not have been incurred if the matter had not been adjourned but were incurred by the matter being adjourned. The adjournment of the matter had no causal relationship to the incurring of the costs. Hence, the costs incurred were not “additional costs” incurred by the matter being adjourned.
	
	
	Once it is determined that the costs claimed by Trico are not additional costs, the Court has no power under s 257F(1) to order the Council to pay those costs to Trico. It is irrelevant whether those costs were incurred because of the unreasonable conduct or delays of the Council. That only matters if the costs could have been described as “additional costs”.
	
	
	I therefore reject Trico’s application for an order under s 257F(1) that the Council pay the costs of Trico.
	


Whether award of costs to prosecutor


	
	I now turn to deal with the Council’s application under s 257B that Trico pay the Council’s costs of the proceedings. Ordinarily, where a court convicts and sentences an offender for an offence, it is appropriate for the court to order the offender to pay the costs of the prosecutor. However, the court has a discretion not to award costs to the prosecutor or to limit the amount of the costs ordered. Grounds on which a court might exercise its discretion not to order costs or to limit the amount of costs include disentitling, unreasonable conduct or delay of the prosecutor.
	
	
	Trico submitted that the unreasonable conduct and delay of the Council concerning the charge period in the summons justifies the Court exercising its discretion to not order Trico to pay the Council’s costs or alternatively to limit the costs payable to be only from 18 November 2014. Trico referred to the decision in Environment Protection Authority  v  Truegrain (No 4) [2014] NSWLEC 179 at [138],[139] where the Court limited the costs payable by an offender in certain respects. One of the respects was that the prosecutor was not entitled to an order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs incurred in relation to the charge prior to it being embodied in the amended summons. Another respect was that the prosecutor was not entitled to an order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs incurred in relation to the interlocutory dispute concerning the duplicity of the unamended charge or the prosecutor’s costs in relation to those parts of the charge that were found by the courts to be duplicitous.
	
	
	The Council submitted that the Court should order Trico to pay costs and without limitation. The Council submitted that the Court would not be satisfied that Trico was genuinely prejudiced by the late amendment of the summons. Alternatively, the Council submitted that the Court would only exclude from the ambit of costs awarded to the prosecutor the costs of the first two days of the trial.
	
	
	I consider that an order under s 257B ought to be made in favour of the Council, but that the costs should be limited to those incurred from 18 November 2014. I find that the Council’s conduct in relation to the drafting of the commencement date of the charge period in the summons to be 18 September 2012 rather than 15 September 2012, when it had knowledge of and had filed evidence that the primary conduct constituting the offence had commenced on 15 September 2012, was unreasonable. Furthermore, the Council’s delay in seeking leave to amend the charge period of the summons until the second day of the trial, given its knowledge and the evidence available to it, was also unreasonable. I accept the submissions of Trico in this regard that I have earlier set out.
	
	
	I consider that this unreasonable conduct and delay is disentitling conduct. However, I do not consider it disentitles the Council from receiving any costs order in its favour but rather it disentitles the Council from being compensated for its costs up to the time when the cause of the unreasonable conduct and delay was remedied. This was when the Court granted the Council leave to amend the charge period and the Council did so. This occurred on 13 November 2014. There was then an adjournment to 18 November 2014. I consider it is just that the Council be compensated for its costs from 18 November 2014, but not for its costs incurred before that date.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The defendant is convicted of the offence as charged in the amended summons.
	
	
	The defendant is fined $46,750.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs incurred on and after 18 November 2014, in such amount as may be determined under s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

		10 April 2015",2015-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Land and Environment Court
2766122,R v WESTON [2015] NSWDC 166,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Michael Weston today appears for sentence in relation to three offences that were committed by him in early July 2014. One offence was an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon committed on 9 July 2014, which involved the robbing of a taxi driver. The other two offences were committed on 11 July 2014 at Waterloo. The first offence in time on that day, as I understand, it was an attempt to rob a taxi driver whilst armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife, and the second offence in time on that date was the offence of armed robbery with an offensive weapon of a taxi driver at Waterloo as were the locations of the other two offences. I am informed by the Crown that all three offences are offences contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on 15 July 2014 and has been in custody since that date and all time spent in custody since his arrest will be taken into account. He was not in breach of bail, a good behaviour bond or parole, although he has been previously granted good behaviour bonds and parole.
	
	
	To re-state the agreed facts requires me to refer to some of the details although I do not propose to repeat all the details. As was pointed out by his counsel, in fairness, these three offences, serious offences as they are given the fact that taxi drivers are people who are performing tasks that are conceded by counsel for the accused to be in a vulnerable position, were committed in daylight hours. To some extent the vulnerability of the victims was not as great as it might have been in the early hours of the morning or the late hours at night.
	
	
	But it is the fact, as this Court knows from dealing with many matters that arise from this area, robberies of taxi drivers in the Waterloo area is not an uncommon occurrence. I am very mindful of the good work of Superintendent Luke Freudenstein, the officer in charge of the Redfern Local Area Command, that he has done with the Koori community in Redfern to try and reduce the very high incidence of robberies committed in that area. In fairness, this prisoner is not responsible for other robberies. But the truth of the matter is that there is a long line of cases that have been dealt with in this Court, some by me, involving offences of this type in that particular area.
	
	
	The first victim was employed by Taxis Combined. At about 8.15am he was driving his car on Botany Road and the prisoner was standing near the corner of Botany Road and McEvoy Street, Waterloo. The taxi was flagged down. The prisoner was wearing a beanie and a jumper and a hood pulled over his head. He got into the rear passenger seat, slid across the seat so he was seated directly behind the victim, which would have been a quite unnerving experience, and directed the victim to drive him to a dead-end street being John Street, Waterloo.
	
	
	At one point the prisoner put his hand onto the victim’s right shoulder and put his other hand at the victim’s throat. At that point the victim realised that the prisoner was holding a knife to the victim’s throat with his left hand. The victim is described as being “paralysed with fear” and being pinned back against the seat by the offender. The prisoner demanded money. The victim removed $190 from his left shirt pocket and also removed $50 from his right shirt pocket, handing over to the prisoner $240. The prisoner still held the knife at the victim’s throat and used his right hand in a patting down motion on the top half of the victim. The blade was described as being 20 centimetres long, not including the handle. It had two triangular chunks out of the blade and the victim believed that the knife was broken. The prisoner also took the victim’s Samsung mobile phone from the centre console of the taxi and ran away.
	
	
	The victim used his taxi radio to advise base he had been robbed. Police were notified. The taxi driver drove around Waterloo in an attempt to locate the offender and when he realised police had not been called, he went towards Redfern Police Station but he apparently collected a second fare, which he dropped off, before he attended the police station and reported the matter to police. Internal CCTV camera footage within the cab captured the entire incident.
	
	
	Two days later at about 9.20am the prisoner flagged down a cab that was being driven south along Elizabeth Street, Waterloo, just past the intersection of Wellington Street. The prisoner again was wearing a beanie and a jacket. Again he slid when he got into the taxicab across to the back seat and positioned himself directly behind the victim. The prisoner asked to be taken to George Street, Waterloo, near the intersection of George Street and John Street. As the victim tried to pull over, the prisoner directed the victim to turn left into John Street, the street where he had previously robbed the other driver. The victim was asked to stop.
	
	
	The prisoner reached forward and placed his right hand on the victim’s right shoulder and again with his left hand held a knife to the victim’s throat. He screamed out “give me your money, give me your money.” The victim momentarily froze and then he reached down and pressed the car horn as hard as he could. The prisoner immediately got out of the cab and walked off through 40 John Street, Waterloo, and the victim lost sight of him. The prisoner did not get any money or property. The victim completed his shift before going to Redfern Police Station to report the incident. Again internal CCTV footage within the taxi captured the entire incident.
	
	
	It must be said, in the context of some observation made about the two cab drivers to whom I have referred going on and doing further work, that no inference can be drawn from that that they were not affected by the conduct of the prisoner. It may be that cab drivers or some cab drivers in this area are inured from the risks of driving taxis in an area, but it does not diminish the effect upon them or the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The prisoner probably just over an hour after the first offence on 11 July flagged down another cab in the area of Regent Street, Redfern. He got into the rear passenger seat and then initially sat behind the front passenger seat. He directed this cab to George Street in Waterloo. He again slid across the back and he committed the offence with a very similar modus operandi, except on this occasion the right arm of the prisoner was put around the neck of the victim. The victim saw the offender was holding a knife and he felt the knife being held up to his throat. The prisoner made a threat on this occasion, “Just give me your money or I will stab you.” The cab driver tried to calm him down saying, “Take it easy, take it easy.” The prisoner demanded all of his money and the victim held up $200 that he removed from his shirt pocket. The knife was still being held against the victim’s throat. The prisoner asked for all of the coins as well and the gold coins as they are described, that is I assume $1 and $2 coins, were handed to the prisoner, who then removed the knife from the throat of the victim and exited the cab. The victim was in shock, unable to move for a few minutes. Eventually the matter was reported to police.
	
	
	Again internal CCTV footage captured the whole affair. I assume thus that the prisoner was easily identified and on 14 July 2014 the prisoner was arrested at a unit at 232 Pitt Street and charged. He declined an interview and he declined to participate in an identification parade, although if he was filmed, bearing in mind he did not have a disguise, although he was wearing a beanie and other clothing, he would have been readily identified from that.
	
	
	The prisoner I accept threatened his victims, first of all by holding a knife against or near their throat. That is a very, very threatening gesture and it matters nought to my mind that words were not uttered in the first two offences as direct threats, although there were demands for money. In the third offence in time of course, as I said earlier, there was the threat to stab the victim. The prisoner talks about his regret for what he did. But he obviously had no regard for the welfare of his victims, even if it be true that he was not intending to use a knife upon his victims. They would not have known that. He was after what he could get in the form of cash from them or other items that he might be able to sell for his own selfish purposes.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history does not reflect a life of antisocial activity throughout his teenage years, but from the age of approximately 19, perhaps slightly younger, he has been regularly offending in a range of ways consistent with the history of drug use, which is the comment of a psychologist whose report I will come to in a moment.
	
	
	He was born on 23 August 1990. His first conviction was at the Downing Centre Local Court from charges brought in February 2009 when he appeared at that court on 3 September. He was convicted of larceny and possessing implements to enter or drive a conveyance, and given two good behaviour bonds pursuant to s 9 “Sentencing Procedure” Act, one for 12 months, one for 18 months.
	
	
	He was called up in relation to those bonds on 22 April 2010, that is on my calculation a little more than six months after being granted those bonds, for reasons which are not explained in the criminal history. He was convicted also on 3 September 2009 of destroying or damaging property. Another offence committed in February 2009. He was given a good behaviour bond for nine months in respect of that matter and again was as I understand it called up for a breach of that bond.
	
	
	He was convicted on 20 November 2009 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and given another opportunity by way of s 9 bond. He was presumably by that conviction in breach of the good behaviour bonds to which I refer. On 25 November 2011 he was charged with common assault and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, and in February 2012 was given two s 10 bonds for a period of six months. He was convicted on 10 September 2012 with destroying or damaging property and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, and was fined modestly in relation to both offences. He was convicted of larceny on 11 June 2013 and fined $800, and also fined for entering inclosed lands without lawful excuse, these offences committed between Christmas and New Year in 2012. He was fined in relation to those matters.
	
	
	He has another conviction for entering inclosed lands recorded on 31 January 2013. On that day he was convicted of breaking, entering and stealing, and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months. He was also convicted of destroying or damaging property and possessing an unregistered firearm, for which offences he was sentenced to three months imprisonment. He would have from what I can read of the dates of those offences, committed those offences whilst on bail in relation to the break, enter and steal matter. All the terms of imprisonment were concurrent with one another.
	
	
	He appealed against the severity of those penalties, as best as I can work out the record appearing in the Sydney District Court on 18 July 2013. In respect of the breaking, entering and stealing matter he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months imprisonment. Thus there was a finding of ‘special circumstances’ not found at the Local Court.
	
	
	He has a number of other convictions in his criminal history over the period of time between 2009 and 2013, including custody of a knife, possessing prohibited drugs on a number of occasions, larceny and being an unlicensed driver, which is a relatively minor matter. As was pointed out in the course of submissions, the criminal history reveals a gradual elevation or increase in the severity of the offending that has brought him before the courts. I note in relation to the matters with which I am concerned that it is the first occasion that he has come to the District Court for sentence at first instance. Certainly, as his learned counsel said in her very helpful oral submissions, the offending that I am concerned with is quite a leap upwards in severity from other offending.
	
	
	I have a very detailed psychological report. I know the prisoner did not given evidence. I am mindful of the fact that one must approach matters of history not the subject of test by the prosecution with some circumspection. There are a number of cases that deal with this. The case of Qualtieri comes to mind. There is also the case of Palu where Justice Howie spoke about the proper approach to opinions based upon hearsay material that is not independently established. I am prepared however in general terms to accept the bulk of the material. It seems to be consistent with what the criminal history reveals. The prisoner is a relatively young man. Obviously he is, being born in 1990 he is now 24 years of age to turn 25 this year as I would understand it.
	


The psychological report ma’am I have just picked up has got his birth date in 1989, the Crown through the criminal history has his birth date 1990. That’s an error by the psychologist I’d expect because he calls him a 24 year old man on 18 March 2015. That can’t be right if he was born in 1989.

MAYNE: My understanding is, your Honour, it is 1989 which is the date on the front sheet of the record.

OFFENDER: When I come into the gaol ..(not transcribable).. 1990 by mistake, they just haven’t changed it.

HIS HONOUR: I’m interrupting my remarks on sentence just to point out some anomalies in the matter that I hadn’t picked up in the rush to try to complete four or five sentence matters today that I heard. But his criminal history says he was born in 1989, the Court Attendance Notices say that he was born in 1990, so it makes him 25 years of age. Is that right?

MAYNE: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Is that right, ma’am?

MAYNE: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well the psychologist is then wrong in his report in reporting the prisoner to be a 24 year old man based upon the information that he had.


	
	But what is important is he’s a relatively young man still, raised in the “inner west” suburb, I would call it the inner southern suburb, of Waterloo. He has had a somewhat unfortunate upbringing. He was raised by his grandmother. He suffered some hardship as a small child and had to be placed in the Department of Community Services’ care, and essentially his main maternal influence has been his grandmother, who is with him today and has stood by him throughout the years and supported him materially by endeavouring to obtain for him an education. The prisoner was in fact separated from his mother for a 10 year period until he was 13, having been placed in his grandmother’s care at the age of three. As I understand the chronology, he went back to his mother after a falling out with his grandmother, but the reconciliation with his mother was short-lived.
	
	
	He relocated to Queensland or moved to Queensland at some point. He displayed evidence of antisocial behaviour and eventually came back to live with his grandmother when he was about 16. His mother died suddenly and unexpectedly when he was aged 19 years. His grandmother is quite ill at the present time.
	
	
	The prisoner was educated at a “private primary school” in Marrickville as it is described. The prisoner himself describes the school as “pretty good.” He seemed to enjoy that school. He has been diagnosed through his education with the disorder of dyslexia and obviously has had a great deal of difficulty in his reading and writing whilst at school. He attended St Mary’s Cathedral High School, which is a very good high school, for some short time, obviously paid for by his grandmother. But he did not apply himself. He essentially left school as I would understand the chronology he gave, in year 7.
	
	
	He has had little educational opportunity living in the Waterloo area. It is a hard, tough area. As I have already pointed out, a great deal of serious crime is committed there, particularly crime of the character with which I am concerned, and it was no shock to read in the report that he associated with what are described as antisocial peers. It must be fairly said of course that he has to take responsibility for his own conduct. It may be that the people that he describes, or the psychologist describes, as antisocial peers might have described him likewise as an “antisocial peer,” but he noted that Waterloo was a “rough area” and he developed a code of relationship with people of that area, which basically has contributed it would seem to the attitudes he has that have contributed to his criminal history.
	
	
	He was in a relationship with a woman for a period of time. There are two children from that relationship. He apparently plays no role in their lives.
	
	
	He has been a user of cannabis and alcohol since an early age. He moved on to heroin and amphetamines and has had a long history of heroin use. He has been prescribed drugs such as OxyContin, sometimes referred to by drug dealers as ‘hillbilly heroin’. He was actually taking OxyContin for the purposes of recovering from a wounding of his abdomen by a samurai sword that he claimed required him to spend nine months in hospital and in fact required him to wear a colostomy bag for a period of time. In any event, being prescribed OxyContin would not have helped him from remaining, once he got out of medical care, off heroin and he went back to the heroin use. I am told by his counsel then, on the basis of the history provided to the psychologist I am prepared to accept, that in part his commission of these crimes was to obtain money to buy prohibited drugs for himself. He was heavily dependent on prohibited drugs at the time of the commission of the relevant offences. He claimed to the psychologist he weighed only 65 kilograms when arrested, but he now presents in a much healthier state. He has remained in custody he says trying to avoid the use of drugs and has been taking some prescription medication to control his craving for drugs.
	
	
	He has had no significant brain injuries. He has a family history of anxiety and depression. He has a drug history that would be the diagnostic threshold for substance use disorder including the use of cannabis and stimulants, as well as opioids. He has evidence of antisocial personality disorder and a conduct disorder at the age of 15 years. He has a pervasive history on his own account of non-conformity, impulsivity, irritability, recklessness and irresponsibility.
	
	
	With regard to these offences, he claimed that these were a departure from his “normal” offending in terms of their seriousness and harmfulness, and thus he will understand why more significant penalties will be imposed upon him for these matters than would be imposed upon offences of the character that he previously committed.
	
	
	With regard to psychometric testing, which is the real importance of psychologists’ reports and the part of the psychologists’ reports that are most helpful to a court, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (2nd edition) actuarial assessment was made and his performance placed him in what was described by the psychologist in the “average” range of the 30th percentile. As I would understand it, that percentile is a reflection upon persons of his own age. His verbal performance however was much lower than his non‑verbal visual intellectual skills. His verbal performance put him at the 19th percentile but his non-verbal visual intellectual skills placed him at the 50th percentile, so in other words he has natural abilities, but his educational limitations obviously restrict his capacity to perform in tests that are in many instances a reflection of educational achievement.
	
	
	The psychologist also completed with the prisoner the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. This is a self-report questionnaire which assesses many things including personality and other disorders. His most elevated scores on the personality scales were for depressive, negativistic and antisocial personality matters, so it reflects what the history states. He had a “notable elevation on the severe personality scales for borderline personality.” His highest elevation on the scales of clinical syndromes were for anxiety and drug dependence, and his major depression scale was elevated as well. These are, as the psychologist says, consistent with his self‑reporting. His borderline personality disorder, if it be such, will need further investigation.
	
	
	The psychologist concludes that the prisoner is a man who has lived in a subculture where violence and criminality are respected. His learning difficulties at school impeded the likelihood of successful diversion from antisocial behaviour, and aided by substance dependence this has affected his capacity to control his behaviour, but he did not justify or speak dismissively of the particular crimes with which I am concerned.
	
	
	The psychologist states,
	


“This may be Mr Weston’s first opportunity in his adult life to pause, reflect and consider. There is much work to be done to overcome his poor self‑regulation, his criminal attitudes, his vulnerability to substance abuse and his employment prospects. A solid case management plan will be important in remediating these issues prior to Mr Weston’s community release.”


	
	He also will need alcohol and other drug counselling, and he would perhaps benefit from avoiding the Waterloo/Redfern area. Although if he grew up there and his grandmother is still alive and lives there he will naturally gravitate back to that area. But he will do so at the risk of succumbing to the temptations that have pervaded his life beforehand. That having been said, the prisoner’s background is to be fairly said one where his grandmother has endeavoured to assist him as best she can, but regrettably the prisoner has grown up in an environment and developed an attitude which has ultimately led to the matters with which I am concerned.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner I have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Of course, these are crimes that require emphasis to be given on general and personal deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the prisoner, making him accountable for his crimes and ensuring that there is adequate punishment. I am still obliged, of course, to promote his rehabilitation. His criminal history in the context of his age is not something that disqualifies him from consideration of matters that are always pertinent in the sentencing of offenders. The Court of Criminal Appeal in a number of cases, particularly a case such as Blackman and Walters from 2001, have considered a line of authority, perhaps commencing with the South Australian decision of Yardley v Betts, that asserts that in sentencing offenders, punishment is not always to be the norm, although of course punishment will be severe for significant criminality. Promoting the rehabilitation of offenders is a relevant consideration, because it is in the community interest that offenders eventually be rehabilitated, be persuaded from offending when they are at large, as much as it is in the interests of the prisoner.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner I am required, as the submissions of both the Crown and the defence have identified, to have regard to the guideline judgment from 1999 of Henry & Ors v The Queen, which I will come back to in a moment. Counsel for the accused took me through matters I have already identified, the escalating character of the criminal behaviour of the prisoner, his relatively young age to an extent, the fact that he is supported by his grandmother, although that has not prevented him from offending, the fact that his background is very much fashioned by the social circumstances in which he has lived.
	
	
	It is submitted on his behalf that his prospects of rehabilitation are still positive, particularly if he is able to overcome his dependence on drugs, and it is acknowledged in the submissions that - bearing in mind I am concerned with three offences committed at different times - by reference to what are the general principles enunciated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly in the majority judgment at [45], I am required to reflect the totality of the criminality by some partial accumulation, which I will do. The Crown referred to Henry, as I have earlier said, and basically said things that were in accord with what had been put by the defence counsel. There had been an escalation in his offending, this was serious offending, the victims were vulnerable, and it was a case where specific and general deterrence obviously had a role to play in the sentencing process.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that the guideline judgment in Henry involves a decision that pre-dates the guideline judgment in relation to Thomson and Houlton. The particular guideline promulgated by the learned Chief Justice at [162] of the judgment (see [1999] NSWCCA 111) points to what are said to be by his Honour common features of armed robberies with which the court was concerned, limited degree of planning, limited if any actual threat, limited if any actual violence but a real threat thereof, young offender with no or little criminal history, a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, victim in a vulnerable position such as a taxi driver, small amount taken and a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.
	
	
	Here of course the plea of guilty has strong utilitarian benefit in accordance with the guideline judgment. I propose to give the prisoner a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence in relation to each offence in accordance with that guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. I am very mindful of course that the learned Chief Justice in reviewing the cases pointed to aggravating and mitigating factors, particularly matters set out in [170] which might require consideration of the starting point above or below what was said to be the range of appropriate penalty for the guideline. The guideline was stated at [165] to require sentences for an offence of the character identified “above” - that is a reference to [162] - which would generally fall between four and five years for the full term. It is to be pointed out of course that the guideline is concerned with one offence. Relevant too are the observations of Wood CJ at CL at [273] of Henry, as to the lack of planning of some of the offending and the prospects of rehabilitation. He is certainly not at the ‘crossroads’.
	
	
	Here I am concerned with three offences and whilst there is greater utilitarian benefit than identified in the guideline, of course in this particular matter we have the fact of the criminal history of the prisoner showing past convictions for dishonesty, past convictions for violence, past periods of imprisonment including the granting of non‑parole periods and the grant of bonds to be of good behaviour which were breached, admittedly three or four years ago.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that subsequent to Henry, in relation to guideline judgments it has been said that guidelines are precisely that, to assist in structuring sentencing discretion. They are not “tram lines.” I am also very mindful of the observations of Chief Justice Spigelman at [10] where he referred to the “unreported” case of Lattouf and the public interest, reflected upon by Acting Chief Justice Mahoney as he then was, that there was a public interest in the sentencing process to maintain a residual discretion of the sentencing judge, and of course there was the need to ensure that general principles by their nature are adjusted to the individual case to ensure that justice is achieved.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, I have been provided with statistics. They do not provide a great deal of information. The number of cases are within the range of statistics from 2007 to 2014 for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon or robbery in company. Both offences of course are covered by s 97(1). The statistics show in the case of 1,497 cases, which is quite a large sample I hasten to say, much larger than many of the samples provided, the range of sentences will be from approximately 12 months through to 12 years, reflecting obviously a range of circumstances. The mean period would appear to be in the vicinity of around about four years, but again whether that is for individual offences or one of a series of offences is difficult to gauge. Although I have also been provided with statistics, reflecting much the same figures I hasten to say, for what are described as “multiple offences” for sentence.
	
	
	Statistics do not tell anywhere near the full story. In the decision of Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at the very early stage of Chief Justice Spigelman’s career as Chief Justice, he reflected upon the inadequacy of statistics as was reflected in Henry. They are of limited use, he said. They are less useful than surveys of decided cases, caution needs to be exercised in using statistics although they can ensure consistency in sentencing, they provide some information in relation to general sentencing trends in an appropriate range, but they do not provide full particulars. Statistics in relation to sentences for particular offences also do not reflect some other factors that can never be known. A good example to my mind has always been the offence of accessory after the fact for murder. One will see the statistics for sentences for that offence see many good behaviour bonds or suspended sentences being imposed. But what the statistics do not tell you is that most people convicted of accessory after the fact for murder are usually charged principally with murder at the start. They plead guilty to the accessorial offence after having been in custody sometimes for 18 months or two years awaiting trial and thus the ultimate penalty imposed does not actually reflect the time they spend in custody. However, be that as it may, the statistics provide some general guide.
	
	
	I was not taken to any particular matters under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that reflected as aggravating factors. This was a case where the prisoner’s offending involved what could be called “little planning”, but it is to be remembered that when he committed the first offence, even if that was an offence where he took the time to arm himself with a knife, he did not give himself much time to plan. After he committed that offence he returned two days later to commit two offences on the one day, a few hours apart, with the same modus operandi, reflecting in relation to the second two offences a greater degree of premeditation, if not planning. Of course, as I said earlier, the prisoner committed these offences in the full glare, if that is the correct expression, of CCTV footage with minimal attempt to disguise his face. Ultimately he was fore-doomed to be arrested.
	
	
	The s 21A(3) matters to my mind are ultimately found on balance to be that the prisoner has expressed contrition for his actions through his plea and in his representations to the psychologist, although they are not tested. I accept that his plea of guilty is of course a mitigating factor for which he receives a discrete penalty. I cannot conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I think it is far too early to come to that conclusion.
	
	
	I cannot conclude that he is unlikely to reoffend. I do not conclude, of course, that his criminal history, is in fact an aggravating factor, as it is understood, pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act. But of course it does not entitle him to any particular leniency.
	
	
	I detect in his discussion of his offending with the psychologist and discussion of his background some insight on behalf of the prisoner. He is not an unintelligent man. As I pointed out, he has got a reasonable score in relation to non-verbal intellectual functioning which is an artefact of what I would call natural intelligence. But, again, he is limited very much by educational opportunity that has been denied him. That having been said, I am prepared to accept as a mitigating factor that his crimes are not planned offences or “organised criminal offences.”
	
	
	Going back to the objective facts, which is always a starting point for any sentencing exercise, the truth of the matter is they are serious offences, albeit committed in daylight. He put the victims in fear. I cannot find beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to harm them, but he was committed enough to make demands for money and on one occasion verbally threatened his victim. It seems to me in attributing appropriate penalties that the penalty for the last offence in time by way of period of imprisonment, the starting point of which will be six years imprisonment, should be greater than the starting point for the terms of imprisonment in relation to the other offences.
	
	
	I have determined that the starting date of the sentence for the last offence in time should commence 12 months after the commencement of the sentence for the first offence in time. I have determined that the starting point in relation to the first offence in time should be five years imprisonment and with a 25% discount the term of imprisonment should be three years and nine months. As I seek to achieve a non‑parole period effectively of three years, I will fix a non-parole period of three years in relation to that sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the two offences committed on 11 July, the starting point for the first offence, the attempted robbery, is to be four years and six months. That will be a sentence of three years and four months. I propose to fix a non‑parole period of two years for that sentence, that sentence commencing 12 months into the first sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the last offence in time, the starting point for the sentence for that offence shall be six years with a discount of 25%. The total sentence for that, and it will be four and a half years, I will fix a non-parole period of two years.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the fact that I cannot find that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend, I have determined that there should be a finding of ‘special circumstances’. The psychologist’s report points to particular matters that will require professional assistance to be given to the prisoner. This is the most significant term of imprisonment that has been imposed upon him. He will need professional assistance to adjust to community living having served a substantial term in custody, certainly greater than has been previously granted (see R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, at 120-121 per Wood J). I am mindful that he has been in breach of bonds in the past, though I note he was previously granted parole which he successfully negotiated. The truth of the matter is, as the psychologist pointed out, the prisoner himself has acknowledged the need for him to in effect take “time out,” my words, to reassess his life. He does need to pause and reflect and consider where he is, because if he wants to go out into the community armed with a knife or a gun threatening people in order to obtain drugs for himself, he can only expect greater and more severe sentences to be imposed upon him. The one matter that does mitigate against a more significant sentence in my view is the fact that he is not so old to be beyond redemption.
	
	
	Thus having taken into account all the relevant submissions, I make the following orders. If you could stand up please, Mr Weston.
	
	
	In relation to the first offence in time, that is sequence 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non‑parole period of three years. That is to date from 15 July 2014 and will expire on 14 July 2017, at which date you will be eligible for release to parole. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of nine months and that balance of sentence will expire on 14 April 2018.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of the attempted armed robbery committed on 11 July, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two years. That will commence on 15 July 2015 and expire on 14 July 2017. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of one year four months. That balance of sentence will expire on 14 November 2018.
	
	
	In relation to the last offence in time, that is the armed robbery matter which is sequence 3, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years by way of non-parole period that will commence on 15 July 2015 and it will expire likewise on 14 July 2017. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years and six months, and that balance of sentence will expire on my calculation on 14 January 2020. You will be eligible for release to parole on 14 July 2017. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released on that date. It will depend upon your performance in custody.
	
	
	Any technical matters, Mr Crown?
	
	
	MURRAY: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters from you, Ms Mayne?
	
	
	MAYNE: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The effective total sentence I have imposed is five and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. You will be eligible for release to parole on 14 July 2017. The balance of sentence on my calculation will expire on 14 January 2020. If you are released to parole, commit offences on parole or you fail to comply with the conditions of parole, the Parole Authority will revoke your parole and you will go back into custody for such period as the parole authority fixes. Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much, Mr Weston, I wish you well for the future.

	The sixth defendant brings an application for summary dismissal of the proceedings against him pursuant to r 13.4(1) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) on the basis that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.
	
	
	The current pleading in these proceedings, the Amended Statement of Claim filed on 13 November 2014, recites that the sixth defendant was “formerly employed” by a company no longer a party to these proceedings (paragraph 7) but the only reference to the sixth defendant is set out in a statement alleged to have been made by the fourth defendant as follows:
	


“Yes everything that Phil [the fifth defendant] said is true. We have a long list on David Wayne. David Wayne threatened to murder us. The Police heard the murder threats. Phil, Shaun [the sixth defendant] and I are prepared to sign statements that David Wayne threatened to murder us.” (paragraph 9.2)


	
	This is the only reference to any statement involving the sixth defendant, although paragraph 9 commences with a claim that:
	


“Statements were made by the Fourth and Fifth defendants in person at this meeting and Sixth Defendants [sic] statements were presented to the meeting as irrefutable evidence that the Plaintiff made murder threats and the matter was now subject to a NSW Police Investigation.”


	
	There is no further particularisation of what those statements were, whether they were oral or in writing, whether the sixth defendant was even present at the meeting, or, if he was present at the meeting, whether he said or did anything at the meeting to indicate his endorsement of the statements made by the fifth defendant.
	
	
	The concept of publication is broad. In Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 364 Isaacs J said, citing R v Paine (1910) AC 4:
	


“If one repeat and another write a libel, and a third approve what is wrote, they are all makers of it; for all persons who concur, and show their assent or approbation to do an unlawful act, are guilty: so that murdering a man’s reputation by a scandalous libel may be compared to murdering his person; for if several are assisting and encouraging a man in the act, though the stroke was given by one, yet all are guilty of homicide.”


	
	However, there is nothing in the pleading, the “particulars of communication” or other particulars provided by the plaintiff to date to identify how it is that the sixth defendant authorised, endorsed or otherwise published the matter complained of. It does not appear to be in dispute that he was not present at the meeting (Annexure A, the attendance list referred to in paragraph 9 of the Amended Statement of Claim, shows that he was not present), and it is clear that there is no allegation that he spoke any words: Wayne v Owners Corporation SP64622 (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 245 at [16].
	
	
	The submissions on behalf of the plaintiff appear to acknowledge this, in that he seeks to reopen his previous application for interrogatories concerning publication. I have already refused the plaintiff’s application in this regard (Wayne v Owners Corporation SP64622 (No 2)) and I do not propose, particularly since the revised questions to be asked are not specified, to accede to the plaintiff’s latest request (set out in paragraph 20 of his submissions) that the proceedings “should proceed to interrogation and discovery” so that he may discover what publications, if any, the sixth defendant made.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s submissions alternatively are that by referring to “irrefutable evidence”, the fourth and fifth defendants impliedly or expressly including the sixth defendant as a publisher.
	
	
	The way in which the pleading is framed is simply a statement that the sixth defendant was a publisher of the whole of the matter complained of, although that cannot have been the case; he was not even present when the defamatory words were spoken. Where a person has contributed to a publishing process, liability as a publisher will not ordinarily be established unless such a person has assented to its publication in some kind of final form: Dank v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1938 at [4], citing Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2014] NSWCA 288. While this situation generally arises where a claim is brought against a source or contributor to part of a media publication, where liability of that contributor or source for the whole publication is claimed, the same principles apply to any publication where (as is the case here) a person is sued for publications part or most of which have clearly been made by other persons.
	
	
	The precise nature of the case pleaded against the sixth defendant has never been satisfactorily delineated. The time for specifying what publication he actually made, and/or the circumstances in which he authorised the publication of one or more of the other defendants, has now passed. Any application to include any fresh publication must be met with a limitations defence: Linnell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 20 at [24]. The only basis upon which the plaintiff can bring this claim is on the basis that the sixth defendant authorised it, and these are the particulars that the plaintiff has consistently failed to supply.
	
	
	The plaintiff has been on notice since this application was first foreshadowed on 18 December 2014 of these problems and has failed to identify with precision, either by way of particulars or in submissions, the publications the sixth defendant is alleged to have made and/or authorised.
	
	
	I note that the defects in pleading in these proceedings mirror the defects first identified by McCallum J in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2013] NSWSC 1101, where the first and sixth defendants moved to strike out a claim where they were fixed with publication of the whole of the matter complained of when they were at best minor contributors. It was following the failure of the plaintiff to administer those interrogatories that the proceedings were struck out permanently. McCallum J then refused a further application to join this defendant on the basis of authorisation: Dank v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd.
	
	
	The plaintiff in these proceedings has followed the same pattern of failing to identify with precision the precise publications and/or authorisations of publications necessary for the sixth defendant to be a party to these proceedings. The sixth defendant should not be required to continue to guess as to the nature and extent of the publications he is asserted to have made.
	
	
	Accordingly, the proceedings will be struck out against the sixth defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff has also sought to canvass costs orders made in circumstances where he was not able to attend court through illness. No new material is put before the court; the plaintiff simply reargues his case. I do not propose to revisit those orders.
	
	
	The plaintiff should provide an amended statement of claim deleting the claim against the sixth defendant. A further timetable will be set when this has been done.

2766139,R v Gordon Reginald Cramp [2015] NSWSC 271,"Judgment


	
	Introduction
	
	
	Gordon Reginald Cramp was convicted by a jury of the murder on 21 February 2013 of Lance Hargreaves. Mr Hargreaves had died when his spinal chord was completely severed by a stab through the neck. Mr Cramp gave evidence denying that he had struck this blow. The guilty verdict necessarily entailed a rejection of the critical parts of Mr Cramp’s evidence concerning the elements of the offence. There is no agreed statement of facts and it is therefore necessary for me to determine those which are relevant to the task of sentencing him. The facts emerge from the evidence of witnesses, whose accounts were reliable as to the important matters though, in some respects, their recollections may be mistaken; as to other matters, several witnesses were likely not telling the truth. As to any matter adverse to Mr Cramp which is susceptible of doubt, I have given him the benefit of that doubt, subject to the inferences following from the verdict of the jury.
	


Facts


	
	The facts of the killing itself are straight forward. At about 4am on 21 February 2013 Mr Cramp went to the workplace where he had formerly been employed. He had two knives with him, carried in a small bag. Mr Hargreaves was at work on the overnight shift. Using one of the knives, Mr Cramp stabbed Mr Hargeaves through the neck, severing his spinal cord. He immediately dropped to the ground and was dead very shortly after. Aside from it being self-evident that Mr Cramp had been angered in some way, perhaps by an earlier exchange with Mr Hargreaves, his motive for killing him is ultimately a matter of speculation. It is, at all events, of little moment. Given the nature of the blow, in which the knife went completely through Mr Hargreave’s neck from side to side, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was inflicted with the intention of killing him.
	
	
	Although the preceding events do not, to my mind, shed any real light on why Mr Cramp killed Mr Hargreaves or upon his frame of mind at the time, I should set out the salient features to provide the context for the offence itself. Unsurprisingly, it is not altogether easy to reconcile the accounts of all the witnesses who were present at the yard at the material time and I have not troubled to undertake any analysis of the differences. The following is sufficiently accurate for present purposes.
	
	
	In the early morning of 21 February 2013 Mr Cramp was collected by a friend, Mr Seth Roberts, who drove him to the latter’s home in Werrington. Shortly after they entered the premises Mr Cramp became distressed about difficulties he was experiencing in his relationship with his partner. He had brought with him a small shoulder bag. Whilst in Mr Roberts’ premises Mr Cramp went into the kitchen and injected ice into his arm and also smoked couple of cones of marijuana. He was there for about an hour. He then asked Mr Roberts to drive him to his former workplace at Solveco (a waste storage and destruction plant) to “pick up”, meaning that he wished to obtain some drugs. Mr Roberts agreed. They left at about 4am. Mr Cramp left behind (though Mr Roberts only discovered this on his eventual return) a mobile phone, a wallet and two knife sheaths from which he had removed the knives, placing them in his bag. He said he brought the knives from his home because they were in the cupboard and “I knew I was walking along roads that had, you know, countryside roads; I thought I would take them in case I needed them for protection”. (Mr Cramp said that he took one knife out of the sheath to take with him and left the other in its sheath at the house. I accept Mr Roberts’ evidence that he found only the sheaths when he returned and, accordingly, am satisfied that Mr Cramp took both knives with him, leaving the sheaths behind. Nothing of significance turns on this difference.) One was described by Mr Cramp as “an army style knife” and the other as a “US military style knife”. He said that he did not carry the knife in its sheath because he “wasn’t thinking clearly” as he had “just been smoking pot, shooting up ice”. Whether he was thinking clearly or not, I infer that he removed the knives from the sheaths because he had some idea that he might use one or both of them and did not wish to be hampered by the sheaths.
	
	
	Mr Roberts parked his car at the front of Solveco’s premises perhaps 40 or 50 metres from the front gate and waited in the car whilst Mr Cramp went into the yard, a little time later coming out, calling Mr Roberts to come inside. He had his bag with him. When Mr Roberts entered the premises he noticed a Mr Maizen, one of the truck drivers, and they had a brief conversation next to Mr Maizen’s truck. Mr Cramp and Mr Roberts went to the lunchroom, the former coming out shortly after and speaking with Mr Maizen. Mr Maizen said that Mr Cramp asked him whether “Bob” [Peterson] was at the yard. Mr Maizen told him in effect that he did not know and that he had to go. Mr Cramp made some insulting remarks about other employees and promised to get him a pay rise, an absurd suggestion given his situation. Mr Maizen did not respond to this conversation, going a short time later to the lunchroom for a cup of tea. As he walked out of the lunchroom to go to the toilet shortly after, he saw Mr Cramp walk out of the locker rooms and stab the lid of one of the Otto bins lined up against the wall of the lunchroom with a large bladed hunting knife, he thought over a foot long and close to two inches in width. Mr Maizen did not say anything to Mr Cramp but walked past him to the toilet and returned to his truck. He saw Mr Cramp climb on the back of a tipper truck and, reaching above his head, holding orange coloured wires in one hand and the knife in the other, tried to cut the wires to the video security camera near that point. Mr Maizen asked him what he was doing but Mr Cramp did not respond. Shortly afterwards, Mr Roberts saw Mr Cramp climb a large steel post to which a security video camera was attached and start pulling on the wires of the camera. He was holding a knife in his hand. This went on for a minute or two. Mr Cramp then jumped down from the post and walked back into the lunchroom. Mr Roberts asked him why he was doing it and he said, “I had to do it”.
	
	
	Mr Hargreaves was in the lunchroom watching television and he and Mr Cramp had a conversation which, to Mr Roberts, seemed like a chat between old work mates. Mr Cramp then left the lunchroom again and called out called out to someone, ""Come over here”. Mr Roberts thought that Mr Cramp talked with someone but he did not hear what was said. A Mr Woodyatt, who was on the same shift as Mr Hargreaves, said that Mr Cramp asked him to call Mr Peterson and he refused. It seems to me that this is the conversation to which Mr Roberts referred. (Although Mr Woodyatt – whose recollection was somewhat confused as a result, I think, of later events which disturbed him greatly – placed it, as I understand his evidence, in the lunchroom, I prefer Mr Roberts’ evidence on this point, but this does not matter.) Mr Woodyatt noticed that Mr Cramp was carrying a bag hanging around his neck or shoulder. He went out of sight and had a cigarette. Mr Cramp returned to the lunchroom and asked Mr Hargreaves to make a phone call to Mr Peterson but Mr Hargreaves also refused. Mr Cramp became insistent, Mr Hargreaves refused again, got up holding a magazine and walked out to the front gate to his car, parked a short distance outside. Mr Cramp and Mr Roberts walked out just behind him. It seemed to Mr Roberts that Mr Cramp was speaking to Mr Hargreaves in an agitated tone but he could not recall what was said. Mr Hargreaves kept saying, “No” in a firm voice. Mr Hargreaves opened the car door and put the magazine inside, at which time Mr Roberts was talking once more to Mr Maizen at his truck. Mr Cramp and Mr Hargreaves were standing at the car talking as before. Mr Maizen drove out of the yard, said goodbye to them and drove away. Eventually Mr Hargreaves in a firm loud tone said “Enough”. He locked his car and walked back through the main gate, Mr Cramp following him.
	
	
	Wooden pallets were stacked in the yard between where Mr Roberts was standing and the lunchroom towards which Mr Hargreaves and, it appeared, Mr Cramp were walking. There was a narrow winding path through the stacks and Mr Roberts lost sight of Mr Hargreaves and Mr Cramp. Very shortly after that he heard and partly saw what he thought was a scuffle and the sound of someone falling over and Mr Cramp yelled to him, “Get out and go to the car”. He was still behind the pallets at this point. Mr Roberts turned and ran to the car followed by Mr Cramp who was yelling, “Get out of here”. He also heard him shout, “You better not say anything” but Mr Roberts did not know to whom he was speaking. Shortly after Mr Cramp left the yard and got into the passenger seat of Mr Roberts car, holding the bloodstained knife with which, I am satisfied, he had just murdered Mr Hargreaves. Mr Roberts asked, “Did you stab Lance?” but got no reply. He asked, “Why did you do it?” but Mr Cramp just told him, “Drive and get out of here”.
	
	
	In the meantime, Mr Woodyatt had finished his cigarette and came back towards the door to the lunchroom. As he did so, he saw Mr Hargreaves on the ground bleeding about five metres away. This was perhaps 10 or 15 minutes after he had left Mr Cramp to go out of sight. Mr Woodyatt said as he was walking towards the body, he heard someone yell out, “Adam, you fat cunt, where are you” but he did not recognise the voice. He ran away and hid under an excavator. Shortly after this that he heard a car start up and leave. He (mistakenly) thought that someone may still have been in the yard and remained hidden until about 15 or 20 minutes later he heard Mr Jones, another employee, turn up. After a brief exchange, Mr Woodyatt, who was in a state of panic, ran away, got his car and drove up the road looking for a Police car or an ambulance. I am satisfied that the person who yelled out to Mr Woodyatt was Mr Cramp.
	
	
	Mr Roberts had driven some distance at Mr Cramp’s direction when he was told to stop. Mr Cramp alighted from the vehicle and walked away. Mr Roberts then returned home. He found out about the death of Mr Hargreaves on the radio on his way to work later in the morning. (Mr Roberts gave a somewhat more elaborate account of these events to the police when he was interviewed on 21 and 22 February 2013. These differences are not of any present importance.)
	
	
	The wound was estimated by the pathologist to be 12 cm long, going from right to left and cutting through the space between the second and third cervical vertebrae, completely severing the spinal cord.
	
	
	I should mention that Mr Cramp had visited the Solveco yard earlier that night, at sometime between midnight and 1am. Mr Woodyatt saw (but did not hear) a conversation between Mr Hargreaves and Mr Cramp at this time. Mr Woodyatt asked Mr Hargreaves what he wanted to speak to him about. Mr Hargreaves told him, “I couldn’t understand him. He just kept on raving on about, ‘you owe me big time’”.
	
	
	Four video cameras had been interfered with by Mr Cramp. Although for the purposes of assessing Mr Cramp’s evidence, the times and sequence at which this occurred was important, this does not presently matter much. The video record shows camera 4 was the first to be interfered with (but it was only dislodged and continued to record the ground) at 4:38am; camera 1, one of the two caged cameras at the front gate stopped at 4:39:50; camera 3, the other camera on this post stopped at 4:40:03; camera 2 at another location stopped recording at 4:49:06. Mr Cramp said in his evidence that, when he entered the premises, he saw two surveillance cameras on a post and cut the wires to them because he wanted to obtain drugs from Mr Maizen and did not want him to be in trouble for supplying the drugs to him. He said (but this cannot be correct) the last camera dislodged was camera 4 because it might have recorded Mr Maizen’s presence at the yard, after which he departed with Mr Roberts. This account was necessarily rejected by the jury.
	
	
	Although a warrant for Mr Cramp’s arrest was issued on 22 February 2013, he presented himself, at the Windsor Police Station on 2 March 2013 and was taken into custody. Neither of the two knives carried by Mr Cramp on the night of Mr Hargreaves’ murder has been found.
	
	
	It is not necessary to deal with Mr Cramp’s evidence in detail. He said, and I am prepared accept it as likely, that he went to Solveco in the hope of obtaining drugs. He said he asked for some amphetamines from Mr Maizen who told him to go to the office and wait whilst he emptied his truck. He said that, whilst he was waiting, he became bored and, taking the knife from his bag, stabbed the lid of one of the wheelie bins in frustration. This evidence may have been truthful. Mr Cramp deposed to conversations with Mr Woodyatt and Mr Hargreaves concerning the earlier theft of tools from the yard and about contacting Mr Peterson. He said that after stabbing the bin he walked over to the camera on the post underneath the shed, and decided to disable it so that there would be no video record of him and Mr Maizen being at the yard together, since Robbie Peterson (and perhaps others) would know that the only reason for him being there was to try to get drugs from Mr Maizen and he did not want Mr Maizen to get into trouble. Of course the other two persons who would have known that he was there at the same time as Mr Maizen were Mr Hargreaves and Mr Woodyatt. Mr Cramp also said that he was thinking that Mr Maizen might have had some products that he brought back from a job and he was concerned that if he was seen walking out with any of the products from the factory, that Mr Maizen would get in strife, another reason then for disabling the video cameras. Mr Cramp said that he took the knife out of the leather sheath and, brought it with him to Solveco because he “might have to cut open a pallet or something and look through it”. He said that he did not need the sheath because he carried the knife in the bag. He said that he was not thinking clearly because of the ice and marijuana he had consumed. There is some evidence suggestive of irrationality, but it goes no further than this.
	
	
	Of course, there can be only one reason for attempting to disable the video cameras, namely that he did not want them to record what he may have intended to do. Perhaps he thought that disabling them might also expunge the recordings already made. At the highest however, this suggests that he intended to do something illegal or, at all events, that he did not wish the management of Solveco to be aware of, including perhaps that they might think that he was present at the yard hoping to obtain drugs from Mr Maizen and therefore get Mr Maizen into trouble. Since I do not accept Mr Cramp as a credible witness, I am unable to conclude that the reasons he gave for disabling the cameras are more probably true or not, except of course that he did not want a record to be made or kept of what he did or intended to do in the yard. It is not necessary to speculate further about this issue, since I cannot infer (adversely to him) that he disabled the cameras in order, in some way, to either destroy evidence or prevent evidence from being obtained of an intended assault on Mr Hargreaves. On the other hand, I am not prepared to conclude that his actions were irrational and the result of some disordered thinking brought about by the drugs he had injected. Since the inferences reasonably capable of being drawn from this evidence are uncertain, and do not enable a conclusion to be drawn more probably than not that he was acting irrationally, I put the evidence to one side except as forming part of the narrative of events.
	


Assessment of objective seriousness


	
	I am not able to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Cramp took the knives to Solveco for the purpose of killing someone, let alone Mr Hargreaves. However, I have no doubt that, when he followed Mr Hargreaves from his car into the yard and then made his way through the stacked pallets, removing the knife from his bag as he did so, he had it in his mind to kill him. Mr Roberts heard no sounds of discussion, let alone raised voices. Mr Cramp intended no negotiation. There was some form of brief scuffle. Mr Hargreaves was found with his hand in his jacket pocket and had not in any way attacked Mr Cramp. I cannot say what Mr Cramp’s motive was but I am satisfied that he fully intended to do what he did. I am satisfied that after he killed Mr Hargreaves he called out to Mr Woodyatt to check whether he had seen what had happened. Whatever else this portended, it did not suggest a man not in his right mind. Although in fact Mr Woodyatt had not seen the attack, he was in grave danger and his decision not to respond, though made in panic, was a wise one. Mr Cramp left the scene and, in his immediate exchange with Mr Roberts, evidently displayed no emotion, certainly no remorse. Mr Cramp said in evidence that he “could not say he was in his right mind but [although he] was affected by drugs” he agreed he knew what he was doing and had no problems with his memory about what he did. The mere fact that it is not possible to identify a motive does not mean that the killing was unreasoned or the result of some confusion of mind or understanding. I am satisfied that Mr Cramp was not significantly affected, let alone intoxicated, by drugs when he killed Mr Hargreaves. I accept there appears to be some sign of irrationality in some of his conversations that night but I do not consider that this was to such a degree as to afford any mitigation or otherwise affect the seriousness of his crime.
	
	
	The circumstances of this crime demonstrate that Mr Cramp is a dangerous individual and it is necessary that his sentence reflect the need for the protection of the community whilst not, of course, exceeding the punishment called for by the circumstances of the offence itself or amounting to preventative detention. The very inability to identify a motive, to my mind, increases rather than reduces his dangerousness. This conclusion is re-enforced by his criminal record. Leaving aside a number of relatively trivial motor vehicle and drug offences, he was convicted in July 2003 of committing in June 2002 an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. His initial sentence was reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal in July 2004 to an overall term of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 21 June 2002. On his release from prison, he was convicted on 22 September 2008 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and placed on a s 9 bond for three years, then breaching that bond on 10 January 2010 by committing a common assault and contravening an apprehended violence order for which he was imprisoned for 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 months commencing on 28 May 2010. On 9 November 2012 he was charged with another assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was on bail for that offence when he committed the present offence.
	
	
	The circumstances of the malicious wounding charge committed in June 2002 are troubling. The victim was a relative of Mr Cramp’s then de-facto who offered her emotional support during the breakdown of the relationship. On the day in question Mr Cramp was driving near his workplace and saw the victim walking past, skidded to a halt, took a U-turn and came alongside. He took a knife from the glove box, alighted and chased the victim who had seen him and fled. Mr Cramp called, “I’m going to stab you”. When he tried to jump over a fence, Mr Cramp stabbed him in the back to the right side of his spine and said, “I am going to kill you, you dog” reinserting the knife into the victim before pulling it from his back. The victim fell to the ground. Mr Cramp left with his knife, got back into his vehicle and drove away. The victim suffered a lacerated right lung and a perforated right diaphragm with a fractured mid-thoracic right rib. The seriousness of his injuries complicated his recovery and he remained in the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital for a little over a month. He suffered continuing and significant permanent injuries. As here, there was no provocation, the victim was pursued (although in the present case, Mr Hargeaves had not fled), he was attacked with a knife that was to hand, his wounds may well have been fatal, no assistance was offered, and Mr Cramp fled the scene.
	


Subjective features


	
	Mr Cramp did not give evidence on sentence and proffered no evidence as to his subjective factors. The following facts are drawn from the judgments dealing with the 2002 wounding charge. They are not adverse but do not assist him in any significant respect. He was the elder of two children, raised in Western Sydney whose father, with whom he was close, died when he was 15, this resulting in his starting to use illicit drugs. He left school at the age of 15 years having obtained his School Certificate, since when he had been engaged in employment of various kinds. It appears that Mr Cramp commenced using amphetamines in 1990 and became addicted to them. It was accepted that he may have been affected by that drug when he committed the wounding offence. Perhaps somewhat ironically, he completed an anger management course in 2002 and undertook a drug and alcohol rehabilitation. It appears that, on his release from prison after serving his sentence for the maliciously causing grievous bodily harm offence he found employment although, as has already been mentioned, he was unemployed at the time of the present offence. He has had a relationship which, however, ended the day before he killed Mr Hargreaves.
	


Mr Cramp is now almost 40 years of age. He has undertaken a number of courses whilst in prison and his teachers speak well of him.

Victim Impact Statements


	
	Mr Hargreaves’ daughter Lorraine Smith, his partner Karen Buchanan and brother Thomas each made Victim Impact Statements which were read to the Court. They bear eloquent testimony to the generosity and loving kindness which this decent, hard-working man showed to his family and friends, as well as to the dark and unremitting pain and grief they have and continue to have as a result of his appalling death. This Court can do nothing to ease these feelings or lighten their burden, but I wish to acknowledge it and express my personal condolences at their great loss.
	
	
	The whole community is affected by the killing of one of its number. It is an aspect of this important understanding that the Court is required to take into account the harmful impact on the victim’s immediate family as an aspect of this reality. At the same time, no right-minded person would think that it would be appropriate to reduce a sentence for murder even by a day because, as it happened, the victim had no family, was alone and friendless with no one to grieve at his or her death. By parity of reasoning, the sentence cannot be rightly increased because the victim had a family. One life must be valued as much as another and the criminal taking of that life is equally wrong and must be equally punished whatever the family circumstances of the victim might happen to be.
	
	
	Discussion
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment: s 19A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The standard non-parole period is 20 years. These two periods are markers, the maximum sentence being applicable to a case of the gravest seriousness exhibiting features of very great heinousness and the absence of mitigating facts. The Crown has rightly submitted that, although this is indeed a case of great seriousness where the protection of the public must be given considerable weight, a life sentence would not be appropriate. The standard non-parole period of 20 years applies to cases falling into the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However, although this provides a benchmark or signpost to an appropriate non-parole period, it is far from the only element to be taken into account. Many cases of murder occur when there has been no intention to kill but, rather, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Generally speaking, the intention to kill will make the crime more serious than an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Although I would not, as is clear, describe the attack as pre-meditated, it was decided upon significantly, albeit only a short time, before it was undertaken, and required the removal of the knife from the bag Mr Cramp was holding. This is not a case in the worst category, but its objective seriousness is very great. Furthermore, the fact that Mr Cramp is a dangerous man who has already committed an attack of a similar though less serious kind must give rise to an emphasis on the need for personal deterrence to protect the community.
	
	
	This is Mr Cramp’s second extremely violent unprovoked knife which strongly suggests, at least, that his prospects for rehabilitation are not good. I do not say that it is not possible that he might be rehabilitated. It may be that, like many offenders, aging itself will bring about some change of mind and attitude.
	
	
	There is no evidence which might amount to special circumstances justifying a variation of the statutory ratio stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Orders
	
	
	I make the following order:
	



	
	Gordon Reginald Cramp is sentenced to an overall term of 40 years imprisonment commencing on 2 March 2013 comprising a non-parole period of 30 years and a balance of term of 10 years. The offender will be eligible to be considered for parole on 1 March 2043.

2766155,R v Scott (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 458,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The accused makes application for discharge of the jury today, which is 19 March 2015.
	
	
	Today is the seventh day of the trial, the accused having been arraigned before the jury on 10 March 2015 on indictment charging him with murder, his trial having then commenced.
	
	
	The Crown case could not be said to be at an early stage. Indeed we have heard from all of the witnesses, it appears to me, who were present at the scene of the incident which lead to the death of Riley Dehn.
	
	
	In that sense, the substance of the Crown case has already been given and that evidence has been tested. Accordingly the considerations which were referred to in Wu v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 99 do not arise here in the sense that this matter is not an application to be determined at a very early stage of the trial. The Crown case is at least halfway, and probably more than that, complete.
	
	
	The application for the discharge of the jury centres on evidence given yesterday by Russell Payne, a civilian witness.
	
	
	It is of relevance to note the nature of Mr Payne’s evidence, not so much in the substance of what he said but rather in how he said it.
	
	
	Mr Payne is someone who is said to have been sharing premises with the accused, and the accused’s then girlfriend, at the time of the relevant incident.
	
	
	Mr Payne presents as a man with significant intellectual limitations and that is manifested both in his manner of giving evidence and also in his manner of speech.
	
	
	His delivery in evidence is that of a man who struggles to articulate words. He is extraordinarily difficult to follow and comprehend. He is softly and very quietly spoken and he appears to have some sort of impediment which affects the formation of words to the extent that they are very difficult to understand.
	
	
	During the course of his evidence he has had to be asked repeatedly to give answers a second and even a third time. I know from my perspective, as probably the person other than our court reporter who sits closest to him, I have not heard all that he has said, and I struggled greatly to comprehend those parts that I did hear.
	
	
	That is relevant in two ways. Firstly, the evidence was given in an early part of the witness’s testimony. Indeed it came only some five or ten minutes after his evidence commenced, at what is recorded as a couple of pages of the transcript into his evidence.
	
	
	That being the case I think it is reasonable to infer that the jury members, and certainly this is consistent with my experience at that time, had not managed to familiarise themselves with the way that Mr Payne spoke such as to have a better understanding of what it was that he was saying.
	
	
	When the witness gave the relevant evidence, (and it is recorded at transcript 531 from about 35 through to the following page at about line 3,) Mr Payne was speaking as he typically did; very softly and rather quickly, and it was difficult to hear and understand what he said.
	
	
	I certainly heard his comment sitting, as I say, very close to him. That being, “I have known Cycle from in and out of gaol a few times”.
	
	
	When that unresponsive answer was given, the most significant thing that I noted about the atmosphere of the courtroom at the time was that Mr Cavanagh’s sharp intake of breath was audible and his movement to rise from his seat, obviously to make a quite proper objection, could be noted.
	
	
	I observed a couple of the jurors to look at Mr Cavanagh as that occurred but in any other respect none of the jury appeared particularly concerned or troubled or gave any sign that they had heard anything which was in any way out of the ordinary or of particular interest.
	
	
	Although this is just, I suppose, a matter of my experience of the witness, from speaking with both my associate and my tipstaff I know that neither of them heard what Mr Payne said, indeed to the point where my associate was inquiring of my tipstaff by email whether she knew what the evidence had been to explain Mr Cavanagh’s sudden movement.
	
	
	I think there is every chance that the jury did not hear this evidence. It may be that one or two of them did. If that is the case it was a piece of evidence which was rapidly moved on from and, in the context of the whole of the evidence of the trial, it would have very little significance in my view.
	
	
	Whilst lawyers readily understand the risks of reference to “gaol” and so forth, ordinary members of the public generally do not have that same comprehension of bad character evidence and what it may mean.
	
	
	If the jury or some members of the jury heard that evidence it is unlikely, for them, to have the significance that it has for lawyers but, even if it does, I do not agree with the submission that it is incapable of cure.
	
	
	Here there is evidence which is already before the jury which clearly establishes that, certainly as at June 2013, the accused was in custody having been bail refused with respect to this charge. The jury knows that and they have already been warned that they may not draw any conclusions adverse to the accused as a result of that evidence.
	
	
	It seems to me that it would be a very simple matter, without expanding the ostensible scope of that direction, in the summing-up to simply refer the jury to evidence which is before them which makes it plain that the accused has been in custody, and direct them that, regardless of any evidence as to his custodial status at any time, that it is something which they must put out of their mind, and which they cannot allow to prejudice or adversely affect their assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	These Courts have long acted on the principal that jurors will follow directions that are clearly given. It seems to me that if they are given a direction in those terms, whilst it will not draw attention to the unresponsive evidence given by Mr Payne, it will address the principal that evidence as to the accused’s custodial status is essentially neutral and may not be used in any sense which is adverse to him or unfairly adverse to him.
	
	
	If one proceeds on the time honoured understanding that jurors will in fact follow those directions then it seems to me that, whilst there may be prejudice, it is not a prejudice which is incapable of cure, and certainly it is not a prejudice which is such that the accused cannot now receive a fair trial.
	
	
	In my view it is readily able to be remedied. The transcript, should the jury request it in their deliberations, or indeed at any stage before, will be edited so that that reference will be entirely removed from it. That will prevent them being reminded of it or indeed advised of it for those who did not hear the evidence.
	
	
	I think with those two remedies, that is an expansive direction about the accused’s custodial status at any time, and the editing of the transcript to excise the prejudicial portion, I think the accused can well and truly receive a fair trial.
	
	
	Accordingly I do not propose to discharge the jury.

		23 April 2015",2015-03-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766156,R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259,"Judgment


	
	Part way through a pre-trial voir dire hearing, Tony Simmons (“the accused”) and Kieran Moore (“Mr Moore”) applied for an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that they be tried by judge alone. The application was foreshadowed for the first time by the accused on Monday 16 February 2015 at the commencement of the voir dire concerning the admissibility of admissions or statements against interest made by each of them (T 10).
	
	
	The matter was raised for a second time towards the end of the eighth day of the voir dire (3 March 2015). Shortly before 1pm on Wednesday 4 March 2015, Mr Moore was granted leave to file in Court an election under s 132 along with a notice of motion and supporting affidavit. Mr Young SC, who appears for the accused, asked for time “to give my client one further opportunity to consider his position, having heard your Honour’s judgment” (T 314). This was a reference to the judgment that I delivered that morning in relation to the admissibility of admissions made by the accused to undercover police officers: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143 (“Simmons (No 2)”). Shortly after lunch, the accused filed in court a notice of motion and supporting affidavit.
	
	
	The issue was stood over until 9 March to enable the Crown to consider its position. The Crown’s position was complicated. However, the Crown did not consent to a trial by judge alone and so it is necessary to determine whether a judge alone trial is “in the interests of justice”: s 132(4). I heard argument in relation to the application on 9 and 10 March 2015. Further evidence on the application was adduced on 18 March 2015 and further submissions were received on 16 and 18 March 2015.
	
	
	On Tuesday 10 March 2015 I made rulings excluding statements against interest and admissions made by Mr Moore: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189 (“Simmons (No 3)”). On Friday 13 March 2015 the Crown indicated that the Director had ordered no further proceedings in relation to Mr Moore. He was discharged on the indictment and his application for a judge alone trial abated. I understand that he is now to be a prosecution witness.
	
	
	The accused read an affidavit of his solicitor (Matthew Lorkin) affirmed 4 March 2015 and a further affidavit of Mr Lorkin affirmed 9 March 2015. Substantial portions of the second affidavit were not pressed (T 429-431). In addition to the affidavit evidence, the parties agreed that it was necessary to receive all of the evidence that had been tendered on the pre-trial voir dire: see Simmons (No 2) at [46] - [50] and Simmons (No 3) at [13].
	
	
	This comprises a 13 volume brief of evidence (Ex VD 1) as well as 14 separate exhibits (Ex VD 2 – VD 15). Neither party made any reference to Ex VD 2 - VD 15. The parties did not identify with any precision the parts of the 13 volume brief that are relevant to this application. When the matter was first argued, it was unclear which parts of Ex VD 1 will actually be adduced in evidence at the trial and it seemed that the accused had not consulted with the Crown to determine the evidence that the Crown intended to lead (T 425-6, 429-430, 432-434). Submissions were made in relation to parts of the evidence that the Crown Prosecutor later indicated would not be lead at the trial. Following a concession by the Crown on the final day of the first voir dire, it is known that a large amount of the listening device material considered in Simmons (No 2) will not be led at the trial: R v Simmons (No 2) at [151].
	
	
	In the absence of a clear understanding of the material to be led at the trial, it was not possible to make a reasoned assessment of where the “interests of justice” lay. The matter was adjourned to allow the parties time indicate what would, and what would not, be led in the trial proper.
	
	
	Exhibits VD 16, 17 and 18 were tendered on Wednesday 18 March and it is now tolerably clear, at least for the purpose of this application, what evidence is to be led at the trial.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	Sections 131 – 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provide:
	


“131. Trial by jury in criminal proceedings

Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.

132. Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a ""trial by judge order"" ).

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

(a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

(b) the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.

132A. Applications for trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings

(1) An application for an order under section 132 that an accused person be tried by a Judge alone must be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in the Supreme Court or District Court, except with the leave of the court.

(2) An application must not be made in a joint trial unless:

(a) all other accused person apply to be tried by a Judge alone, and

(b) each application is made in respect of all offences with which the accused persons in the trial are charged that are being proceeded with in the trial.

(3) An accused person or a prosecutor who applies for an order under section 132 may, at any time before the date fixed for the accused person’s trial, subsequently apply for a trial by a jury.

(4) Rules of court may be made with respect to applications under section 132 or this section.”


	
	These sections replaced earlier provisions providing for a judge alone trial on 14 January 2011. Section 132 was previously in the same terms as the repealed s 16. Section 16 had, in turn, replaced s 32. The previous provisions (ss 16, 32 and 132) were in substantially the same terms as one another. The introduction of the current version of ss 132-132A made two significant changes to the law. Under the previous regime, a judge alone trial could not be ordered unless an election was made “before the date fixed for the person’s trial”. This requirement was mandatory: R v Perry (1993) 29 NSWLR 589 at 593-594. Attempts to circumvent it (by adjournment of the trial date) were frowned upon although sometimes succeeded: see R v Coles (1993) 31 NSWLR 550 at 553-554. Section 132A maintains the requirement that applications be made in a timely fashion. Applications must be made “not less than 28 days” before the trial date “except with the leave of the Court”.
	
	
	The second change introduced by s 132 concerns the requirement under s 32(3) that the accused could only elect for a judge alone trial if the Director of Public Prosecutions consented. This change was “introduced to remove the former veto power held by the prosecution”: R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [10]; New South Wales Legislative Council, Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, Second Reading Speech (Hansard), 24 November 201 at 28073.
	


Whether leave should be granted


	
	The parties concede that leave under s 132A is required. The Crown does not oppose the grant of leave. In spite of the Crown’s position, the question of whether leave should be granted in the present case is a live one. The application is tardy in the extreme.
	
	
	From the time the trial date was fixed (16 February 2015), the case was mentioned in the arraignments list on four occasions in the second half of 2014. At no stage was the presiding Judge given any indication there may be an application for a judge alone trial.
	
	
	On 4 July 2014, Johnson J confirmed the trial date of 16 February 2015 with a 12 week estimate. It was indicated that there would be pre-trial issues of some substance. Johnson J asked a number of questions in the course of that mention as to the logistics of the hearing and how its smooth running might be facilitated.
	
	
	On 5 September 2014, the matter was again before Johnson J in the arraignments list. Notices of motion had been filed by both accused concerning the objections taken to parts of the prosecution brief. Johnson J anticipated the difficulties that may arise given the length and complexity of the proposed voir dire and observed that jury panels had been organised for 16 February 2015. His Honour vacated the listing of the trial date and listed the pre-trial motions for 16 February 2015 with the trial to follow. No suggestion was made on 5 September 2014 that, depending upon the resolution of the objections that were to be raised on the voir dire, an application for trial by judge alone may follow the pre-trial hearing.
	
	
	The matter came before Fullerton J on 3 October 2014. Mr Stratton SC, appearing on behalf of Mr Moore, but speaking on behalf of all parties indicated that the parties “would be keen to proceed from the pre-trial applications into trial.” Her Honour confirmed the date for the pre-trial applications and enquired whether there was any possibility of using something described as “judge time” in the final months of 2014 to facilitate the smooth running of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. None of the parties were available and her Honour simply confirmed the date for the pre-trial hearing, noting that the trial would proceed after rulings on the voir dire were made. Nothing was said to suggest that the trial would be anything other than a jury trial.
	
	
	Finally, the matter came before Johnson J on 5 December 2014. On that date his Honour announced that I was to be the trial judge. Mr Stratton SC again said “could I confirm my understanding that at the moment the matter is set down for pre-trial hearings … with a view to the trial starting shortly thereafter?” Mr Young SC agreed with the proposition that the 12 week estimate may “get shorter but not longer” although he confirmed it was necessary to maintain the 12 week listing to be “a bit cautious”. However, he expressed the view that “it would be less than that”. His Honour asked the parties whether anything else needed to be raised. Nothing was.
	
	
	Arranging for the attendance of sufficient jury panels to ensure that a trial commences is a matter of some administrative and logistical difficulty. It involves summonses being sent out and significant effort on the part of the Sheriff of New South Wales. Courtrooms with appropriate facilities must be organised and scarce resources allocated accordingly. Members of the public are inconvenienced and no doubt anxious about the prospect of serving on a jury.
	
	
	For that reason, it is important when matters are mentioned before the arraignments judge that the parties provide a clear account of the issues anticipated. Where an application for a judge alone trial is contemplated, it is important for the list judge to know that. It may be that that application can be dealt with in the list court so that it is not a matter determined by the judge who may ultimately preside at such a trial.
	
	
	The purpose of s 132A(1)—and s 32(4) before it—is to avoid the appearance (or actuality) of “judge shopping”. In Perry v The Queen, Gleeson CJ said (at 594):
	


“I have no doubt that one of the legislative purposes underlying s 32(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act is concerned with an important matter of appearances. One of the reasons why the legislation provides that an election for trial without a jury must be made before the date fixed for trial is that if an election could be made on the date fixed for trial, it might appear that accused person were making such election in the light of the knowledge of the trial judge.”

   See also R v Coles at 552-553 (Wood J).


	
	In the second reading speech for the Bill introducing s 132A the Attorney General said:
	


“The new section 132A sets out procedural matters regarding trial by judge orders, including that applications are to be made no less than 28 days before the trial date, except by leave of the court. This is designed to minimise the risk of a party applying for a judge-alone trial on the basis of knowing the identity of the trial judge.”

—New South Wales Legislative Council, Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, Second Reading Speech (Hansard), 24 November 2010 at 28073.


	
	In the present case, there can be no suggestion of “judge shopping”. As I said earlier, the parties have known the identity of the trial Judge since 5 December 2014. That is a considerable time before the 28 day time limit prescribed by s 132A. Thus, it cannot be suggested here that the parties made the application as a result of discovering the identity of the judge.
	
	
	However, matters of appearances are not limited to the identity of the trial judge. The case has thrown up two incidents that, from the point of view of appearances, are unfortunate.
	
	
	On 3 March 2015, Senior Counsel for the accused indicated that he had instructions to make an application for a judge alone trial. He indicated that he would formally make the application by notice of motion the following day although he doubted that “it actually needs a couple of pieces of paper to galvanise the Crown into action in the circumstances”. On 4 March 2015, Senior Counsel had in his possession the formal documents but did not seek to file them until he had taken further instructions:
	


“I’m going to give my client one further opportunity to consider his position, having heard your Honour’s judgment.”


	
	This was a reference to my judgment in R v Simmons (No 2), handed down earlier in the day and in which I made certain remarks about Mr Simmons’ conduct, character and willingness to engage in criminal activity of a large variety of kinds (see for example at [142]-[149]). The appearance, if not actuality, was that Mr Simmons was basing his decision around things I had said earlier in the day. This was a perfectly sound and proper forensic exercise and an appropriate discharge of counsel professional responsibility to his client. However, as I said in the course of the argument, it was an “unedifying spectacle” from the point of view of appearances. It would not have occurred had the application for a judge alone trial been made in advance of the trial and in a timely fashion.
	
	
	The second incident involved the position taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown Prosecutor has taken a fair and principled approach to the application. He acknowledges that this is an unusual case in terms both of the quantity of prejudicial material and the particular manner in which that prejudicial material affects the trial. However when the application first came to be argued on 9 March 2015, I was reserved in the voir dire judgment concerning the admissions made by Mr Moore (R v Simmons (No 3)). Asked whether the Director consented to the application for trial by judge alone, the prosecutor described it as “a rather delicate situation” and continued:
	


“My instructions to oppose, and I need to quite openly inform your Honour, is predicated upon not knowing your Honour’s view in relation to the voir dire matter involving [Mr Moore’s admissions]’s.”

…

“If your Honour took a certain view, or made certain findings of fact in that matter, that it could impact on whether the Crown, the instructions for the Crown to consent or otherwise to the application for judge alone might change.”


	
	The appearance of this is that the Director was seen to be deciding whether or not to consent to an application for a judge alone trial – which is to say determining its position on the “interests of justice” – based on the identity of the trial judge. I must reiterate that I am not being critical of the Crown Prosecutor when I make these remarks. He made the submissions delicately, with admirable candour and on my invitation to speak plainly. However, once again, the appearances are bad. One problem with the matter being raised in this way, although the Crown Prosecutor was clear in eschewing it, was the appearance that some pressure may be placed on the decision maker in relation to findings to be made. (I have now delivered the judgment in Simmons (No 2) and have been advised that there will be no submission made that I should be disqualified from hearing the matter.)
	
	
	If the application for a judge alone trial was determined in advance of the pre-trial hearing, and things were said in the course of a voir dire that prompted or justified an application for the judge to disqualify themselves, that application would be dealt with on its merits. The identity of the trial judge should play no part in the determination of, or election for, a judge alone trial. Such an approach is against the purpose of the legislation and inimical to the appearance of justice.
	
	
	An application for a judge alone trial should be considered from both parties point of view without any reference to the identity of the trial judge. That is so whether the trial judge is part heard in pre-trial hearings or not. If something is said in open court or in a judgment or if information comes to the attention of the parties that might create the appearance or apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge, the application for the judge to be disqualified from hearing the case should be made then.
	
	
	All of this goes to emphasise the problems with making an application under s 132 at such a late stage.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is much to be said for the application for a judge alone trial to be made before other pre-trial issues are considered. While this might potentially give rise to applications based around decisions then made on the voir dire, it avoids the appearances to which I have made reference.
	
	
	The tardiness of the application militates against the grant of leave under s 132A(1). However, the question of leave must also be considered by reference to a number of other significant factors.
	
	
	First, as I have said, the identity of the trial judge was known since early December 2014. The purpose of the 28 day time limit is to avoid the actuality and appearance of judge shopping. That consideration has no meaningful application where the parties were aware of the identity of the trial judge for such a long time before the trial date.
	
	
	Second, it has been put from the bar table (and I accept) that the solicitor for Mr Simmons raised the possibility of a judge alone trial informally with the prosecution at one or more of the mentions before the arraignment Judge. While the matter should have been brought to the attention of the list Judge, I take that matter into account in considering the question of leave.
	
	
	Third, rightly or wrongly, Mr Young SC took the view that the application for a judge alone trial would have been premature in advance of the ruling on the voir dire. I disagree with that stance and, even if the judge hearing the voir dire determined the sequence of applications differently, notice of the possibility of the application should have been made earlier. However I accept that Senior Counsel took a different view and did so in earnest. There was no forensic advantage in hiding the possibility that he may make an application for a judge alone trial. Further, Mr Young SC advised the court of the possibility of the application on the first day of the pre-trial hearing.
	
	
	Fourth, as Mr Stratton SC (then appearing for Mr Moore) pointed out when I raised the question of whether there was jurisdiction to hear the application after the trial had (technically) started (cf s 130(3)(a) Criminal Procedure Act), the trial date was formally vacated by the list Judge on 5 September 2013. His Honour listed the pre-trial hearing for 16 February 2015 noting that it was expected to take “several weeks”. On 5 December 2014 the list Judge confirmed the listing of the pre-trial hearing “with the trial to proceed thereafter”. The situation is not dissimilar to that which arose in R v Coles where Wood J made the following practical observations (at 553):
	


“The initial allocation of a hearing date is often a nominal date. Cases which are fixed for hearing are sometimes not reached, and cases are sometimes adjourned for cause on the date appointed for trial, either because the Crown or the accused is not ready. These cases are then re-fixed. In country circuits, and in other metropolitan courts where there are running lists, there may either be no specific date fixed, or at best the date is a nominal or not before date. When proceedings are adjourned to a new date for cause, or re-fixed after being not reached, it is difficult to say that a new date for trial has not been appointed by the trial judge, or list judge, as the case may be.

I am not prepared to construe s 32 so as to exclude the possibility of a new date for trial being fixed by the trial judge. It seems to me, as a matter of principle, that is what occurs when a matter is stood out of a daily list, and listed for a new date. I am unable to identify any satisfactory basis for framing a distinction which would be dependent on the reason for the adjournment or the re-fixing of the trial”.


	
	In view of the listing of the trial “to proceed [after]” the pre-trial hearing, any date fixed was both non-specific and “nominal” in the sense articulated by Wood J.
	
	
	Fifth, the Crown Prosecutor does not object to leave being granted. His position appeared to be (if I may be permitted to infer it) that the accused should not be locked out from arguing the merits of their application based on a refusal to grant leave due to the failure of their legal representatives to make the application earlier. This is a fair and correct approach.
	
	
	Sixth, having read the material and heard the submissions, the application is based on unusual circumstances and is clearly arguable.
	
	
	For those reasons, I will grant leave under s 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	However, it should be clear to practitioners that this is a most unusual case. I expect that in most cases leave would be refused if the application is not made until after the date that the matter was set down for trial or for the hearing of pre-trial applications where the trial was to proceed thereafter.
	


The factual background, circumstances of the alleged offence and basis of the application


	
	I have set out the factual background of this case in both of my judgments on the voir dire. In Simmons (No 3) I summarised the circumstances at [7] - [11]:
	


“7. In June 2009 Andrew Russell, a resident of Bathurst, went missing. He was last seen, at least by a source that is considered by the Crown to be reliable, on 2 June 2009. His family and friends have not seen him since that date. A witness, Michael O’Neill, saw a man near the intersection of Littlebourne Street and the Sydney Road (Great Western Highway) in Kelso at around 10:30 pm and then again a short (unspecified) time later. The man was in the middle of the highway and Mr O’Neill was concerned and spoke to him. He reported the incident to Bathurst Police. A few weeks later, after Mr Russell was reported missing, Mr O’Neill was shown a photograph and said he was “quite confident” that it depicted the same man.

8. Suspicion attached fairly quickly to the accused Simmons because there was known animosity between him and Mr Russell. It is alleged (and, based on his plea on arraignment, not disputed) that on 20-21 March 2009, Simmons assaulted Mr Russell. However, while Simmons seemed to be the prime suspect, orthodox police investigations failed to uncover any cogent or admissible evidence against him. There was a good deal of rumour and some evidence of things that he had said, but no reliable evidence of real substance was uncovered between June 2009 and September 2012.

9. The accused (Moore) was a close friend and associate of Mr Simmons and the rumour mill suggested that he too was involved, either as an accomplice in the murder or in assisting with the disposal of the body.

10. Between September 2012 and January 2013, the police employed a sophisticated undercover operation targeting Simmons. The details of that operation are set out in some detail in my judgment admitting the evidence of Simmons’ admissions: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) at [9]-[42]. The admissions made are detailed at [84]-[97]. In short, Simmons asserted that he and the accused had come upon Mr Russell at a bridge on the Sydney Road outside Bathurst, had taken him by car to a cliff near the town of Sofala and pushed him off the cliff. They retrieved the victim’s body and buried it in a mineshaft in another location near Sofala. Mr Simmons took the undercover police to the location where they buried the body. No mineshaft or human remains have been found in that area in spite of a thorough search. It is clear from the submissions on the voir dire that Mr Simmons’ case is that the admissions are untrue and that he was boasting or big noting himself for reasons of no present relevance.

11. The admissions made by Simmons would suggest that Mr Moore is guilty of murder. He was part of the joint enterprise of abducting Mr Russell and played a part in pushing him off the cliff. Of course, those admissions are not admissible against the accused. The Crown case against the accused Moore is that Simmons killed Mr Russell and that the accused assisted in disposing of the corpse.”


	
	In Simmons (No 2), I set out the nature and extent of the undercover police operation undertaken between September 2012 and 16 January 2013: at [9] – [42]. I set out the admissions that were made by the accused from [84] – [97]. I will not repeat that summary here and it is necessary for the reader to refer to those paragraphs to obtain any real understanding of the reasons that follow.
	
	
	In general terms, the object of the police operation was to trick the accused into believing that a number of undercover operatives [REDACTED]. The accused was encouraged to speak plainly and truthfully about crimes he had committed in the past. In particular, [REDACTED], the accused was encouraged to provide all of the circumstances surrounding the alleged murder of Mr Russell. As I said in the judgment admitting the evidence of his confessional statements, Simmons showed himself to be ready, willing and able [REDACTED]. In the lengthy recorded conversation between Simmons and the undercover police officers, Simmons admitted to being involved in a wide range of criminal offences in the past.
	
	
	In the recordings of 9, 15 and 16 December 2015 the accused made admissions to the murder of Mr Russell. To oversimplify what he said, he claimed that he and Mr Moore picked up Mr Russell at a location outside Bathurst, drove him to cliff-face at a place called Wallaby Rock near the hamlet of Sofala and pushed him from the cliff. He and Mr Moore then recovered the body and buried it in a mineshaft at another location near Sofala.
	
	
	Mr Simmons’ answer to those potentially devastating admissions will be that the confession is untrue. As I understand it, it will be suggested that he told those lies in order to big-note himself in front of people that he thought [REDACTED].
	
	
	The basis of the application for a judge alone trial is that, no matter what editing is done to the material, the nature of that material and the evidence that the accused will need to adduce in order to explain why he made admissions that he now says are false, is so prejudicial that no jury would be capable of bringing an impartial mind to bear on the ultimate issue for determination. That issue is the truthfulness and reliability of the admissions. While there is other evidence, confessional and circumstantial, upon which the Crown will place some reliance, the Crown acknowledges that the case will most likely rise and or fall on the question of the reliability of the substance, if not the detail, of the admissions. As best as it can be anticipated at the outset, the Crown’s position will be that even if the precise mechanism of the murder (i.e. pushing the victim off the cliff) is incorrect, the tribunal of fact may accept part or parts of the confession and that this may corroborate the other evidence supporting the case that Simmons is responsible for the disappearance and murder of Mr Russell. For example, there is evidence from an independent source that might establish that the location where Mr Russell was last seen alive is not far from the location where the accused admitted that he picked up Mr Russell.
	
	
	The accused submits that no direction could be formulated which would be sufficient to ensure that the jury does not act on the basis of the prejudice occasioned by the introduction of such a large body of evidence showing that the accused was a willing participant in a diverse array of serious criminal activity.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions does not consent to the order for a trial by judge alone. However, the experienced Crown Prosecutor who appears at the trial acknowledges the force of the arguments put by the accused. In particular, he concedes that the amount of prejudicial material is significant and unusual. He acknowledges that there will be real difficulties for both parties in adducing the evidence in such a way that the trial does not run the risk of miscarriage and discharge of the jury.
	
	
	However, the Crown Prosecutor took the role of “contradictor”. In doing so he relied upon the large body of authority in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and in the High Court to the effect that juries are generally capable of obeying directions and that the system is predicated upon the assumption that they do so.
	
	
	The Crown referred to a number of notorious cases where juries were entrusted to determine the issues in spite of the fact that the evidence necessarily showed the accused to be members of groups that are unpopular in the general community from which any jury is drawn. For example, he referred to the trial of Hawi and others involving the murder of a man at Sydney airport (the appeal is Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83). That case was surrounded by great publicity of a prejudicial kind that necessarily involved the jury knowing that the members of both the groups of men who participated in a serious affray in a public aircraft terminal were members of criminal groups (outlaw motorcycle gangs). The Crown noted that the jury in that case was capable of distinguishing between the accused and a number were acquitted. He referred back to cases such as the trial following the Milperra Massacre, another trial involving so called outlaw motorcycle gangs. Again, the jury heard a substantial amount of prejudicial evidence and yet were capable of obeying directions to act in accordance with their oaths and to put aside matters of emotion and prejudice: R v Annakin (1987) 17 NSWLR 202; R v White (1988) 17 NSWLR 195.
	
	
	A less felicitous example raised by the Crown concerned the lengthy terrorist trial which proceeded before Whealy J in 2010 and was subject to a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Elomar, Hasan, Cheikho and Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303. That was an unfortunate reference because, as far as I am aware, none of the accused in the trial were acquitted and so the proposition that the jury differentiated between the cases and was not influenced by prejudice cannot be tested. In any event, it was a case tried under Commonwealth law and trial by judge alone is not available under s 80 of the Constitution: Brown v R [1986] HCA 11; 160 CLR 171.
	
	
	Otherwise, the Crown Prosecutor’s point is well made. I accept that many trials have been conducted in circumstances involving significant prejudice and juries have been capable of discernment and discretion in putting aside their emotional responses and prejudices.
	


Relevant legal principles


	
	I have set out the terms of the statute authorising a “trial by judge order”. The decision turns on a consideration of the question of whether it is in the “interests of justice” to make a trial by judge order. Obviously enough, the interests of justice is an expression of very wide import and may raise an extremely diverse array of considerations.
	


No presumption in favour of trial by jury


	
	The judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 represents the most comprehensive analysis of the current provisions in New South Wales. Most of the principles to be derived from the judgment were helpfully summarised by Bellew J in R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516 at [20].
	
	
	In R v Belghar the Chief Judge at Common Law made reference to the analysis of the benefits of trial by jury undertaken by Heydon J in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [90], [93]-[97]. Heydon J referred to Lord Devlin’s famous description of the jury as “the lamp that shows that freedom lives” and set out the five advantages that Lord Devlin identified in his Hamlyn Lectures collected in Trial by Jury (rev ed) (1966).
	
	
	McClellan CJ at CL at [96] rejected the proposition that s 131 “has the effect of creating a ‘presumption’ that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person”. His Honour acknowledged that there was an evidentiary onus but there is no presumption in favour of a jury trial and no legal onus on an accused person who seeks an order under s 132.
	


No right to a trial by judge alone but the accused’s election is to be considered


	
	In R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 Barr AJ held that “an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking”. However, the Queensland authority relied upon in support of that proposition appeared to take the view that the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) was not “neutral” and that trials by judge alone were “exceptional”: R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 at [81]. It is difficult to reconcile that position with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar. His Honour at [96] referred to the comments in R v Fardon as obiter and rejected the proposition that the New South Wales statute required “weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury”.
	
	
	However, it must be correct that the accused has no right to demand a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	On the other hand, the fact that the accused has decided on legal advice to relinquish his right to a jury trial is a matter to be weighed in determining where the interest of justice lie. Similarly, any subjective apprehension in the accused that he will not receive a fair trial in the hands of the jury is a relevant consideration: R v Belghar at [99], Arthurs v Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [79]. In R v Stanley it was held at [42] that there must be more than a “mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence”.
	


Community standards and intention


	
	Sub-section (5) provides some non-exhaustive guidance as to a particular circumstance where the court may decide that it is not in the interests of justice to make a trial by judge order. That circumstance is where the case raises the “application of objective community standards, including an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.” None of the specific matters referred to in the section will be an issue in the current trial. Nor is it anticipated that the case will give rise to any other question concerning or requiring the application of objective community standards. The questions that will arise in the present case are first whether the prosecution can establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Russell is deceased. That issue is starkly raised in circumstances where his remains have never been found. The Crown will rely on the fact that he has not been seen or heard of since 2 June 2009 and his disappearance is unexplained. I anticipate that Mr Russell’s poor health will be relied upon by the Crown to submit that he was unlikely to simply leave the Bathurst area and take up residence elsewhere. The Crown will also rely on the admissions made by the accused to various people including the undercover operatives. The second issue will be whether the admissions to the undercover operatives are reliable in the sense that they are true. I gather that the issue in relation to other alleged confessional statements will be whether those statements were in fact made. Those are questions of fact and do not attract the application of community standards.
	
	
	In spite of the fact that the accused disavows the issue on this application, there is some possibility that the question of intention may arise. Obviously, if it is accepted that the accused pushed the deceased off a cliff (the confession in the course of the undercover operation) the issue of intention will scarcely be arguable. There is some evidence in Ex VD 1 that the accused made admissions to bashing Mr Russell. If those admissions are accepted, or if the Crown relies on that alternative version of the admissions, it may be that the tribunal of fact would be called upon to consider whether an intention to inflict really serious injury or to kill has been established.
	
	
	There is some controversy in the cases as to whether the question of intention is a matter which raises objective community standards: see, for example, AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8 at [95] (Heydon J), R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [55]-[58] (Barr AJ, Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing); R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] (Latham J), R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 at [52] (Bellew J), R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [73]-[77] (Harrison J). Both Bellew J in R v King (at [52]) and Harrison J in R v Abrahams (at [76]) referred to R v Belghar at [100] and noted that McClellan CJ at CL at [90] implicitly accepted that the question of intention did not raise the application of community standards, at least in the circumstances of that case.
	
	
	Harrison J considered the controversy in R v Abrahams and said at [73]-[77]:
	


“73. In AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438, Heydon J considered that the question of whether or not an accused person had a particular intent was an example of an issue requiring for its determination the application of community standards. His Honour said this at [95]:

‘...Thus Lord Devlin saw the jury as being for some purposes 'the best judicial instrument'. A clear illustration of this role of the jury is seen when the jury decides whether the facts it finds answer certain legal criteria. That phenomenon is recognised by s 118(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act, for the court may refuse to order trial by judge alone 'if it considers the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards such as an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness'. Other examples of factual issues requiring the application of 'objective community standards' include whether behaviour was 'threatening, abusive or insulting'; whether conduct was 'dishonest', a matter to be decided by the jury 'according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people'; whether an assault is 'indecent'; and whether an accused person had a particular intention.’

74. The link between decisions concerning the existence or formation of a particular intent and the application of community standards was also discussed by Barr AJ in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [56] - [59] with a conclusion as follows:

‘[59] I accept that the fact alone that community standards must be applied in the resolution of factual issues does not mandate trial by jury but, as subs (5) makes clear, it is a circumstance in which the jury may be considered to be the superior tribunal of fact.""

75. For my part I find it difficult immediately to accept that cases concerned with the assessment of whether or not a particular individual had formed or retained a particular intent allegedly relating to the commission of some charged act necessarily or even arguably ""involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"". The question, for example, of whether or not an act was committed with such force that it bespeaks or evinces a particular intention is undoubtedly a question of fact. The force of the suggestion that there is a corresponding and simultaneous requirement to apply some objective community standard in undertaking the assessment of that factual issue is not obvious to me. I note with some interest that the only citation provided by Heydon J for the proposition that ""whether an accused person had a particular intention"" was an example of a factual issue requiring the application of objective community standards was at note [86] to his Honour's judgment in these terms:

‘[86] Buxton, 'Some Simple Thoughts on Intention', [1988] Criminal Law Review 484 at 495: '[R]ecourse to shared values and assumptions about the implications of actions and the circumstances in which those actions occur may be a safer guide to culpability than analytical deductions from a generalised verbal definition'.’

76. In Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL expressed the view that the determination of intention in the particular circumstances of that case did not involve the application of community standards. Latham J referred to the competing views about it in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] as follows:

‘[58] The Crown in King relied upon this aspect of Heydon J's judgment and the Crown relies upon it here. It is right to acknowledge that Justice Heydon's observation in this respect was not endorsed by any other member of that bench and that McClellan CJ at CL accepted that the issue of intention did not involve the application of community standards in the circumstances applying in Belghar. Like Bellew J, I am not persuaded that the issue of intention can never involve the application of objective community standards. I also note that the basis of the decision in Belghar was that the trial judge determined the application in the absence of appropriate evidence and without considering whether such prejudice as was found to exist could be neutralised by directions.’

77. Having regard to the view I have otherwise formed, it is strictly unnecessary to decide the point. I accept cautiously that it could not be said that the issue of intention could never involve the application of objective community standards. It does not, however, appear to me that this is such a case.”


	
	I agree with those observations, particularly those in paragraph [75]. There is a qualitative difference between the application of community standards to questions such as whether an act is obscene, indecent, reasonable or negligent and a factual inquiry as to whether a particular accused formed the necessary intention to constitute a specified criminal offence. Further, if the Parliament was of the view that the issue of intention was one that involved the application of community standards, it would have been very easy to include that issue within the non-exhaustive list of matters identified in sub-s 132(5).
	
	
	Neither counsel anticipates that the issue of intention will loom large in the trial. The real issue in the trial will be the whether Mr Russell was killed and, if so, who killed him. The accused says that the issue of intention is unlikely to arise in any meaningful way. Mr Young says that no submission will be made in address that the jury (or Judge sitting alone) might find the accused guilty of manslaughter on the basis that he did not have an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown Prosecutor expressed doubts that the issue will arise and it is not a matter upon which the Crown relies in opposing a trial by judge order.
	


Efficiency and the length of the trial


	
	In R v Markou [2011] NSWDC 25, Judge Berman SC noted that judge alone trials tend to be quicker and more efficient. His Honour noted:
	


“7. Even in trials that run without interruption, judge alone trials are more efficient. Advocates naturally assume that the clever points they are making regarding evidence have to be emphasised and repeated in order to ensure that the least perceptive member of the jury understands it. Not only do judges tend to understand points the first time they hear them, they have the ability to say to an advocate. ”I understood that the first time”. I use that simple example of how a judge alone trial tends to be quicker.”


	
	In R v Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL at [110] referred to these observations and similar comments in other cases. He accepted that such efficiencies and the length of the trial may form “part of the mix of issues” to be considered in a particular case but went on at [111]:
	


“111. However, I would not accept that the interests of justice in s 132 can be informed by considerations of the overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial. No doubt they are important issues for the administration of justice and may ultimately lead to further legislative intervention but, as the majority determined in Pambula Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, they are not relevant to the interests of justice in the particular case.”


	
	An example of a case where the length of the trial was a significant part of a consideration of the “interests of justice” was R v Gittany [2013] NSWSC 1503. In that case, McCallum J accepted counsel’s estimates that the trial would have been significantly longer if conducted with a jury. The evidence was that the accused had insufficient funds to privately engage his legal team for the longer jury trial. An adjournment to allow a legal aid application to be pursued would have resulted in the unavailability of an important prosecution witness. In those circumstances, her Honour accepted that the length of the trial was a critical factor in determining whether it was in the interests of justice to make a trial by judge order.
	


The duty of a judge to provide reasons


	
	Another issue discussed in R v Belghar was the advantage of transparency inherent in the requirement that a Judge give reasons for the verdict. This is to be contrasted with the jury which is “as inscrutable as the Sphynx”: Ward v James [1966] 1 QB 273 at 301 (CA), Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 365. McClellan CJ at CL said at [112]:
	


“To my mind the opportunity which a reasoned judgment affords to the accused and to the public to understand the steps in the reasoning process of the decision-maker, compared with the inscrutability of the jury's decision, will depending upon all the circumstances, be a factor which is relevant to the decision as to whether to order a judge-alone trial. However, it is but one factor and the weight to be given to it will depend upon the nature of the issues to be determined in the trial. If the trial will involve complex engineering, scientific or medical issues it may be more readily concluded that a verdict accompanied by the reasons of the trial judge will enhance the interests of justice, both in relation to the accused and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system. It would inevitably facilitate an appeal if the trial judge has erred.”

Complex expert evidence


	
	Cases involving complex evidence that could be difficult for a jury to understand may lend themselves to orders for a trial by judge alone: R v Belghar at [112]; R v Dean at [60-62]. In Kingswell v R [1985] HCA 72; 159 CLR 264 Deane J said at 302-303:
	


“There is, for example, obvious force in the argument that a jury of ordinary men and women selected at random from the community lacks the knowledge and experience necessary to sit in responsible judgment upon the type of scientific dispute between specialists that may arise in the course of a criminal trial or upon the detailed technical questions which may be involved in the trial of white collar and computer crime.”


	
	Further, it may often be in the interests of justice for the reasoning process of the tribunal of fact to be exposed in cases involving an assessment of competing and complicated expert evidence: Arthurs v Western Australia at [90].
	


Credibility issues


	
	Lord Devlin was of the firm opinion that the jury was the most appropriate tribunal to determine issues of credibility:
	


""[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers.""

—Lord Devlin, Trial by Jury, (rev ed) (1966) at 14, Cited in AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [94] and R v Belghar at [24].


	
	In Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 the High Court referred (at 214) to:
	


“...the purpose and the genius of the jury system is that it allows for the ordinary experiences of ordinary people to be brought to bear in the determination of factual matters. It is fundamental to that purpose that the jury be allowed to determine, by inference from its collective experience of ordinary affairs, whether and, in the case of conflict, what evidence is truthful.”


	
	However, it is difficult to discern a clear consensus in the Australian authorities in support of a proposition that where credibility issues are central to a trial, that is a factor that militates strongly in favour of a jury trial.
	
	
	In R v Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL referred to Lord Devlin’s statements but did not adopt them in the context of his analysis of s 132.
	
	
	In Coates v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 142 at [9]-[12] Owen JA said:
	


“9. The assessment of credibility is essentially a subjective matter, although some objective considerations might come into play in forming the platform from which the assessment is made. Section 118(6) is of no direct assistance to the appellant here. That was the view taken by the trial judge when the application was made to abort the trial (ts 3826). In my opinion his Honour was correct in coming to that conclusion.

10. It is true that a free exchange of views and ideas can be very helpful in the decision making process. Everyday experience indicates that the physical and mental process of having to articulate propositions and to listen to the reaction of others can clarify thinking. But, equally, in everyday experience important decisions are made by individuals without the benefit of interaction with others. Judges make decisions for a living and they often arise in complex circumstances and involve the expenditure of considerable intellectual effort. Assessments of credibility fall into this category. While the trial judge may be deprived of the advantage of a free interchange of ideas with peers he or she has an advantage that ordinary members may lack. Trial judges have consistent and continuing experience of fact-finding and of the making of the decisions in a situation that demands an objective and dispassionate mind.

11. I am not suggesting that juries are incapable of making objective and dispassionate decisions. A judge's charge to a jury will almost always include directions to that effect and I have no reason to believe that jury members do other than pay due and faithful regard to the instruction. But the day to day working life of a judge will often involve dealing with evidence in ways that are outside the normal experience of members of the public. For example, a judge will often be required to put to one side inadmissible evidence (of which he or she is cognisant) in assessing credibility or deciding other disputed issues. Another example is having regard to an item of evidence for one purpose and yet disregarding it in relation to another contentious issue within the same case. When matters of that nature arise in a jury trial there is a need for careful direction to guide the jury in relation to them. The experience gained by a trial judge over time in relation to a wide range of fact-finding methods can be a peculiar advantage.

12. In this case the trial judge was acutely aware of the centrality of Mr X's testimony. He expressed some views about the advantage jury members would have in discussing the evidence. If his Honour's comments are taken as an indication that he regarded himself at a material disadvantage in assessing Mr X's credibility then it will be apparent from what I have said that I do not agree. But I am not sure that this is what his Honour meant. It does not follow that just because one group has an advantage that another group (or individual) has a material disadvantage in relation to the same matter.”


	
	Those observations were made after the trial Judge had referred to the passage from Doney v The Queen set out above at [74] and went on:
	


“When 12 people unanimously agree on the credibility of a critical witness there can be the highest degree of confidence that that assessment is correct. However, in a trial without a jury only one person makes that assessment, and in my view it follows that exceptional care must be taken before accepting an accomplice's evidence.”


	
	Buss JA (with whom Martin CJ agreed) said at [118]:
	


“118. In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge overstated any difficulty for a trial judge (and his Honour is a very experienced trial judge) in determining the credibility of a witness. The assessment of the truthfulness and reliability of witnesses is a basic function of a trial judge and, in performing that task, he or she is not, in my opinion, under any relevant disadvantage compared with a jury. Indeed, a trial judge has considerable advantages over a jury as a result of his or her training and experience.”


	
	In R v Farrow [2014] NSWSC 1781 Rothman J made a trial by judge order in a case where the sole issue was mental illness. There was a conflict of expert opinion. Central to that conflict was the question of whether the accused was “genuine in his statement of symptoms”. Rothman J acknowledged (at [37]) that this was a matter “invariably” considered by juries and not a matter that “peculiarly, or even preferably, should be determined by the trial judge.” In spite of that fact, and the fact that the issues “may require the application of objective community standards”, his Honour was persuaded that it was in the interests of justice for the matter to be determined by judge alone.
	
	
	There may be cases where particular issues of credibility mean that the interests of justice favour a trial by jury. In R v Tasich [2012] NSWDC 96 Knox DCJ expressed the opinion that where there were attacks on the credibility of public officials and members of parliament “it is an important matter for the administration of justice that the truth or otherwise of such purported attacks need to be determined in open court by the community as represented by the jury.”
	
	
	I allow for the possibility that there are cases where such an approach may be correct. However, for the most part, the fact that a trial involves issues of credibility is a neutral matter when it comes to determining whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for trial by judge alone. As was stressed in R v Belghar and Coates v Western Australia, each mode of trial has its advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. While a jury has the advantage of being able to discuss the issues and the requirement for unanimity provides strength to its decision, a judge has the training and experience of making difficult decisions on question of credibility, putting aside matters of emotion, on an almost daily basis.
	


Prejudicial material


	
	Jodie O’Leary suggests that the most common reason for seeking a judge alone trial is a belief in the accused “that his or her trial might otherwise be prejudiced by previous media publicity or by evidence which the jury might find revolting”: Jodie O’Leary, “Twelve angry peers or one angry judge: An analysis of judge lone trials in Australia” (2011) 35(3) Criminal Law Journal 154. O’Leary considered cases across Australia, particular in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.
	
	
	There are a number of cases in New South Wales where applications for trial by judge alone have been based on prejudice arising from material contained in the evidence of the case itself, from the media publicity surrounding the proceedings or from the risk that a jury may interrogate the internet. Overwhelmingly, it has held that the prejudice identified in the application is capable of being overcome by direction to the jury: see, for example, R v Abrahams at [54]-[60], R v Dean at [65], R v King at [60]-[65]; R v McKnight [2014] NSWSC 398 at [31] (Campbell J).
	
	
	In R v King, Bellew J cited some of the more influential statements to the effect that a jury is capable of following directions imploring them to disregard matters of emotion and prejudice:
	


“62. Bearing all of these matters in mind there is, as the Crown pointed out, a long line of authority which unequivocally supports the proposition that it is to be assumed that jurors will follow directions which are given to them by a trial judge. In Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 McHugh J explained the proposition in this way (at 425):

‘The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the Common Law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves the jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having a criminal jury trial...In my respectful opinion, the fundamental assumption of the criminal jury trial requires us to proceed on the basis that the jury acted in this case on the evidence and in accordance with the judge's directions and that they would have done so even if manslaughter had been left as an issue, as it should have been left.’

63. Observations to a similar effect had previously been expressed by Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 (at 603):

‘The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J. observed in Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) [1987] HCA 56; (1987) 164 CLR 15, at p 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them. In Murphy v R [1989] HCA 28; 167 CLR 94, we stated at p 99:

‘But it is misleading to think that, because a juror hasheard something of the circumstances giving rise to thetrial, the accused has lost the opportunity of anindifferent jury. The matter was put this way by theOntario Court of Appeal in Reg. v. Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279, at p 291: 'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence'.

To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge.’

64. The statements in Glennon were expressly adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 at [153] per Barr J (Spigelman CJ and Price J agreeing).”


	
	There are many statements to similar effect. It is assumed that a jury will generally act on the instructions that it is given: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 425 (McHugh J).
	
	
	Academic writers have questioned this “near heroic belief that jury directions can cure negative impressions formed about an accused” and suggested that “there is no evidence to suggest that this is anything other than judicial wishful thinking”: see Mirko Bagaric, “The community interest in bringing suspects to trial trumps the right to an impartial decision maker – at least in Victoria” (2010) 34(1) Criminal Law Journal 5 at 8. Bagaric refers to a “body of work that suggest that once people form an adverse view they cannot simply discard their preconceptions upon command” (see footnote 4 on p 8) and asserts that “the overwhelming trend of results is that notorious accused are convicted”.
	
	
	In spite of the persuasiveness of Bagaric’s essay, the force of the authorities are such that I must proceed on the basis that jurors are capable of, and do, obey directions, including directions requiring them to disregard prejudicial publicity surrounding a trial and prejudicial evidence adduced in the course of the trial. However, this axiom can be taken only so far. The discretions residing in a trial judge to exclude prejudicial evidence, to suppress evidence during the currency of a trial, to discharge a jury without verdict if inadmissible evidence comes before it and to order separate trials of co-accused and severance of multiple counts are all examples of legal remedies which would not exist if it were universally the case that juries were capable of obeying directions and disregarding prejudicial material. It is a question of degree and turns on a thorough analysis of both the nature and extent of the prejudicial material and the method by which it will be introduced into the trial.
	
	
	This was recognised by Judge Woods QC in R v GSR (3) [2011] NSWDC 17. That case is best identified by reference to the nickname given to the accused by various media outlets. The accused became widely known as the “Butcher of Bega”. He had been tried and convicted in relation to an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial attracted an enormous amount of media publicity. He was then called for trial in relation to a number of offences of indecent assault. Woods QC DCJ held that the publicity was so great and so prejudicial that a fair trial before a jury could not be held at that time. Accordingly, his Honour made an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the case proceeded by judge alone trial. R v GSR (No 3) is an example of an exception to both the body of case law that the system is predicated on the fact that juries obey the directions that they are given and also the general proposition that juries are capable of disregarding prejudicial material.
	
	
	Similarly, in Arthurs v Western Australia, Martin CJ was persuaded that he should order a trial by judge alone largely as a consequence of pre-trial publicity that his Honour described at [86] as “extensive, continuous and in some respects extraordinary”. The Chief Justice had earlier found at [31] that some of the publicity arguably constituted a contempt of court. In concluding that the interests of justice favoured a trial by judge without a jury his Honour said at [87]-[92]:
	


“87. There are of course many cases dealing with the extent to which prejudice that might be occasioned by pre-trial publicity can be ameliorated by an appropriate warning and direction to the jury, and it is standard practice in Western Australia to direct juries that they should not make any access to the Internet to conduct any of their own inquiries in relation to any aspect of the case before them. However, there is, I think, room for doubt as to the efficacy of these processes, particularly in cases which have achieved the notoriety of this case. So in my opinion there is some weight in the proposition that there is a prospect that the fairness of Mr Arthurs' trial might be prejudiced by the extensive publicity to which I have referred if he is tried by a jury.

88. The second factor which I take into account is the possible effect which the evidence as to the circumstances of the offence might have upon a jury. As I mentioned earlier, it is, I think, neither necessary nor appropriate for me to detail those circumstances other than to observe that the evidence is likely to test the emotional strength and fortitude of any person required to consider it in detail, whether juror or Judge.

89. Despite their training and experience, it would, I think, be unwise to assume that Judges are any less vulnerable to human emotions and frailty than any other member of the community. However, it is in this context that an obligation to provide reasons appears to me to be of particular significance. Through the performance of that obligation, the accused person, the community and where necessary an appeal court can evaluate whether, and if so the extent to which emotion may have influenced the decision, at least to a greater extent than in the case of a jury verdict. That consideration seems to me to lend weighty support in this case to the proposition that trial by Judge without jury is in the interests of justice.

90. A third factor which I take into account is allied to the second in that it draws upon the significance of the obligation to provide reasons in the event of a trial by Judge without jury. While it could not be said that the complexity and length of this trial is such that it would be burdensome on a jury, there are more than 70 prosecution witnesses named on the indictment, although we do not yet know how many of those witnesses are to be called. The latest estimate as to the length of trial I have received is one of ten days.

91. I am, however, told by defence counsel that there are likely to be issues requiring the detailed evaluation of expert evidence, including expert pathological and psychiatric evidence. I accept though that it is difficult to be certain as to precisely the extent of that evidence at this stage.

92. I do not for one moment suggest that those are issues which are beyond the capacity of a jury and although this is not a factor upon which I would place considerable weight, from my review of the prosecution brief there do appear to be aspects of this case in respect of which the delivery of reasoned decisions for judgment would be in the interests of justice.”


	
	O’Leary noted (at p 22) that the cases reviewed for her paper predominantly concerned issues relating to prejudice arising from publicity surrounding the case. She considered that the distinction in Arthurs v Western Australia may have been that much of the prejudicial material was evidence to be led at the trial. Such material often concerns the horrific nature of the offence itself. As Latham J’s judgment in R v Dean shows, it is generally accepted (although it cannot universally be true) that prejudice of that kind can be cured by direction. Dean was charged with 11 counts of murder arising from a fire he set at a nursing home. Latham J said at [65]:
	


“65. Unfortunately, trials for multiple murders are not unknown to the administration of criminal justice. Notorious trials such as that relating to the murder of 7 young tourists by Ivan Milat (R v Milat NSWCCA 26 February 1998) in circumstances far more heinous than the instant case have been conducted before a jury. It is accepted by the common law that juries follow instructions from the trial judge that impress upon them the importance of deciding the matter on the evidence in the trial and putting to one side any emotional responses they may have. Robust and repeated instructions to the jury panel that invite any prospective juror to disqualify himself or herself from the panel if unable to put prejudices aside are capable of markedly reducing the risk of bias.”


	
	The application in the present case is not based on prejudicial publicity or on the horrific nature of the evidence to be adduced in relation to the alleged murder itself. Rather, the application is based on the prejudice that will be occasioned by the introduction of evidence that the accused [REDACTED]. In that sense, the case is rather unusual. The case of Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 173, to which reference was made in Simmons (No 2) at [152], provided an example where similar evidence (led without objection) caused the trial to miscarry and a jury verdict to be set aside.
	


Application of those principles to the present case

Prejudicial material to be adduced at trial


	
	As the judgment in R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) shows, there is a vast amount of material in the brief relating to Mr Simmons which is of a highly prejudicial kind. This was summarised in my earlier judgment in dot point form in paragraph [142] – [149]:
	


“142. The material tendered on the voir dire contains a vast amount of material which, if admitted before a jury, would give rise to enormous prejudice to the accused’s right and capacity to receive a fair trial. That material comes in a variety of forms. First, there is the participation by the accused [REDACTED] in the course of the covert police operation. Secondly, in the course of the conversations with the undercover officers, the accused made many admissions (or boasts) about his past involvement in a variety of criminal offences. Third, the tenor of much of the conversation is offensive and suggestive of a person of bad character.

143. I note that the accused have indicated (“formally” yesterday) that they intend to seek leave under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act to make an application for Judge alone trial under s 132. The Crown is yet to indicate its position on the application and the question of leave is a live one. The application is yet to be dealt with and it is appropriate to deal with the s 137 submission on the basis that the trial will be by jury.

144. As my summary of the scenario evidence shows, the police enticed the accused into the commission of a wide variety of pretend criminal offences. His willingness to involve himself in these crimes does him no credit and is likely to cause a jury to consider him to be a person of bad character with a propensity towards the commission of a vast array of offences. Without being exhaustive, the malfeasance and criminal behaviour in which the accused was prepared to participate included:–

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]”


	
	However in the course of submissions, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not need to rely upon a large number of the earlier conversations recorded by listening device between September 2012 and early January 2013. The critical material was that contained in the conversations of 9 January 2013, and 15 – 16 January 2013.
	
	
	The Crown will not press for or seek to tender that earlier material. Presumably the facts of the police operation and its general nature will be given in oral testimony by the relevant offices but the highly prejudicial listening device recordings will not be played and not all of the details of the [REDACTED] criminal offences in which the accused was encouraged to participate would be placed before the jury.
	
	
	The remaining material, which is to say the recordings on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013, still contain evidence of a highly prejudicial nature. It shows the accused’s willingness to engage in [REDACTED]. It was by introducing that “scenario” that the police were able, after a lengthy and sophisticated undercover investigation, to extract the confession or confessions that they did. That material cannot be extricated from the factual matrix to be played out before the jury.
	
	
	Further, within the conversations themselves there are a number of occasions when the accused refers to other crimes that he may have been involved in as well as other material that shows him in a very bad light. While the Crown does not press for the tender of all of that material, it is inevitable that some of it will come out in the trial. It is likely that the accused would seek to rely on the things he said in support of his defence that he was big-noting himself in front of the people [REDACTED].
	
	
	In Simmons (No 2) I referred in general terms to the nature and extent of the prejudicial material that would remain even taking into account the Crown’s agreement not to adduce all of the earlier recordings and assuming a large amount of editing of the evidence:
	


“154. However, if the admissions (or some of them) are admitted, it will still be necessary for the jury to be aware that that the underlying theme of the covert operation was that the UCOs [REDACTED]. In addition to that, the conversations containing the admissions are riddled with comments that suggest that the accused is callous and uncaring. By way of example, the comment about robbing the victim after he was dead and that he was a ‘bum’. Also, he made disparaging remarks about the possibly deceased UCO 2.

155. This means that, in spite of the concession by the Crown to extract large portions of the material, there will remain a real danger of unfair prejudice.

156. Further, if the admissions go before the jury, the accused will need to make difficult forensic choices in relation to what parts of the evidence he requires to ensure that the jury understands his defence. I expect that the defence will be that the things he said to the police were unreliable, untrue and the result of him big noting himself [REDACTED]. To establish this he will have to cross-examine his way through a minefield of potentially prejudicial material. Again, this creates a danger of unfair prejudice.”


	
	Simmons (No 2) included a direction that the parties liaise in an effort to reach agreement as to the form and content of the remaining parts of the evidence recorded by surveillance device. That was a substantial undertaking but on Wednesday 18 March 2015 the parties advised me of the prejudicial material that they agree needs to be led to enable (i) the Crown to put the evidence of the crucial admissions fairly and comprehensibly before the jury and (ii) the defence to mount its contention that the admissions are unreliable.
	
	
	Ex VD 17 is a list of the material to be edited from the listening device recordings of 9, 15 and 16 January 2013. Ex VD 18 is a summary of the prejudicial material that, by agreement between the parties, will remain. It includes reference to [REDACTED]. It also includes reference to offences previously committed by the accused including drug supply. Perhaps most significantly for present purposes, it includes reference to the “scenario” [REDACTED]: see Simmons (No 2) at [32]-[37]. The accused was active in this enterprise. [REDACTED].
	
	
	Ex VD 16 is a schedule of material from the recordings between September 2012 and early January 2013 that the accused may seek to elicit in order to put into a realistic and true context his case that his admissions were boasts [REDACTED]. The scenarios are set out in Simmons (No 2) and encompass a wide range of criminal and anti-social behaviour.
	


Affidavit evidence


	
	The accused relies on two affidavits of his solicitor. The first affidavit refers to the fact that the Crown will rely on evidence of an earlier assault by the accused on Mr Russell as “motive or relationship evidence”. It also says that many of the civilian witnesses know the accused through their mutual involvement in criminal and drug related activity. It is asserted that the nature of these relationships “involves the danger of inadvertent disclosure of criminal behaviour during their evidence”. The affidavit annexes the accused’s election for a judge alone trial. The election was made after receiving the advice of his solicitor and Senior Counsel. The affidavit also refers to body of evidence to which I have already referred.
	
	
	The second affidavit identifies further areas of prejudice and lists a number of witnesses known to the accused through criminal connections, drug related activity or as a result of meeting the accused in gaol. Reliance on much of this material was abandoned in the course of argument when it became clear that the Crown did not propose to rely on the material or would not adduce any evidence of criminal connection between the accused and the witnesses.
	
	
	I accept that the material in the affidavits provides some basis for concerns that inadmissible and prejudicial evidence may inadvertently be adduced in the trial. However, of itself, this is a matter that can be dealt with by caution on the part of the advocates and, if necessary, clear direction to the jury.
	


The Crown Prosecutor’s position


	
	The Crown Prosecutor is instructed to oppose the application for judge alone trial. However, in so doing he acknowledges “I can fairly say there are merits in the application … it’s not just a wish-list type of application” (T 389). Later he indicated that “given the state of the [DPP] Guidelines, I’m not in a position to consent” but went on “I concede there a significantly good reasons for the application being made by both accused” (T 416).
	
	
	As I have set out above, the Crown went on to make cogent submissions based around a jury’s ability to follow directions that require them to put aside matters of prejudice and emotion.
	


Relevant considerations


	
	I turn then to summarise my reasoning and application of the principles of law to the facts of the present case. In doing so, I will repeat in summary form some of the principles of law that guide me and to which I have already made reference.
	
	
	There is no presumption in favour of a jury trial and there is no onus on the accused to establish that it is in the interests of justice for the trial to be conducted by judge alone.
	
	
	This is not a case where the application of community standards will be a factor. While a question of intention may arise and while some of the authorities suggest that intention might involve the application of such standards, I am not persuaded by those authorities and accept the submission of counsel that this is not a case where intention is the central issue.
	
	
	Questions of credibility of the witnesses will inevitably arise and the Crown has identified a number of witnesses whose credibility will be subject to dispute. However, for the reasons I have articulated, I am of the opinion that this is a neutral consideration.
	
	
	This is not a case involving complex expert opinion evidence or where the Judge’s duty to give reasons is of particular significance. If a jury were to return a verdict of guilty, it would clearly be on the basis that it accepted relevant parts of the accused admissions. The accused would not be benefited or enlightened by a statement of reasons.
	
	
	I do not consider the length of the trial to be a matter of any significance in the present case. I accept that a judge alone trial is likely to be somewhat more efficient but, judging from the length of the voir dire, I doubt that the savings of court time would be particularly large. In any event, with one reservation, I do not consider such matters constitute a relevant consideration in the circumstances of this case. The reservation is that there is a real risk that if the jury is empanelled there will be repeated applications for discharge of the jury as the material comes out. Some of those applications are likely to have some merit. If acceded to, there will be an increase in court time, expense and inconvenience to witnesses. If refused, it may give rise to grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The accused’s election to be tried by judge alone is a matter worthy of some weight. I infer from his election that he is concerned that the nature of the prejudicial material may impact on him receiving a fair trial in front of a jury. The affidavit evidence satisfies me that he has sought and received advice from an Australian legal practitioner as to the effect of a “trial by judge order”: s 132(6).
	
	
	I commence my consideration of the question of the prejudicial material by acknowledging the large body of authority supporting the proposition that juries will obey the directions of the trial judge and are capable of putting to one side material giving rise to prejudice.
	
	
	I also acknowledge the fair and reasonable stance adopted by the Crown Prosecutor. While the Crown did not have instructions to consent to a judge alone trial, he candidly acknowledged the difficulties that both parties would encounter in conducting the trial in the light of the nature and extent of the prejudicial material lurking in the brief.
	
	
	I have not been taken to any case where the prejudice is as extensive as it appears to be in this case. Further, apart from the sheer volume of prejudicial material, the real vice in the present case is the way in which the evidence will be introduced, the fact that it raises both character and tendency in circumstances where the Crown places no reliance on it for those purposes and, perhaps most potently, the fact that the accused’s counsel may need to introduce certain parts of the material in order properly to argue his client’s defence. As I have said, that defence is no doubt that [REDACTED]. That is a most unpalatable defence and one that will be entirely foreign to most members of the jury. I find it difficult to see how the accused can fairly conduct that defence and expect a jury of right minded people from the community to put aside his admitted criminal propensity in determining in a cold, scientific, dispassionate and judicial manner whether the Crown has proved its case of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I am unable to envisage any direction to the jury that will alleviate the prejudice that will be aroused by the material that it is anticipated will be led in this trial. In Makarov v R (No 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293 a large body of prejudicial evidence was tendered as “context” or “relationship” evidence. The Court (Bell JA, Johnson and McCallum JJ) held that the careful and thorough directions given in that case were “not capable of overcoming the prejudice that arose as a result of the joint trial and the admission of the appellant’s other sexual misconduct”. While the factual and legal matrix is entirely different, the cases share two common threads. The first is the sheer volume of prejudicial material that will be introduced into the trial and the fact that the material is not introduced in direct proof of guilt but for an ancillary purpose. The second is that direction to the jury is unlikely to overcome the prejudice that will result in the admission of such a large body of evidence.
	


Conclusion and Orders


	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I have reached the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice that the accused be tried by judge alone.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave granted under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	Pursuant to s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) I order that the accused is to be tried by judge sitting alone without a jury.
	
	
	The un-redacted version of this judgment is to be available to judicial officers, their staff and legal practitioners as a restricted judgment on the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) in accordance with the protocols established by the Judicial Commission.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 11 September 2013 the applicant stood trial before his Honour Bennett SC DCJ and a jury on an indictment containing two counts:


	
	Sexual intercourse with a person under 16 (namely 12 years) knowing she was not consenting contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s61J(1).
	
	
	Sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 14 years (namely 12 years) contrary to s66C(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	


The second count was in the alternative to the first count.


	
	The applicant pleaded not guilty to both counts. The trial continued until 17 September 2013 when the jury retired. On the afternoon of 19 September 2013 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to the first count.
	
	
	On 14 February 2014 the applicant was sentenced by Bennett DCJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 25 January 2014 and expiring 24 January 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 24 January 2019.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against conviction. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	


Ground 1 – Having regard to the evidence the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported.

Ground 2 – The failure to edit out Q/A 633 from the [applicant’s] record of interview which was played to the jury caused a miscarriage of justice.

CROWN AND DEFENCE CASE


	
	The Crown case was that the applicant was the uncle of the complainant who was aged 12 at the time of the offence. He was living in the same premises as the complainant in Bankstown on the evening of Wednesday, 15 August 2012. The Crown alleged that he entered the complainant’s bedroom, lay next to her and penetrated her anus with his penis.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial but was interviewed by the police. His ERISP was before the jury. He did not call any witnesses. He denied committing the offence and said that he was either at the mosque for Ramadan during that night or at home but having a shower while T (whom the complainant referred to as a grandmother) was there. The applicant relied upon the cross-examination of the witnesses called for the Crown and his ERISP.
	


Evidence at trial


	
	On 16 August 2012 the complainant was attending Bankstown Primary School. She had arrived in Australia from Sierra Leone in 2006 with members of her family. She lived at XXXX, Bankstown with T, her aunt R (whom she referred to as her sister), the applicant who was also R’s boyfriend and R’s three year old son. The complainant’s sister, F and F’s friend, N, had moved out of the house on 15 July 2012. R was in Africa when the offence took place.
	
	
	The Deputy Principal of the Bankstown Primary School was Ms Janet Byrne. She was aware that the complainant required additional support in terms of learning and other things. She had developed a trusting relationship with the complainant. On 16 August 2012 at about 11 – 11.30am, Ms Byrne was advised that two women and a baby were at the school to see the complainant. It is common ground that the two women were F and her friend N. The baby belonged to N.
	
	
	The women had apparently not seen the complainant since they left the house. When they saw the complainant, they hugged and were talking. Ms Byrne remained throughout the conversation.
	
	
	The two women and the complainant spoke loudly in a language which Ms Byrne did not understand. In the course of their conversation, their voices became raised and high-pitched. Ms Byrne thought that she heard the words “hitting” or “bashing” in the course of the conversation. Later, she heard one of the women say in English “it’s sexual abuse”. When she heard this, Ms Byrne asked the two women to leave and told them that she would take the complainant with her and speak to her.
	
	
	Ms Byrne took the complainant to her office but because it was lunchtime, did not ask her any questions at that time but allowed her to join the other children. After lunch Ms Byrne spoke to the complainant again but the complainant was reluctant to say very much. She was described by Ms Byrne as “she was really shutting down and not wanting to engage in conversation”. Ms Byrne persisted and her evidence as to what then happened was:
	


“… I again was getting very little response from her. I said to her, ""Is your uncle kind to you?"" and she made a comment to me that he had come I said we also needed to talk about what N had said, the comment about sexual abuse, and that I really needed to know that she was safe. I kept coming back to that. That that was my job, that I needed to know that she was safe. When we spoke about - when I said to her I needed to know about the sexual abuse comment, I asked her if she knew what that meant and no response from her. I then asked her if her uncle was kind to her and she responded by saying, ""He came into my bedroom last night.""”

Q. Did she say anything else in relation to that?

A. She did go on to say I asked her. I said, ""Were you sleeping?"" and she said, ""Yes."" I said, ""Was the light on or the light off?"" and she said, ""The light was on. I asked her what happened when her uncle came into the bedroom. She said, ""He took the blanket off me."" And I said, ""So your uncle came in. You were sleeping. Your uncle came in and he took the blanket off you?"" And she said, ""Yes."" And I said, ""Can you tell me what happened then?"" and she shut down again. She would not respond.

Q. During the time that you were talking to her up until this point, how was her demeanour?

A. Sad. I would - I would say a little frightened, unsure, very reserved. She was sitting next to me at some stages and other times we were sitting at a round table sitting together at that and other times on two lounge chairs that were in my office. She just she found it very difficult to make eye contact.” (T.148.40 – 149.15)


	
	Ms Byrne was unsuccessful in getting any further information from the complainant whom she allowed to take a further break and play with the other children. The school had an afternoon break from 1.15 to 2pm. Ms Byrne resumed speaking to the complainant at 2pm but was unsuccessful in obtaining any further information from her until she suggested that it might be easier for the complainant to draw a picture or write something.
	


“Q. And what was her response, if anything?

A. Quiet. Didn't say anything. I said, ""Are you worried about your writing? She said nothing. I said, ""You don't have to worry about your spelling or your writing. I just want you to try and write down and tell me what happened after that."" And I indicated a piece of paper, sat it on the table and she sat there and wrote on that piece of paper.

…

Q. Is that the paper that she wrote on?

A. Yes.

Q. In terms of that document, can you tell me what she wrote, if anything, in your presence?

A. She wrote, ""He did it with me.""

Q. Yes.

A. ""He had six with me.""

Q. … When she wrote, ""He had sex with me,"" did she write that at the same time?

A. No.” (T.150.3 - .25)


	
	Ms Byrne said that when the complainant made the comment “he did it with me” it was right on bell time, so she allowed the complainant to go home. In cross-examination she agreed that although it was her recollection that it was the complainant who wrote “he did it with me”, it was possible that the complainant had told her that and that she [Ms Byrne] had written those words on the paper. Ms Byrne said that when the complainant wrote the words “he did it with me” she would not make eye contact with her.
	
	
	The following day, 17 August 2012, Ms Byrne spoke to the complainant when she came to school. Her evidence was:
	


“Q. When you spoke to [the complainant], can you tell me what she said and what you said?

A. I just asked her if she was okay. She didn't respond. I said I would like her to come with me so we could try to write a little bit more from yesterday.

Q. Yes.

A. Which she was very willing to do. We took up the piece of paper and she continued to write on that and that was that second part that we mentioned before.

Q. Can you just clarify what do you say is the second part that she wrote?

A. ""He had six with me.""

Q. When you say, ""sex"" you mean the S-I-X.

A. Yes.

…

Q. When she wrote that, do you recall how her demeanour was?

A. The same as it had been. Very - very sad and not making the eye contact.” (T.152.5 - .29)


	
	Thereafter, Ms Byrne contacted the relevant authorities. Two female police officers from the Bankstown Joint Investigation Response Team (JIRT) attended the school. They collected the piece of paper that the complainant had written on. The piece of paper was subsequently marked MFI 3. It is clear that there is other material written on that piece of paper. This was subsequently explained by the complainant in her statement and in her evidence at trial. Ms Byrne said that the rest of what is contained in document MFI 3 was not written in her presence.
	
	
	N gave evidence. She was then aged 19. She gave evidence without an interpreter. She had arrived in Australia in 2007 from Sierra Leone and after a time, moved into the house at Bankstown. She gave birth to her child in 2011 and ceased residing in those premises on 25 July 2012. This was at the same time that her friend and the complainant’s sister, F, also moved out.
	
	
	She had problems in the house with T and with the applicant. There were money problems with an allegation by the applicant that she was not paying her way. She had a good relationship with the complainant whom she would see every day. She was attending a school which was close to the complainant’s school. After she left the house, she did not see the complainant again until she and F visited her at her school on 16 August.
	
	
	She said that when she saw the complainant at school, she was upset because the complainant looked really messy. She said that F was upset as well and that the complainant burst into tears when she saw them and that they were all emotional. They were speaking to each other in the Krio language. The complainant told them that she was still having problems with “grandma” (T), she was not eating enough food and that she had to clean and wash the dishes before she was allowed to go to school in the mornings. The complainant said that she did not want to live there anymore but wanted to live with her and F. When initially asked about what she was told by the complainant, N said “Do I have to talk about it?” and was allowed to take a short break (T.61.45).
	
	
	When she returned to court, her evidence was:
	


“Q. Can you tell me what she said about that?

A. She told me that she was sleeping in the room. And [the applicant] went to the room, and took off her pants, and hold her mouth.

Q. When she said this to you, do you recall who was there, when she was saying this to you?

A. Yeah, she say that - I ask her for how long, she said not for long, cause Grandma was coming from her room, she say, and [the applicant] run to his room back.” (T.65.31)

These words were spoken by the complainant to her in Krio and at the time the complainant was very emotional and sad.


	
	N’s evidence continued:
	


“Q. When she told you this, did you say anything to her, or not?

A. The only thing I said to her, I said for how long, and she said not for that long.

Q. Did she say anything about what had happened in the room?

A. Yes, she did.

Q. What had happened?

A. She told me that she was sleeping, and Uncle [the applicant] to her room.

Q. Sorry?

A. She told me she was sleeping, and [the applicant] to her room, and she say that he took off her underwear, and hold her mouth. She told me that she wanted to scream, she say that [the applicant] say if she scream, if R come back to - from Africa, she will - he will tell her that she was doing bad stuff.

Q. Did she provide any further details about what happened in that room?

A. Yeah. She said [the applicant’s] on top of her.

Q. Did she say anything else?

A. No, after that she just paused and start crying.” (T.66.1 - .22)


	
	When asked what she told the principal, N said:
	


“A. Yeah, I said to the principal that [the complainant] just explained to us that she is suffering in the house, there's no food to eat and she has been sexual abuse in the house.” (T.66.40)


	
	N was cross-examined to the effect that she and F had talked about the complainant making a complaint about being sexually abused as they were walking towards the school. It is necessary to set out the questions and answers in relation to this issue since both the Crown and the applicant placed reliance upon them.
	


“Q. Did you and F talk about the fact that if [the complainant] complained about sexual abuse, that she wouldn't be able to go back to that house, and she'd have to come and live with you?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did you talk about that on the way to the school?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did you and F talk about telling [the complainant] that she should complain about being sexually abused, so that she could come and live with the both of you?

A. Yeah, we told her that she should tell the principal about it, if it happens again.

Q. Is that something that you and F talked about before you even got to the school?

A. Yeah.

Q. So you already had a plan about what you wanted [the complainant] to say to the principal, before you even got to the school?

A. Not for her like, to say something like, because she explain it to us, and we told her that if it happens again, she needs to tell the principal.

Q. I want to suggest to you, Ms N, that you and F went there with the very specific plan of having [the complainant] complain about sexual abuse, so that she could come and live with you and F. Do you agree or disagree with that?

A. Yes, I agree.

Q. You went to the police station on the Friday, when they called you, is that right?

A. Yeah.

Q. And later on, you made a statement to the police, didn't you?

A. Yeah.

Q. It wasn't on that day though, was it, a couple of days later?

A. Yeah.

Q. And when you spoke to the police, you told them what [the complainant] had told you, didn't you?

A. Yeah.

Q. You told them that one of the things that [the complainant] had said, was that she was screaming a little sound?

A. Yeah.

Q. Because she was being hurt?

A. Yeah.

Q. Is that what she told you?

A. Yeah, that's what she told me.

Q. And she told you that she thought that Grandma had heard, and came to the door?

A. Yeah.

Q. And that's when [the applicant] ran out?

A. Yeah.

…

Q. You were suggesting to her, by the questions that you were asking her, that she should make some complaints about Grandma and [the applicant], weren't you?

A. No, cause she explained the story to us, before I told her that she need to complain about it.” (T.75.17 – 76.49)


	
	F gave evidence at trial with the assistance of a Krio interpreter. She was aged 23 when she gave evidence. She had come to Australia in 2006 from Sierra Leone. She had come to Australia with her stepmother, T. The complainant was her little sister. After arriving in Australia, she had moved with T and the complainant to the premises at Bankstown and had shared a room with the complainant until she [F] left on 25 July 2012. At some time before she left the house, the applicant had moved in.
	
	
	She said that she had gone to the school to see the complainant on 16 August 2012. When she first saw the complainant she was upset because of how untidy the complainant was and she started to cry. She had difficulty talking about what she had been told by the complainant. Her evidence on that issue was:
	


“Q. What did she say?

A. She said yesterday night [the applicant] went to the room and took off her pants, her undies, and when she tried to scream, he put his hand over her mouth and try to scream, I'm going to tell my - your elder sister. That's R.

Q. You are speaking a bit fast. Okay? So just take a bit of a break. You said that she said to you that [the applicant] came into her room last night.

A. Yes.

Q. Can you just repeat what she said after that point?

A. She said he - he take off her undies.

Q. Just go slowly.

A. He take off her undies and when she tried to scream he covers her mouth and told her, ""If you scream, I'm going to tell your elder sister."" That's R.

Q. When she said this to you, how did she appear to you?

A. It appear like she is saying the truth because you can tell from her eyes –

…

Q. Was she happy when she was saying it, was she sad?

A. No, she was crying.

Q. When she was saying this to you, you said she was crying. Was she crying throughout?

A. Not loud cry. Like when you speaking, the tears run through

your eyes.” (T.87.9 - .50)


	
	F was cross-examined along the same lines as N:
	


“Q. You and N wanted [the complainant] to come and live with you, didn't you?

A. Yeah.

Q. And that's something that you talk about on the way to the school when you were going to visit her?

A. No. We are talking about different things.

…

Q. You had a conversation with N about what [the complainant] would have to say to be able to get away from TK and [the applicant]?

A. No.

Q. You thought that if [the complainant] complained about being sexually abused in the house, that she would have to leave there, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. You didn't think that?

A. No.

Q. Talk to N about that?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell [the complainant] that if she made such a complaint, that she would be able to come and live with you?

A. No.” (T.92.18 – 93.13)


	
	After the matter had been reported, the complainant was interviewed on the afternoon of 17 August 2012 by a Department of Community Services employee, Ms Megan Payne, and was remotely supervised by Senior Constable Julie Neagle. The complainant was aged 12 at the time and the interview took place two days after the offence. The interview was videotaped and shown to the jury. No interpreter was used.

And, he suddenly ran, and I was sleep, and I just heard a, my door

room and pretended nothing happened.

Q135   Yeah. And, if you can write your name too, thank you. So, I'm just going to ask you some more questions about what you wrote on here.

O.K. So, what do you mean by, ""He had sex with me""? What, what

Q275   Not safe. And, have you told anyone about it?

A   I only told my sister.

Q276   Your sister. Who's your sister?

A   F.”


	
	When the complainant gave evidence at trial she was aged 13. She did not use an interpreter. When asked how long the “blank” was inside her bottom, she was unable to remember. She said that she preferred to continue using the word “blank”. She said that when the applicant entered her room, the light was still on. She was on her side, facing the wall, with her knees bent up to her chest. The applicant’s body was pressed against her back and she was scared.
	
	
	Apart from the clarification of those issues, the complainant’s evidence in chief was what was set out in her videotaped statement.
	
	
	Under cross-examination the complainant said:
	


“A. When he finished, I turned around. That's when I saw him.” (T.26.39)

She denied that F had told her to say certain things in order to be able to get out of the house. Her evidence was:

“Q. Did F tell you that you need to say certain things to be able to get out of that house?

A. No, she didn't.

…

Q. Were you embarrassed about having this conversation in front of Mrs Byrne?

A. Yes, I was, a little.

Q. Was it the case, Ms XXX, that it was F and N who suggested that you should say you'd been sexually assaulted?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't tell them that you had been sexually assaulted, did you?

A. Yes, I did.” (T.30.19 - .48)


	
	The complainant gave evidence as to what happened to her clothes:
	


“Q. How did those clothes come off you, when your uncle was in the room?

A. I don't know.

Q. Did you take them off?

A. No.

Q. What clothes came off you?

A. None. None came off me.

Q. So you had your clothes on, the whole time your uncle was in the room, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Didn't you tell Meg, in the interview, that you uncle took

A. Yes, I -

Q. - your clothes off you?

A. Yes.

Q. And are you saying to me that that's not true?

A. Yes, it is true.

Q. Well, you told me just a moment ago, and I just want to clarify, that you had all of your clothes on?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. At some stage did those clothes come off?

A. Yes.

Q. How did they come off?

A. I don't know.

Q. You didn't take them off, did you?

A. No.

Q. Who took them off?

A. [The applicant]

Q. Did you see him take those clothes off?

A. No, because I was asleep.

Q. How do you know that he took them off then?

A. I was asleep that time.

Q. Would it be fair to say, Ms XXXX, that you really don't know what happened this particular evening?

A. I do know what happened.

Q. You certainly don't know how your clothes came off, do you?

A. No, because I was asleep.

Q. Were you having a dream, were you?

A. No.

Q. Were you having a dream that [the applicant] did these things to you, were you?

A. No.

Q. What clothes came off you?

A. My pants.

Q. Are we talking about tracksuit pants, or underpants?

A. My tracksuit pants and my underpants.

Q. What about your boots?

A. My boots was on.

Q. They stayed on, did they?

A. Yes.” (T.31.31 – T.32.49)


	
	The complainant’s evidence that she was asleep was vigorously challenged as follows:
	


“Q. What you say is that the reason you can't say that is because you were asleep?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it correct, Ms XXXX, that you're saying you're asleep as an excuse for the fact that you can't give us any detail about this incident?

A. I can't understand you.

Q. Okay. You're saying you were asleep as an excuse because you can't answer the questions. Do you agree or disagree with that?

A. I disagree.

Q. You told Meg that your uncle had his hand on your eye. Is that right?

A. Yes. Yes.

Q. Where you asleep while that was happening too?

A. Yes.

Q. So how do you know he had his hand on your eye?

A. Because I can feel his hand on my eye.

Q. But you're asleep.

A. Yes. I was asleep.

Q. When you say you were asleep, do you just mean you had your eyes closed or do you mean you were actually sleeping?

A. I was actually sleeping.

Q. I want to suggest to you, Ms XXXX, that if you were actually sleeping you wouldn't have known what was happening, would you?

A. I can't understand you.

Q. When you go to sleep at night, you don't know what's happening in the room around you, do you?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you mean when you've got your eyes closed or when you're asleep?

A. When I'm asleep.

Q. You know there's a difference between just having your eyes closed and being asleep, don't you?

A. Yes.

Q. So you're not confused about what I mean when I say, well, did you just have your eyes closed or were you asleep? You're not confused about that,

are you?

A. No.

Q. Well, I want to suggest to you, Ms XXXX, that either you were awake and you knew what was happening or you were asleep and you had no idea. Which one of those applies?

A. I can't understand you.

Q. You accept, don't you, that in order to know what was happening in the room, you had to be awake?

A. Yes, I know that.

Q. What you've been telling me is that you were asleep, haven't you?

A. Yes, I yes.

Q. You'd accept that if you were asleep you can't have known what was happening, could you?

A. Yes, I could.

Q. How?

A. I can't explain it.

Q. Try.

A. I can't.

Q. How was it, if you were asleep, you knew your uncle had his hand on your eye?

A. Because when you cover your eyes you can feel your own hand touching your face.

Q. You agree with me that to do that you would have to awake, yes?

A. No.

Q. No?

A. No?

Q. You do that in your sleep, do you?

A. Yes.

Q. You know that you've done that. Is that right?

A. No, I don't have an idea.

Q. You accept that you have no idea if something happens to you when you're asleep?

A. Yeah.

Q. You accept, don't you, Ms XXXX, that you have no idea about these incidents that you say took place, because you were asleep?

A. I can't understand you.

…

Q. How was it that you knew what time it was when your uncle came into your room?

A. Because when I went before I went to sleep, I checked the time.

Q. How long after you went to sleep did your uncle come in?

A. I can't remember that.

Q. Was it a short time or a long time?

A. A long time.

Q. You told us, when you were asked questions by the Crown Prosecutor before, that after your uncle left your room you brought your knees up to your chest. Is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened to your clothes?

A. I can't remember that.

Q. Did you do anything about your clothes?

A. No, because I was asleep.

Q. So you were still asleep?

A. Yes.

Q. You stayed asleep during the whole time your uncle was in your room; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Didn't you tell Meg that when your uncle was in your room, he said things like, ""I love your sister, R"". That's what you told Meg, wasn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you asleep when he said that?

A. Yes. I was.

Q. How is it that you remember what he said if you were asleep?

A. I remember everything what - what happened.

Q. I want to suggest to you that it is impossible for you to know what was being said if you were asleep at the time; do you agree or disagree with that?

A. I disagree with that.” (T.37.7 – 40.37)


	
	The issue was raised again:
	


“Q. F and N told you that you had to say things about your uncle to be able to move out with them?

A. No. They didn't tell me that.

…

Q. It's all mixed up because you're not telling the truth, isn't it?

A. No.

Q. You're saying you're asleep because you simply don't know what else to say. That's right, isn't it?

A. No.

Q. You told Meg in the interview that your uncle whispered, ""I believe you, everything you say"". That's what you told Meg, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. That's what you wanted your uncle to say to you, isn't it?

A. Yes. I wanted him to say that.

Q. You wanted to hear him say that he believed you, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Because he never did, did he?

A. Yes.

Q. You thought that if your uncle would just believe you, that would solve some of your problems at home, wouldn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's the reason you were talking to Meg, wasn't it, to solve your problems at home?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm going to suggest to you, Ms XXXX, that at no stage did your uncle put any part of his body on your back; do you agree with that or disagree?

A. I don't understand what you just said.

Q. What I'm saying to you is that at no time did your uncle put any part of his body on yours in your bed; do you agree with that or disagree?

A. I disagree.

Q. I want to suggest to you that he did not at any time put his penis in your bottom; do you agree or disagree with that?

A. I disagree.

Q. Do you know what a penis is, Ms XXXX?

A. Yes. I do.

Q. I want to suggest to you that you are continuing to say this story because it has gone so far; do you agree or disagree with that?

A. I couldn't understand you, what you just said.

Q. All right. You are continuing to say that your uncle abused you because you feel like you have to say it?

A. Yes. I have to get it out of my head.

Q. Even though it's not true, is it?

A. It is true.” (T.41.17 – 42.31)


	
	Fn was the sister to T. She gave evidence that in August 2010 she and the applicant went to the mosque together for Ramadan every day. She said they would go between 7.30pm and 8.30pm. She said that on 15 August 2012 she and the applicant went to the Punchbowl Mosque. He probably arrived at her house about 7.15pm. They finished at the mosque at about 8.30pm and walked back to her house. The applicant did not come in.
	
	
	The following day she and T, the applicant and the complainant went to the airport to pick up R. She said the complainant appeared normal and did not appear to be upset.
	
	
	M was the son of T and the half brother of the complainant. On 17 August 2012 he arrived at T’s house at 9.50pm. He had earlier received some messages in relation to the applicant having raped the complainant. He asked the applicant what had happened. The applicant cried and swore by the Ramadam month that he “is not going to be one of the people to do such an act against that young girl”.
	
	
	Only a minute or two after the conversation, M heard knocking at the front door. The persons at the door announced themselves at police officers. M and T went to the door while the applicant remained in the lounge room. The police had a search warrant and entered the house. M looked for the applicant but he could not find him. Within half an hour M telephoned the applicant and told him that the police had been there and that he was wanted by them. He advised the applicant to come home because the police wanted to speak to him. The applicant replied “yes”.
	
	
	Dr Alanah Houston gave evidence. On 17 August 2012 she was the Medical Co-ordinator at the Liverpool Sexual Assault Service. She was in charge of the physical examination of persons reporting to the Service, including making observations in the Sexual Assault Unit of certain matters on their bodies.
	
	
	At about 6.30pm on the evening of 17 August 2012 Dr Houston examined the complainant. She understood that there was an allegation that she had been sexually assaulted by her uncle on 15 August 2012. She was told by the police that there was a suggestion of anal penetration.
	
	
	She said that she deliberately did not take a history from the complainant. When the complainant was asked to demonstrate her position in bed, she lay on her side with her knees pulled up.
	
	
	Dr Houston when she examined the complainant was looking for signs of constipation. She could not find any. When she examined the complainant’s stomach, she found it to be very soft and that she was not constipated. The complainant told her that she had defecated since the assault and gone to the toilet on a number of occasions and had passed faeces.
	
	
	When Dr Houston examined the complainant’s anus and perianal area, she observed that the complainant had some soft faeces which was consistent with her not being constipated.
	
	
	Dr Houston when examining the anus found two healing fissures at 5 and 7 o’clock.
	
	
	Dr Houston gave the following evidence:
	


“… So the function of the anus is - is to open and close at appropriate times. It's - it allows quite large motions to come through, from the inside, without - without usually without any tearing or bleeding; and so equally it can allow large diameter things to go in from the outside, often without any damage or any tearing. So, that's the function of - of the anus, to dilate up, and close down. In this case, this girl did actually have some injuries.

Q. Yes, can you just tell me what those injuries were, and describe it by using that item, if you don't mind?

A. Yes, she had an anal fissure, which is a split, in in the skin, and can it can go right down to the muscles, so it was it comes out from the centre of the anus, like a radius. So it would have been a split, going down, and going up into the anus, so it would have been going further inside, all the way in. And she had two of them, and when you're trying to describe injuries to the anus, you tend to regard it as - as a clock face, with 12 o'clock at the front, and 6 o'clock there, so the five and the seven really represent two that are closest together. It's just it's just to denote the position where they are.

Q. In relation to these fissures, or the split you've referred to, when you observed them, are you able to say when those fissures or splits had occurred?

A. I would have said within - within the previous few days, because these heal very quickly. And the fact that I was seeing them, meant that I think - they, I supposed the oldest they could have been was about four or five days.” (T.162.46 – 163.20)

“Q. When injuries are caused on the anus, from passing faeces, is that as a result of the person being constipated?

A. Yes, if they were very constipated and had very hard motions coming

through, that could over distend the anus, beyond what it can cope with, and then there could, there could be injuries.

Q. When you examined the complainant, are you saying that there was no signs of constipation?

A. No, her tummy was nice and flat and soft, so when I was feeling around, there was nothing hard in there trying to get out. And also, she had soft faeces around the outside, which I cleaned away, so she wasn't a constipated child when I saw her.

Q. In terms of these two fissures that you saw, what did they indicate to you?

A. Well, they indicated to me that the anus had been stretched beyond its stretchable limit, and had so that there had been a two splits, or tears.

Q. Do you agree that in terms of the insertion of an adult male penis, into the anus, that would cause such an injury could cause?

A. Could cause, yes, yes.

Q. And in terms of your observations, was that consistent with anal penetration?

A. Yes.” (T.163.47 – 164.21)


	
	Dr Houston explained that it was too late to test for any semen presence because 48 hours had passed, particularly in circumstances where a child had been to the toilet and passed her motion.
	
	
	Dr Houston gave further evidence:
	


“Q. When you made observations of her anus again, you observed that the two fissures that you had observed on 17 August had been healed?

A. Yes.

Q. In terms of your understanding, when two fissures are - the injuries that you observed on the complainant on 17 August 2012, would that have caused pain?

A. Yes. It would have been a painful, painful experience.

Q. In terms of the pain, would that have continued after the injury was caused?

A. It would have given her pain when she passing a motion but probably not apart from that.

…

Q. Hence the healing process is usually --

A. Very rapid.

Q. --- rapid in that area. The fissures that you observed, would there have likely been the emission of blood from those wounds?

A. There could have been. It wasn't bleeding when I saw her because they were beginning to heal.

Q. In terms of your observations of the fissures, can you tell me again were they coming from the inside to the outside or from the outside to the inside?

A. Well, it was coming through from the inside and to the outside.

Q. What's the significance of that?

A. Well, to me it indicates something has been pushed in from the outside in.

Q. So inserted into the bottom?

A. Yes. Yes. I think that, to be clear, from looking at it I couldn't say absolutely but this had been - I had been told this - this is what had happened and this was entirely consistent with it.” (T.165.5 - .48)


	
	Under cross-examination the following evidence was given:
	


“Q. Doctor, you told us earlier that constipation could be one explanation for how a person could have an anal fissure. Is that right?

A. Yes. Yes.

Q. You'd also accept, doctor, that if a person was not constipated but nevertheless passed a hard, dry stool or faeces, that that would also cause or could cause an anal fissure?

A. But that's - that's constipation, having hard, dry stools. (T.168.28)

…

Q. Are you able to say, doctor, whether there was any inflation of the anus or rectum of [the complainant]?

A. No, just - just the fissures.

Q. Now, you've told us that from your observations it appeared consistent that something had been inserted into the anal area?

A. Yes.

Q. I think when you were clarifying that you said that that was consistent with what you'd been told and consistent with what you were, in a sense, looking for. Is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. But you're not able to say what, in fact, did happen to create those fissures. Is that right?

A. I wasn't there so I - I couldn't say.

Q. Would you agree, doctor, with the proposition that anal fissures are common in children that have poor toileting habits?

A. As a hygiene issue, you mean?

Q. Yes.

A. No. I suppose they might have some very little superficial ones but not

Q. Not of the nature that you're talking about?

A. Not of the nature.” (T.169.25 - .50)


	
	T was overseas during the trial. Her recorded interview taken through an interpreter on 30 August 2012, was played to the jury. In the course of that interview, she was asked to say what had occurred on the night of 15 August 2012.
	
	
	It was her recollection that the applicant slept at the mosque that night. She said that he told her at about 10pm that he was going to sleep at the mosque and then he left. T said that he did not return to the house until the morning. She said that she had never been woken up at night by him or by the complainant or by anyone else while they were in that house.
	
	
	The applicant was interviewed by the police and participated in an ERISP on 18 August 2012. That ERISP became exhibit E.
	
	
	In the ERISP the applicant denied running away from the police earlier that evening and said that he was not in the house when the police came. He denied sexually assaulting the complainant.
	
	
	He said that on Wednesday, 15 August 2012 he picked up Fn at around 6.30pm to go to the Punchbowl Mosque for prayers which started at 7pm. Later he said that he picked her up at 7.30pm. Once there he went to the separate men’s area and remained there until 3am. Later he said he left there at 6am.
	
	
	He said that he returned home at 11pm to have a shower and then left at midnight to return to the Lakemba Mosque. He said that T was there when he went home. She was waiting for him to leave so that she could lock the door. He said that on Wednesday night he was wearing jeans and a black leather jacket. He only wore the traditional gown on Fridays.
	
	
	When asked about the allegation that he had put his penis into the complainant’s bottom, he said “No, I can’t do it, I didn’t do that, I can’t do that, trust me, I can’t do that in no circumstances. [The complainant] is like a daughter to me” (Q/A621). The applicant denied ever sleeping in the complainant’s bed due to her wetting the bed.
	
	
	The police attempted to obtain CCTV footage from the Lakemba and Punchbowl Mosques. The CCTV footage from the Lakemba Mosque was grainy and indistinct while the Punchbowl Mosque did not have cameras.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – Having regard to the evidence the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported.


	
	The primary submission for the applicant was that he could not be found guilty unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truth and accuracy of what the complainant said. He submitted that this Court could not be satisfied on that issue and in particular, could not be satisfied that his penis penetrated the complainant’s anus. He submitted that a close scrutiny of the evidence would leave the Court with a reasonable doubt. He then set out a list of matters which he submitted, looked at individually and holistically, would demonstrate that the complainant’s evidence was not accurate and reliable.
	
	
	The matters to which the Court’s attention was directed were:
	



	
	The reservations which the trial judge had concerning the verdict which he forcefully expressed at T.8.45, 17.9.2013:
	


“I’ve got to tell you, Madam Crown, this case is one of the weakest I’ve ever seen presented in these courts.”


	
	The vagueness of the description of penetration of the anus – “on my bum” and later the response to a leading question – “Was it “outside your bum, inside your bum or something else”. This, it was submitted, was a “loaded” question with only limited alternatives suggested as an answer. The complainant was never asked to explain what she meant by the word “bum” and it was never made clear whether she was referring to penetration of her anus or within the cheeks of her backside. In the circumstances, the Court could not be satisfied that anal penetration had occurred.
	
	
	The complete absence of any expression of pain or discomfort which common sense says would have been felt by the complainant. The complainant’s account was doubtful given the lack of expression of pain or discomfort. Dr Houston said that the mechanism which caused the two fissures would have been painful. Comments by the complainant that it felt “bad” and “not safe” were not suggestive of a physical pain sensation. The absence of pain was surprising given the act alleged and should raise a doubt about the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant.
	
	
	The words attributed to the applicant by the complainant during the act do not ring true. When asked in the interview what the applicant said “when the blank was in your bum” she said that he whispered “I believe you, everything you say” and “I love your sister R”.
	
	
	Even taking into account that the complainant was aged 12 when spoken to by the police, her initial concern only related to the way her grandmother and the applicant treated her, not to any sexual assault. The applicant relied upon the fact that it was not until Q117 that there was any mention of sexual impropriety and that had to be led with difficulty from the complainant. There was no spontaneous mention of sexual assault or inappropriate touching. It was only when the conversation with Ms Byrne and the handwritten note were mentioned that a complaint was made.
	
	
	The medical evidence of the observations of fissures is consistent with both anal/penile penetration and the passing of a hard stool. In this regard, the applicant relied upon what the trial judge said in the summing up that the observations by the doctor were “consistent with but not conclusive of the alleged penetration” (ROS 15.1). The applicant submitted that a fair reading of Dr Houston’s evidence was that the fissures were consistent with anal penetration by a penis and the passing of a hard stool. The medical evidence therefore did not add to or increase the reliability of the complainant’s account.
	
	
	The evidence of flight was ambiguous. Even if the Court were satisfied that the applicant left the house when police announced their presence, it was entirely rational that he might have done so out of panic. It is not open to conclude that he did so out of a consciousness of guilt of sexually assaulting the complainant. The applicant said that he did not see the police come to the house and that the police did not see him leave.
	
	
	The complainant had a motive to exaggerate, if not lie. The complainant was unhappy in the house and felt that she was being picked on and mistreated by T and the applicant. She wished to leave the house and live with N and F. There was also the evidence in cross-examination of N that she and F had discussed making an allegation of sexual assault before they arrived at the school.
	
	
	The complainant’s assertion that she was actually asleep when she was assaulted and not just lying with her eyes closed did not make sense. It was not indicative of a reliable account. The complainant was asked on a number of occasions whether she was asleep during the whole incident and she maintained that she was.
	
	
	The applicant was a person of good character and had no prior criminal convictions.
	


Consideration


	
	The task of this Court where such a ground of appeal is raised is well established and well known: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 48; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question is ultimately whether notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, nevertheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand (M at 492) or, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	In making that assessment the Court is obliged to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses.
	


(1)   Comments of Trial Judge


	
	While the comments of a trial judge should always be given appropriate respect, they should not be given the weight sought to be placed on them by the applicant in this case. This was particularly so when one had regard to the context in which the remark by his Honour was made. His Honour was expressing some exasperation with the trial advocate for the Crown because of a point which she was seeking to make in her address.
	
	
	The question of what weight should be given to an expression of opinion by a trial judge in a jury trial was considered by Crennan J (with whom the plurality French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ agreed) in SKA v The Queen. What happened in that case was summarised by Crennan J as follows:
	


“77   After conviction, applications were made to the trial judge, on behalf of the applicant, for a certificate under the Criminal Appeal Act, which his Honour declined to grant, and for bail, which his Honour indicated he proposed to uphold before he proceeded to sentence the applicant. During the course of the judgment in respect of bail, his Honour recorded that the applicant appeared to be ""a perfectly honest witness"" and also that he ""found the complainant a very compelling witness"". His Honour then continued: ""I find it impossible to see how any jury acting reasonably could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ... In my opinion the jury acting reasonably could not have convicted the accused.""”


	
	In this case, apart from the exchange with counsel to which the applicant referred, there was also the following observation by his Honour Bennett DCJ when sentencing the applicant:
	


“The jury must have accepted beyond reasonable doubt the evidence given by the complainant upon whom the Crown case against the offender depended, notwithstanding anomalies, to some of which I shall refer. Regardless of the view I might have of her credibility or reliability as trial judge, I must give effect to the finding by the tribunal of fact. Any doubt lingering in light of discrepancies, inadequacies or the lack of probative force that the evidence might otherwise suffer are matters for an appellate Court in accordance with statements of principle such as in M v R [1994] 181 CLR 487.” (Sentence Judgment, 5.2)


	
	Crennan J set out the relevant principles as follows:
	


“110   Submissions on the alleged failure to take into account the trial judge's opinion were framed by reference to the value of a trial judge's report which must undoubtedly have been of ""great use"" before the routine provision of transcripts as part of a written record of a trial. In this case, the trial judge was not asked to provide a report and he declined to provide a certificate that the case was fit to appeal.

111   Relevant authorities establish a number of propositions about trial judges' reports which are applicable to the present circumstances where the transcribed evidence is part of the written record.

112   First, whilst a trial judge's report may be a factor to be taken into account it would be wrong to substitute the opinion of the judge for that of the jury. Secondly, the weight to be given by an appellate court to a trial judge's report will vary with the circumstances. Such a report will be of greatest assistance when expressing views about matters not readily apparent from the written record of a trial. Less weight will be given to a trial judge's report in circumstances where the judge's opinion appears to be based almost wholly upon the assessment of the evidence which an appellate court is obliged to undertake for itself, or is an opinion which is not fully reasoned. The functions of such a report, when there is in existence an adequate system for reporting of court proceedings, have been summarised helpfully in Sloane:

""An important function of a report under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act is to inform the Court of Criminal Appeal of any problems which might have emerged during the trial, which either do not appear on the face of the record, or which are imperfectly or ambiguously recorded.

Another permissible and relevant function of such a report is its use, by a trial judge, to raise any matters of irregularity or otherwise, which may give cause for significant doubt in relation to a guilty verdict, and which again are not apparent upon a bare reading of the record.

A third permissible reason for such a report is its provision, in response to a specific request from the Court of Criminal Appeal, in relation to any matter which may be of concern to it.

Otherwise, in times where there is in existence an adequate system for court reporting, occasion for the provision of a s 11 report should only arise in exceptional circumstances. Its use in order to justify, or to explain a decision for which reasons should have been provided, is not such a circumstance.""

…

115   … The trial judge's opinion was based on his assessment of the evidence, the very task which it was for the Court of Criminal Appeal to undertake independently for itself. In these circumstances there was no error in relation to the way in which Simpson J dealt with the trial judge's opinion.”


	
	In this case no report was provided or sought nor was a certificate sought. What is relied upon is a somewhat testy exchange between his Honour and the Crown at the end of the trial and a very general observation made by his Honour in relation to the complainant’s credibility and reliability in the course of the sentence judgment. As Crennan J pointed out it would be wrong to substitute the opinion of the judge for that of the jury and less weight will be given to a trial judge’s report in circumstances where the judge’s opinion appears to be based almost entirely upon the assessment of evidence which an appellate court is obliged to undertake for itself. Moreover, the comment by his Honour was expressed in very general terms and his reasoning was not exposed.
	
	
	In my opinion, this Court should not take into account the comments by his Honour to which the applicant made reference. It is necessary for the Court to reach its own conclusions based on its assessment of the evidence.
	


(2)   The vagueness of the description of the offence


	
	The complainant’s description of the offending was sufficiently precise to make out the offence. During the interview with Ms Payne, the complainant wrote (on the note marked “E”) that the applicant had put his penis on her “back”. She then marked (on the diagram “C”) where the applicant had put his penis and then described that structure by reference to it being used to defecate. Significantly, she volunteered the use of the word “bum” (Q/A262 – 265).
	
	
	The fact of actual penetration of the anus by the applicant received substantial support from the evidence of Dr Houston. The effect of the doctor’s evidence will be discussed in more detail later but the presence of two fissures was “entirely consistent with” and indicative of the occurrence of penile/anal penetration which had occurred within the 4-5 days preceding the medical examination.
	
	
	The applicant’s criticism of Q268 (“And, tell me, was it outside your bum, inside your bum or something else?”) is not made out. It is not correct to say that the form of Q268 was such that it only allowed (in practical terms) for two alternatives. A third alternative was not foreclosed and on other occasions in the statement the complainant did not accept suggested answers but made her own response. The form of Q268 permitted the complainant to answer in an unfettered way by reference to the three specified alternatives, i.e. “on”, “in” or any other response to the question - including by responding that she did not know what had occurred or that there had been an attempt at penile/anal penetration. The question clearly left open to the complainant the opportunity to provide any other response she might wish regarding what had happened, including an attempt or rubbing of the penis upon the buttocks/anus which would be conduct sufficient to amount only to an indecent assault.
	


(3)   The absence of any expression of pain


	
	The applicant’s reliance on “common sense” and “the absence of any expression of pain or discomfort” is not made out.
	
	
	It is correct that in the statement, the complainant did not tell Ms Payne anything more than that it felt “bad”. N in her evidence, however, said that the complainant had originally told her that she wanted to scream but that the applicant had placed his hand over her mouth and told her that if she did scream, he would tell her sister/aunt when she returned from Africa that the complainant had been doing bad things (T.66.05 - .16)
	
	
	At T.76.10 N said:
	


“Q. You told them that one of the things that [the complainant] had said, was that she was screaming a little sound?

A. Yeah.

Q. Because she was being hurt?

A. Yeah.

Q. Is that what she told you?

A. Yeah, that's what she told me.”


	
	At T.87.9 F gave evidence to similar effect:
	


“Q. What did she say?

A. She said yesterday night [the applicant] went to the room and took off her pants, her undies, and when she tried to scream, he put his hand over his mouth and try to scream, I'm going to tell my - your elder sister. That's R.

…

A. He take off her undies and when she tried to scream he covers her mouth and told her, ""If you scream, I'm going to tell your elder sister."" That's R.”


	
	It is obvious from her statement and her evidence at trial that there was a great reluctance on the complainant’s part to describe in any detail what happened. This was equally consistent with a cultural or personal reluctance as with unreliability, which was the interpretation sought to be placed on it by the applicant. It is clear from her narrative that she deliberately avoided any detailed description of what had happened. Early in her statement she was asked “Can you tell me about it” to which she responded “No” (Q/A55). On many occasions she used the response “It’s hard to explain it” or “It’s too hard to explain it” to avoid going into any detail. The jury saw and heard these responses and was in the best position to asses the genuineness of them.
	
	
	It is also important to remember that not only was the complainant aged 12 but her knowledge of both written and spoken English was marginal, as both her oral evidence and written evidence make clear.
	


(4)   The words attributed to the applicant do not ring true


	
	This submission is not made out.
	
	
	The answer at Q/A272 is fully consistent with the background to the incident. Having regard to the complainant’s history of not being believed by the applicant and by other household members, some of whom apparently beat her in the time leading up to the incident, the remark “I believe you everything you say” attributed to the applicant is understandable. Given what was occurring, the remark is consistent with an attempt on his part to placate, re-assure or at least secure the acquiescence of the complainant to what was happening. It fits in with an attempt by the applicant to ingratiate himself with her as a person whom she could trust and who had her interests at heart.
	
	
	The answer at Q/A145 relied upon by the applicant, was where he was said to have whispered “I love … your sister R”. From the context it would seem that these words were spoken during (or immediately before or after) the anal penetration. The words can be reconciled with an attempt by the applicant to secure the acquiescence of the complainant by indicating that the sexual activity then occurring should not be thought by her to indicate that he did not also love her sister/aunt and that the offence was in some way a betrayal by him of R.
	
	
	The third answer upon which the applicant relied is Q/A194 where he is said to have whispered “I love your sister so much but she’s rude and she doesn’t like me”. These words also appear to have been spoken during or immediately before or after the anal penetration. The remark suggests that not only did her sister/aunt not reciprocate the love which the applicant claimed he had for her but that she had been rude and hurt him by making it clear that she did not like him.
	
	
	Far from suggesting unreliability, these words fit with the factual background so far as we know it.
	
	
	Having regard to the circumstances in which they were spoken, all these remarks share the common theme of being designed to placate, re-assure and/or secure the acquiescence of the complainant to the sexual activity which was occurring.
	


(5)   The absence of any spontaneous complaint


	
	The applicant submitted that the reliability of the complainant was adversely affected because it was not until Q/A117 in the interview that she referred to a sexual assault by him and even then it had to be elicited from her with considerable difficulty. The applicant submitted that an inference should be drawn that the failure to mention the incident earlier in the statement meant that it was not at the forefront of the complainant’s mind and therefore probably did not occur.
	
	
	An initial problem with the submission is that it does not have regard to the totality of the complainant’s statement. Her reluctance to describe or discuss the incident and her attempts to avoid such discussion are patent and consistent. That same reluctance emerged when Ms Byrne was attempting to elicit details from her on 16 and 17 August 2012. The only time the complainant appears to have been prepared to talk freely about what occurred was when she was talking to N and F using the Krio language.
	
	
	What is important is that the complainant raised these issues at an early point in time. She told N and F the following day. She eventually disclosed in part what had happened to Ms Byrne that same day. She appeared upset and distressed and was avoiding eye contact. What she said about other matters in her statement were all part of her attempts to avoid discussing this unpleasant topic. The content of the statement makes this clear, as does the evidence from Ms Byrne as to her demeanour.
	
	
	Far from placing doubt on the complainant’s reliability and veracity, I am of the opinion that the statement and the evidence of Ms Byrne provide substantial support for her evidence. Even without specific evidence on the topic, it is apparent that there were personal, religious or cultural reasons perhaps also including guilt, embarrassment and a lack of trust that the family would provide appropriate support, which account for her extreme reluctance to freely articulate and discuss the full details of a sexual assault such as that which occurred in this case.
	


(6)   The evidence of Dr Houston


	
	The applicant submitted that a fair reading of Dr Houston’s evidence was to the effect that the fissures were equally consistent with both anal penetration by a penis and the passing of a hard stool. I disagree. In my opinion the evidence of Dr Houston is very much the other way and provides powerful support for the Crown case.
	
	
	It was fundamental to the applicant’s approach to the evidence of Dr Houston that her evidence be capable of establishing an hypothesis consistent with innocence, i.e. the passing of a hard stool by the complainant as a result of her being constipated. There is not a single piece of evidence to establish that proposition. There is no evidence that the complainant was constipated during the four to five days before she was examined by Dr Houston. On the contrary, to the extent that there is any evidence on the subject, it is to the effect that she was not constipated at the time that she was examined and by inference for at least some time before the examination (which would account for the findings which Dr Houston made).
	
	
	Her evidence made clear what she thought was the most likely explanation for what she found on examination. Not surprisingly, she was not prepared to say that it was absolutely certain that anal penetration had occurred. Nevertheless, it is clear that her opinion was that such penetration had occurred.
	
	
	What Dr Houston said was:
	


“Q. In terms of these two fissures that you saw, what did they indicate to you?

A. Well, they indicated to me that the anus had been stretched beyond its stretchable limit, and had so that there had been a two splits, or tears.

Q. Do you agree that in terms of the insertion of an adult male penis, into the anus, that would cause such an injury could cause?

A. Could cause, yes, yes.

Q. And in terms of your observations, was that consistent with anal penetration?

A. Yes. (T.164.11)

…

Q. What's the significance of that?

A. Well, to me it indicates something has been pushed in from the outside in.

Q. So inserted into the bottom?

A. Yes. Yes. I think that, to be clear, from looking at it I couldn't say absolutely but this had been - I had been told this - this is what had happened and this was entirely consistent with it.” (T.165.41)


	
	Dr Houston unqualifiedly rejected the propositions that anal fissures such as those which had been observed on the complainant could have been caused by a child suffering from diarrhoea or with such “poor toileting habits” that there was thereby a “hygiene issue”. The effect of the evidence of Dr Houston is that she did not reject constipation as a theoretical cause of the anal fissures but in her opinion the most likely cause was external anal penetration.
	


(7)   Evidence of flight


	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence of him leaving the house when the police arrived was ambiguous at best. He submitted that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for what he did, given his tragic background before he came to Australia, i.e. fear and panic when he realised the police wished to speak to him.
	
	
	From a factual point of view, there would appear to be clear evidence from Mohamed and T that on Friday night, 17 August 2012, the applicant had been at the premises when the police arrived and that by the time the police entered, he had left. That was to be contrasted with what the applicant said in his ERISP to the effect that he had eaten some food at the premises but had left before the police arrived.
	
	
	I agree with the applicant’s submission that of itself the fact that he left when the police arrived is not capable of establishing consciousness of guilt. At most that fact if established to the jury’s satisfaction could only be used in conjunction with other evidence in a “strand of a rope” approach.
	


(8)   Motive to lie


	
	The applicant submitted that the complainant had a motive to exaggerate and lie because she disliked living in the house with him and T. In support the applicant relied upon her complaints about how she was treated, that she missed F and N and her wish to move in with them.
	
	
	This together with the cross-examination of N and F forms the basis of the applicant’s submission that the accusation by the complainant was deliberately fabricated by her, N and F to provide a pretext for the complainant leaving the Bankstown premises and moving in with them. The applicant relied upon the cross-examination of N as providing evidence to that effect.
	
	
	There appear to be express admissions by N to that effect in cross-examination. On a proper reading of that evidence, however, it is clear that this evidence should not be taken at face value. N did not use an interpreter when giving her evidence and it is apparent that she did not fully understand the effect of the questions to which she gave an affirmative answer. A more reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that the discussion between her and F concerning the sexual assault on the complainant, only occurred after the complainant had told them what had happened. The following four questions and answers at T.75.25 make that clear:
	


“Q. Did you and F talk about telling [the complainant] that she should complain about being sexually abused, so that she could come and live with the both of you?

A. Yeah, we told her that she should tell the principal about it, if it happens again.

Q. Is that something that you and F talked about before you even got to the school?

A. Yeah.

Q. So you already had a plan about what you wanted [the complainant] to say to the principal, before you even got to the school?

A. Not for her like, to say something like, because she explain it to us, and we told her that if it happens again, she needs to tell the principal.

Q. I want to suggest to you, Ms N, that you and F went there with the very specific plan of having [the complainant] complain about sexual abuse, so that she could come and live with you and F. Do you agree or disagree with that?

A. Yes, I agree.”


	
	I do not read that evidence as having the effect contended for by the applicant. This is particularly so given the convoluted nature of the final question in the sequence. The better and more likely interpretation of the evidence is that it related to a discussion which took place after the complainant had told N and F about the offence. That conclusion is confirmed by the evidence of F who, with the assistance of an interpreter, rejected out of hand similar questions in cross-examination. That evidence does not leave me with a doubt as to the complainant’s reliability and veracity.
	
	
	If the complainant had the motive sought to be imputed to her by the applicant, she chose a strange way of achieving her purpose. Had she had such a motive, one would have expected her to have lost no time in making a complaint against the applicant. On the contrary, her extreme reluctance to make a complaint and to provide intimate details tends strongly against her having such a motive.
	


(9)   Reliability of complainant


	
	The applicant’s submission was that the evidence of the complainant that she had been asleep during the incident but still remembered what happened (T.36 - T.38) cast doubt upon her reliability.
	
	
	If the complainant’s responses are taken literally, the evidence is difficult to understand. Unfortunately what the complainant meant by being asleep was never properly explored or explained. A more likely explanation of what she meant was that she had been asleep when the applicant entered her room, got into her bed and removed her clothes and commenced the sexual encounter. She may well have been half asleep, or at least not entirely awake, during the offence and that this was what she was trying to convey.
	
	
	Such an interpretation of necessity involves some speculation as to what precisely the complainant meant in her evidence. What is important is that at no time did the complainant resile from her primary position that the applicant had entered her room and sexually assaulted her, nor did she accept that she was mistaken or telling lies as to what happened. On the contrary, even after cross-examination that elicited responses that she had been asleep, the complainant rejected the assertion that the applicant had not sexually assaulted her (T.41.29 – 41.34, 42.26 – 42.31).
	
	
	The jury were fully aware of the apparent inconsistency in the complainant saying she was asleep but also saying that she knew what was happening and what the applicant was doing. This was stressed, not only by defence counsel in her address, but also by the trial judge in his summing up. Even allowing for that apparent discrepancy in the complainant’s responses, on the whole of the evidence I have not concluded that it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand. Given the nature of the offending, the applicant’s prior good character does not dissuade me from that conclusion.
	


Conclusion


	
	Despite difficulties in explaining some of the evidence, none of the submissions by the applicant as to the unreliability of the complainant have been made out. On the contrary, a proper reading of the relevant evidence, particularly the medical evidence, strongly supports the complainant. It follows that I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The failure to edit out Q/A 633 from the [applicant’s] record of interview which was played to the jury caused a miscarriage of justice.


	
	The applicant was interviewed by Detective Neagle from 3.30am until 5am on the morning of Saturday, 18 August 2012. The recorded interview was played to the jury and the applicant did not give evidence. Included in the recorded interview was Q/A633 which was in the following terms:
	


“Q633   Because see we’ve also been told that when [the complainant] goes to the toilet in the house that you’ve been seen to be looking in through the door at her.

A.   When was that? That’s oh, is bullshit. That’s not, not true. I can’t do that.”


	
	After the record of interview was played, the trial judge questioned why Q/A633 was allowed to be heard by the jury. This was described as an “oversight” by counsel for the defence. The following exchange took place in the absence of the jury:
	


“HIS HONOUR: The next question is why question 633 was left in.

COUNSEL: That was an oversight, your Honour. That was an oversight and my solicitor and I had thought that that had been taken out, but again that's something that we missed.

…

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Your Honour, that was agreed by the parties to stay in. Everything your Honour has was agreed by the parties to stay in. …” (T.241)


	
	No application to discharge the jury was made on behalf of the applicant following that exchange or at all.
	
	
	The trial judge was sufficiently concerned about Q/A633 that he specifically referred to it in his summing up as follows:
	


“While I am dealing with evidence and the proposition that you must decide this case according to the evidence, I want to make it clear to you that some things are not evidence; and a question standing by itself is not evidence. The question and the answer provide the evidence.

For example, if you were sitting here in court and you heard a barrister asking a question of a witness about whether or not they were wearing a hat yesterday, and the witness said, “No, I wasn't,” there is no evidence before you that the witness was wearing a hat yesterday. The proposition is implicit in the question or expressed in the question, more correctly, but until the witness agrees that they were wearing a hat yesterday, there is no evidence before you that they were wearing a hat the day before; and it does not matter how forcefully or how often the question is put. While ever the witness retains that position, maintains they were not wearing a hat, there is no evidence before you that they were wearing a hat.

That is important in this case, because of a question that is in the record of interview that was tendered in the Crown case. It was one of those questions that perhaps should not have been included, but in any event it is there before you and I must give you a direction in the strongest terms that you must disregard it. It is question 633 of the interview of the accused. It is in these terms:

“Q. Because, see, we’ve also been told that when [the complainant] goes to the toilet in the house that you've been seen to be looking in through the door at her?

A. When was that? That’s, oh, is bullshit. That’s not - not true. I can't do that.”

Thus there is no evidence before you of any such conduct by the accused. There is no indication to us at all from whom that information came or how reliable it might have been or in what circumstances any such observation might have been suggested to have been made. It is completely valueless to your deliberations, and you should completely ignore it. Whatever proposition is contained expressly or by implication in that question, it is not the subject of evidence before you. It should be ignored.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the question was highly prejudicial and referred to uncharged conduct which was not led from the complainant and was not alleged at all. The applicant submitted that insofar as the question asserted that the police officer had been told something despite the applicant’s denial, it was unfairly prejudicial and grounds for a discharge of the jury. The applicant submitted that it could only have led the jury to speculate as to the background to the question. The applicant submitted that the reference to “oversight” by the defence counsel was a concession of error.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that once the error was conceded by defence counsel, the next appropriate step should have been an application to discharge the jury. He submitted that the failure to apply for a discharge could not be characterised as a forensic decision to his advantage. Alternatively, if there were a decision not to apply for a discharge (because for example the complainant appeared to have been sufficiently discredited), then the decision was erroneous.
	
	
	Since this point was not taken at trial, the applicant accepted that leave was required pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. He submitted that leave should be granted in this case because a miscarriage of justice occurred.
	


Consideration


	
	It is accepted that the failure to remove Q/A633 from the applicant’s statement was an oversight. Its potential effect on the jury, however, has been significantly overstated in submissions. There was already a similar issue in play.
	
	
	At Q/A50 – 51 of the complainant’s statement was as follows:
	


“Q50   How does he harass you?

A   Like, he goes into my bedroom, he meets me, like, putting my school

uniform on, and he doesn't knock on the door, so he just barge in.

Q51   He barges in when you're putting your school uniform on.

A   Yeah.”


	
	This was taken up by counsel for the applicant at trial when cross-examining the complainant:
	


“Q. You told Meg, when you were speaking to her, that your uncle used to barge into your room, all day, do you remember saying that?

A. I said sometimes.

Q. I want to suggest to you, Ms XXXX, that …

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Your Honour, I object to the word ""suggest"".

HIS HONOUR: Why?

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Because I don't think that the complainant understands that term.

HIS HONOUR: I don't agree with you, Madam Crown. Yes, proceed.

COUNSEL: Q. Ms XXXX, I want to suggest to you that at no time did your uncle come barging into your room, while you were getting dressed. Do you agree or disagree with that?

A. I agree with that.” (T.34.45 – 35.15)


	
	Not only was no objection taken by the applicant to that issue being raised at trial, but it was counsel for the applicant who raised the matter again during cross-examination.
	
	
	In addition, his Honour gave a direction in the course of his summing up in the strongest terms to the effect that Q/A633 in the applicant’s record of interview was valueless and should be ignored by the jury. There is no basis for supposing that the jury did not follow that direction. To submit otherwise involves nothing more than speculation.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant at trial was in a far better position than this Court to assess the atmosphere of the trial. The fact that she did not make an application to discharge the jury allows an inference that in her opinion such prejudice as there was, did not justify such an application. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, this Court can infer that the decision not to apply for a discharge of the jury was a considered forensic one. This is particularly so when the matter had specifically been drawn to counsel’s attention by the trial judge.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, no miscarriage of justice took place. This ground of appeal has not been made out. In those circumstances, I would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	The application for an extension of time within which to appeal is granted.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against conviction is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	HARRISON J: In considering this appeal this Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence in the trial and to determine whether upon the whole of that evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. The Chief Judge has thoroughly considered that evidence in conformity with the test for which M v The Queen is authority. I respectfully adopt his Honour’s analysis and agree with his reasons for concluding that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	It is very often difficult in cases of alleged child sexual assault, although by no means limited exclusively to them, that the Crown case depends almost entirely upon the evidence of a single witness, of tender years, sometimes from a different country, with inadequate or limited English and subject to often quite arcane religious, cultural and social mores enforced within the family but which are not generally influential or understood in Australia. These matters, or a combination of some of them, can in many circumstances confront those of us uninstructed in or unfamiliar with such differences in a way that significantly influences our perception of the evidence that such a person gives of the events that are critical to proof of the Crown case.
	
	
	In the present case it appears reasonable to observe that the complainant was embarrassed by references to her own genital anatomy or that of the appellant and was otherwise disinclined to speak of it without prompting or the use of non-anatomical descriptions or terms. Some of her evidence was also afflicted with the logical difficulty that part of the account she gave included a reference to events that occurred when she said she was asleep when it seems clear that she was intending to refer either to pretending to be asleep or simply to having her eyes closed.
	
	
	These and other similar matters were legitimately available to be, and were, exploited by counsel for the accused at the trial and were also quite properly emphasised by his counsel in this Court. However, as the analysis by the Chief Judge makes plain, these arguable imperfections in the complainant's evidence and the way it was delivered are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. The vagueness of the complainant’s description of what she said occurred, the associated absence of any complaints of pain and the (on one view) curious words that she ascribed to the appellant at the time of the assault, as well as the absence of any contemporaneous complaint, are all colourable circumstances. None can be said either alone or in combination logically or inexorably to cause this Court to have a doubt which the jury ought also to have experienced. In my opinion, any suggestion that the complainant’s evidence lacks credibility is more than adequately met or explained by the manner in which it was given, especially having regard to her particular personal and cultural characteristics. This is a case in which in my view the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the complainant’s evidence is more than capable of resolving any doubt that the appellant contends this Court should itself be experiencing.
	
	
	I am of the view, based upon the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I am grateful for the detailed review and analysis of the evidence provided by Hoeben CJ at CL. His Honour's conclusions accord with my own and I agree with the orders he proposes.
	
	
	I am also grateful for and agree with the additional observations of Harrison J.
