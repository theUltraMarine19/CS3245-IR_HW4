     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Application is made by SGJ and KU for leave to appeal against sentence. The sentences were imposed on 27 August 2007 by English DCJ at the Penrith District Court. They related to multiple sexual and other offences.  
     
      
    3 SGJ and KU are, respectively, de facto husband and wife. At the time of these offences they had lived together for about 20 years. They had two children, a son aged 19 at the time of sentence and a daughter aged 10. 
     
      
    4 There were differences between the charges which each faced. SGJ, the husband, ultimately pleaded guilty to 15 counts, 6 on the first indictment and 9 on the second. He also asked her Honour to take account of a further 18 offences on a Form 1, when sentencing in respect of Count 4 on the second indictment. 
     
      
    5 SGJ’s wife, KU, pleaded guilty to 14 counts, 5 on the first indictment (that is, one less than her husband) and the same 9 counts on the second indictment. She also signed a Form 1, to be taken into account when sentencing in respect of Count 4. In her case, the Form 1 included 16 further offences, that is, 2 less than her husband.  
     
      
    6 SGJ’s offences related to seven victims, whereas KU’s offences related to six. The police were able to identify four of those victims (who became complainants). The remaining three victims were unknown, their images having been recovered by police from a computer hard drive seized from the home of SGJ and KU. 
     
      
    7 The charges faced by KU on the first indictment were as follows:

        Crimes Act 
         1900; (maximum penalty: imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non parole period of 15 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:

        Crimes Act 
         1900. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4:

        Victim A

        Crimes Act 
         1900; (maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5:

         1900; (maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years). 
        
       
      
    8 The first indictment in respect of SGJ was in the same terms except that it included the following additional count relating to a separate victim (Victim B):

    11 The two additional offences on the Form 1 in respect of SGJ were as follows (the numbering being somewhat different from that adopted in respect of KU): 
     
      
       
        
        Form 1 - # 8:  
        That on 8.10.05, he cultivated cannabis. 
        
       
       
        
        Form 1 - # 9:  
        That on 8.10.05, he possessed cannabis. 
        
       
      
    12 Her Honour ultimately imposed the same aggregate sentence upon both offenders, that is, a total term of 22 years consisting of a non parole period of 15 years (8.10.2005 to 7.10.2020) with an additional term of 7 years (expiring 7.10.2027). She determined that “on the issue of parity, except for Count 6 on the indictment of 18 October 2006 in respect of (SGJ), I find their respective degrees of culpability to be equal” (ROS 36). The sentences imposed on both offenders in respect of Counts 1 to 5 of the first indictment were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 8 years to date from 8.10.2005 and expire on 7.10.2013. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 8 years to date from 8.10.2010 and expire on 7.10.2018. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 8 years to date from 8.10.2010 and expire on 7.10.2018. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 8.10.2010 and expire on 7.10.2012. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years to date from 8.10.2010 and expire on 7.10.2015. 
        
       
      
    13 In respect of Count 6 (which was exclusive to SGJ), her Honour imposed a concurrent term as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 6:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 3½ years to date from 8.10.2010 and expire on 7.4.2014. 
        
       
      
    14 The terms of the second indictment were the same for both. Her Honour imposed the following sentences in each case: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years to date from 8.10.2006 and expire on 7.10.2009. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 8.10.2006 and expire on 7.10.2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 6 years to date from 8.10.2009 and expire on 7.10.2015. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4:  
        Taking account of the Form 1 matters in respect of each offender, a non parole period of 11 years to date from 8.10.2009 and expire on 7.10.2020. 
         
        Balance of term of 7 years to expire on 7.10.2027, making an overall term of 18 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 6 years to date from 8.4.2010 and expire on 7.4.2016. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 9 years to date from 8.4.2010 and expire on 7.4.2019. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 9 years and 9 months to date from 8.4.2010 and expire on 7.1.2020. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 8:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 8.10.2006 and expire on 7.10.2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 9:  
        Fixed term of imprisonment for 8 years to date from 8.10.2009 and expire on 7.10.2017. 
        
       
      
    15 Both applicants relied upon a number of grounds of appeal, which are set out below. Before identifying the grounds, and the arguments in support of each, I should describe the circumstances giving rise to each charge. 
     
      
       
      The first indictment. 
       
      
    16 SGJ was born in January 1964. KU was born in March the same year. They had lived together as de facto husband and wife since about 1985. They occupied a house in a small town on the south coast of New South Wales. The offences occurred in a 10 month period (between late November 2004 and October 2005). Their son, at that time, was aged about 16 years and their daughter less than 8 years. 
     
      
    17 SGJ had a brother who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In 2000, or thereabouts, he died, aged 39 years. In November 2003, that is, before these offences, the offenders’ son noticed numbness in certain limbs and problems with his eyesight. These were the symptoms of multiple sclerosis which was later diagnosed. His parents, naturally, regarded this development as catastrophic. 
     
      
    18 Both SGJ and KU were long term users of cannabis, smoking the drug daily. After their son’s diagnosis and before these offences, they began experimenting with methamphetamine (“ice”). It was a costly drug for which they paid about $100 a week in the beginning, and about $200 a week as time went by. At about this time, SGJ introduced his wife, KU, to “mainstream pornography”, that is, not involving children. 
     
      
    19 On 7 October 2005, KU drove to the home of SGJ’s late brother. Arrangements had been made with his widow for her daughters (SGJ’s nieces) to visit their cousin and sleep over. One of the daughters (Victim A) was 8 years 8 months, a few days younger than her cousin. The other (Victim B) was aged 10 years 5 months. 
     
      
    20 On returning home the next day, Victim A complained to her mother that her uncle had been “rubbing my private parts”. She added that her uncle had also touched her on a previous occasion. Arrangements were made at once for Victim A to be interviewed by the police. Victim A provided an account of what had occurred in the course of the sleep over. Her description became the foundation for the offences charged in the first indictment against both offenders. 
     
      
    21 Ultimately, there were pleas of guilty to both indictments. The matter proceeded before the sentencing Judge upon an agreed Statement of Facts. Neither offender gave evidence. According to the agreed facts, Victim A told the police that, having gone to bed in the loungeroom of the offenders’ home, SGJ woke her up. She was directed to accompany him to the bedroom. Once in the bedroom, her uncle asked her to get onto the bed. KU was present at that time, standing next to the television. However, KU left the bedroom once Victim A sat on the bed. SGJ then asked Victim A to “take your pants off please”. She refused. He then removed her pants himself. Having done so, he rubbed Victim A’s vagina for 30 minutes. Whilst he was doing so, KU re-entered the bedroom. 
     
      
    22 SGJ then said to Victim A: “Suck my doodle”. Again she refused. He then hit her on the left arm. She got off the bed and went to leave the bedroom. He stopped her, saying: “Come back onto the bed and suck my doodle.” Victim A then did so. She placed her mouth on SGJ’s penis and, for about 15 minutes, moved her mouth up and down. 
     
      
    23 The events of that evening and the abuse of Victim A continued, as I will shortly describe. However, before I do so, I should advert to a problem. It made the sentencing task immeasurably more difficult. The conduct I have described was a sequence, where each event was related to the one that followed. Each aspect concerned the same victim, and occurred within a relatively short time, such that collectively they may be regarded as the one episode (a matter relevant to issues of concurrence and accumulation) (R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, per Simpson J at 67). Some aspects of SGJ’s conduct did not amount to criminal conduct, such as waking Victim A from her sleep and directing her to go to his bedroom. Such circumstances were, nonetheless, relevant to the primary offence committed a short time later, fellatio (being Count 2 of the first indictment, sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). Other aspects of SGJ’s conduct were separate crimes, such as rubbing Victim A’s vagina (aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years) or hitting Victim A when she refused to co-operate (which was an assault). 
     
      
    24 However, the prosecution artificially broke up the sequence by placing certain offences upon the Form 1, which then became relevant to the sentence on Count 4, second indictment, which related to a different complainant, Victim C. The result in the sequence already described, for instance, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Form 1 – Count 3:  
        SGJ removes the pants of Victim A. 
        
       
       
        
        Form 1 – Count 4:  
        SGJ rubs the vagina of Victim A. 
        
       
       
        
        Form 1 – Count 5:  
        SGJ hit Victim A on the left arm. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 (1st Indictment):  
        Fellatio (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). 
        
       
      
    25 The sequence should not have been broken up in this way. By doing so, there was the risk of double counting, were the sentencing Judge to take account of the acts making up the sequence when sentencing the offenders for the major offence (fellatio), and at the same time, use such offences on the Form 1 when sentencing for Count 4, second indictment. The only conduct that permissibly provided context for Count 2, in these circumstances, was waking Victim A up, removing her from bed to the loungeroom, and the absence of consent to what then occurred. Such conduct was not an aggravating feature of the offence charged in Count 2, such as to give rise to a more serious offence (De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383). They were, nonetheless, the circumstances relevant to an understanding of the criminality in Count 2, together with the fact that this was not an isolated incident. 
     
      
    26 Of course, it is permissible to have unrelated offences on a Form 1, such as the drug offences (Counts 8 and 9) in respect of SGJ. But where the offence to which the Form 1 attaches (Count 4, second indictment) related to Victim C, it was illogical to include crimes relating to Victim A. It made it difficult for the sentencing Judge, without double counting, to give such offences any real weight when sentencing on the count relevant to the Form 1 (Count 4). 
     
      
    27 Related conduct amounting to a crime may be dealt with either by separate charges or on a Form 1. Where there are separate charges, and they form part of the same episode, the sentencing Judge will determine issues of accumulation and concurrence in the context of the principle of totality, as set out by Howie J in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at 47: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively.  
        The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? 
         If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    28 If the matter is dealt with on a Form 1, it has the advantage, from the viewpoint of the offender, that he is not subject to a separate sentence, and the sentence imposed in respect of the count to which the Form 1 attaches cannot exceed the maximum. The Form 1 offences, of course, must be evaluated in the context of the particular crime to which they attach. A longer sentence may be imposed than if the primary crime stood alone, reflecting the need for personal deterrence and the community’s need to extract retribution for serious criminal conduct for which no punishment has in fact been imposed (Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146).  
     
      
    29 Here, if the prosecution wished to limit the charges against SGJ, and place some on a Form 1, there ought to have been a separate Form 1 for each victim, drawing together lesser offences relevant to that victim. The Form 1 relating to the most serious offence, Count 4 in the second indictment, could then have collected the miscellaneous additional offences (such as SGJ’s drug offences and the offences against the unidentified victims) which did not concern complainants who were the subject of specific counts. 
     
      
    30 Returning to the events of the evening of 7 October 2005, after the sequence which has been described, SGJ asked Victim A to “roll over and rub your vagina and smile” (the offence of inciting a child to commit an indecent act). That offence was likewise placed on the Form 1 (Count 6). Victim A did as she was told. KU then photographed Victim A in the presence of SGJ (Count 5, first indictment: using a child under the age of 14 years for pornographic purposes). 
     
      
    31 The photograph having been taken, SGJ again asked Victim A to “can you please suck my doodle again”, which she did (Count 3, first indictment). KU photographed Victim A performing that act (Form 1: Count 7). KU then lent over Victim A and herself performed oral sex on SGJ (Count 4, first indictment: commit an act of aggravated indecency towards a child under the age of 14 years). 
     
      
    32 Following the interview of Victim A on 8 October 2005, a search warrant was executed upon the home of SGJ and KU. The police located three digital cameras and a computer, which were seized. They also found 10 cannabis plants being grown hydroponically (Form 1: Count 8: cultivate cannabis, concerning SGJ only.) Cannabis leaf was located in the garage (Form 1: Count 9: possess cannabis, concerning SGJ only.) SGJ and KU were arrested. Bail was refused and they remained in custody until sentenced. 
     
      
    33 On 10 October 2005, Victim A was again interviewed. It will be remembered that, when she first complained to her mother, she said that her uncle had touched her on a previous occasion. In the second interview the police asked about the earlier occasion. Victim A described what happened on 26 November 2004, when she slept over at her cousin’s home. A number of other children had also slept over. They all went to bed in the loungeroom. After she was asleep, SGJ woke her up. He held her hand and led her to his bedroom. He told her to get onto the bed. As she did so, KU stood alongside the bed.  
     
      
    34 SGJ then placed a red blanket over her head. He removed her underwear (Form 1: Count 1: SGJ/KU). Victim A asked whether she could put her underwear back on. She was told that she could not. SGJ then sat beside her. He said: “Can you suck my doodle?” Victim A did so (Count 1, first indictment: SGJ/KU). Whilst she did so, SGJ masturbated her with his hand (Form 1: Count 2: SGJ/KU). 
     
      
    35 Victim A later removed the blanket from her head. She asked to return to her bed. Permission was refused. Eventually she was told to go back to her bed. At the time of these events Victim A was 7 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    36 On 10 October 2005, the police also interviewed Victim A’s sister (Victim B). She was somewhat older (10 years 5 months). She, likewise, recounted an episode on the evening of 7 October 2005. However, the offence which she identified related only to SGJ and became Count 6 upon the first indictment concerning SGJ. When she was asleep in the loungeroom, she became aware of SGJ lying next to her. She woke up. He then rubbed her vagina, both on the inside and the outside of the clothing she was wearing. He also placed his hand underneath her bikini top, rubbing her chest, saying words to the effect: “It feels so good.” 
     
      
    37 Committal proceedings in respect of the first indictment were held on 3 March 2006. Both SGJ and KU were committed for a trial which was to take place in October 2006. Both, at that point, insisted that they were innocent. 
     
      
       
      The second indictment. 
       
      
    38 Meanwhile, the two hard drives of the computer were examined. Images were retrieved which corroborated the account of Victim A. Other images were retrieved which revealed additional victims and additional offences. A second indictment was then framed against each offender. It contained nine counts. 
     
      
    39 The photographic evidence obtained from the computer was incontrovertible. There were 81 images in data stored in the computer. They had been taken with a Kodak Eazy-Share CX7200 digital camera, such as that seized by police in their search. Some images depicted SGJ (or his tattooed fingers) and KU involved in sexually explicit acts with young children. Most images showed the time and date each photograph was taken. The agreed facts included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “These pornographic images depict 5 separate child victims. The faces of 4 of the victims are either out of shot or covered during the assaults; however police have been able to identify 2 of the children depicted.” 
        
       
      
    40 Dealing with the counts in chronological order, Count 2 related to a series of six photographs taken on or about 14 December 2005 (s 91G(1) Crimes Act, using a child under the age of 14 years for pornographic purposes). They showed a young female (Victim E) in her underpants with her vagina and bottom exposed. Images 1.1 to 1.3 showed the hands of SGJ pulling at the girl’s underwear, exposing her genitals (Count 1). The image displays his tattoo on the left index finger. The photographs were taken between 10.51 pm and 11.10 pm, a period of approximately 20 minutes. According to a paediatrician, the child (Unknown Victim 1) was aged between 3 and 5 years. 
     
      
    41 The next series of photographs concerned Victim C, who was a school friend of the offenders’ daughter. She used to sleep over from time to time at their home. A series of images of Victim C were taken between 9.45 pm on 12.3.05 and 5.30 am on 13.3.05, a period of almost 8 hours. Victim C, at the time, was 7 years old, approaching her 8th birthday. The images revealed 5 offences. Two, Counts 3 and 4, were included in the second indictment, and the remaining three, appropriately, were dealt with on the Form 1. Count 3 in the second indictment was a general count that, on or about 12 March 2005, SGJ and KU had each used a child under the age of 14 years for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Count 4 was based on an image showing SGJ engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse with Victim C. It will be remembered that the Form 1 matters were to be taken into account when sentencing on this count. 
     
      
    42 There was an image of Victim C showing her lying in bed with her underpants pulled across, exposing her vagina. Other images in the same sequence showed KU spreading the lips of Victim C’s vagina to further expose it (Form 1: Count 8: KU/Form 1: Count 10: SGJ; aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years). There was a further image showing SGJ digitally penetrating Victim C’s vagina (Form 1: Count 9: KU/Form 1: Count 11: SGJ; sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). Yet another image depicted KU performing cunnilingus upon Victim C (Form 1: Count 10: KU/Form 1: Count 12: SGJ; sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). 
     
      
    43 The photographic images depicted a further child (Victim D). She was aged 5½ years at the time the images were taken. KU had placed an advertisement in a local newspaper seeking employment as a baby sitter. The mother of Victim D read that advertisement and arranged for KU to baby sit her child. Her child was dropped at the home of SGJ and KU, where she spent the night. Twenty-two images were taken of Victim D over an 8 hour period between 6.36 pm on 8.4.05 and 2.35 am on 9.4.05. The images revealed a number of serious offences. Some were made counts in the second indictment (Counts 5, 6 and 7). Others, again inappropriately for the reasons given, were made counts on the Form 1, relevant to the sentence to be imposed on Count 4 (which related to a different victim, Victim C). Count 5 related to images of Victim D in sexually explicit poses, giving rise to the charge of using a child under the age of 14 years (namely a child aged 5½ years) for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Count 6 charged sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years and was based upon an image showing KU inserting her finger in Victim D’s vagina (image 3.17). Count 7 charged the same offence and was based upon a digital photograph showing KU’s finger in Victim D’s anus. 
     
      
    44 It will be remembered that there were four offences relating to Victim D included on the Form 1 of each offender. Form 1: Counts 11 and 12, KU and Counts 13 and 14, SGJ, were charges of aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years and, in each case, were based upon images of Victim D showing both offenders using their fingers to expose the genitalia of the victim as photographs were taken. Form 1: Count 13, KU/Count 15, SGJ, were based upon a photograph taken at 1.05 am on 9 April 2005, being the first of two images showing KU performing cunnilingus upon Victim D (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). The final charge relating to this victim, Form 1: Count 14, KU/Count 16, SGJ was a second image of KU again performing cunnilingus upon Victim D, taken one and a half hours later (2.35 am) (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). 
     
      
    45 Count 8 related to Victim F, who was the second child who could not be identified, whose image appeared in this material. Count 8 charged that, between 13 December 2004 and 7 October 2005 the offenders had used a child under the age of 14 years for pornographic purposes (s 91G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900). There were a series of 10 images, although the date did not appear. One image showed KU performing cunnilingus upon the victim, which became Count 9 (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years). In the opinion of the paediatrician, the child was within the age range of 5 to 8 years. 
     
      
    46 The remaining images form the basis for the Form 1, Count 15 KU/Count 17 SGJ. They depicted the victim in sexually explicit poses with KU using her fingers to further expose the child’s genitalia. 
     
      
    47 There was one further image which showed KU performing cunnilingus upon yet another unknown child (Victim G). The image did not display the time and date it was taken. The child was estimated to be less than 12 years of age and most likely between 8 and 10 years of age. That image formed the basis for the charge in Form 1, Count 16 KU/Count 18 SGJ, being sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case of SGJ. 
       
      
    48 SGJ, as mentioned, did not give evidence on sentence. He had a minor criminal record. In 1982, he was ordered to serve 150 hours community service for taking a motor vehicle. In 1990, he was convicted of assault and malicious damage and was fined. He had no convictions for offences of a sexual nature. Her Honour said this: (ROS 28) 
     
      
       
        
        “Those matters do not aggravate the offences, and nor does his record disentitle him to leniency, having regard to the years which have passed since he last came to the notice of the authorities.” 
        
       
      
    49 The evidence tendered on SGJ’s behalf on sentence was a medical report (15.4.07) prepared by Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist. SGJ had a history of psychiatric illness, associated with drug taking. He had spent time in various psychiatric hospitals, the last occasion being approximately ten years before. The probable diagnosis was drug induced psychosis. He had made three attempts at suicide, the last being one week before his arrest, when he took an overdose. He experienced panic attacks and depression. After taking methamphetamine (“ice”), he also experienced voices, although they never directed him to do things. 
     
      
    50 Dr Allnutt asked SGJ about his offending behaviour. He acknowledged a recollection of one or two occasions. He remembered that one involved his niece. He added that, when the police told him what he had done, he “thought ‘no way’”. Dr Allnutt expressed the view that SGJ’s drug taking of methamphetamine would not have affected his memory to the extent revealed by these answers. Dr Allnutt reached the following conclusion on this aspect: (p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “Your client engages in minimisation of his offending. Your client has minimised the memory of the extent of the offences. It is not uncommon for offenders to engage in minimisation, at this stage of the proceedings. Often this is an attempt to protect either themselves, a relationship, or a third party. It should be noted that minimisation and denial of sexual offending has not been found to be strongly associated with future risk of recidivism, but might relate more to capacity to engage in treatment.” 
        
       
      
    51 In terms of diagnosis, Dr Allnutt stated that SGJ met the criteria for the paraphilia, paedophilia and sexually deviant behaviour. He had displayed a Conduct Disorder from childhood. He met the criteria for an Antisocial Personality Disorder of a mild nature. 
     
      
    52 SGJ expressed himself to be remorseful. He said he was disgusted by his behaviour. He added he: “should have his balls cut off”, and that there were no excuses for what he had done. His Honour, however, was not persuaded. She said this: (ROS 29/30) 
     
      
       
        
        “(SGJ) wishes to blame his ingestion of illicit substances. He referred to one victim, a niece aged nine. He was not sure when he began offending and he estimated that it happened on one or two occasions only. He acknowledged taking ‘a couple of photographs’. When pressed by Dr Allnutt, he could recall offending on two days.” 
        
       
      
    53 Her Honour added (dealing in similar terms with KU, whose subjective case I will describe in a moment): (ROS 30) 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither offender chooses to explain truthfully why they chose to offend as they did, and nor do they appear to me to have any real insight into the impact their offending behaviour has had and will continue to have upon these extremely young innocent victims. Certainly (SGJ) continues to minimise the extent of his criminality. Any expressions of remorse or contrition are nothing more than as a result of the position in which they find themselves now facing lengthy custodial sentences. (SGJ’s) actions in attempting to remove images from his computer hard drive demonstrates an acknowledgement on his part that what he was doing was very very wrong.” 
        
       
      
    54 Returning to Dr Allnutt, he dealt with the question of the risk of SGJ reoffending upon release. He said this: (p 8/9) 
     
      
       
        
        “Your client has a tendency to utilise substance abuse, when exposed to significant stressors. There is in general an increased risk of sexual and general recidivism in individuals who abuse substances. Your client requires assistance in developing more appropriate stress management responses.” 
        
       
      
    55 SGJ told Dr Allnutt that he was keen to engage in sexual offender rehabilitation. Dr Allnutt then made reference to an actuarial tool developed in Canada and the United Kingdom, called Static 99, which can be used to make a prediction as to the risk of sexual recidivism. The prediction must be approached with caution. Within the psychiatric profession there is some controversy concerning its accuracy, although it is generally thought useful. SGJ, on this test, fell within the moderate to high risk group. However, Dr Allnutt added the following comment: (p 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no evidence of prior sexual offending preceding October 2004. The offending seemed to have occurred in the context of significant life stressors, depression and an increase and change in substance of abuse, namely methamphetamines. These are dynamic factors that could change. Thus, while he might fall into a moderate to high risk group for sexual recidivism in the future, in my view, in the absence of substance abuse, treatment of his mood disorder and engagement in sex offender rehabilitation, this risk could be significantly reduced.” 
        
       
      
    56 Her Honour, somewhat charitably to SGJ, made the following comment referable to both him and his de facto wife, KU: (ROS 30) 
     
      
       
        
        “Hopefully they do have good prospects for rehabilitation, and will be unlikely to re-offend if they … undergo appropriate drug rehabilitation and sex offending counselling. Only time will tell, although I note the concern that Doctor Allnutt places (SGJ) in the category where the risk of re-offending is high, unless he addresses his illicit drug problem.” 
        
       
       
      The subjective case of KU. 
       
      
    57 KU did not give evidence. She, like her husband, was examined by Dr Allnutt, who provided a report dated 14 February 2007. She told Dr Allnutt she had not been abused as a child (p 5). She added that there were no “interpersonal violence or significant interpersonal issues” between herself and SGJ. She confirmed that she and her husband used cannabis almost daily throughout their married life. They began using ice after their son was diagnosed with MS on 4 November 2003 (report Dr Iain Stewart). When asked about her offending behaviour, KU said that she was reluctant to discuss it. She found it too distressing. She expressed strong feelings of remorse. She said she had done wrong and deserved to be in prison. 
     
      
    58 Dr Allnutt recorded the following explanation for her behaviour: (p 3/4) 
     
      
       
        
        “When I enquired as to what she thought had contributed to her offending, she stated that she thought the drugs had affected her and led her to experimentation. She again said, ‘I accept it was wrong and I take responsibility’. She voiced motivation to attend a treatment program. 
        
       
       
        
        She believed she had been influenced by her husband to offend. She also again explained that the offending had occurred on weekends, when they were using ice. She said that her husband wanted to try something different. She thought she would ‘see what it was like’. At the time she did not believe that it would harm the children.” 
        
       
      
    59 Dr Allnutt expressed the following view concerning KU’s responses: (p 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “Your client does not engage in extreme minimisation or denial of sexual violence. Although she is reluctant to speak about it, she accepts the Facts. Her reluctance to discuss her experience of the offending, in my view, is a consequence of her distress and shame with regard to her behaviour, rather than an attempt to minimise or deny her offending.” 
        
       
      
    60 Dr Allnutt’s diagnosis was as follows: (p 5) 
     
      
       
        
        “Your client has been involved in behaviour of a paedophilic nature, over a period of a year. … However, having said this, it is my view that underage children [are] not her preference and do not manifest as a primary sexual interest for her. Rather, this behaviour appears to have manifested in the context of a heterosexual, adult relationship with her husband and in the context of substance abuse, influenced by her husband and ‘experimentation’.” 
        
       
      
    61 KU had no history of mental illness. She was, in Dr Allnutt’s view, suitable to participate in a sex offenders treatment programme and was anxious to do so. Unfortunately, as will emerge below, there is no such programme for female offenders. On the Static 99 actuarial test, assessing the likelihood of future offending, KU scored zero, signifying that she was within the low risk category. Dr Allnutt’s conclusion was expressed in these terms: (p 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to both a clinical and actuarial assessment, it is my opinion that your client falls into a low risk group of sex offenders for future sexual recidivism.” 
        
       
      
    62 As stated in the context of her co-offender, her Honour was not persuaded on the question of remorse. She made the following comment in respect of KU: (ROS 29) 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither offender gave evidence on sentence as I have said, and in those circumstances it is always difficult to assess just how remorseful and contrite they truly are, despite the opinions contained and the reports tendered. 
        
       
       
        
        (KU) wants to lay the blame either upon her drug addiction or upon her partner’s influence over her. She told Doctor Allnutt ‘her husband had wanted to try something different’. That could perhaps be understood if it was on one occasion only, but she was an active participant in multiple acts of sexual assault upon very young children. Quite extraordinarily, she stated at the time she committed these offences upon them that she did not believe it would harm the children.” 
        
       
      
    63 As with SGJ, her Honour believed that expressions of remorse by KU were no more than “a result of the position in which they find themselves now facing lengthy custodial sentences” (ROS 30). 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence. 
       
      
    64 Having set out much of this material, her Honour said this: (ROS 24) 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences carry very considerable criminality. The actions of both co-offenders are outrageous and disgusting. They involve gross breaches of trust of very young children left in their care, be they nieces or children left to be cared for whilst their parents were otherwise engaged. Their conduct is nothing short of evil. The photographs which unfortunately have to be viewed by the legal representatives and this court can only be described as stomach churning. It is almost incomprehensible that a mother of a child of approximately the same age as some of these victims would engage in such behaviour. In one such instance, the offences included an act of violence, albeit of a minor nature and in others coercion was used. They were offences committed in company. Certainly the emotional harm suffered by the two victims who provide victim impact statements is substantial. These children were extremely vulnerable in every sense of the word.” 
        
       
      
    65 Her Honour, in this passage, was dealing with matters which were aggravating features of these crimes (s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Care was necessary when determining whether the vulnerability of the victim was an aggravating feature (s 21A(2)(l)), where the crime included, as an element, the age of the child. In the context of the s 91G(l) offences (use of a child for pornographic purposes), the age limit of the child under the section is 14 years. Here all victims who had been photographed were very young indeed (from approximately 3 years to 8 years) (apart from Form 1, Count 16, where the child was between 8 and 10 years). In that context the age of the child can be regarded as aggravating the offence. In respect of the s 66A offences (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years), the ages of the victims varied. The youngest victim (Victim D) was 5½ years which, of course, is very young and is an aggravating feature. Victim A in Count 1, first indictment, was 7 years 9 months. In the context of the abuse (fellatio where the child had protested), there is, I believe, a real difference between a child that age and a child almost 10, such that it is capable of being characterised as an aggravating feature.  
     
      
    66 Her Honour also referred to an aggravating feature under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(n), namely, there was planning. The children were woken from their sleep. They were taken to the offenders’ bedroom. The camera was on hand. The heads of the victims in some cases were covered, or excluded from the photographs. The photographs were downloaded onto the computer. The offences took place late at night, when detection was less likely. 
     
      
    67 Her Honour then dealt with matters in mitigation. Each offender had pleaded guilty to both indictments. She generously allowed each a 20 percent discount in respect of the 1st indictment. The allowance in respect of the second was 25 percent, which was appropriate, the pleas having been entered soon after the charges were laid. SGJ had a minor criminal record, which her Honour regarded as irrelevant for the purposes of sentencing. KU was a person of prior good character. Her Honour found, generously to SGJ, that he, as well as KU, had good prospects of rehabilitation once they had completed sexual offenders rehabilitation. 
     
      
    68 Her Honour noted that some offences were subject to a standard non parole period. In that context, she said this: (ROS 27) 
     
      
       
        
        “Penile vaginal penetration of a child has been held to be significantly more serious than other forms of penetration encompassed within s 66(A) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . That having been said, it is to be borne in mind that it is the facts and circumstances of each case which need to be valued … when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. It is also to be kept firmly in mind that whilst penile vaginal penetration might be taken to be more serious than enforced fellatio for example, that does not mean that fellatio necessarily falls somewhere below the mid point of objective seriousness. The same must be said about the act of cunnilingus. Similarly there are grades of seriousness of aggravated indecent assault, involving the touching on the outside of the clothing as opposed to the touching of the skin, or more particularly the genitalia.” 
        
       
      
    69 The standard non parole period, of course, represented an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (s 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). In that context, her Honour said this: (ROS 31) 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no need for me to further amplify the objective seriousness of these offences, they are offences which fall at the upper end of the scale for objective seriousness for the reasons to which I have already referred. Counsel for the Crown and both offenders has submitted that these offences fall well beyond the mid range of objective seriousness and I would not disagree.” 
        
       
      
    70 Her Honour did not elaborate by reference to the individual offences. However, sentences of differing lengths were then imposed with different commencing dates, as set out above. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    71 The Notice of Appeal filed on behalf of SGJ identified the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge erred by failing to set non-parole periods in respect of counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the Indictment dated 19 September 2006 and counts 1, 6, 7 and 9 on the Indictment dated 2 March 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentencing judge erred in her application of the totality principle; 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was not contrite; 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentencing judge erred in her application of  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          
        1999 s 21A(2)(l); 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentence imposed in respect of count 4 on the Indictment dated 2 March 2007 was manifestly excessive; and 
        
       
       
        
        6. The total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    72 The notice in respect of KU relied upon the same grounds (with different numbering), together with the following additional grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. The sentencing judge erred in her application of a parity principle; 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentencing judge took irrelevant material into account on sentence.” 
        
       
      
    73 Ground 5 of KU’s notice was a reference to a slip made by her Honour, when dealing with Count 6 on the first indictment. Count 6 concerned Victim B and was exclusive to SGJ. Her Honour inadvertently (when describing the effect upon Victim B) referred to KU. However, it is plain from her Honour’s analysis, and the rest of her remarks, that she well understood that KU had not been charged with Count 6. There is no substance in Ground 5. The grounds relied upon by the applicants are therefore the same, apart from the additional ground raising parity in the notice filed on behalf of KU. 
     
      
    74 I therefore turn to the arguments in respect of the Grounds of Appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Failure to set non parole periods in standard non parole period offences. 
       
      
    75 Her Honour was faced with a complex sentencing task, where the following offences specified standard non parole periods: 
     
      
    · s 66A (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years) 7 counts (1st Indictment, Counts 1, 2 and 3; 2nd Indictment, Counts 4, 6, 7 and 9) (maximum penalty: 25 years imprisonment; standard non parole period 15 years). 
     
      
    · s 61M(1) (aggravated indecent assault of a child (SGJ only)) 1 count (1st Indictment, Count 6) (maximum penalty: 7 years imprisonment; standard non parole period 5 years). 
     
      
    · s 61M(2) (aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years) 1 count (2nd Indictment, Count 1) (maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment; standard non parole period 5 years). 
     
      
    76 Fixed terms with various commencement dates were imposed in all but Count 4, second Indictment. Indeed, counsel then appearing for the applicant SGJ invited her Honour to take that course. However, it was said on behalf of the applicants on this appeal, that her Honour was obliged, by the terms of s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, to set a non parole period. In respect of offences which specify a standard non parole period, the Act takes away the discretion to decline to set a non parole period. Section 45(1) of the Act is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “45(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence (other than an offence set out in the Table to Division 1A of this Part), a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the office if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence relates or the antecedent character of the offender, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) for any other reason that the court considers sufficient.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    77 The Crown acknowledged error, characterising that error as “highly technical”. The error, according to the Crown, had not disadvantaged the applicants. The applicants argued, although not persuasively, that they had, in various ways, been disadvantaged by her Honour’s approach. 
     
      
    78 Nonetheless, there was error. Non parole periods should have been fixed in respect of those offences which were subject to a standard non parole period. There was no discretion. There is therefore a need to re-sentence the offenders. The real issue, on this appeal, is whether under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, some lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. That in essence raises the same issues as Grounds 5 and 6 in the SGJ appeal (and the companion grounds in KU’s appeal), that is, whether the sentences imposed, in total, and especially in respect of Count 4 (second indictment), were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    79 Let me therefore turn to that issue. I will later deal with the parity argument raised on behalf of KU, which is a separate issue. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 5 and 6: Were the sentences (including Count 4) manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    80 It may be helpful to restate briefly the circumstances giving rise to Count 4. The victim (Victim C) was a school friend and contemporary of the offenders’ daughter. She was 7 years old, although only a few weeks away from her eighth birthday. She had been invited to sleep over at her friend’s house. She was photographed over about eight hours (Count 3, second indictment). One photograph (taken by KU) showed vaginal penetration by SGJ (Count 4). The Form 1 offences were to be taken into account when sentencing for Count 4. As described, some of these offences concerned the same victim (Victim C) and were therefore appropriate to include on the Form 1. Using the numbering relating to KU, Form 1, Count 8 charged aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years, based upon a photograph taken by SGJ showing KU spreading the lips of Victim C’s vagina. Form 1, Count 9 was a charge under s 66A (sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years) and was based upon a photograph (taken by KU) of SGJ digitally penetrating Victim C. Form 1, Count 10 was again a charge of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years, based upon a photograph taken by SGJ of KU performing cunnilingus on Victim C. 
     
      
    81 The sentence in respect of Count 4 was 18 years with a non parole period of 11 years. Her Honour noted that penile vaginal penetration had been held to be a more serious form of sexual intercourse (ROS 27). The offences were “at the upper end of the scale for objective seriousness” (ROS 31) and they “ranked high on the scale of criminality”. 
     
      
    82 The applicants had, in each case, entered early pleas. As mentioned, her Honour acknowledged that each was entitled to a 25 percent discount in respect of the charges on the second indictment. It follows that her Honour’s starting point was 24 years, compared to a maximum under the section of 25 years. Her starting point for the non parole period was slightly less than the standard non parole period of 15 years. 
     
      
    83 The submission that the sentence on Count 4 was excessive was based upon statistics from the Judicial Commission and a comparison with other cases, where the offending behaviour was comparable or worse, and yet the sentences lower. 
     
      
    84 The statistics in relation to s 66A related to forty offenders for the period after 1 February 2003, being the commencement date of the amendments introducing standard non parole periods. They demonstrated that the sentences imposed on Count 4 were equal to the highest given for this offence. The non parole periods were within the top 12.5 percent. The Crown submitted, however, that the sample was very small. It, no doubt, included offenders who were themselves teenagers, where the criminality was utterly different. 
     
      
    85 The applicants also drew attention to a number of cases, including XY v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 72; Rolfe v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168; and Clare v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 30. Each, in my view, was materially different from the present case and of limited assistance. XY v The Queen involved the digital penetration of a two year old female. The penetration occurred in the course of disciplining the child when the offender, a very young man, was intoxicated. The sentencing Judge accepted that the motive was not sexual gratification. That finding was not challenged. A fixed term of 4 years was imposed, concurrent with other terms in respect of additional counts. 
     
      
    86 Rolfe v The Queen concerned charges which included two counts under s 66A of the Crimes Act. The offender was the stepfather of the complainant, who was abused between the ages of 5½ and 8 years. The total sentence after trial was 8 years. There was no Crown appeal. The appeal was against conviction, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The offender, understandably, did not press the appeal against sentence. Giles JA remarked, when dismissing the appeal against sentence, that the total sentence was “well open to the Judge” (at 207).  
     
      
    87 The case which was pressed as best illustrating the injustice to the applicants was Clare v The Queen. Two children, brother and sister, were left in the care of William Clare. The boy was aged 3 years and the girl 6 years. Clare sexually assaulted both children on successive days. In the case of the boy, he caused injuries which proved fatal. An autopsy revealed anal tears and rectal bruising. Clare was charged with two counts, sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (s 66A) and with murder (s 18). He pleaded guilty in the District Court to sexual assault of the female child and was sentenced. He had previous convictions for offences of a similar nature for which he had served a term of imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the District Court Judge was 16 years with a non parole period of 12 years and 1 month. Clare was to be eligible for parole on 17 October 2015. 
     
      
    88 Clare then stood trial in the Supreme Court in respect of the offences relating to the male child. He pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with that child (then aged 3 years). He pleaded not guilty to murder. After trial, he was convicted of manslaughter. The sentencing Judge in the Supreme Court was acutely aware that Clare had already been sentenced under s 66A in respect of the victim’s sister. The principle of totality had to be applied. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 14 years imprisonment (reduced from 16 years to reflect the plea of guilty) in respect of the s 66A count (cf s 45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). The sentence was cumulative upon that imposed in the District Court (to commence on 17 October 2015). In respect of manslaughter, the sentence imposed was the maximum under the section (25 years), the crime having been characterised as “within the worst class of case”. The sentence commenced on 17 October 2015, with a non parole period of 18 years and 9 months. The manslaughter sentence and the sentence on the s 66A count were therefore concurrent. On appeal, the non parole period was adjusted because the sentences imposed in the Supreme Court were cumulative upon the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    89 Here, it is said on behalf of SGJ and KU that the criminality of Clare was significantly greater than SGJ or KU. The victims were younger, there were injuries, the offender was a convicted paedophile, and his pleas of guilty were entered much later. Yet the head sentence was less in respect of both victims. According to counsel for the applicants, one must assume that the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, “were applied in respect of each sentence and that the sentences were all, in the circumstances, within range”. 
     
      
    90 However, in Clare’s case the sentences were not fixed by this Court. The original sentence in respect of the 6 year old girl was fixed by a District Court Judge in the exercise of his discretion. There was no Crown appeal. In the unusual circumstances of the offences having been divided between the District Court and the Supreme Court, the sentence in the District Court on the s 66A offence was clearly relevant to the sentence to be imposed in the Supreme Court in respect of the second offence under the same section. The sentences do not, however, determine the appropriate sentence on a charge under s 66A. 
     
      
    91 Section 66A is an offence which is subject to a standard non parole period of 15 years for an offence determined to be in the mid range of objective seriousness. The maximum penalty is 25 years. Accordingly, if an offence is determined to be in the mid range, and the usual ratio between head sentence and non parole period is applied, the sentence can be expected to be 20 years with a non parole period of 15 years. Adams J, in the context of these amendments (whilst questioning their logic), said this in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575: (at 590) 
     
      
       
        
        “[52] This suggests that, so far as objective circumstances are concerned, the difference between a middle range case and a case in the worst category is not very great, a view which the severity of the standard non parole period rather suggests.” 
        
       
      
    92 Against that background, statistics and other cases are of less importance than the characterisation of the offending behaviour in relation to a mid range offence. Here, her Honour determined, appropriately, that the offending behaviour in Count 4, second indictment (ignoring for the moment the Form 1), was worse than mid range. Indeed, she made that determination at the invitation of the parties, who were in agreement. The offence may not have been in the worst category, but it was most serious. When sentencing, her Honour was also obliged to take into account the Form 1. The principles to be applied (as she acknowledged) were restated in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) (supra). The Chief Justice said this: (at 159) 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.” 
        
       
      
    93 Spigelman CJ also made the following comment: (at 155) 
     
      
       
        
        “[18] A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. (See, eg,  
        R v White  
         (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 13;  
        Murrell v The Queen 
         (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 179, per Blackburn J;  
        R v Vougdis 
         (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 128-129;  
        R v Morgan 
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372.) 
        
       
      
    94 The offences on the Form 1 concerning Victim C (quite apart from the other counts) were serious. Having regard to the criminality in Count 4, and taking account of the Form 1 offences, the starting point of 24 years was not outside the range. For my part, I believe no lesser sentence was warranted on Count 4.  
     
      
    95 Was the aggregate sentence on all counts manifestly excessive? It will be remembered that the total sentence imposed upon each offender was 22 years with a non parole period of 15 years. It can be seen at once that, since the sentence imposed upon Count 4 was 18 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 11 years, the total sentence involved the accumulation of a further 4 years imprisonment in respect of the head sentence as well as the non parole period. The remaining counts (14 counts in the case of SGJ and 13 in the case of KU) were themselves serious. There were a further six counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (s 66A of the Crimes Act), apart from Count 4. The maximum penalty under that section, as stated, is 25 years with a standard non parole period of 15 years. In many cases, the offences occurred on separate days and involved different victims. A number of these offences involved an unwilling child being forced to fellate SGJ, whilst KU looked on and photographed what was occurring. Such offences were at least in the mid range. There were other offences besides, involving lesser penalties but nonetheless serious. In short, there was significant criminality involved in each indictment. It was entirely appropriate that there be partial accumulation in respect of many of these offences. The accumulation, adding 4 years to the total term and to the non parole period was certainly more than justified. 
     
      
    96 I, therefore, do not believe that a lesser sentence, in aggregate, was warranted and should have been passed in respect of SGJ. SGJ’s appeal against sentence should be dismissed.  
     
      
    97 However, before reaching a conclusion in respect of KU, it is necessary to consider the separate issue of parity raised in her notice of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 (KU): Parity. 
       
      
    98 Her Honour’s remarks on sentence included the following: (ROS 36) 
     
      
       
        
        “On the issue of parity, except for count 6 on the indictment [of] the 18th October 2006 in respect of [SGJ], I find their respective degrees of culpability to be equal.” 
        
       
      
    99 That finding, according to counsel for KU, gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of KU, for the reasons identified by Brennan J in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, where the following was said: (at 617) 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable is unjust. A justified sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case.” 
        
       
      
    100 Here there were, according to counsel for KU, real differences between KU’s position and that of SGJ. Yet the same sentences were imposed. First, SGJ faced six counts on the first indictment, whereas KU faced five. Although her Honour acknowledged that difference, the additional charge could not, it was submitted, be so lightly dismissed. It involved an additional victim (Victim B) and a separate and additional aspect of the abuse on the evening of 7 October 2005. Further, the Form 1 in respect of SGJ included two additional offences, both carrying a maximum penalty under the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 of 10 years imprisonment (ss 23(1)(a) and (1)(c) and s 32(1)). One offence involved the cultivation of marijuana.  
     
      
    101 Secondly, KU was a person of good character, as her Honour acknowledged. SGJ, on the other hand, had a criminal record, although the offences were relatively minor, and were some time ago. Nonetheless, according to KU’s counsel, his record was “indicative of a continuing pattern of anti-social behaviour under the influence of drugs and alcohol”. 
     
      
    102 Thirdly, there were differences in respect of their prospects of rehabilitation. SGJ, but not KU, had been diagnosed as having an antisocial personality disorder of a mild nature. He had minimised his offences. His prospects of reoffending, according to the actuarial test, Static 99, suggested he was in the “moderate to high risk group”. KU, according to the same test, scored zero. She was within a low risk group in terms of reoffending. She had not sought to minimise her offences. 
     
      
    103 The Crown, in response, emphasised that the sentences were imposed by the same Judge at the same time. Caution should be exercised before determining there was unfairness as between offenders. Her Honour was conscious of the additional count faced by SGJ and the Form 1 offences. It was open to her to make the sentence on Count 6 of the first indictment concurrent, as she did. Although the drug offences were included only in the Form 1 of SGJ, they concerned the drug cannabis. The undisputed evidence was that both offenders used cannabis daily. 
     
      
    104 The second issue, character, had limited relevance in the context of the offences charged, as her Honour recognised. SGJ’s offences were minor and were well in the past. Her Honour said this: (ROS 29) 
     
      
       
        
        “(KU) has no prior criminal antecedents. The fact that she is a person of otherwise good character is of little assistance to her. All too often those who have no prior criminal antecedents are convicted of such offences. The fact that they are of otherwise good character enables them to commit these types of offences and hide behind the façade knowing that if their victims were to complain, it is unlikely that they will be believed because the person is known to be a person of good character and therefore unlikely to offend in such a heinous way. The same can be said about the offender (SGJ), who has not re-offended for many many years.” 
        
       
      
    105 On the third issue, rehabilitation, her Honour was entitled, according to the Crown, to take a cautious approach. KU had used drugs. She was an active participant in multiple offences involving very young children. She had made the “quite extraordinary” statement to Dr Allnutt, that she did not believe at the time that her conduct would harm the children. 
     
      
    106 Before dealing with these arguments, I should refer to one other matter. It was lightly touched upon in argument, although relevant to the issue of parity. Dr Allnutt recorded, in his report concerning KU, her statement that “she believed she had been influenced by her husband to offend”. SGJ “wanted to try something different”. Her Honour commented upon that aspect in these terms: (ROS 20/21) 
     
      
       
        
        “In the opinion of Doctor Allnutt, there is insufficient evidence to suggest overt physical coercion on the part of the co-offender although the circumstances would suggest that there was perhaps psychological coercion. … Doctor Allnutt is of the opinion that under aged children are not (her) sexual preference but rather the behaviour manifested itself in the context of a heterosexual relationship combined with substance abuse. The introduction of methamphetamine may have resulted in her being dis-inhibited and led to the offending behaviour. She is regarded as being suitable to engage in a sex offenders program, she is regarded as being at low risk of re-offending.” 
        
       
      
    107 When the appeal was heard, material was tendered on behalf of KU upon the basis that it may be taken into account in the event that this Court finds error and there is a need to resentence. Here, in my view, there has been error and there is a need to resentence, if only to restructure the sentences imposed in order to conform with s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The material is relevant to KU’s assertion that she was under the influence of her husband, SGJ. On 2 October 2008, KU saw Ms Anita McGregor, a psychologist. Her interview lasted five hours. The history she provided departed from the account she had given Dr Allnutt before sentence. She told Dr Allnutt that she had neither been abused as a child, nor as a wife. However, to Ms McGregor, she described in detail sexual abuse by her brother before the separation of her parents when she was 13 years old. After the separation, she went to live with her father. He then began sexually abusing her. That abuse continued until she left home at the age of 18 or 19 years. She met SGJ soon after. Within a short time they began living together. 
     
      
    108 KU also described to the psychologist her life with SGJ. He permitted her few friends, he was extremely jealous and he physically abused her repeatedly. Twice her ribs were broken. On other occasions her eyes were blackened, and bruises inflicted. He forced sexual behaviour upon her when she was not consenting, and verbally abused her. The level of violence escalated as his drug taking increased. She thought about leaving him several times. She did not so because she did not believe that financially or emotionally she could have coped alone. 
     
      
    109 Ms McGregor administered various tests designed to evaluate KU’s personality. She concluded that KU sees the world as a frightening and dangerous place. She added the following: (report 2.10.08, p 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “The main coping mechanism displayed by individuals with this profile appear(s) to be self sacrificing, their poor self image and focus on past painful experiences tend to reflect their often finding themselves in difficult and humiliating situations.” 
        
       
      
    110 Statistically, female sex offences account for less than 7 percent of all sex crimes in Australia. The recidivism rate is less than 1 percent. Ms McGregor described various types of offending by female sex offenders. Her conclusion in respect of KU was as follows: (p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “(KU’s) index offences can be identified within the second category of female coerced/accompanied. Her cycle of offending was based on (SGJ’s) request for her to engage in this behaviour. It is unknown, but unlikely, that (KU) would have engaged in this behaviour on her own.” 
        
       
      
    111 Ms McGregor’s conclusion was as follows: (p 9) 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsequent to a life, beginning in childhood, of abuse by her brother and father, and later by her de facto partner, (SGJ), (KU) displays many of the characteristics of an abused woman. Her standardized testing shows a woman who lacks self esteem and tends to engage in self defeating and humiliating situations in her life. She is an abused woman who herself became an abuser. Was her tendency towards submissive, passive and self defeating behaviours a predisposing set of factors or the result of the abuse and emotional neglect? As she stated many times during the interview, she felt that she deserved much of the abuse she encountered throughout her life. She sees herself as an evil person who engaged in heinous and unforgivable acts. She does not believe herself worthy of anything positive in her life.” 
        
       
      
    112 An affidavit was also filed by KU, in which she affirmed the truth of the history she had provided to the psychologist. She added: (aff: 10.10.08) 
     
      
       
        
        “2. It has been very stressful and very liberating getting these things off my chest. I am referring to the abuse within my family when I was growing up and to the fact that my partner (SGJ) was violent to me for years. I have never spoken to anyone about these things before. … “ 
        
       
      
    113 KU added:  
     
      
       
        
        “4. I believe I will never again commit offences against children because: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) I no longer think like I did before. I now see that what I did was evil and I recognise how bad it is to do things like this. I would not want any other children to suffer. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) I do not want my family and in particular my children to suffer like they have had to do. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Gaol is a terrible place. I never want to come back here. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) I realise the use of drugs and alcohol had a role in committing these offences. I will stay drug and alcohol free after I am released from gaol. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) When I am released I will be on parole and on the sex offenders’ register. I will co-operate with the authorities and do whatever they think I need to do. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) If the authorities say I should not live or have contact with (SGJ) then I will not. If they say nothing about it then I will need to think about what is best for me and the children as I approach the time of release. I really need help sorting through many of the issues I have started talking about.” 
        
       
      
    114 Unfortunately there is no sex offenders’ programme in gaol for females, no doubt because their numbers are so small. There are, nonetheless, courses which cover many of the same issues, some of which KU has already undertaken. Because of the nature of her crimes, involving children, she has been threatened since entering gaol. She is obliged to serve her sentence in protection. Indeed, in the early stages of her incarceration, she spent 23 hours out of 24 in her cell. She is anxious to work. However, the opportunities for work and for further education when on protection are limited. 
     
      
    115 On this material, including that gathered since sentence, I believe that there are real differences between SGJ and KU which, if not reflected in a lesser sentence, give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. That said, KU’s criminality was significant. She was not simply a passive by-stander. She was actively involved in many offences. It was KU who placed the advertisement in the newspaper seeking work as a baby sitter. People entrusted their children to her, although a stranger, because she was a woman and a mother, in circumstances where it may be inferred they would not have done so to a man. KU’s sentence, I believe, should be 2 years less for the non parol period (15 years reduced to 13) and the overall term (22 years reduced to 20 years). 
     
      
       
      Resentence. 
       
      
    116 Giving effect to these reasons, in summary, the position in respect of the two offenders is as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) The aggregate sentence of 22 years, consisting of a non parole period of 15 years, and an additional term of 7 years, should be confirmed in the case of SGJ. 
       
       
      (ii) Sentences in respect of both SGJ and KU which were fixed terms, in respect of offences where there was a standard non parole period, must be quashed and the applicants resentenced (cf s 7(1A)  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912). 
       
       
      (iii) In respect of SGJ, the sentence in respect of Count 4 (in aggregate 18 years) will stand and there will be accumulation in respect of the remaining counts. This Court, nonetheless, is constrained. There was no Crown appeal. The overall sentence cannot exceed the aggregate sentence of 22 years with a non parole period of 15 years imposed by her Honour. This Court is therefore not dealing with the matter as though it were sentencing at first instance, in terms of accumulation and concurrence. There will be accumulation in respect of SGJ, not exceeding the upper limits set at first instance. 
       
       
      (iv) In respect of KU, the approach will be similar, reflecting as well the finding of lesser criminality in the case of KU, justifying a lesser accumulation. The aggregate sentence will include a non parole period of 13 years with an additional term of 7 years. 
       
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    117 In respect of the appeal by SGJ, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal in respect of Count 4 of the 2nd indictment dismissed and the sentence confirmed. 
       
       
      3. The appeal allowed in respect of the remaining counts on the 1st and 2nd indictments and the sentences quashed. 
       
       
      4. In lieu thereof, SGJ is sentenced as follows:

   JUDGMENT1. On 12 October 2007 this appellant was at home consuming alcohol. I suspect his wife was too. It seems that their alcohol preference was port because it was cheap. About 9 o’clock he started yelling at his partner. She could not understand why. She tried to reason with him, although in what condition she was is kept silent here. He refused to listen. He grabbed her by the throat, lifted her off the ground, pushed her from the lounge room into the hallway, yelling “I’m going to kick you in the head”; pushed her to the ground, placed his foot on the right side of her head pinning her to the ground. Experiencing pain in her ears she screamed “You’re hurting me”. She was held there for about two minutes before removing his foot.2. She said to him “Do you want me dead or something?” He said “I want you dead”. He walked into the kitchen and returned with something in his hand, which she believed to be a knife. Fearing for her safety she ran from her own home. 3. Some minutes later she re-entered by climbing through the lounge room window because she thought the appellant had fallen asleep. She went to their bedroom, collecting a blanket and a pillow. He was asleep. She was exiting the room and the door become jammed against the bed. That woke the appellant and he said, “You’ve got three seconds to get out of the room”. Scared, she became stuck between door and doorframe. 4. There is other evidence describing this house as virtually uninhabitable. It is hard to know why that door became stuck. In any event the appellant came out of bed, began pushing the door against her stomach, preventing her from leaving the room. After a short struggle she managed to get most of her body through the door except for the right leg. He continued pushing the door against her leg, causing her pain there and bruising.5. The appellant’s partner eventually got her leg through and, upon doing so fell, striking her head. She thought she was out for about 10 minutes and woke to the sound of her children crying. She went to the children’s room and comforted them. There she remained until morning.6. The next morning the appellant woke, approached her and continued the argument “You’ll never see your kids again.” He said. She left her home again and contacted police and remained outside until police arrived. He was arrested without resistance. Ultimately he came before the Court.7. For the first assault he received 100 hours community service comprised of 80 hours of community work and 20 hours of programs. It is clear, listening to the appellant today, that he was desperately in need of programs to assist him. A lot of people take a view that Probation and Parole are just there to hassle people. My view is that they are a resource for people who need assistance.8. On the second assault he received 50 hours of community service, all of it to be served by way of community working. Those sentences were imposed on 12 December 2007. 9. On 8 January 2008 the appellant attended the Maitland district office of Probation and Parole as ordered by the Local Court. He participated in the community service order induction program where his obligations were explained to him. Among those obligations he would have been told that if he did not commit to complete the hours, he would be placed before the Court again and was liable to go to gaol. He was to be placed on an integrated community project when it commenced on 20 February. 10. On 22 February he attended the Maitland district office of Probation and Parole to sign his work instruction with that integrated community project. He was told to be at the pick up point at 8am on 27th and 28th and every subsequent Wednesday and Thursday. The first couple he did all right but on 14 and 22 April he failed to perform the community service and it was said he was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for his absence. I think he has done that in Court today, he has explained that he could not get up. The reason he could not get up was probably because he was hung over from the night before.11. On 13 June a failure to comply letter was sent to him, no doubt telling him or reminding him of what he had been told, that he was liable to have the order breached and then gaol was possibly an option. That letter on 13 June was in respect of absences of 26 May and 2 June. On 9 July a second failure letter to comply was sent because he had failed to go on 16th, 23rd and 30 July and 7 July. Even so, those running the community service program sought to discuss his problem on 17 July at 2pm but he failed to report for that discussion. On 23 July yet another letter was sent informing him he had been withdrawn from the assigned agency and the matter was to be returned to court.12. He failed to attend for work on six occasions it was said, on my count it is more than that, and when he was there his performance was considered poor. He had also failed to complete the program component of the order, had only attended the first three sessions of I think it was 20. The Court did what he always knew it was likely to do; in respect of the first offence it put him in custody for six months and in respect of the second, put him into custody for three months.13. A funny thing was that he had done a community service order once before in 2002 and those who were supervising him then thought his response was deemed to be excellent. It says to me that he has got it in him. In 2005 he was given a 12-month bond for an offence similar to the one that is the foundation for these community service orders.14. In the course of his evidence today I indicated that it seemed to me he had two choices. The first was to demonstrate that he could co-operate with Probation and Parole, get out and do something about getting his life together. The second was, he could accept his time in gaol. He has given evidence that he was terrified in gaol; big hulking man, strong enough around the house to belt the living daylights out of people but did not feel so tough in gaol. He was scared to come out of his cell for most of his time, I can understand that. Nobody would like to be in gaol.15. Orders of the Court can be enforced and sometimes, to be enforced, we have to look not to the offender to have the orders enforced, but rather to custodial officers to have our orders enforced because offenders will not do what they are asked. That is what has happened on this occasions. The men in uniform will do what we ask when offenders will not.16. I am going to adjourn the finalisation of this matter for 12 months and during that adjournment I am going to allow you, pursuant to what is called section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to have bail. Now that particular section of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has, as its focus, to give to an offender an opportunity to demonstrate to the Court, that is me, that he can rehabilitate which in simple language means get back on his feet; lead a useful, valuable life to the community. 17. You can do that, firstly, by being a good husband or partner; secondly by being a good father. Look around the community, people have been raised in families that constitutes a community. People who are parents, even if they are not employed, there are good parents making a wonderful contribution to the community. If you can get employment - things may get tough they tell me in the next 12 months but if you can get employment, so much the better. If you cannot, you can start giving something to the community. There may be a sport that you are good at, you can go and be the gear steward for all I mind. If you get a home, you can keep the outside of it neat and tidy so that it looks tremendous. Become a gardener. You do not just have to sit on your backside saying “I’m unemployed, this is terrible, give me another port”. That is allowing life to drift away.18. The conditions of the bail will be, firstly, that you will be of good behaviour. Secondly, that you will reside at 21A Wentworth Street, Telarah. You will report to the Probation and Parole office at Maitland within 48 hours of release, that is two days. You will obey all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole including counselling re domestic violence, self-image and anger management. 19. Now in the event that you move, does your brother in law still live at that place where you are going?APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: If there are any tensions and you feel you have to move, you will do so in consultation with Probation and Parole.APPELLANT: Notify them straight away.HIS HONOUR: No you misunderstood me. Consultation means “hello, I’ve got to move, can you help me”.20. In the event of change of address, only do so in consultation with Probation and Parole. You will renew or report within five days of release to the Wesley United Employment Program and seek to have your program manager restored.21. In consultation with Probation and Parole, you will make contact with the local mental health unit for psychological or psychiatric counselling. I would like to find out what is causing you to be angry. Somebody must have mistreated you when you were a child perhaps, I do not know. Is that right?APPELLANT: My Dad was violent when he was drinking.HIS HONOUR: All right. So we want to get that out in the open and find out what it is so you can deal with it, do you understand that?APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: 22. You will, while you are unemployed, find some community activity, whether coaching or sport based or charity based like sorting out clothes for the Salvation Army or whatever, right? But some community activity that will occupy you for at least 15 hours weekly. That is a couple of hours each day. When you come back to me in three months time, we have this checklist, you are going to have it and I am going to need to know about it.23. You will abstain completely from alcohol for the next six months and thereafter only after consultation with Probation and Parole. I am not going to keep you off alcohol forever but there is a responsible drinking thing, I think you would be crazy to go back to it but I am not going to keep you off it except for the first six months understand?APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: So consultation with Probation and Parole re responsible drinking program. 24. You will provide proof of community based activities, get a letter from somebody saying you have done what you have done, did I put in the random urine? Submit to random urinalysis for the purposes of detecting illicit drugs and/or alcohol at least four times monthly. Any dirty drug test deemed a breach of bail. Supplying urine sourced from another person breach of bail. 25. You will attend Court, that is my Court, at all times required.26. Failure to attend Probation and Parole as directed by the Court or Probation and Parole deemed a breach of bail.27. Is there any condition that I have put there that you cannot meet?APPELLANT: No sir I will stick to all those conditions.HIS HONOUR: You have said that in open court, you understand that?APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: It means I am going to hold you to it, you have had your chance to change them. 28. I require to be notified of any breach of bail within 48 hours.29. Bail can be entered downstairs.GOMEZ: Your Honour just in relation to any change of address must be done in consultation with Probation and Parole, I do not know if the registry are automatically notified but perhaps it might be prudent--HIS HONOUR: You should also notify the registry here too yes. In consultation with Probation and Parole, that is that condition. In the event of any change of address only to do in consultation with Probation and Parole. There is a further condition related to that which is notify the Registry within two working days of any change of address. That is so we can keep in contact with you.APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: You will get a copy of this bail and you will see in a minute, I am going to set a date early next year, you will have to probably come down to Sydney.APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: And this will be a checklist, I will be asking you “have you been of good behaviour, where are you now residing” and so on and so on, right through the list. “What is the community organisation that you are attached to and doing” write it down so that you will know what you have to tell me when you come.APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: Because it is the conditions on the bail sheet do you understand?APPELLANT: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: If you make progress, I will indicate to you now I will suspend the sentences, that means that you will not go back into custody and I will reduce them for what you have served already. If you fail, you will go back into custody and complete the sentences and again, I will give you credit for what you already have done.APPELLANT: Thank you, your Worship.GOMEZ: Perhaps your Honour might want to take a transcript of today’s proceedings.HIS HONOUR: Yes we might have a transcript please.30. I wish you good luck. We had better set a date so we know when we are going to be hearing from you. I will see you on 13 February all right.APPELLANT: Yes sir.DISCUSSION AS TO SUITABLE DATEHIS HONOUR: Friday 20 February. I would very much prefer to keep counsel in it so I am very pleased to accommodate you.31. What is the first thing you have to do once you get out Mr Ledwidge?APPELLANT: Go to Probation and Parole within 48 hours or 42 hours.HIS HONOUR: Yes.APPELLANT: The next two days.HIS HONOUR: When do you get your first drink?APPELLANT: Not for at least a year.HIS HONOUR: All right, so long as we understand each other. It is my intention to finalise this a year from today as best I can, which will be Friday 13 November.32. All right good luck.APPELLANT: Thank you, your Worship.

    3 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Nicolae Halmi, appeals against his conviction for supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986 (NSW).  
     
      
    4 The Appellant stood trial in the Sydney District Court before his Honour Judge Donovan QC and a jury between 14 and 31 January 2007. On the last mentioned day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 5 On 9 February 2007, his Honour Judge Donovan QC sentenced the Appellant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months to commence on that day and to expire on 8 August 2009 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 8 August 2010. In passing this sentence, his Honour took into account periods which the Appellant had spent in custody between 2000 and 2007 before and after his conviction for the offence at an earlier trial. That conviction was quashed by this Court on a ground which is not relevant to the present appeal: R v Halmi (2005) 62 NSWLR 263. 6 The grounds of appeal relate only to conviction. No appeal is brought in relation to sentence. 
     
      
      The Offence Charged  
       
      
    7 The Appellant stood trial upon an indictment alleging that, on 8 May 2000, at Bass Hill in the State of New South Wales, he did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, in an amount that was not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.  
     
      
    8 The Crown alleged that, on 8 May 2000 at Bass Hill, the Appellant and a co-offender, Mile Stojkov, supplied five blocks of heroin weighing 1.789 kilograms to Skalidi Ilievski and Robert Stransky. 
     
      
      Grounds of Appeal 
      
    9 The Appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      (a) the jury’s verdict is unreasonable and/or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence pursuant to s.6(1)  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that, before they could convict, they would have to find proved beyond reasonable doubt as an indispensable intermediate fact that the heroin had been driven to Bass Hill in the motor vehicle occupied by the Appellant and Mile Stojkov. 
      
     
     
      
      Uncontroversial Facts 
      
    10 The following summarises those parts of the evidence at the trial of the Appellant which were not in dispute.11 Some time before 8 May 2000, a person named “Joe” informed police that he had arranged to receive heroin from two persons known to him as “Stevo” and “Roberto”, at the Rydges Hotel at Bass Hill some time during the afternoon and evening of 8 May 2000. “Stevo” and “Roberto” were Ilievski and Stransky. 12 On 8 May 2000, a police surveillance operation was set up in and around the Rydges Hotel at Bass Hill. The operation involved officers from various State and federal law enforcement agencies.13 The focus of the police operation was the Rydges Hotel. “Joe” and an undercover police officer named “Nick” occupied Room 508 of the Rydges Hotel. Police officers occupied Rooms 507 and 510 nearby. Video and listening surveillance devices had been placed inside Room 508 by police, who could see and hear what was occurring inside that room throughout the afternoon and evening. 14 At 3.28 pm, Ilievski and Stransky arrived at Sydney Airport having travelled from Melbourne earlier in the day. The pair got into a taxi in the vicinity of the Domestic Terminal at Mascot and made their way to Bass Hill. 15 At approximately 4.00 pm, Ilievski and Stransky arrived at Bass Hill and checked into Room 42 at the Gardenia Motor Inn which was located east of the Rydges Hotel on the Hume Highway. 16 At 4.27 pm, Ilievski placed a phone call to Stojkov. Ilievski then made a second telephone call to “Joe” who was waiting in Room 508 at the Rydges Hotel. Ilievski and “Joe” arranged to meet at a McDonalds restaurant located immediately adjacent to the Rydges Hotel. The car park of the McDonalds restaurant was connected to the car park of the Rydges Hotel by a walkway. 17 Ilievski and Stransky met “Joe” at McDonalds and accompanied him back to Room 508. Once inside, “Joe” and the undercover police officer “Nick” showed Ilievski and Stransky $280,000.00 in cash. The four men remained in Room 508 for some time. 18 At 5.47 pm, Ilievski received a phone call from Stojkov, which indicated that Stojkov had arrived in the Bass Hill area. The listening device inside Room 508 recorded the following exchange (Exhibit J): 
     
      
       
        
        “Ilievski (answering phone): Yeah…yeah…ah…are you close…yeah alright…ah go down there at Mcdonalds…at forty two…yeah… 
         
         
        Ilievski (to Robert  
        [Stransky] 
        ): Go, go inside, take it… 
         
         
        Joe: Take it and bring it here.” 
        
       
      
    19 Stransky immediately left Room 508 and made his way east across the McDonalds car park to Room 42 at the Gardenia Motor Inn. 20 Back inside Room 508 at the Rydges Hotel, Ilievski attempted a number of times to contact Stojkov on the telephone without success. At 5.54 pm, Ilievski successfully contacted Stojkov. Ilievski said to Stojkov (Exhibit J): 
     
      
       
        
        “Ilievski (on the phone): Yeah, yeah, you are here, yeah, you come here  
        [sic]  
        me, hello! Yeah, you can hear me, yeah, you are already there…, just go upstairs, in forty two, my mate, my mate, this is my mate that came with me. Yeah, and you give, pass to him and five minutes wait there…alright. Give to him, he come out and you wait there five minutes. Yeah…yeah…(not clear) Alright I come down. Alright I’m coming down. 
        
       
       
        
        Ilievski (to Joe): He wants to see me. 
        ”  
        
       
      
    21 Ilievski immediately left Room 508 and made his way along the Hume Highway towards a Shell Service Station. He crossed to the other side of the highway where, at 6.03 pm, he met Stojkov. It was, by this time, dark.22 At 6.06 pm, while still on the side of the highway with Stojkov, Ilievski received a phone call from Stransky. The following exchange was recorded (Exhibit K): 
     
      
       
        
        “M1  
        [Ilievski] 
        : Hello 
         
         
        M2  
        [Stransky] 
        : Tell me.  
         
         
        M1: Yeah, alright, wait there. 
         
         
        M2: To wait, uh.  
         
         
        M1: Or come here.  
         
         
        M2: What now, to wait or come? 
         
         
        M1: Wait. Wait.  
         
         
        M2: Is he going to come?  
         
         
        M1: Yeah, wait there, okay? Bye.” 
        
       
      
    23 At 6.07 pm, Ilievski and Stojkov separated on the side of the highway. Ilievski began making his way back to the Rydges Hotel.  24 Stojkov walked along the highway in a westerly direction to the car park of the Bass Hill Plaza, where he met the Appellant, who was driving a white Holden Commodore sedan. As will be seen, there was no issue at the trial that the Appellant had earlier driven Stojkov to the Bass Hill area in the late afternoon. Stojkov and the Appellant drove from the Bass Hill Plaza to the McDonalds restaurant adjacent to the Rydges Hotel. They arrived at the McDonalds car park at 6.17 pm. 25 The pair got out of the car. Stojkov made his way to the walkway connecting the McDonalds car park and the Rydges Hotel car park. The Appellant went inside McDonalds and purchased some food. 26 While this was happening, Stransky had made his way back to the Rydges Hotel from the Gardenia Motor Inn. He had departed the Gardenia Motor Inn at 6.12 pm and was captured on closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) a few minutes later re-entering the Rydges Hotel. Police had been watching Stransky since he departed the Rydges Hotel at 5.47 pm He was not observed at any time carrying anything. Approximately two minutes later, at 6.19 pm, Ilievski was captured by CCTV re-entering the Rydges Hotel. He had in his possession a black shopping bag. 27 Once back inside Room 508, Ilievski showed “Joe” the heroin, which was inside the black shopping bag. Ilievski was recorded as commenting (Exhibit J): 
     
      
       
        
        “I come from shopping. He goes no bring down the money. I said, … up and down fucking…”  
        
       
      
    28 At this point, armed police officers intervened arresting Ilievski, Stransky, “Joe” and “Nick” inside Room 508 and Stojkov near the walkway connecting the McDonalds car park and the Rydges Hotel car park. 29 Moments later, the Appellant emerged from McDonalds with a bag of food and observed the arrest of Stojkov taking place. The Appellant moved in the opposite direction from where Stojkov was being arrested. He was arrested moments later by police. 30 Forensic analysis was undertaken on the five blocks of heroin. Fingerprints of the Appellant were found on two pieces of the plastic used to wrap the heroin (Exhibit G). One of the Appellant’s fingerprints was found on the outer plastic wrapping of one of the blocks of heroin. Three further fingerprints of the Appellant were found on the inner plastic wrapping of another of the blocks of heroin. Stojkov’s fingerprints were also found on the plastic wrappings.  
     
      
      The Crown Case 
      
    31 It was the Crown case that the Appellant and Stojkov were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin and that they had travelled to Bass Hill on 8 May 2000 for that purpose. 32 The Crown case against the Appellant was circumstantial. Despite extensive police surveillance of the geographic area in and around the Rydges Hotel, no witness at the trial of the Appellant gave evidence of actually observing the heroin in the black shopping bag being given to Ilievski or Stransky by either Stojkov or the Appellant.  
     
      
    33 The Crown contended that Ilievski and Stransky had been waiting for a third party to arrive at Bass Hill with the heroin. This was supported by the fact that after Ilievski and Stransky first inspected the money in Room 508, they then waited in the room with “Joe” and “Nick” for about an hour. During this time, the following exchange was recorded (Exhibit J):  
     
      
       
        
        “Joe (to Ilievski): Can you ring those people, you know, so we don’t have to wait. 
         
         
        Ilievski: (not clear) 
         
         
        Joe: Oh, when they are near, they will call, OK.”  
        
       
      
    34 It was only after Ilievski received the telephone call from Stojkov at 5.47 pm, alerting Ilievski to the fact that he had arrived in Bass Hill, that the exchange of the money and heroin proceeded to finality.35 Apart from Stransky and “Joe”, Ilievski did not attempt to contact any person other than Stojkov on 8 May 2000. Telephone records tendered at the trial of the Appellant showed that between 3 May and 7 May 2000, Ilievski had been in contact with Stojkov on six occasions (Exhibit M; T293). On 8 May 2000, Ilievski was in contact with Stojkov on 13 occasions (Exhibit M). The Crown invited the jury to conclude that the reason for the volume of communication between Ilievski and Stojkov in this period was indicative of Stojkov being directly involved in the proposed heroin supply. 36 There was direct evidence that the Appellant had driven Stojkov to Bass Hill and that he later drove Stojkov from the Bass Hill Plaza car park to the McDonalds car park. There was evidence that the Appellant had not used his own car (a red Ford Fairlane with mag wheels) for this purpose, but rather, had used his brother-in-law’s white Holden Commodore. The Crown contended that a less prominent vehicle was used by the Appellant, being one which was less likely to draw police attention.37 When confronted with the arrest of Stojkov as the Appellant exited McDonalds, it was the Crown case that the Appellant had attempted to flee the scene, and that this was evidence of the Appellant's consciousness of guilt. The Crown pointed to the fact that the arresting police were wearing clothing with the word “Police” displayed clearly on them.38 The Crown asserted that the presence of the Appellant’s fingerprints on outer and inner plastic wrappings around the heroin indicated that the Appellant had been involved in the preparation and packaging of the heroin for supply. 39 The Crown contended that it was an irresistible inference that Stojkov delivered the heroin to Ilievski. The Crown said that the heroin had arrived at Bass Hill via a third party, and that the jury were entitled to infer that that third party was Stojkov, with the assistance of the Appellant. The Crown Prosecutor submitted in his closing address (T608):  
     
      
       
        
        “Everything they  
        [Ilievski and Stransky] 
         do is indicative of there being a third party. You might ask yourself this, if Ilievski, being in a position but for one fact, the supply of drugs, he could supply, grab that bag with 280 thousand dollars and leave. Why is the person he is preoccupied with that day Stojkov? I suggest to you the only reason he is preoccupied with speaking to Stojkov, meeting with Stojkov is because Stojkov is the source of the drugs. The other point about that I would ask you to give some thought to is if you accept that the accused and Stojkov travelled from Kingsford to Bass Hill and if you accept that Stojkov had to have been the source of the drugs that Ilievski takes into the hotel it must also follow, you might think, that those drugs must have been in the vehicle at some point. They must have been in the vehicle at a time when the accused and Stojkov were in the vehicle.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The Appellant’s Case 
      
    40 The Appellant gave evidence at trial and proffered innocent explanations for a number of the matters relied on by the Crown. 41 In evidence, the Appellant said that Stojkov had left his car at the Appellant’s home on the evening of 7 May 2000 because he had been drinking, and made his way back to his home by way of public transport. It was arranged that the Appellant would collect Stojkov from his home in Kingsford on 8 May 2000 and drive him back to where his car was located so that he may pick it up. 42 At around lunchtime on 8 May 2000, the Appellant and Stojkov departed from Stojkov’s home in Kingsford. The Appellant said that once they were inside the car, Stojkov raised the possibility of stopping for a short period of time at Bass Hill so that he may see a friend. He directed the Appellant to drive to the Hume Highway at Bass Hill. 43 In evidence, the Appellant said that Stojkov had a number of telephone conversations in a Yugoslavian language whilst in the car with him. The evidence established that these conversations were between Stojkov and Ilievski (Exhibit M). The Appellant asserted that he was not able to understand the conversations between Stojkov and Ilievski spoken in Yugoslavian, as he only spoke English and Romanian (T423-424). 44 The Appellant said that when he and Stojkov arrived at Bass Hill, they parked in the Bass Hill Plaza car park. Stojkov told the Appellant that he would be gone for a while and that he would see him in a short time (T454). The Appellant said that he went into the Bass Hill Plaza and bought some bread rolls (T455). A short time later, Stojkov returned and asked the Appellant to drive to the McDonalds restaurant adjacent to the Rydges Hotel to see his friend again.45 When the two men arrived at McDonalds, the Appellant went inside to buy food. It was the Appellant’s evidence that he did not see where Stojkov went. As he emerged from McDonalds, the Appellant said he heard and saw cars arrive and people with guns jump out screaming. The Appellant said that he moved in the other direction when he saw Stojkov being set upon by these people, because he did not know that they were police and he was frightened. 46 The Appellant ran a fruit and vegetable shop in Concord, and had known Stojkov for four or five years. During cross-examination, the Appellant agreed that Stojkov was a friend (T496). Stojkov had worked in the Appellant’s fruit and vegetable shop in the past, although not on a regular basis. 
     
      
    47 The Appellant said that he was driving his brother-in-law’s white Holden Commodore because his own vehicle was having heating problems and he had left it with a mechanic friend to examine. In cross-examination, the Appellant said that his Ford Fairlane was parked at the back of his shop and he was waiting for the mechanic to pick it up (T471-472). 
     
      
    48 The Appellant could not explain how his fingerprints came to be on the plastic wrapping around the heroin. He denied that his fingerprints were on the wrapping because he had assisted Stojkov to wrap the heroin (T526). The Appellant said that the freezer-type plastic bags used to wrap the heroin were similar to those used in his fruit and vegetable shop, but he did not know whether the plastic had come from his shop (T526). 49 The Appellant denied that he knowingly participated in the transport of heroin to the Bass Hill area on the day in question. He said that he had no knowledge of any drug deal, or of any delivery of drugs to Ilievski.50 Trial counsel for the Appellant emphasised the fact that, from the time Stojkov met Ilievski on the side of the Hume Highway at 6.03 pm to the point at which police arrested Stojkov and the Appellant in the McDonalds car park, the two men had been under police surveillance. It was the Appellant’s case that no transfer of the drugs could have occurred in this period.51 It was the Appellant’s case that although Stojkov may have been involved in the heroin supply, the transfer may have involved another party who delivered the heroin to Ilievski at some point between the time when Ilievski left Room 508 and the time that he was captured on CCTV re-entering the Rydges Hotel carrying the black shopping bag. It was put on behalf of the Appellant that the other party might have been the “Chinese”. The Appellant relied on a reference to “Chinese” during discussions between Ilievski, Stransky, “Joe” and “Nick” in Room 508 (Exhibit J): 
     
      
       
        
         “Joe: What are these people, one of us or different. 
         
         
         Ilievski: Chinese and there will be one of my people.  
         
         
         Joe: Chinese, that’s alright.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Determination of Appeal 
      
    52 I turn to consider the grounds of appeal. The Appellant submitted that Ground 2 (a retrial point) would only be reached by the Court if Ground 1 (an acquittal point) was rejected.   
     
      
      Ground 1 – The Jury’s Verdict is Unreasonable and/or Cannot be Supported Having Regard to the Evidence 
      
     
     
      
      Appellant’s Submissions 
      
    53 Mr Dalton SC, for the Appellant (who did not appear at the trial), submitted that the evidence presented by the Crown against the Appellant was “equivocal” as to his guilt. He submitted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant. He submitted that the jury’s verdict of guilty was contrary to the evidence and that the Appellant should be acquitted.54 Mr Dalton SC developed a number of arguments in support of Ground 1 in written and oral submissions. 55 It was submitted that a critical part of the Crown case against the Appellant was the fingerprint evidence recovered from the plastic wrappings encasing the heroin blocks (Exhibit E). The plastic was said to be of a similar type to that used in the Appellant’s fruit and vegetable shop. Stojkov, as an occasional employee of the Appellant’s shop, would conceivably have had access to the plastic without the Appellant’s knowledge. The Appellant's fingerprints may have been left on the plastic in the course of his work at the shop. 56 It was submitted that the fingerprints of the Appellant recovered from two pieces of plastic used in wrapping the heroin indicated that the Appellant might only have touched the plastic wrappings twice. The three fingerprints recovered from the inner plastic wrapping of one of the blocks of heroin were overlayed in such a fashion as to be consistent with a single touch of the plastic by the Appellant’s left hand. The other fingerprint recovered from the outer wrapping of another block of heroin indicated a second touch. No fingerprints were recovered from the adhesive tape used to secure the plastic around the heroin. 57 It was submitted that the presence of the Appellant’s fingerprints on only two pieces of the plastic wrapping, and the nature of those fingerprints, was consistent with innocent touches of the plastic by the Appellant in the course of his work at his fruit and vegetable shop. 58 On one piece of plastic, a fingerprint of Stojkov was recovered in close proximity to that of the Appellant. It was submitted that this assisted the proposition that the Appellant may have innocently touched the plastic wrapping prior to it being used to wrap the heroin, as it was unlikely that the two men would have double handled the plastic in the course of wrapping the heroin if they were engaged in that exercise together. 59 It was submitted that the fact that no fingerprints were recovered from the adhesive tape used to secure the plastic around the heroin, was consistent with the proposition that someone wearing gloves had wrapped the heroin. 60 Mr Dalton SC submitted that another critical component of the Crown case was that Stojkov had supplied the heroin to Ilievski at Bass Hill, and that it had therefore made its way to Bass Hill in the white Holden Commodore driven by the Appellant. Mr Dalton SC sought to develop a submission in oral argument that such a transfer was not possible, given the extent of police surveillance of Stojkov and the Appellant from the time Stojkov met Ilievski on the side of the Hume Highway to the moment the pair were arrested in the McDonalds car park.61 A further matter was cited in support of this submission, which related to the Crown hypothesis that Stojkov may have transferred the heroin to Ilievski through the walkway connecting the car parks of McDonalds and the Rydges Hotel moments after arriving in the McDonalds car park with the Appellant. 62 Observations made by police officers throughout the afternoon, as part of the surveillance operation, were called in over a communication frequency. The times of their observations were recorded by reference to a central timepiece. However, the CCTV recording of the Rydges Hotel foyer was not consistent with the police’s central timepiece - it was between two and four minutes in front. It was submitted that this discrepancy in time was crucial. 
     
      
    63 It was the evidence of police officers involved in the surveillance operation that the Appellant and Stojkov arrived in the McDonalds car park at 6.17 pm. According to the time displayed on the CCTV recording, Ilievski re-entered the Rydges Hotel at 6.19 pm. It was submitted that, allowing for a minimum discrepancy of two minutes between the time kept by the police’s central timepiece and the CCTV footage inside the Rydges Hotel, no transfer could have taken place in the period between the Appellant and Stojkov arriving in the McDonalds car park and Ilievski re-entering the Rydges Hotel carrying the black shopping bag. This was so, it was submitted, because the two events would have occurred simultaneously. 
     
      
    64 In support of this submission, Mr Dalton SC pointed to the fact that the Appellant and Stojkov were under surveillance for the whole of the period after Stojkov met with Ilievski on the side of the Hume Highway. However, Ilievski was not observed outside the Rydges Hotel from the time when he left Stojkov on the side of the Hume Highway until he re-entered the Rydges Hotel at 6.19 pm, as captured by CCTV. 65 Mr Dalton SC pointed to other pieces of evidence, namely, the evidence of the Appellant’s flight in the McDonalds car park in the moments after the arrest of Stojkov, his presence at the scene and his association with Stojkov on the day in question. It was submitted that each of these pieces of evidence was capable of rational explanation consistent with the Appellant’s innocence. 66 It was also submitted that there was evidence suggesting that the “Chinese” may have been involved in the transfer of the heroin, and that this was significant in raising doubt as to the Appellant’s guilt.67 It was submitted that the equivocal nature of the evidence against the Appellant, coupled with the fact that there was no evidence available which proved that the Appellant had been a party to the transfer of the heroin to Ilievski, meant that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury. Mr Dalton SC submitted that the jury’s verdict was contrary to the evidence and that the Appellant should accordingly be acquitted.  
     
      
      Crown Submissions 
      
    68 The Crown submitted that it had never been the Crown case that the Appellant had handed over the heroin to Ilievski. Rather, the Crown case was based on the notion that the Appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Stojkov. 69 The Crown case that Stojkov supplied the heroin to Ilievski was a circumstantial one. The circumstances relied on by the Crown to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that it was Stojkov who supplied the heroin to Ilievski included: 
     
      
      (a) that Ilievski and Stransky were waiting at Bass Hill for another party to arrive with the heroin;  
       
       
      (b) that Ilievski was in contact with Stojkov by telephone a number of times on 8 May 2000, and the only other people Ilievski contacted were Stransky and  
      “Joe” 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) that after Stojkov and the Appellant arrived in Bass Hill, Stojkov contacted Ilievski and an arrangement was made in relation to Room 42 at the Gardenia Motor Inn - Stransky then left Room 508 of the Rydges Hotel and made his way to the Gardenia Motor Inn, however, minutes later a further arrangement was made for Ilievski to meet Stojkov;  
       
       
      (d) that Ilievski and Stojkov met on the Hume Highway shortly before Ilievski was seen re-entering the Rydges Hotel with the heroin in the black shopping bag; and 
       
       
      (e) that forensic examination of the heroin found Stojkov’s fingerprints on the plastic used to wrap the heroin.  
      
    70 The Crown submitted that it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Stojkov who delivered the heroin to Ilievski. It was submitted that it was then clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Stojkov to supply the heroin. The Crown relied on the following circumstances in this regard: 
     
      
      (a) that the Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the plastic used to wrap the heroin;  
       
       
      (b) that the Appellant drove Stojkov to Bass Hill and was in the vicinity of the McDonalds car park; 
       
       
      (c) that the Appellant was in the vicinity of the sale of the heroin inside Room 508 of the Rydges Hotel; and 
       
       
      (d) that when police arrived, the Appellant attempted to flee the scene, thereby demonstrating consciousness of guilt.  
      
    71 In his final address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor pointed to a series of matters in support of the conclusion that the Appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin (T610): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is further that it is not a coincidence that on 8 May the accused finds himself at Bass Hill nearby a place where two men, Ilievski and Stransky, are waiting for a heroin delivery and it is not a coincidence that the … heroin delivered happens to be heroin that is wrapped in plastic that contains the accused’s fingerprints. Is it at all likely that Stojkov would have wanted the accused to be present, assuming the accused has nothing to do with what Stojkov is up to, but is it all likely that Stojkov would have wanted the accused present in circumstances where he is engaged in the supply of heroin? Is it likely that Stojkov would have so badly organised himself that on the day he is to supply the heroin he happens to leave his car up at Mt Pritchard and he chooses to, it appears on the evidence, rather than arrange to travel that extra short time from Bass Hill to Mt Pritchard to get his car, that is the thing that he chooses not to do.” 
        
       
      
    72 In reply to the Appellant’s submission that the “Chinese” may have been involved together with Stojkov in the supply and not the Appellant, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence of any contact between Ilievski and anyone other than Stojkov, Stransky and “Joe” in the relevant period. It was further submitted that the hypothesis that the “Chinese” were involved was not consistent with the available fingerprint evidence, together with the fact that Stojkov and the Appellant were in the vicinity of Bass Hill at the relevant time. There was no evidence of the presence of any other party said to be involved in the transfer. 73 The Crown submitted that it was apparent that the “Chinese” hypothesis, for want of a better phrase, did not cause the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Appellant. 74 Upon the whole of the evidence, the Crown submitted that it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was party to a joint criminal enterprise to supply heroin.   
     
      
      Decision 
      
    75 The Crown case was reliant upon circumstantial evidence to establish: 
     
      
       
      (a) that Stojkov supplied the heroin to Ilievski; 
       
       
      (b) that the Appellant was a knowing participant in a joint criminal enterprise with Stojkov to supply heroin. 
       
      
    76 It has been observed that a jury brings to its consideration of a circumstantial case the common experience of members of the community comprising men and women of different backgrounds, of different ages and with different experiences in life, who apply to the case their collective knowledge of human affairs and their common sense: R v Kaldor (2004) 150 A Crim R 271 per Dunford J at 272-273 [2] and Howie J at 293-294 [86]; R v Chahine [2006] NSWCCA 179 at [88].  
     
      
    77 Where it is contended that a verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the question which this Court must ask itself is whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant in this case was guilty: M v Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] 213 CLR 606 at 614-615 [25], 623 [55]-[57]. This Court’s function under s.6(1) is to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of accused persons in criminal trials: MFA v The Queen at 624 [59]. The jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, including the Appellant: M v The Queen at 493. 
     
      
    78 There was a strong body of circumstantial evidence supporting the conclusion that Stojkov supplied the heroin to Ilievski. There was regular contact between Stojkov and Ilievski on the days leading up to 8 May 2000 and on that day. Stojkov had travelled to Bass Hill, as had Ilievski, with a meeting to take place between them at that location. Ilievski took possession of a black shopping bag containing the heroin wrapped in plastic which bore Stojkov’s fingerprints.  
     
      
    79 In my view, any question arising from the variation in times recorded and the absence of direct evidence of observation of Stojkov handing the bag to Ilievski, does not greatly assist the Appellant’s case. The Crown did not assert that there was a complete and unbroken observation of all events which, in any case, took place in the dark of an early evening in winter. Nor does the somewhat cryptic isolated reference to “Chinese” assist the Appellant’s case. The evidence, including the telephone and other electronic surveillance evidence, did not point to the involvement of any other party in a manner which served to undermine the powerful and damaging inference that it was Stojkov who handed the heroin to Ilievski. 
     
      
    80 The evidence of the Appellant’s fingerprints being found on the plastic used to wrap the heroin was powerful circumstantial evidence adverse to the Appellant. It connected him directly to the heroin. That he transported Stojkov to the Bass Hill area and remained there, that he was with him in the McDonalds car park when Stojkov positioned himself in the walkway connecting the McDonalds car park to the Rydges Hotel car park, and, when confronted with arrest, that he attempted to flee the scene, were all damaging to the Appellant.  
     
      
    81 It has been observed that circumstantial evidence may often be more reliable than direct evidence, which can be subject to the fallibility of human observation and memory: R v Cable (1947) 47 SR 183 at 184 per Jordan CJ; R v Chahine at [95]. Fingerprint evidence is powerful and cogent evidence of identification of an offender in a manner which links him to the crime: R v Chahine at [96]. 
     
      
    82 This was not a case where the Crown case was dependent on an isolated fingerprint of the Appellant being located on the heroin package. The fingerprint evidence was to be considered with other evidence which saw the Appellant and Stojkov travelling together to Bass Hill, and remaining in the area for a period of time, leading up to the supply by Stojkov to Ilievski of a substantial quantity of heroin. The Appellant’s reaction to Stojkov’s arrest pointed to a guilty mind on his part. 
     
      
    83 In considering a circumstantial case, all the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence. A circumstantial case ought not be considered piecemeal at trial or on appeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]. 
     
      
    84 The Appellant’s submissions invited a type of piecemeal assessment of the circumstantial case. It is necessary to assess the evidence by reference to all the circumstances established.  
     
      
    85 Upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant’s guilt. It has not been demonstrated that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
      Ground 2 - The Indispensable Intermediate Fact Ground  
      
     
     
      
      Appellant’s Submissions 
       
      
    86 Mr Dalton SC submitted that it was foundational to the Crown case against the Appellant that the heroin had been brought to the Bass Hill area in the vehicle occupied by the Appellant and Stojkov.  
     
      
    87 It was submitted that the jury was not properly directed by the trial judge in relation to this aspect of the Crown case being an indispensable intermediate fact, which required proof beyond reasonable doubt, before the jury could convict: Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 589. It was submitted that the direction given in this respect was not in explicit enough terms as to leave the jury in no doubt that this was a critical finding of fact that needed to be made before the jury could convict.  
     
      
    88 It was submitted that failure on the part of the trial judge to construct a direction on this point, in explicit enough terms, was so fundamental in the circumstances of the case that it caused the trial to miscarry.  
     
      
       
      Crown Submissions 
       
      
    89 The Crown submitted that, although express reference was not made to the heroin being in the vehicle, the trial judge did treat the question of whether Stojkov brought the heroin to Ilievski as an indispensable intermediate fact and gave a direction to the jury accordingly.  
     
      
    90 It was also submitted that trial counsel for the Appellant did not seek any further direction on this point, and that leave under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules should not be granted to the Appellant to raise the point on appeal.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    91 The relevant direction given to the jury by the trial judge was expressed in the following terms (SU18): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown took you through a lot of the detail which the Crown relies on to say that Stojkov did bring the heroin to Ilievski which is finally found in Room 508. The Crown’s case is circumstantial. If you are to conclude that Stojkov did bring it then that must be the only rational explanation. The Crown relies upon the fact that Ilievski is waiting. The Crown relies upon all the contact between Ilievski and Stojkov and the Crown rely in particular upon the fingerprints of Stojkov. And the Crown says that particularly with the fingerprints of Stojkov there you would find there is no other rational explanation other than Stojkov brought the heroin to Ilievski which was later found in the room.  
         
         
        But it is a matter for you and you have to decide that again beyond reasonable doubt, you have to decide that beyond reasonable doubt before you can conclude that it is what happened. The Crown has to prove that one beyond reasonable doubt and it has to be the only rational explanation.” 
        
       
      
    92 Although trial counsel sought further directions on a range of matters at the conclusion of the summing up, no further direction was sought in accordance with the proposition contained in Ground 2. Accordingly, the Appellant requires leave under Rule 4 to rely upon this ground. 93 I am satisfied that the direction given to the jury by the trial judge was appropriate and sufficient in the circumstances of the trial. The jury was directed, in no uncertain terms, that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Stojkov brought the heroin to Ilievski. Stojkov had been transported to Bass Hill in the vehicle driven by the Appellant. In the context of this trial, the issue was clearly enough whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Stojkov had supplied Ilievski with heroin which had been conveyed to Bass Hill in the vehicle driven by the Appellant. It is pertinent that the heroin was wrapped in plastic which bore the fingerprints of both Stojkov and the Appellant. The absence of any application for a further direction by experienced trial counsel reinforces the conclusion that this issue was clearly left to the jury in the summing up.  
     
      
    94 There is no case for the grant of leave under Rule 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the Appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error or is satisfied that the Appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319; R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [19]-[24]. With respect to Ground 2, the Appellant has not demonstrated an arguable case that the trial judge fell into error or that the Appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    95 Leave to argue Ground 2 ought be refused. 
     
      
    96 I reject the second ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    97 I propose that the appeal against conviction ought be dismissed.

      2007/3825 REGINA v SHIRLEY JUSTINS 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 19 June this year the offender, Shirley Justins, was found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of her partner Graeme Wylie. The same jury convicted a co-offender, Caren Jenning, of being an accessory before the fact to that manslaughter. After the jury verdict was returned and before the sentencing proceedings commenced, Ms Jenning committed suicide. I am now to sentence Ms Justins for her involvement in the unlawful killing of the deceased. 
     
      
    2 On 22 March 2006 the deceased died from a lethal dose of a substance known as Nembutal, being the drug Pentobarbitone. This is a substance used in Australia in veterinary services for putting down animals. It is not otherwise available to members of the public in this country. Ms Jenning had obtained the drug in Mexico. She travelled to that country for the purpose of purchasing the drug so that it could be used to end the deceased’s life. Ms Jenning then unlawfully imported the drug into Australia and ultimately supplied it to the offender. It was accepted by the Crown that the deceased voluntarily drank this substance that had been provided to him by the offender. She intended that he should drink the drug and die as a result. The Crown accepts that the chief motivation of the offender in providing the drug to the deceased was so that he could take his own life in accordance with what she believed to be his wishes. 
     
      
    3 The offender was arraigned before the jury on an indictment containing a count of murder. There was an alternative charge of aiding and abetting the suicide of the deceased contrary to s 31C(1) of the Crimes Act (NSW). Ms Jennings was charged with importing the drug contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) and an offence of being an accessory to the fact of the murder allegedly committed by Ms Justins. There was also an alternative count of aiding and abetting the suicide of the deceased. 
     
      
    4 On arraignment both offenders pleaded not guilty to all charges. Counsel for each of them opened to the jury denying that his client had any involvement in the death of the deceased. However, in the second week of the trial they were both re-arraigned before the jury at their own request. Ms Justins pleaded guilty to the offence of aid and abet suicide but the Crown refused to accept that plea in discharge of the indictment. Ms Jenning pleaded guilty to the importation offence. The trial on the charge of murder and accessory before the fact to murder then continued. Very late in the trial the Crown indicated that it intended to have the jury consider the charge of manslaughter in respect of the offender based upon gross criminal negligence. It asked that the indictment be amended to add a count of accessory before the fact to manslaughter in respect of Ms Jenning. This occurred and ultimately the jury brought in their verdicts in relation to the manslaughter of the deceased. 
     
      
    5 The issues ultimately left to the jury were, first, whether the Crown could prove that the deceased’s mental state at the time of consuming the drug was such that he did not have the capacity to determine to take his own life and, if so, secondly whether Ms Justins or Ms Jenning were aware of that fact. In deciding that Ms Justins was guilty of manslaughter the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased lacked the capacity to make an informed decision to end his life by consuming the drug proffered to him by the offender. The jury must also have been satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the offender would either have been aware of that fact or would have made inquiries to determine whether the deceased had that capacity. In relation to Ms Jenning the jury must have been satisfied that she knew that the deceased lacked that capacity even though the offender may not have had that knowledge. 
     
      
    6 At the time of his death the deceased was aged 72 years. He was a retired commercial airline pilot suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The offender was his de facto partner of about 20 years and Ms Jenning a long-term close friend of the deceased. At the time of his death he had two adult daughters from a previous marriage and there were two sisters living in Tasmania. He had been a man of very strong and somewhat particular opinions with an almost obsessive interest in audio-electronics. He was so determined to have his own way in relationships that he literally turned his second wife out of the matrimonial home when she expressed a desire to have children contrary to his wishes. 
     
      
    7 It is unnecessary to detail the medical and other evidence relating to the deceased’s deteriorating mental faculties since November 2000 and particularly after he was diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in March 2003. He was generally under the care of the staff of the Cognitive Disabilities Clinic (the CDC) at Concord Hospital at the time of the diagnosis through until August 2005. His general practitioner throughout this period had been Dr Russell in Cammeray. However, from August 2005 the deceased attended a general practitioner, Dr Gupta, who had been the doctor who had treated the offender when necessary. From this time the deceased no longer remained in contact with Dr Russell or the staff at Concord Hospital. 
     
      
    8 In 2001 Ms Jenning attended her first euthanasia workshop with Exit International Australia and became an officeholder of that organisation in 2004. This was an organisation the members of which believed that persons in the community should be given the opportunity to commit suicide if they believed that they would rather die than continue living because of illness, pain or suffering. One of the principal persons in this organisation was Dr Philip Nitschke a well-known spokesman on the issue of euthanasia and suicide. 
     
      
    9 Between 2002 and 2005 the deceased’s decline in his mental facilities was fairly rapid eventually resulting in his abandonment of his long-held interest in electronics. He stopped reading newspapers, had very limited conversation and at times appeared disoriented. As a consequence he became increasingly more depressed. By January 2005 testing at the CDC indicated severe cognitive impairment. 
     
      
    10 In September 2005, while the offender was away from home, the deceased attempted to cut his wrists. The offender took him to Dr Gupta who found that he had superficial lacerations to both wrists. 
     
      
    11 Toward the end of that month the deceased expressed an interest in travelling to Switzerland to an organisation called Dignitas that lawfully assisted and supervised persons who wished to take their own lives. The offender and Ms Jenning started gathering material to support that application. In October the offender completed an application to Dignitas on behalf of the deceased. For this purpose she obtained medical reports from Dr Russell. Ms Jenning told a member of the staff at Concord Hospital that the deceased needed reports and a prognosis as to his condition because he and the offender were to travel overseas. 
     
      
    12 In November 2005 the deceased and the offender attended Dr Gupta to obtain a medical report as to the deceased’s mental health for the purposes of the application to Dignitas. There was a dispute between Dr Gupta and the offender at the trial as to whether the doctor was aware of the purpose to which the certificate was obtained. That month the offender paid Dignitas 1000 Swiss Francs. 
     
      
    13 The deceased’s daughters were aware of the application and supported his wishes, although somewhat reluctantly. The deceased’s sisters were also made aware of the application and spoke to him about it. They indicated their support, as they believed that it was what the deceased wanted. 
     
      
    14 On 8 November 2005 Dignitas requested the assistance of Dr Nitschke in assessing the application because the deceased was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. On 16 November Dr Nitschke examined the deceased and, notwithstanding that he was unable to remember his date of birth or whether he had any children, Dr Nitschke advised Dignitas that the deceased had sufficient insight into his condition to support his application. At about this time Ms Jenning cautioned Dr Nitschke about one of the deceased’s daughter’s, Tania, who Ms Jenning believed would cause trouble. 
     
      
    15 In early December 2005, the application to Dignitas was refused on the basis that the organisation had doubts about the deceased’s capacity to make the decision to end his own life. The offender accused the daughter Tania of interfering and swaying Dr Nitschke against supporting the application. The deceased spoke to his sisters about his disappointment that the application had been rejected and indicated that he would have to look for other ways and means. 
     
      
    16 In January 2006 the offender contacted a solicitor, Ms Favretto, about the deceased’s will. It is clear that by this time the offender and Ms Jenning were considering, what members of Exit called, the “Mexican option”; that is obtaining Nembutal from Mexico where it could be purchased over the counter from Chemist shops. A publication by Exit in evidence before the jury discussed the use of this drug. It was apparently very foul tasting such that it was generally impossible to keep it in the stomach once swallowed. Therefore, in order to suppress the body’s natural reaction to expel the drug through vomit, it was necessary that, some days before drinking the Nembutal, the person take an antiemetic. 
     
      
    17 In February 2006 the deceased had a fall in a shed under his house. This occurred during a suicide attempt when he attempted to poison himself with the fumes of a lawnmower purchased for that purpose. He was described at that time as suffering from mild to moderate dementia. While the deceased was recovering in hospital the offender and Ms Jenning met with Dr Nitschke to discuss a further application to Dignitas. Dr Nitschke was less than enthusiastic about the prospects and the next day, 16 February, Ms Jenning booked a flight to Los Angeles for departure on 13 March 2006. The offender paid for the ticket. Nothing was said by the offender or Ms Jenning to any person, including Dr Nitschke, about the plan to end the deceased’s life by the use of Nembutal. 
     
      
    18 The deceased was discharged from hospital on 20 February and returned to his home. He needed the assistance of a walking frame. On 23 February the offender visited Dr Gupta and complained that the deceased was nauseous since his discharge from hospital. The doctor prescribed Maxalon, an antiemetic. 
     
      
    19 On 1 March 2006 the offender made an appointment for the deceased to see Ms Favretto, the solicitor. On 3 March the deceased and the offender attended on Ms Favretto for the purpose of having his will changed. The deceased had made a will in 1995 by which he left his estate divided as to 50 per cent to the offender and, as to 25 per cent, to each of his daughters. There was a provision that the house was to be sold one year after his death. The offender produced this will and indicated that there were a “few changes” to be made to it. The deceased told Ms Favretto that he wanted nothing left to his children but the offender suggested that they should each receive $100,000. Ms Favretto was not made aware that the deceased was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or of the plan to end his life shortly after the making of the will. 
     
      
    20 Ms Jenning flew out from Australia to Los Angeles on 13 March. The next day she travelled to Tijuana Mexico where she purchased the bottle of Nembutal that she later brought into Australia and gave to the offender. On this same date the offender obtained a certificate from Dr Gupta to the effect that the deceased was “capable of making his own decisions and understanding the nature of those decisions”. The certificate had been obtained at the suggestion of Ms Favretto as independent evidence of the deceased’s testamentary capacity at that time. Dr Gupta gave evidence that he did not know the purpose of the certificate. 
     
      
    21 On 15 March the deceased and the offender attended upon Ms Favretto and the new will was executed. Although the deceased appeared to read over the will before signing it, the offender knew he was no longer able to read. Ms Favretto was not made aware of the deceased’s mental deficiencies in this or any other regard. The will left the whole of the deceased’s estate to the offender except for $100,000 bequeathed to each of his daughters. The offender conceded in evidence at the trial that the deceased did not then have testamentary capacity. 
     
      
    22 Ms Jenning returned to Australia on 18 March and met up with the offender to give her the bottle of Nembutal. The next evening she had dinner with the offender and the deceased and reminded them that the deceased had to take the Maxalon for a few days before drinking the Nembutal. On this occasion Ms Jenning gave the offender a copy of a newspaper she had brought with her from America in which there was an article warning of the dangers of Aricept the medication that the deceased was prescribed for the Alzheimer’s disease. The offender and Ms Jennings made plans for the death of the deceased the following Wednesday and arranged to have alibis for that date. Ms Jenning was to receive the Nembutal bottle after its use and to dispose of it for the offender. 
     
      
    23 On 22 March 2006 the offender provided the deceased with a glass containing the Nembutal and watched him drink it. Her evidence was that he died within a few seconds of having taken the poison. She then left the premises taking the bottle and the glass with her and later giving both to Ms Jenning. The offender then went on a shopping excursion with a friend as she had earlier planned. Ms Jenning attended the theatre. 
     
      
    24 At about midday the offender returned to the house. She phoned a doctor at Cammeray to attend for the purpose of obtaining a death certificate. However that doctor would not furnish a certificate stating the cause of death, as she had not been treating the deceased. Other inquiries were made by the offender trying to obtain a death certificate in the hope of avoiding an autopsy but to no avail. Eventually the police arrived. By that time Ms Jenning was at the premises. She told police that she believed that the Aricept medication was the cause of death and produced the article in the newspaper. 
     
      
    25 On 24 March an autopsy was carried out on the deceased and the presence of Pentobarbitone in a lethal dose was discovered. 
     
      
    26 On 13 April the offender informed one of the deceased’s daughters about the contents of the new will. On 19 April Ms Jenning sent an email to Dr Nitschke’s partner about the deceased’s daughter Tania. 
     
      
    27 The deceased’s daughters lodged a caveat against the estate on 24 May 2006. On 1 June Ms Jenning advised Dr Nitschke of the dispute over the will and noted that “they” owed him money. She expressed concern that Dr Nitschke’s medical reports might be subpoenaed. On 5 June the offender commenced action in this Court for administration of the will. 
     
      
    28 On 13 August 2006 Ms Jenning emailed a friend seeking information on news items current on the 18th and 19th of the previous March so that she could give evidence as to what she and the deceased “would have” spoken about. She was supplied with the means of obtaining that information. On 6 September there was a phone call between Ms Jenning and the offender concerning these news items. The offender gave evidence that this was part of an attempt by Ms Jenning, to which she was a party, to fabricate evidence for use in the proceedings in this Court about the March will. Two days after the phone call Ms Jenning drafted a letter to a solicitor indicating that she had spoken to the deceased shortly before his death about various items of news that were current at the time. 
     
      
    29 Both the offender and Ms Jenning were interviewed by police and denied any knowledge or involvement in the circumstances leading to the death of the deceased. This was the stance that they both took at the start of the trial. 
     
      
    30 The trial of the offender and Ms Jenning was apparently seen by some members of the community as a test case about the morality of euthanasia or the right of a person to take his or her own life. It was no such thing. As I explained to the jury, the issue in the trial concerned the right of the deceased to make the decision for himself and not have it made by someone on his behalf. If the deceased had the capacity to make an informed decision to take his own life, then it was his act and the offender was guilty only of assisting him. But if he did not have that capacity, then it was the act of the offender that intentionally took his life regardless of whether he would himself have made the same decision. The law holds human life so sacred that a person cannot give some other person permission to take his or her life. 
     
      
    31 The law of this State is clear. It is a criminal offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years to aid or assist a suicide. This offence was created when Parliament repealed the offence of suicide. It is for Parliament to change the law. Persons in the community, who choose to disobey the law, do so at the peril of being treated as a criminal and punished accordingly. As the evidence finally emerged, and as the offender’s plea to the charge of aiding suicide indicated, both the offender and Ms Jenning had been engaged in serious criminal activity leading to the death of the deceased. This included the importation by Ms Jenning of a banned substance into Australia and the offender’s involvement in that crime. The only real issue for the jury to decide was what offence the two had committed in bringing about the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    32 Although Ms Jenning was charged as being an accessory to the actions of the offender, to a significant extent she was more criminally liable for the death of the deceased. It is one of those, perhaps rare, cases where an accessory would have deserved greater punishment than the principal. Ms Jenning has been portrayed in some of the media as a person who was unjustifiably mistreated by the police and prosecution. It seems that her daughter thought this to be the case. But there is simply no basis for such an allegation from any of the material placed before the jury at the trial. The evidence of her guilt in respect of the importation of the drug and her assistance and encouragement in the death of the deceased was overwhelming. 
     
      
    33 Had she been half honest with those representing her Ms Jenning could possibly have avoided the strain of a criminal trial. Yet she persistently lied throughout the investigation of the matter and during the course of the trial. From what I saw and heard she was, so far as the death of Mr Wylie was concerned, a manipulative and thoroughly dishonest woman who had no compunction about her conduct even to the extent of fabricating evidence to be used in this Court in the contest over the will. She refused at any time to accept any responsibility, either legally or morally, for the death of the deceased. She was a highly intelligent woman yet maintained apparently to the end that she had not assisted in the death of the deceased because she did not hand him the poison. 
     
      
    34 I make these comments not by way of speaking ill of the dead, but because it is important to consider Ms Jenning’s character and conduct when determining the criminality of the offender and contrasting their behaviour at the trial. They were in a joint criminal enterprise to bring about the death of the deceased. But despite being charged as the principal, the offender was not the moving force behind the events leading to his death after the rejection of the Dignitas application. I have no doubt that the Mexican option was Ms Jenning’s idea, to some extent motivated by her desire to obtain the drug for herself, even though she swore to the jury that she had purchased only one bottle. I cannot help but think that Ms Jenning’s motivation in assisting in the obtaining of the Nembutal was not merely altruistic. 
     
      
    35 On the other hand I believe that the offender was motivated in her actions because she believed that this what the deceased wanted. In part it was a reaction to the relationship that had existed between her and the deceased for most of their life together. The deceased had always got his way and he and Ms Jenning were the dominant forces in the relationship between the three. I believe that Ms Jenning retained her dominant position even when the deceased declined in health and mental capacity. It was she who organised the circumstances surrounding the killing and she who came up with the explanation for the death based upon the drug Aricept. It is clear from the taped conversation between the two that Ms Jenning was the moving force in their attempts to manufacture evidence. 
     
      
    36 I believe that, in the weeks preceding his death, the deceased was completely vulnerable and, to a very substantial degree, reliant upon the offender in a way foreign to their previous relationship. It was in the changed dynamics between the two that the offender raised the issue of her position after his death in relation to the house. I believe it was the offender’s idea that the will should be changed to put her in an unassailable position after his death. In evidence she expressed the belief that she was entitled to stay in the house because it had been, in effect, their matrimonial home for almost 20 years.  
     
      
    37 However I do not find that the offender was motivated in bringing about the deceased’s death by financial gain. The relevance of her conduct surrounding the changing of the will is that it shows the degree of preparation and planning that she undertook. It also reveals the extent to which the deceased’s mental state had been diminished and his personality altered. 
     
      
    38 It is clear to me that as part of the planning for the death of the deceased the offender went out of her way to isolate him from anybody who might interfere in her plans. I do not accept the offender’s account that this was all at the behest of the deceased. In any event, at least after he was released from hospital, the deceased did not have the capacity to make such decisions. Rather the offender embarked upon a course of deception. She misled persons such as Ms Favretto by failing to disclose relevant facts. She was prepared to rely upon the irresponsibility of Dr Gupta to get what reports she needed. 
     
      
    39 It is perhaps not unusual for a person to go about his or her unlawful conduct in secret to avoid being frustrated in achieving the criminal purpose. But of concern in the facts of this case is the offender’s treatment of the deceased’s daughters. They had a powerful interest in what was done to their father. It seems that the offender, unjustifiably, blamed Tania for the failure of the Dignitas application. There was further some friction between the daughters and the offender because, rightly or wrongly, they did not believe that the deceased was getting adequate support and assistance. The result was that neither of the daughters was informed that her father was in hospital following the second suicide attempt for some days after his admission. Given the deceased’s mental state at that time it was no excuse to say that their father did not want them told, even if I accepted that explanation. 
     
      
    40 The offender and Ms Jenning planned over some months to bring about the death of the deceased without revealing those plans to the daughters. This was selfish and cruel. The offender deprived them of the opportunity of saying good-bye to their father and of preparing themselves for his death. This aspect of grieving is not uncommon in cases of sudden death through accident or criminal conduct. But this was not a case of sudden death and I have no doubt that the offender intentionally sought to distance the deceased from what she saw as interfering conduct of the daughters who were genuinely concerned for his welfare. The offender could have had no doubt of their love for him. 
     
      
    41 The jury could have come to its verdict of manslaughter in one of two ways: either (a) because a reasonable person would have known that the deceased lacked capacity to make the decision to take his own life, or (b) a reasonable person would have made inquiries to ensure that he had that capacity before providing him with a poison. It may not matter in assessing the offender’s criminality to determine what the jury found. However, it is instructive that the jury reached the view that Ms Jenning knew that the deceased lacked capacity. That finding might on first blush seem inconsistent with their finding in respect of the offender’s mental state. But the difference can be explained in that Ms Jenning was more objective in her assessment of the deceased than the offender in the last weeks of his life. There was evidence before the jury that a carer might less readily appreciate the deterioration in a person’s mental state. The jury asked a question about this piece of evidence. I believe that the jury concluded that a reasonable person in the offender’s position would have realized that shortly before his death the deceased lacked the capacity to make a decision to end his life as Ms Jenning did. 
     
      
    42 One of the principal factors in sentencing for manslaughter is the need to denunciate the unlawful taking of human life whatever the circumstances of the death. Yet those circumstances can vary so dramatically that the whole range of sentences are available to a court sentencing for that offence, notwithstanding that the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. Manslaughter by gross criminal negligence is a rare type of manslaughter usually seen only in motor manslaughter cases. The circumstances of this particular manslaughter are unique and, therefore, little assistance can be gained from sentences imposed for other offences. It is also very rare to have a case of aiding suicide before a court. Therefore there is no assistance to be gained from sentences imposed for that offence, which, as I have already indicated, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The court therefore must approach the sentencing of the offender relying upon basic sentencing principles. 
     
      
    43 As I have said, denunciation is an important consideration especially where, as here, the taking of life was the intended result of the offender’s carefully planned and deceptive conduct carried out over a number of months. In this case general deterrence is a very significant matter. Normally members of the public would appreciate what conduct is criminal and understand that if the offender is detected he or she will be punished. But in this case there appears to be an attitude which found its expression in some of the media coverage of the trial and its aftermath that somehow the conduct of the offender and Ms Jennings was justifiable or at least of a different moral order than other criminal conduct that results in the loss of life. 
     
      
    44 The sentencing of the offender must make it clear that this is not so. The calculated and unlawful taking of human life is an affront to every aspect of civilized society. The general stance taken in this community is that the imposition of the death penalty upon criminals is unjustifiable and morally repellent such is the accord given to the sanctity of human life. There are very stringent limits imposed by the law upon the taking of life even in justifiable defence of the person. Heavy sentences are imposed upon persons guilty of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence. As Coldrey J of the Victorian Supreme Court pointed out, the offence of aiding and abetting suicide exists not only in recognition of the community’s regard for human life but also for the protection of persons who are vulnerable because of advanced age, pain or emotional distress: R v Hood [2002] VSC 123 at [32]. 
     
      
    45 The New Zealand Court of Appeal has stated; 
     
      
       
        
         
        “A just and humane society expects accountability for the deliberate taking or attempted taking of human life. The issue is not one of private arrangement, but community values”:  
        R Martin 
         (unreported 14 February 2005) at [166]. 
        
       
      
    46 Of course there are extremely sad cases of offences committed by persons pushed beyond endurance by concern for a loved one in never-ending pain and suffering without hope of remedy. In those circumstances the court can take a very merciful view of the criminal conduct especially when it occurs without significant planning. Such a set of facts would give rise to an offence on the lower end of the spectrum for crimes of assisting a suicide or otherwise aiding a person who professed a wish to die. But this was not such a case. On the other hand it is not at the upper limit of seriousness such as where the offender operated a commercial enterprise in assisting the deaths of members of the community for gain. But in my view it was of such seriousness that even had the offender been convicted of an offence contrary to s 31(C)(1) of the Crimes Act a gaol penalty would have been the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    47 Manslaughter is of course a more serious offence than aiding suicide. It was the offender’s act that resulted in his death. The offence is aggravated by the degree of planning involved. There was a late acceptance by the offender of involvement in the death that indicates some acknowledgement of responsibility, both morally and criminally. However, I doubt that she really accepts the grave criminality of what she did. Her conduct after the killing shows that the offender knew that what she had done was unlawful. The pre-sentence report indicates that the offender still believes she acted appropriately in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. Perhaps having heard the victim impact statements of the two daughters, the offender now appreciates the effect of her act on others who loved the deceased and had a right to be involved in any decision made about his future. The fact that the two sisters have a more benevolent view of her conduct is beside the point. 
     
      
    48 I have been referred to a number of sentencing decisions concerned with aiding suicide or, what have been described, as mercy killings. They do indicate that gaol penalties have been imposed for such conduct to emphasis the seriousness of taking another life and in order to deter others from taking a similar course. Otherwise they do not offer any assistance because this Court can have little regard to the sentences imposed in foreign jurisdictions where there are different statutory regimes, differing maximum penalties prescribed and where different tariffs have been developed. 
     
      
    49 The offender is aged 60. She has no prior convictions of any type and can be considered as a person of good character and repute in the community. She has for some years been actively employed in bush regeneration work for the National Trust. She has been described as reliable and trustworthy with little interest in monetary reward. She was highly regarded by the deceased’s sisters and they have written in support of her. 
     
      
    50 The probation officer preparing the pre-sentence report wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The offender] presented as a woman with a strong resolve to honour the wishes of others. It would appear that [the offender] has been surrounded by personalities that have been overt in promoting their needs and consequently has put her own sensibilities aside to abide with what may have ostensibly been conflicting propositions. In doing so she has not realised the ensuing ramifications. Her commitment to her partner appears to be undeniable and her grief for him remains unresolved. [The offender] did not present with any issues that would benefit from any particular intervention. 
        
       
      
    51 I believe that generally the offender was caring and supportive of the deceased and compliant to his wishes. There is little doubt that he was genuine in seeking death through the Dignitas application. But, as I explained to the jury, the Crown’s case was that the window of opportunity when the deceased could make a decision about that matter closed shortly after the application was rejected and certainly by the time he was admitted to hospital after the second suicide attempt. In effect the offender failed to ascertain, as she ought to have done, that the situation had changed by the time she prepared to bring about his death. 
     
      
    52 As a result of the death of the deceased, action was taken by the daughters in this Court to stop probate being granted of the will made shortly before his death. The offender no longer seeks to have probate granted of that will but rather intends to seek the leave of the Court to benefit under the provisions of the 1995 will. This really seems to be bowing to the inevitable, having regard to the circumstances surrounding the later will and the evidence of the offender in the trial as to the deceased’s lack of capacity at that time. Yet she told the probation officer that the action of the daughters in commencing these proceedings shocked her. If this is true, the offender has no understanding of the reality of the situation caused by the changing of the earlier will so close to the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    53 It was submitted that the offender has suffered severe extra-curial punishment. I fail to see it. Any financial loss she suffers is largely a result of her conduct in inducing the deceased to make the later will when it was at least highly doubtful that he had testamentary capacity and then becoming involved in Ms Jenning’s machinations in attempting to manufacture evidence. In any event she may yet inherit under the earlier will in the unusual circumstances of this killing. 
     
      
    54 There is obviously no need for the Court to impose punishment to deter the offender from further offending notwithstanding that I am of the view that either she does not consider her actions to be seriously criminal or else she believes that what she did was justified. But I have already indicated that general deterrence is of very significant importance in this case even though the facts are unique in this jurisdiction: see R v Nekuda (1989) 39 A Crim R 5. Notwithstanding the offender’s good character and the unusual circumstances of the offending, I am unpersuaded by the able submissions of Mr Bodor SC that in her case the mere conviction of an offence of manslaughter alone carries sufficient general deterrence. I believe that many in the community would see such a conviction in the circumstances of this case as a badge of honour rather than a mark of the community’s disapproval. 
     
      
    55 Although there are exceptional cases of manslaughter where the court can appropriately determine that a sentence other than imprisonment can be imposed, this is not in my view one of them. This is chiefly because of the considerable amount of planning involved in bringing about the deceased’s death over a not insignificant period of time, including, as it did, the offender sponsoring Ms Jenning’s trip to Mexico to import the drug illegally into this country. I am permitted to take into account, when determining the seriousness of the offending, other criminal activity that was involved in the commission of the offence charged, even if that criminal activity is not itself the subject of a charge: see R v Garforth (NSWCCA, unreported, 23 May 1994). This was a planned killing and as part of that planning was the obtaining of the drug. It does not seem to me to matter, in that regard, that the basis of manslaughter was an omission to appreciate the deceased’s mental capacity. 
     
      
    56 Of course it is one thing to assist a person to travel to a country where his death can be brought about legally but it is quite another to illegally bring into this country the means of unlawfully aiding his death. The offender and Ms Jenning must have understood this fact, if not the seriousness of what they were doing. The gravity of the offender’s negligence was high because, as a result of what she did, death was inevitable.  
     
      
    57 I am satisfied that the purposes of punishment require that nothing less than a sentence of imprisonment be imposed upon the offender. Because of the motivation with which she acted, I am prepared to impose a sentence at, what I consider to be, the very bottom of the range for a negligent yet premeditated manslaughter. I also take into account that to a very significant degree Ms Jenning, a stronger and dominant character, persuaded her to this course. Because of the offender’s prior good character and as individual deterrence is not a consideration in this case, it is appropriate to grant her a significant degree of leniency and permit that sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. I accept that a sentence of imprisonment, even if served by way of periodic detention, is in this case a suitable means of making it clear to the community the serious criminality of the offending yet ameliorates the harshness of imposing full-time custody on a person such as the offender. 
     
      
    58 There are in my view no special circumstances to warrant a reduction in the non-parole period. The offender’s personal situation has been taken into account by me in reducing the sentence and does not warrant a further reduction to the non-parole period. There is no requirement for the offender to have any lengthy period of supervision. I considered whether this was a suitable case for the imposition of a fixed term but concluded that such a sentence would not sufficiently denounce the offence. There is of course no discount even though the offender did plead guilty to aiding suicide, as the plea had little or no utilitarian value. 
     
      
    59 The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 22 months with a balance of term of 8 months. The sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. The sentence is to be served at the Tomago Periodic Detention Centre and is to commence on 21 November 2008. The offender is to be released to parole on 20 September 2010.

      PRELIMINARY DECISION 
       
       
      [2008] NSWIRComm 1119 
     1 Mr Joris Zonneveld was employed as a registered nurse by the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service. He was employed in the Wollongong Hospital. His services were terminated on Monday, 19 May, 2008 after nineteen years of employment over allegations of inappropriate behaviour with a patient, which he denies but over which at the present time there are unresolved criminal charges. He subsequently lodged an application under Part 6, Unfair Dismissals, of Chapter 2, Employment [Ss.83 to 90] of the 1996 Industrial Relations Act, primarily seeking his reinstatement. 2 The matter was allocated to me and I set it down for a preliminary hearing on Monday, 22 September, 2008 (in the Commission's premises at 90 Crown Street, Wollongong) and adjourned it for hearing on a preliminary issue on Friday, 31 October, 2008. Mr Zonneveld's Part 6 application was lodged on Tuesday, 26 August, 2008, ie substantially outside the 21 day time limit prescribed by S.85(1) and the SESIAHS has opposed Mr Zonneveld's Part 6 application on that basis. In the proceedings on Friday, 31 October, 2008, Mr Sherley represented Mr Zonneveld and Ms Hellams represented the SESIAHS.3 S.85(1) provides as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         
        ""Any application under this Part must be made not later than 21 days after the dismissal."" 
         
         
        
       
      Nevertheless, under S.85(3) members of the Commission hold a discretion to accept an out-of-time Part 6 application if they consider that there is sufficient reasons for doing so. In determining whether there is sufficient reason to hear an out-of-time Part 6 application, S.85(3) directs me to have regard to a number of specific matters: (i) the reason for, and the length of, the delay, (ii) any hardship that may be caused to the applicant if the claim is denied or the employer if it progressed and (iii) the conduct of the employer. All relevant considerations should be taken into account in determining whether to grant an application to proceed out-of-time [ 
      Brady 
       v.  
      Kennedy, trading as 'Sardines' 
       (1999) 91 IR 258]. 
      4 Mr Zonneveld has given essentially two reasons for his delay in lodging his Part 6 application, viz: 
      
       
        
        (i) that he was not aware of the time limit imposed for Part 6 applications; and 
         
         
        (ii) that he, and his legal representatives, had been concentrating on the criminal charges laid against him. 
         
        
       
     5 Mr Zonneveld is a member of the New South Wales Nurses Association. He approached the Nurses Association which at first represented him in negotiations with the SESIAH and, according to Ms Hellams, initially indicated its intention to pursue a claim for Mr Zonneveld's reinstatement. It did not do so, however, and Mr Zonneveld asserted that it ultimately declined to assist him. He only obtained legal advice concerning the Part 6 application from his current legal representatives concerning his position on Tuesday, 19 August, 2008. His legal representatives lodged a Part 6 application seven days later. So the delay in this case is essentially for the period from his dismissal on Monday, 19 May, 2008 to Tuesday, 19 August, 2008. 6 Ordinarily, where the incident or incidents from which an employee was dismissed also involve criminal proceedings against him, any Part 6 application would be delayed to await the outcome of those criminal proceedings. There are a number of reasons why such a delay of Part 6 proceedings is appropriate. For one thing, the standard of proof before the Commission is the civil standard of the balance of probability and not the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt [Coles Myer Limited v. Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association (1989) 27 IR 299 at pp.303 and 304]. If a dismissed employee proceeded under Part 6 prior to his criminal prosecution, he may, in fact, have his guilt determined on the less onerous civil standard. Furthermore, there would be considerable logistical difficulties for a Part 6 applicant in properly advancing a case, with the criminal proceedings hanging over his head. He would have a right of silence - a right to refuse to answer any questions in the Part 6 hearing which may serve to incriminate him [Pyneboard v. Trade Practices Commission (1983) 152 CLR 328] - but the question remains whether, in the light of his right to remain silent, he would be in a position to present proper argument in his own behalf. 7 Nevertheless, it is customary that employees facing criminal charges arising out of the circumstances surrounding their dismissal to still immediately lodge a Part 6 application but seek adjournment of the matter to await the resolution of any criminal proceedings. The fact remains that in this case from Monday, 19 May, 2008, when Mr Zonneveld was dismissed to Tuesday, 26 August, 2008 when the Part 6 application was finally lodged on his behalf the SESIAH would have been entitled to form the view that Mr Zonneveld was no longer contemplating a claim for his reinstatement or any other remedy under Part 6. 8 The prospects of ultimate success for a Part 6 applicant is also a factor which may be taken into account in any determination of a member of the Commission under S.85(3) to admit an out-of-time Part 6 application. The Full Bench of the Commission (Wright J - President, Walton J - Vice President and McKenna C) in Hurrell v. Queensland Cotton Corporation Limited (2003) 125 IR 145 commented in that respect (at pp.151 and 152) as follows: 
      
       
        
        ""...In cases where the acceptance of a late application is determined as a preliminary issue, it may be appropriate to consider whether the applicant has an arguable case and the applicant's prospect of success. While it is inappropriate effectively to decide the substantive issue in interlocutory proceedings, whether there is an arguable case and the parties' prospects of success are matters appropriately considered in determining whether a 'sufficient reason' has been established to accept an application out of time. This is particularly so, given the subject matter of an application for relief against an allegedly unfair dismissal, and the recognition that a refusal to extend time would finally determine the proceedings and prevent the hearing of such an application on its merits. 
         
         
        Indeed, it has been held that a consideration of the prospects of success may be a necessary, although not determinative, consideration in the exercise of discretion... Moreover, the parties should be given an opportunity to address on any such prospects, where they arise as relevant discretionary consideration:  
        Sebastian 
         v.  
        Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales 
         (1995) 62 IR 190 at pp.193 to 194. It should be emphasized, however, that any assessment of an arguable case or an applicant's prospects of success, will, of necessity be made in the absence of all the relevant evidence and, as such, can be only preliminary in nature..."" 
         
         
        
       
      And in my unreported decision of Monday, 8 October, 2001 in  
      Waine 
       v.  
      BHP Steel 
       [Matter No.IRC 3138 of 2001] I also commented on an out-of-time Part 6 application (at p.4) that: 
      
      
       
        
        ""…whilst it is not specifically referred to in S.85(3), it seems to me that one of the factors which I must take into account in determining whether or not to exercise my discretion and admit an out of time Part 6 application, is the prospect of such a Part 6 application ultimately succeeding if it is considered on its merits. That is a common approach by courts and tribunals [ 
        Burns 
         v.  
        Grigg 
         (1967) VR 871 at p.872 and  
        Mitchelson 
         v.  
        Mitchelson 
         (1979) 24 ALR 522 at p.524]. Essentially, if an out of time Part 6 applicant is unlikely to succeed, it goes without saying that to refuse his claim will not, in fact, constitute the type of hardship to the dismissed employee referred to in S.85(3). It would do nothing more than delay the inevitable and (avoid) considerable cost and inconvenience to both parties…"" 
         
         
        
       
      In this case, Mr Zonneveld's Part 6 application centres on the incident out of which the criminal charges against him have been laid. Mr  
      Sherley 
       has suggested that he expects a no bill for those criminal charges against Mr Zonneveld but there must at this stage still be a level of speculation concerning the criminal proceedings and consequently it is not something on which I may rely in determining this issue on the out-of-time Part 6 application. 
     9 The rights of employees to pursue claims for unfair dismissal, and the 21 day time limit for such claims, have been a feature of the industrial landscape for at least seventeen years. I would therefore expect that by this time the general nature of the unfair dismissal regime would be common knowledge. But the legal maxim ignorantia juris quod quisque scire tenetur non excusat (ie ignorance is no defence) has not been accepted as a factor in the Part 6 jurisdiction [Hurrell v. Queensland Cotton Corporation Limited (at p.148). 10 That having been said, I would still regard, as the prima facie position, that Part 6 applicants be obliged to follow the 21 day time limit prescribed by S.85(1): it is a clear instruction of the legislature that such a time limit be imposed and to depart from it there must be some material upon which to exercise the discretion in favour of an out-of-time Part 6 applicant [Skelly v. Prouds Jewellers Pty Limited (1994) 53 IR 3 at p.5]. Otherwise the time limit in S.85(1) would be meaningless. But, as I see the position, in exercising my discretion under S.85(3) it is a question of determining where the balance of convenience lays: whether a late applicant employee should be denied a remedy or the respondent employer be put to any inconvenience which may arise for him from a late application [Griffith Ex-Services Club Limited v. Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees’ Union of Australia (1993) 51 IR 186 at p.191]. In Parker v. Capitol Painters Pty Limited (1996) 68 IR 100 I stated (at p.101) that: 
      
       
        
        ""…in my view, it is not appropriate to adopt a restrictive approach in exercising my discretion under S.85(3). It is a question of balancing the competing interests of (the applicant) and (the respondent)…"" 
        
       
     11 I believe the balance of convenience favours Mr Zonneveld in this case and, notwithstanding the very lengthy delay in a Part 6 application being lodged on his behalf, I should permit his Part 6 application to proceed. He would certainly be prejudiced if his Part 6 application was aborted without his being given the opportunity to present his case (and ahead of the resolution of the criminal charges against him with respect to which he claims innocence and which appears to be the sole reason for his dismissal). The SESIAHS was initially made aware from the Nurses Association that it would be pursuing a claim for his reinstatement, albeit that it did not proceed at that time and I see no difficulties for it if Mr Zonneveld's Part 6 application is now permitted to go forward.12 In those circumstances, I propose to exercise my discretion under S.85(3) in favour of Mr Zonneveld's Part 6 application and permit it to go forward. I will set this matter down for a further mention on Monday, 1 December, 2008 (in Wollongong) for a mention and further programming of the matter.P J CONNORCommissioner

   JUDGMENT1. Equal access to justice will only occur when courts are able to make sentencing dispositions without needing to have regard to whether the relevant resources are available in the district to give effect to the orders a judge would make. Judges sentencing in regional and remote centres are continually reminded that the programs, this program or that sentencing outcome is not available in the region the court is serving because of an absence of resources in regional New South Wales. Frequently it is periodic detention that is not available.2. In Newcastle, access to the compulsory drug program is not available. For that reason, Nathanial Robert Young is denied equal access to justice, because I am unable to order him into a compulsory drug program, the sentencing outcome I would have seriously considered. Novocastrians are also losing because offenders with well-established drug addictions are being released back into this community without access to drug rehabilitation programs as effective as the compulsory drug programs or other programs run by the Drug Court. Those working in the administration of criminal justice in the Newcastle area would have a better idea than I as to the amount of crime in this region that is drug related, but I would be surprised, if it was not substantial.3. In the absence of closely monitored and effective drug rehabilitation programs, offenders with high to moderate risk of recidivism, such as this offender, are far more vulnerable to re-offending as they become desperate upon release, or shortly after release, for money for drug purchases. Nathaniel Young’s case illustrates the disadvantage to him and those regional centres when it comes to being sentenced at Newcastle.4. On 28 May 2008 Young pleaded guilty to an aggravated break, enter and steal offence in Tudor Street, Hamilton. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal acts. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for this offence, before this court, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community (see R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]). My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from evidence before the court relating to both the offence and to the offender.5. The facts that have been tendered as allegations being made by the Crown do not appear to be in dispute. They constitute the major material before the Court on what happened in the victim’s home. While the offender gave his recall of events, his recall is patchy. He does, however, explain his motivation was to obtain money for drugs. Before any sentence can be made, there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discount, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period and, if so, the length of the parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of those matters can be determined until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, will also need to be determined (see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740).6. On 17 March 2006, at Hamilton, Nathaniel Young broke into the dwelling house of Trage Trajanovski and, while in the house, committed a serious indictable offence that was larceny, but that was committed in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he used corporal violence on Bogoja Trajanovski and Trage Trajanovski. Bogoja Trajanovski is aged seventy-seven years. He was residing at the time of the offence in his home in Tudor Street, Hamilton with his son Trage, aged fifty, a daughter-in-law, Scojna, aged forty-one, and four grandchildren.7. At about 10pm on St Patrick’s night, 17 March 2006, he got up from bed to go to the toilet. As he returned he noticed this offender looking through his bedside drawers. Initially he thought it was one of his grandsons looking for Panadol. He said “The tablets are not in that drawer, they’re over here”. This offender said “Money”. The offender then moved to the bedroom window and commenced to climb out. Mr Trajanovski realised it was a burglar and took hold of his arm. The noise must have awakened others. His son Trage and daughter-in-law Scojna came to assist. Young threw a number of punches at the older man, yelling out, “I’ve got a gun”. I am satisfied he did not have a gun but simply called those words out with a view to instilling fear into Bogoja Trajanovski in the hope that he, the accused, would be released. 8. Meanwhile the son went outside to confront the offender and Scojna took hold of the offender’s leg. The offender’s leg was, of course, inside the window frame. Scojna then closed the window onto the offender’s leg. The offender, as he struggled, smashed the window and pulled his leg through. As he did so, one of his shoes and socks came off and fell into the room. The son, Trage, who was outside the window grabbed the offender in a bear hug. The two wrestled on the ground. The offender attempted to bite Trage on the head. Trage, in turn, punched the offender in the groin several times. The offender threw punches at Trage. Trage Trajanovski picked up a garden stake and struck the offender to the forehead. The offender ran from the scene.9. A neighbour, who is a doctor, arrived at the scene and attended to the victim Bogoja Trajanovski, who had suffered severe abrasions to one of his arms. An ambulance was called and he was taken to the John Hunter Hospital. He had suffered severe lacerations and contusions to his forearm, which the hospital described as de-gloving injuries, exposing the bones on his left hand. The wound was treated using steri-strips and dressings.10. Police located an orange shirt some distance from the crime scene. It was a shirt that the offender had earlier been wearing, and a blood swab from a rear fence of 105 Chatham Road, Broadmeadow. The offender’s DNA matched the DNA recovered from both of those items.11. Mr Trajanovski senior noticed a flip-over cardholder containing a hundred and eighty dollars had been stolen by Young. Also missing were various personal cards, such as Medicare, pension and chemist cards, and Omega watch. A Samsung mobile phone had also been stolen by the intruder. None of the property had been recovered.12. When spoken to at Grafton, the offender consented to providing DNA samples. DNA comparison from the items found earlier mentioned at the crime scene pointed to the offender’s involvement.Objective Criminality 13. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of this criminal behaviour. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence is evaluated. Not surprisingly, the objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.14. The criminal justice system places great store upon the sanctity of a person’s home. For example, police and other government authorities must seek a court’s permission in the normal course of events before they enter even the most humble person’s abode. 15. Any analysis of sections 112 and 113 of the Crimes Act dealing with offences where breaking and entering is an essential element would yield the inescapable fact that those sections focus upon the crime of breaking and entering the personal space of an occupant as one aspect of the two-pronged crime. The second aspect in this case is the larceny committed.16. If a person breaks and enters a dwelling, that person is liable to a maximum penalty of ten years. If a person commits a larceny, he is liable, on indictment, to a maximum penalty of five years. In this case the larceny would have been dealt with in the Local Court and it would have been two years’ maximum penalty. But if he breaks and enters a dwelling and commits the larceny, the maximum penalty escalates to fourteen years. Whereas in this case there is an aggravation by the use of corporal violence, that maximum penalty increases yet again to twenty years. In this case there are circumstances, namely the use of corporal violence, that is bodily violence to the victims by this offender, that increased that maximum penalty, as I say, to one of twenty years. Thus, not only has there been an offence aimed at property of the victim, but, in the circumstances of this case, offending also was against the person by way of serious bodily assault. 17. I have already referred to the de-gloving nature of the injury. It would seem, although I may stand to be corrected, that Mr Bogoja Trajanovski did not have to remain at the hospital overnight. Nonetheless, his injury did require medical attention. It is possible these injuries occurred as a consequence of the struggle near broken glass. I am not satisfied the injuries were intentionally inflicted, but it is likely that during the struggle the offender may have foreseen the possibility of injury and continued his struggle reckless as to whether the injury occurred.18. I noted during submissions that the conduct of the residents of the house, in seeking to secure the offender, was lawful. I am satisfied they were seeking to restrain him in the course of committing a serious indictable offence, for the purposes of arresting him and also for the purposes of reclaiming from him any property stolen from the home. The corporal violence occurred at a time when the offender was seeking to make his escape with stolen property. The initial contact was not initiated by him but by Mr Bogoja Trajanovski. The violence occurring in those circumstances does not have the same level of criminality as violence administered trying to break into or in the course of seeking to commit another offence such as stealing. This violence occurs after the stealing, that is after the asportation of the stolen goods had commenced, asportation the carrying away of the stolen goods. It occurred in those circumstances other than for the purpose of obtaining access to the goods to steal them. 19. The offender’s case is he entered the home for the purpose of obtaining drug money, that is money for drugs. An Omega watch and a mobile phone were also taken. Items such as watches are frequently gifts from loved ones with sentimental attachments for the owner. Mobile phones these days contain much personal information in respect of contact and stored SMS text. The taking of mobile phones has the potential for a serious invasion into the owner’s privacy. 20. In Ponfield’s (1999) 48 NSWLR [327] case the Court of Criminal Appeal promulgated a guideline stipulating a number of matters, eleven of them, that aggravated the seriousness of a break and enter offence. Of course, the corporal violence is an automatic aggravation contained within the nature of the offence itself. But the first of the aggravating features in Ponfield’s case is one that notices, or applies to, offences committed whilst an offender is on conditional liberty, being either bail or parole. That applies in this case. This offender had been given bail a week before this offence and had been released from custody the night before, or the day before this offence. Section 21A(2)(j) mandates the commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty aggravates the objective seriousness of that offence. 21. The second feature of aggravation in Ponfield’s case relates to the question of whether the offence was professionally planned, organised and the way in which it was executed. I am satisfied the offence was not planned or organised with others, however, this offender has a substantial history of break and enters. There are twenty-nine such offences on his fingerprint record. There are other break and enters on his non-fingerprint record. Whether they are in addition to the twenty-nine already counted or not I am unable to determine. The point is that this offender clearly had skills and expertise in breaking and entering. It is likely his execution was skilfully accomplished on this occasion. His entry into the house was unannounced and appears to have been unnoticed. He was disturbed by the victim returning to his bedroom, probably or possibly from a nocturnal visit to the toilet. At that stage he had been inside the premises long enough to steal a wallet with a hundred and eighty dollars, a watch and a mobile phone without disturbing anyone. Indeed it was he who was disturbed by the return of the unsuspecting victim.22. The next feature of aggravation of some relevance is the offender having a prior record for particularly like offences. I have mentioned already that there are twenty-nine such offences on his record and, indeed, I should note that the parole that he was just released to was a parole for a similar offence.23. Next, the offence is committed at the premises of the elderly, the sick or the disabled. Although Mr Trajanovski was seventy-seven years old, he was surrounded by family. When first entering his bedroom he thought the accused was a grandson. That suggests that his grandson is a fully developed young man. Mr Bogoja Trajanovski’s own son was aged fifty, he was also present. In those circumstances, I do not regard Mr Trajanovski as a vulnerable person. I am also satisfied the offender did not know the identity of those living in the premises. It is likely at least by the time the offender was grabbed by the victim, the elderly victim, he would have realised that victim was an elderly man.24. The next matter of aggravation is one of vandalism or other significant damage to the property. In the course of escaping, the window of the premises was broken. I am unable to say whether it was broken deliberately or not. It is likely that it was broken, and the offender, in his evidence, says it was broken, in the course of the struggle to flee. I would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to break it, I cannot be so satisfied and, therefore, cannot treat the breaking as an intended breaking. On the other hand, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was a consequence of his invasion into this house and, on that basis, I do regard it as aggravating the offence.25. The next matter of aggravation that I draw from Ponfield is the value of the stolen property to the victim. I have already mentioned that the money taken amounted to a hundred and eighty, cards and private documents were taken that would have needed to be replaced. I accept the watch may well have been of sentimental value. The mobile phone may well have contained material the victim wished to keep private and, indeed, may have been a phone of some value. Those matters are not clearly established in evidence.26. The last of the aggravating features in Ponfield was that the actual trauma suffered by the victim as a result of corporal violence of infliction of actual bodily harm is one that has been picked up since Ponfield in the changing of the offence into an aggravated form by parliament and, of course, that aggravation is reflected in the increased maximum penalty. Parliament has prescribed a standard non-parole period for this offence of five years should it fall within the mid range of seriousness for this type of offence. 27. In assessing whether this offence falls within a mid range of seriousness, I have noted that there does not appear to have been any damage caused in the actual entering, although I have noted the damage in the escaping from the premises. From the owner’s point of view that may well be academic, but the damage done to commit the intended offence, stealing, would, as I say, be regarded as the higher order of criminality because it is done maliciously and with intent to do further crime. The damage on this occasion arises from a struggle with a view to escape. Certainly it is criminal damage, but the malice is less.28. There is no suggestion the house was left in disarray or trashed or desecrated by the offender whilst about his criminal activity. Corporal violence was done, but only after the offender himself was grabbed when he was partway through the window. I have already indicated the corporal violence was criminal, but was not of the same high order that it would have been had it been done to capture the booty. I am conscious of remarks made by Simpson J in R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 in respect of the seriousness of corporal violence in these kinds of offences. Subject to what I have said above, I approach corporal violence in accordance with her Honour’s observations.29. I have regard to the property taken. Whilst I regard the value of the property as substantial, other break, enter and steals have resulted in far more property being taken. This offence, on its objective circumstances, falls below a mid range of seriousness.Subjective Circumstances30. This offender is now a twenty five year old Aboriginal male, raised by an aunt in the Newcastle region. As a young child he visited his mother occasionally in Redfern. She was a heroin addict. It appears he has had no significant contact with his father. His aunt’s house appears to have been a residential centre for other members of his extended family or of her extended family. He left Newcastle for Redfern at an age of fourteen but regards his aunt’s house as his home. His aunt and a brother/cousin, Michael Lombardi, appear to be the two most significant people in his life. He contacts them by phone regularly. Although not the country of his birth, he was brought up an Awabakal man. The home was at Windale. He has a sister, but I sense contact with her is more remote than with the other two significant persons.Education, Skills and Work Experience 31. Young attended Windale Public School and Gateshead High School, where he departed in year 8. He is basically illiterate and without numeracy skills. He says he plays rugby league well, in the position of fullback. This offender first entered juvenile custody aged sixteen. Between sixteen and nineteen he spent the majority of his time in juvenile custody. Since February 2002 until today he has been in and out of custody. On my calculation, in the six years and nine months since February 2002 he has spent five years and two months of it in custody.32. Much of his education would have been completed whilst in custody. He has qualified as a bricklayer. Currently he has started a course in Aboriginal art, but concedes he is not yet very skilful at it. Intellectually he presents as impoverished. He had difficulty in primary and high school academically. There were some disciplinary issues, but he does not appear to have been expelled. He has never been employed but thinks he could obtain work as a brickie or perhaps as a brickie’s labourer.General Health33. He is a young man of twenty five, he is of normal build, presently he is experiencing ongoing erectile dysfunction, which he thinks came about as an injury when he fell down a flight of stairs whilst in custody. He noticed this problem in April 2007. There is a report before me noting an acceptance by clinicians who have seen him that he is very distressed and upset about the consequences of this injury. It would not be surprising that a young man of twenty-five would be upset about impotency issues. His concern has been exacerbated by the response of those who are responsible for his health care. Although the problem is noted in April 2007, it is four months later, in August 2007, before he is seen by the urology department at the Prince of Wales. Whilst symptoms including scar tissue have been noticed by the clinicians, therapeutic procedures have not been undertaken, because it is desired to do more investigative procedures. 34. Although some investigative procedures have been recommended, they are, as yet, not pursued. They were to be scheduled by Corrective Services but have not yet happened. No doubt Young is understandably stressed by what appears to be, at least from his perspective, a lack of proper attention to his health issues between April 2007 and November 2008.Mental Health Issues35. In the course of assessing the reliability of tests administered by John W Taylor, a forensic psychologist retained by the defence, Mr Taylor made observation that Young was not introspective and not capable of developing significant insight with regard to functioning (his own). Mr Taylor thought that may have affected the reliability of his own assessment. My own view is the tests conducted by Mr Taylor present the best insight likely to be offered. 36. Mr Taylor, based upon the results, diagnosed the offender as having a personality disorder with some antisocial characteristics. He diagnosed cognitive impairment. Such tests as were completed indicated a mild intellectual handicap. Mr Taylor had allowed two hours for the tests, they were not all completed, which would suggest that the offender is also relatively slow. The mild intellectually handicapped would, of course, account for past school performance and the incapacity to develop insight in regard to his own functioning. My own sense of the offender is of a man with immaturity, concrete thinking patterns and no reflective thinking capacity.37. Mr Taylor diagnosed Young as having a drug abuse disorder. I will return to this topic shortly. Mr Taylor also diagnosed an emotional disorder, low self-esteem and anger internalised towards himself with feelings of guilt. The offender gave evidence “that he was tired of the life he led - he has been to five different gaols - the past few years everything’s hitting me - where my life is - not a night goes by I don’t think about what I’ve done”. The assessment by Mr Taylor disclosed a number of antisocial characteristics, including antisocial personality problems, conduct problems, criminal history, alcohol and drug abuse, antisocial associates, impulsivity and risk-taking behaviour. Not surprisingly, he was also diagnosed with a high-moderate risk of recidivism. Two out of three persons in this category re-offend within three years of release.38. Nathaniel Young’s best chances of achieving rehabilitation rests with a compulsory and well oversighted drug rehabilitation program, coupled with intensive vocational guidance assistance. Drugs and Alcohol39. The offender gave evidence he was abusing both cannabis and alcohol when aged nine. He was using heroin at age twelve. Initially he smoked it but, within nine months was injecting. He became a poly drug abuser including cocaine and amphetamines into the mix. He sought to do rehabilitation at The Glen, but someone came to The Glen distributing drugs. He took advantage of that and was kicked out. At the time of the offence he was on ICE. He says he was on ICE several days before the offence, but it cannot be so because he was in custody several days before the offence, but there was a period immediately before that custody where he had been at large, he claims it was during that period that he over-abused ICE and the withdrawal associated with that over-abuse was still ongoing at the time he was offending. He was either on drugs, or perhaps withdrawing, when he committed this offence.40. On two occasions he has tried to rehabilitate without success, I have referred to one being at The Glen. Presently he has been accepted into Benelong’s Haven rehabilitation program at Kempsey but has been placed on a waiting list. In the absence of compulsion, it would be unlikely he would complete the program. Nonetheless, his attempts at rehabilitation indicate a desire to rehabilitate, particularly when not in the community. Once released into the community it is likely his priorities would change.Character and Criminal History41. This offender is a young Aboriginal man of impoverished intellect who is a repetitive offender. Since adulthood he has spent something like only one day in five out of custody. His crime of choice is break, enter and steal. He was first before the Children’s Court for offences committed when he was fifteen. While this is not his first offence where physical violence has occurred, his offences of violence are in the minority on his record. On my review of his custodial record, apart from appeals from Local Court decisions, this is the offender’s first occasion where he has been dealt with in this Court upon indictment. While it needs to be understood, the science of predicting future conduct is still underdeveloped, it is more guesstimate than science. Nonetheless, six indicators, criminal tendency, antisocial personality problems, conduct problems, criminal history, alcohol and drug abuse and antisocial associates are scores from testing that are, in Mr Young’s case, elevated.42. In assessing issues related to the standard non-parole period, I note section 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is a factor which I must take into account. In accordance with authority, I do not regard it as increasing the objective criminality, but impacting so as to demand an absence of leniency when considered among the subjective features. On my calculation, this offence was committed when the offender was twenty two, approaching twenty three years at the time of the offence He has committed subsequent offences. The only relevance of those subsequent offences that I have attached to is in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation and in evaluating his immediate post-offence contrition. 43. While I accept Mr Taylor’s assessment of moderate high recidivism prognosis, there are a few favourable factors that should be considered. The offender is now contrite, he said so in court and to Mr Taylor. He told Mr Taylor “when I was younger I didn’t care --- now it’s starting to hit me and I can’t stop thinking about it --- I feel really sorry for the victims”. There have been efforts at drug rehabilitation. While they have been unsuccessful, going into rehabilitation centres is an important first step. While he does not have strong community support, he is not isolated. There are at least two significant persons in his life who may support him on release. There has been some positive conduct whilst in gaol, attending courses. Although modest, it is a start. He is still relatively young, his character may not yet be fully locked into those traits that have led him thus far into crime.Setting the Sentence/Deterrents44. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the Federal and State Parliaments. The chief purpose of those criminal laws put in place by parliament is to deter those tempted to breach the provisions of the criminal law. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties such as the twenty year maximum penalty for this offence and the five year standard non-parole period for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind those maximum penalties available and their deterrent purpose.45. There is also a specific deterrent aimed at individuals likeminded to this offender who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. Finally there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to targeting him and deterring him from re-offending. Given this offender’s intellectual impairment, concrete thinking and drug addiction, I am satisfied there needs to be an element of personal deterrence in the sentence I set.Standard Non-Parole Period?46. Because of the early plea, this need not be a matter attracting a standard non-parole period. On its objective circumstances I have found it falls below a mid-range offence. Nonetheless, on its objective features it does come close to reaching the bottom of that mid range. The subjective features do not lift the offence into a mid range. While I accept that this offence will not attract a standard non-parole period, because, on any view, it does not fall within the mid range of objective seriousness, I must, nonetheless, regard the standard non-parole period as a benchmark. It is, of course, a non-parole period that applies to mid range offences, consequently it will drive upwards sentences and non-parole periods that do not reach that mark.Special Circumstances 47. This is a case where a finding of special circumstances is appropriate. The youth of the offender at the time of offending (see R v Hearne (2007) 124 AcrR 457) and the sentence being imposed is partially cumulative upon a sentence already being served (see below).Custodial History Since Arrest48. This offender was serving a sentence of fifteen months’ imprisonment from 17 April 2007 with a non-parole period of eleven months for three counts of receiving. He escaped from that imprisonment on 4 November 2007 and was at liberty for twenty three days until recaptured on 27 November. The offender's existing sentence was determined as commencing on 17 April 2007 and expire on 7 August 2008, with the non-parole period expiring on 7 April 2008. He was then sentenced to imprisonment for an additional month commencing on 8 April 2008 and expiring on 7 May 2008 for the escape. He has remained in custody at the expiration of the 7 May sentence awaiting this matter to be finalised.Commencement Date of Sentence 49. I am satisfied the offender was always going to plead guilty to this offence once charged with it. The Crown case was strong. His DNA, or at least DNA consistent with being his, had been found on items associated with the burglar. The Crown argues for a commencement date to begin on 7 May, when the last sentence expired. The defence seek a starting date on 29 November 2007, when the offender was charged. I do not regard it as double counting to commence the sentence from a point in time when the offender was prepared to plead to it. It is not unusual to accumulate sentences from the expiration of a non-parole period. While it is true this offender was serving a balance of parole, partial concurrency of sentences for different matters is quite common. I intend to commence the sentence from 29 November 2008.Acknowledging the Plea of Guilty50. The offender pleaded guilty from the outset. I intend to give a twenty five percent discount upon the sentence I would otherwise have given (Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383).Totality51. I have kept in mind the issue of totality of sentencing with the sentences that were being served but have now expired. I have accommodated totality issues by commencing this sentence on 29 November 2008, that is before the sentences expired.Sentencing 52. But for the plea of guilty, I would have set an overall sentence for this offence of six years’ imprisonment. Discounting that by twenty five percent, which makes eighteen months, means that this prisoner will serve an overall sentence of four and a half years.53. Would you stand up please Mr Young.54. Nathanial Robert Young, you are convicted of the offence that you, on 17 March, at Hamilton, broke and entered the dwelling house of Trage Trajanovski situated in Tudor Street and, while you were in the dwelling house, committed a serious indictable offence, namely stealing, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you used corporal violence on Mr Bogoja Trajanovski and his son Trage Trajanovski. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years, to commence on 29 November 2007 and to expire on 28 May, on my calculation, 2010. I set a balance of term of two years, to expire on 28 May 2012.55. Just have a seat for a minute, make sure those figures are right, and, while that is being done, I want to explain this to you.56. I cannot order your release on this sentence because it is a sentence in excess of three years. Your release can only be ordered by the Parole Board. They will only order your release to parole if they are impressed with the progress that you have made while you are in prison. So, for the next two and a half years or so, it is probably not quite as long as two and a half years, you have to do all the courses you can and stay out of trouble if you can. You have to persuade the Parole Board that you should be released in two and a half years. You have a very difficult task in doing that because there is real concern that you may re-offend again, so you have to be able to persuade them you will not re-offend again. Do what you can about your drug addiction.

    3 FULLERTON J: On 20 April 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court at Campbelltown to a single count of break and enter with intent to commit the serious indictable offence of larceny in circumstances of aggravation, namely by inflicting actual bodily harm on the occupant of the home unit that was the subject of the break and enter, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 The offence attracts a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years, pursuant to Division 1 of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.5 On 24 August 2007 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 16 October 2006 and expiring on 15 July 2010, with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 16 July 2010 and expiring on 15 October 2011. The sentence was backdated to commence on 16 October 2006, the date the applicant was taken into custody. He remained in custody from that date pending sentence.  
     
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing judge erred in the account he gave to the applicant’s criminal record; and  
         
        2. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  
         
        
       
      
    The facts7 The applicant was sentenced on the basis of agreed facts which were reproduced in his Honour’s reasons for sentence. 
     
      
    8 On 16 October 2006, just after 7.30pm, the applicant was disturbed inside a wardrobe located in a bedroom of a home unit on the first floor of a unit block in Canley Vale by Mr Jovanovic, the occupier of the unit, who was at home with his wife and their son. Mr Jovanovic restrained the applicant with the assistance of his son, and was bitten on the arm whilst doing so. He consequently suffered bruising and broken skin. It was this assault with wounding that gave rise to the circumstances of aggravation as provided for in s 105A(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    9 The applicant apparently gained access to the unit by climbing onto the first floor balcony and slashing a sliding flyscreen door into the bedroom. At some stage after entering the unit he placed a chair against the bedroom door that led into other areas of the unit. Whilst in the bedroom he disturbed the contents of a wardrobe including papers and documents. On his arrest he was searched and $370 in cash, identified as belonging to Mr Jovanovic, was located.  
     
      
    10 The applicant told police that he was in the premises because he had come to see his friend Mohammed. The police officer also reported that the applicant was “behaving as though he was mentally impaired” when he was spoken to. The police did not report as to the applicant’s state of sobriety.  
     
      
    Subjective circumstances 
     
      
    11 At the time of the offence the applicant was 35 years of age. He had migrated to Australia from Vietnam in his early twenties having already completed his high school education and two years of a university course. After his arrival in Australia he studied English for a year before taking up work as a painter in a powder-coating plant. In 1999, at age 29, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has worked only intermittently since that time. He was living with his mother at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    His Honour’s findings for sentencing purposes 
     
      
    12 His Honour was satisfied that the plea of guilty on arraignment entitled the applicant to a discount of 20 per cent reflecting the utility of the plea and, that in his Honour’s view, it was “relatively early”. He was not satisfied that there was any other indication of contrition.  
     
      
    13 Despite the fact that the applicant claimed that he had been drinking alcohol on the day of the offence in his account to Dr Jonathan Carne, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, and that on his own assessment the amount he consumed may explain his lack of memory of anything on the day of the offence until arrested by police, his Honour was not satisfied that any alcohol consumed that day impacted adversely on the applicant’s capacity to appreciate what he was doing when he broke into the Jovanovic’s residence, or the potential consequences of his conduct. His Honour was also of the view that the use of the chair to try and block entry via the bedroom door indicated that the applicant appreciated the rational possibility that if there was no-one in the unit at the time he broke in, but they returned after he broke in, the chair would serve to both block their entry into the bedroom and perhaps enable him to make good his escape.  
     
      
    14 Having regard to the fact that the amount of money taken was relatively small, that the injury sustained by the victim relatively minor, and the fact that there was no reliable evidence that the offence was premeditated, his Honour regarded the objective criminality as towards the lower end of the notional range. 15 For this reason, coupled with the applicant’s plea of guilty, his Honour was satisfied that it was not appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. He did however acknowledge its utility as a reference point or benchmark in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  
     
      
    The significance of the applicant’s mental health and his criminal record  
     
      
    16 The applicant’s state of mental health was an issue on sentence and on the application for leave to appeal in circumstances where, as a matter of simple temporality, he first came to adverse notice in 2000, a year after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. 17 In so far as his criminal record was concerned, his Honour noted that the applicant was sentenced in September 2000 for a period of 12 months with 6 months non-parole period in relation to a number of break, enter and steal offences together with offences of common assault. In 2002 he was imprisoned for a further term, again in respect of offences including break enter and steal. On this occasion an overall sentence of 4 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 3 years. The next significant period of custody commenced on 19 July 2005 in respect of the applicant’s possession of house-breaking implements and a further offence of break, enter and steal. At the time he committed the subject offence he was on parole. 18 It would appear to have been uncontroversial on sentence that the applicant’s mental illness provided the context in which he first came to notice. The extent to which his past offending (excluding for present purposes the offending the subject of this appeal) was causally connected to his mental illness was not, however, the subject of direct evidence in the sentence proceedings. The only information relevant to the question came from Dr Carne, who first saw the applicant in May 2007. He reported the applicant’s claim that his prior offending was as a result of his experiencing command auditory hallucinations and, although he confirmed the diagnosis of schizophrenia, he did not refer to any material independent of the applicant’s account that would serve to confirm that the previous offending was relevantly and causally linked to his condition. In particular, there was no evidence tendered on sentence from the applicant’s treating doctors and no evidence elaborating upon the severity of his condition. That said, it was not a matter of controversy that the applicant had been in receipt of psychiatric treatment from Cumberland Hospital regularly since he was diagnosed and that he has apparently been compliant with prescribed anti-psychotic medication as part of his treatment. 19 Whilst Dr Carne did not appear to doubt the veracity of the applicant’s assertions that auditory hallucinations played a role in the commission of each of the offences which appeared on his criminal record, he was unable to determine whether or not the applicant was affected by any symptoms of his underlying mental illness (whether that be auditory hallucinations and/or commands or otherwise) at the time of committing the offence for which he was sentenced. Dr Carne said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…. whilst Mr Nguyen suffers from schizophrenia and may have been suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the offences, it was not possible to make a direct causal connection between schizophrenia and the offences…”  
        
       
      
    The first ground of appeal20 It is not submitted that His Honour ignored the fact that the applicant suffered from an underlying mental illness. The question which arises on the first ground of appeal is whether his Honour gave it insufficient weight when considering the principle of general deterrence and/or whether he gave it undue overweight (or wrongly weighted it as a matter of principle) in concluding that the applicant’s criminal history justified a finding that it was highly probable that he will remain a danger to the community by committing offences of the kind for which he was to be sentenced despite the fact that he will receive medical treatment whilst in custody. 
     
      
    21 In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, Sperling J usefully summarised the significance of mental illness in the sentencing context as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[33] Mental illness may be relevant – and was relevant in the present case – in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:

        [34] Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration:

         at [42].  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [35] Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person:  
        Tsiaras 
         at 400;  
        Jiminez 
         at [25];  
        Israil 
         at [26].  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [36] A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence;  
        Israil 
         at [24].” 
        
       
      
    22 In circumstances where there was no causal link between the applicant’s illness and the commission of the offence, and no inference that his pharmacological regime was being mismanaged or inappropriate, the first basis upon which an offender’s mental illness might be taken into account on sentence in accordance with the principles in Hemsley had no application. The interaction between the second and fourth principles is in issue. 
     
      
    23 Despite the first principle having no application to the sentencing exercise, given the applicant’s criminal antecedents it was nevertheless open to his Honour not to entertain any optimism as to his prospects of rehabilitation or any confidence that he would not commit further offences on his release. In coming to that view his Honour was properly entitled to have regard to the fact that the subject offence was the second occasion where the applicant had breached parole over the course of a relatively significant criminal history since he migrated to Australia. It was in that context that his Honour concluded that there was a high probability that despite treatment for the applicant’s condition being available in the prison system, the community was at risk of him committing further offences of the kind that are reflected in his criminal antecedents and, by inference, that considerations of specific deterrence were relevant.  
     
      
    24 It is the finding of future dangerousness (or risk to the community) that is the subject of challenge on the appeal, together with what is said to be his Honour’s failure to counterweight that consideration (if it was an available finding) against a moderated need for the sentence to address the principle of general deterrence.  
     
      
    25 The applicant submitted that the finding of risk to the community was not open because of what is said to be the demonstrated connection between the applicant’s prior offending and his mental illness and, as recognised in the second principle in Hemsley, an associated moderation of his moral culpability. It is submitted that viewed in this way his Honour’s finding is also at variance with the approach to an assessment of future dangerous that the High Court has commended in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477: 
     
      
       
        
        “The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” 
        
       
      
    26 I am not persuaded that his Honour’s approach was wrong as a matter of principle. Hemsley recognises that the level of danger that an offender who suffers mental illness presents, or might present to the community may be a countervailing consideration even where his illness might otherwise operate in mitigation of sentence. Here the applicant’s commission of the earlier offences (possibly attended by a causal connection with his mental illness) and his commission of the subject offence (absent any causal connection but with mental illnesses nevertheless established) were both considerations relevant to an assessment of the likelihood of the applicant presenting a danger to the community upon his release. (See also R v Arnold [2004] NSWCCA 294; R v Haines [2004] NSWCCA 294; R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 213; R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314 and R v Hughes [2005] NSWCCA 117.)27 It is also submitted that his Honour should not have proceeded to any conclusion about future dangerousness in circumstances where the adequacy of the applicant’s medical treatment at the time of the earlier offending was unclear. While it is true that Dr Carne’s report did not address the nature of the applicant’s psychiatric treatment or specify the medications he was prescribed, there is no suggestion in the evidence that this regime was inadequate or inappropriate save for the fact that the applicant maintained that he continued to suffer hallucinations notwithstanding the treatment he was receiving in custody. In the circumstances, this is a wholly unreliable basis upon which to mount a challenge of the kind the applicant advances on an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Not only was there no evidence tendered before his Honour bearing upon the significance of his mental illness in the context of the past offending, Dr Carne reported that the applicant was both managed by medication and compliant and that he had been a regular recipient of treatment from Cumberland Hospital for some years.  
     
      
    28 The applicant submitted that even if it were open to his Honour to impose a longer sentence because the applicant’s mental instability posed a danger to the community, the sentence actually imposed should be substantially offset by the reduced need for general deterrence. His Honour expressly referred to the fact that it is appropriate to give less weight to general deterrence in his sentencing remarks. I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to reflect this in the sentence that was imposed. 
     
      
    29 I am not satisfied the errors comprehended by the first ground of appeal have been made out.  
     
      
    Sentence was manifestly excessive 
     
      
    30 The applicant submitted that in light of his Honour’s positive finding that the offending was at the lower end of the spectrum (and there being no finding of special circumstances which might otherwise disturb the statutory ratio between non-parole period and the balance of term) the specification of 20 per cent as the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea meant that the commencement point for the calculation of sentence must have been a head sentence of 6 years 3 months and a non-parole period of approximately 4 years 10 months. It was further submitted that the proximity of the non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months to the standard non-parole period of 5 years renders the sentence one that is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    31 The applicant draws support for that submission from what is said to be a substantial sample of 226 cases, assembled from the available statistics, and which reveal that after the introduction of the regime for the imposition of a standard non-parole period, a head sentence of 5 years was imposed in 90 per cent of the cases and a minimum (or fixed) term of 42 months or less imposed in 95 per cent of the cases.  
     
      
    32 Reference to the Judicial Commission statistics in support of a challenge to a sentence on the basis of it being manifestly excessive is not always instructive. As Hulme J observed, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in Ma and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subliminal in the reference to the statistics and the observation that the sentences here fall into the highest end of the range is the proposition that that is indicative of error. The proposition must be rejected. As this Court has said on many occasions, the range extends to the maximum penalty set by Parliament and it is against that that an offender’s conduct must primarily be judged. Certainly, the statistics may at times inspire further reflection on the sentence in a particular case and perhaps give some limited guidance but, of themselves, they do not demonstrate error. Particularly is this so because, within each category, they provide no details of the cases reflected in them.” 
        
       
      
    See also Allen v R [2008] NSWCCA 11 per Grove J at [24] (Harrison J expressly agreeing at [56]).33 Quite apart from what the Crown pointed to as a refinement of the statistical data relied upon by the applicant, which reduced the number of cases considerably even if it did not alter the analysis, the Crown also emphasised that because the applicant’s sentence was ordered to commence on the day that he went into custody, the sentence entirely subsumed the balance of parole in respect of the sentence imposed on 19 July 2005 and, for that reason, the sentence does not compare easily with the statistical categories of “consecutive and non-consecutive sentences”.  
     
      
    34 In the result I am not persuaded that the statistical data supports the applicant’s challenge to the sentence on the ground of manifest excess.  
     
      
    35 In addition, since I am satisfied that it was open to his Honour to have been concerned about the protection of the community in light of the applicant’s criminal record and his propensity to commit offences – protection of the community being a principle to which the purposes of sentencing are appropriately directed as provided for in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act – I am of the view that the non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months is within an available range utilising the 5 year standard non-parole period as a reference point.  
     
      
       
       
      
    Orders 
     
      
    36 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

     JUDGMENT  
    1. Adam Stewart met the complainant’s mother in a caravan park. He was then seventeen years old. She was substantially older. She was living in a caravan park in Queensland separated from her then husband. Also living in the caravan were her four children, three girls and a boy. The family struggled financially. They also moved frequently sometimes needing even emergency accommodation. As best I can determine Stewart joined the family sometime in 1998 or 1999. 2. Between February 2003 and July 2006 on four occasions Stewart sexually assaulted the complainant in various ways. The complainant was born in mid May 1992. During the period of these assaults she was ten and a half years to fourteen years. In all there are ten counts in an indictment encapsulating Stewart’s illicit sexual activity with this child. Counts 1, 4 and 8 are charges of indecent assault, and 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 are charges of sexual intercourse without consent against a person under the age of sixteen years. Charges 3, 6, 7 and 10, being charges of penile penetration, and the remaining counts digital penetration. The four instances are captured by Counts 1, 2 and 3 for the first, 4, 5 and 6 for the second, 7 stands alone, 8, 9 and 10 is the final episode.3. Today Stewart is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct towards the child. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before the Court committed by this offender harming this young victim in her community.4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to this offender, the subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether these offences attract a standard non-parole period which they do, and if so the length of the parole period. And finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment that is to be imposed. None of those can be determined until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have, as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be kept in mind. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts5. Adam Stewart was found guilty of all ten charges after trial before a jury. Thus, it falls to me to determine the facts for the purpose of sentence. That determination must acknowledge the essential elements of the offence, that the jury must have found proved. The facts must also acknowledge the issues in the trial and have regard to what the verdicts indicate the jury’s view of those issues was. Nonetheless there is still scope for judgment in respect of the facts to be found. There is no obligation to find facts most favourable to the accused or to the then accused. Facts found adverse to him must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. 6. In this case the choice for the jury was stark. The accused’s case was there had never been a sexual assault; that his relationship with the complainant had been excellent until the last house move when she had come under the sway of a neighbour’s daughter, which had impacted upon her relationship with others in the house particularly between himself and her mother; that is the complainant between him and the complainant between the mother. From its verdicts, guilty on all counts, it is clear the jury rejected the account given by the offender and the complainant’s mother. In those circumstances the jury must have been satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, the complainant was not only honest but also accurate as a witness in respect of each count in the indictment. It is for this reason that I rely upon the account given by the complainant in her evidence, primarily to be found in the interview that she gave with police on 14 February 2008.The first incident (Counts 1, 2 and 3)7. The first group of offences occurred at Carlingford. On this occasion the other occupants of the house were out leaving Stewart and the complainant alone in the house. She was in her brother’s bedroom on the bed. She had been there for half an hour when Stewart entered. He commenced touching her inappropriately, initially on the outside of her clothing and then subsequently onto her flesh. He started touching her arm and moved his hand toward her breasts using both hands upon them [Count 1]. He then started to feel her vagina. He pulled her pants part way down her legs, lay on top of her. He placed his fingers into her vagina [Count 2] and finally inserted his adult penis into this child’s vagina. 8. She was lying on the bed, she had her eyes closed, she was crying because it hurt so much. She was holding onto the blankets. Her account is that he could not put his penis all the way up because it would not fit. Her account is he did this for nine or ten minutes, then withdrew and masturbated to ejaculation. While I accept her description of the events and of her discomfort I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt her account of time is accurate. There is no evidence she was able to measure the time she says against any timepiece. While I obviously cannot quantify the time I am satisfied it was substantial, and also likely to have been significantly less than nine minutes. At the commencement time of the offence the complainant was clothed in a bra and panties, t-shirt and pants.The second incident (Counts 4, 5 and 6)9. These offences occurred when the family was living at Metcalfe. The offences occurred at a time when other family members were asleep. The complainant was in the lounge room for an hour or two watching television. Her estimate is the offence occurred around midnight. Stewart was experiencing toothache. He had left his bed to take a shower to relieve the pain. He left the shower, came to her, started rubbing her arms, breasts and legs [Count 4]. He inserted his finger into her vagina [Count 5]. He had obtained moisturising cream, which the complainant said had been obtained from her bedroom by him, some of which he put on his penis. He told the complainant it would make him slippery, he would go in easier and it would not hurt as much. The complainant told him as he had his penis inside her, “It still hurts me, it still hurts me”. At some point he withdrew and masturbated to climax. Stewart then returned to the shower. In her interview the complainant described the penile penetration of her on this occasion as feeling like” it was really ripping me apart”. The complainant was wearing on this occasion a sporting bra, underwear, shorts and a baggy t-shirt. The third incident (Count 7) 10. Some two or three months after the second incident the family was still at Metcalfe. It was daytime. The complainant was in her brother’s bedroom watching a TV that was in that room. Meanwhile Stewart was in the downstairs shower which is nearby to the brother’s bedroom. Stewart interrupted his shower, entered the bedroom with a towel wrapped around him, he began to masturbate. He commenced touching her, pulling her pants down. He inserted his penis into her vagina. At some point he removed his penis from her, masturbated to ejaculation. He ejaculated on her vaginal area. He used the towel he had earlier had wrapped around him to wipe the ejaculate from her body. On this day two siblings had gone out, the complainant’s mother and the two younger children were watching the upstairs TV. The final incident (Counts 8, 9 and 10) 11. The family moved to North Rocks. The complainant was by this time eleven or twelve years old. It was a weekend. The complainant was asleep in the middle of her mother’s bed. Stewart had come from the shower with towel wrapped around him. He commenced opening and closing drawers as he was clothing himself. The complainant woke from her slumber. Her awakening seemed to trigger Stewart, he commenced to rub her breasts [Count 8], placed his fingers into her vagina and manipulated them in and out [Count 9]. He pulled her pants down and then his own, he then placed his penis into her vagina. While the complainant cannot recall precisely what clothes she was wearing she did know that she had been wearing underpants and pants. She remembers that because Stewart put his hands beneath her clothing. 12. I am satisfied from the evidence that the complainant experienced pain to the point of severe hurt on each of the occasions Stewart inserted his adult penis inside her.13. What particularly prompted the first offence is unclear from the evidence. Whether Stewart was giving into a fantasy he had previously entertained or whether it was a spur of the moment impulsive act is unable to be determined from the evidence. It is likely it was an opportunistic offence. All family members were away from the house. I am satisfied this offence, as with them all, was undertaken for Stewart’s sexual gratification.14. The other offences are scattered through a three and a half year period. The last three episodes are associated with showering. On the last occasion it is likely the decision to sexually assault the complainant occurred with the complainant wakening from sleep and in that sense also was opportunistic. The offences were a significant breach of trust. Although Stewart was young to be in a stepfather type role for children of the age in the family he had come into, nonetheless they looked upon him as a stepfather type figure. He too regarded himself in a parent type role, speaking of himself as a stern or severe parent. His commission of these offences was in a domestic setting and as such were totally hostile to his responsibilities. Instead of protecting or nurturing he was violently harming the complainant. The repetition of the offending conduct convinces me he was using these criminal acts to groom her to accept his advances in future whenever occasion should arise that he felt the need to satisfy his sexual urges. In that sense he was seeking to corrupt the complainant. 15. I note in his favour though that in no case did he ejaculate inside the complainant. Ejaculation within the complainant, all other things being equal, adds to the seriousness of the sexual assault. It furthers the humiliation to the victim to have the bodily fluids of her predator deposited within her. It also adds to the risk of transmission of sexual diseases and in those old enough to know, increases the worry, a potential in the case of this complainant when she was thirteen or fourteen. I note there were no threats directed towards her either physical or verbal.Objective criminality16. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offences with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 17. There are sections within the Crimes Act 1900 which are about the protection of young children from a range of sexual experiences while their physical, emotional and psycho-sexual development is patently immature and the power imbalance between the child and the adult grossly favours the adult. All of the offences committed here were committed against offences in the Crimes Act having among other things, that purpose. 18. Mr Justice Lee in describing the jurisprudential philosophy behind these sections said the following, 
     
      
      “One begins with the proposition that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged by the legislature in providing for the greater penalties when the victim is under 16. That acknowledgment has been in our legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from the risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life caused by such conduct.” 
       
      
    19. His Honour also made this observation highlighting the laws focused upon the power imbalance between adult males and young children. The law has always sought to protect young children against sexual predators particularly adult men. The law recognises of course, as young girls grow up, there is an inevitability of contact with sexual overtones and more with members of the opposite sex of the same age or a little age. (as said) That is simply one of the facts of life, but when it comes to the case of an adult male .... tampering with girls of twelve and thirteen years of age the crimes become crimes of enormity, R v Zappella unreported NSW CCA 5 November 1991 pp 2 and 3.20. Focusing particularly on the indicted charges of sexual intercourse without consent these were sexual encounters without the complainant’s consent. She submitted to them because of the immense power and balance and her inability to know quite what to do when the stepfather figure took disadvantage of her. The power imbalance is also noticeable from the offender’s viewpoint when he, as a senior member of the family, illustrated not just his decision to have intercourse but against the expectation that his demands and actions would be accepted without show of resistance. 21. The criminality of penile sexual intercourse offences also centre around the breach of the young person’s safety. They amount to a gross intrusive invasion of a young girl’s right to privacy and her right to healthy sexual development. Her breach of privacy, personal safety and impairment of the right to healthy sexual development were of no apparent moment to this offender who put his own sexual gratification above these three things. It is that which makes his conduct of high criminal order. The intercourse appears to have been committed without consideration of using any protective device. 22. Factors relating to the essential elements that impact upon the seriousness of this offence are firstly that the complainant was aged ten or eleven when the first of these offences occurred, while she may have been as old as fourteen when the last occurred. The element of the offence requires proof that the complainant was under sixteen, thus for the first of these offences it occurred at a greater distance from that age, the last was closer, in that sense then, or on that score then the first of these offences is the more serious so far as age is concerned.23. The offence of sexual intercourse without consent where a young person under 16 is concerned must anticipate some degree of hurt, but I am satisfied that the level of physical pain experienced by the complainant, and on subsequent offences known to be experienced by her, aggravates the seriousness of the criminality exposed in that element because the subsequent offences were committed by him full well knowing he was entering her in the way that was so painful. Of course in respect of the second offence it must be recognised that he was trying to accommodate consideration of that pain by using a lubricant.24. Finally on that score the offences were committed for his own gratification. 25. The s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act matters aggravating the objective seriousness of this offence is the breach of trust I earlier referred to. While I note all offences were committed within the home of the complainant it seems to me that fact is already reflected in the breach of trust to which I have referred. For that reason I do not regard that they were committed within the home as an aggravating feature pursuant to s 21(a)(2). One of the offender’s roles was to provide a home and keep it safe for her. That was part of the breach of trust that I have already alluded to. 26. As to the s 21A features that mitigate the offence, there is no evidence these offences were planned. I have indicated they were responses to sexual desires or lust being experienced. While I see a pattern of grooming for the future I do not regard these offences as pre-meditated events for that purpose but rather opportunistic events that would advance that purpose.27. On the objective circumstances however I am satisfied each of these offences of penile penetration that is the four of them, would qualify as falling within the lower half of the mid range of seriousness. By that I mean if one regards the mid range of seriousness as covering a band of varying levels of seriousness all falling within what can compendiously be described as a mid range, then the four offences I have identified would fall within the lower half of that band. I am not satisfied the digital penetration offences qualify as falling within the mid range of seriousness.28. Insofar as the indecent assaults are concerned I do not regard any of them as falling into a mid range. 29. The incidents of touching were not prolonged. There was no violence or voyeuristic carry on, it was done only with the hands, no instruments or manipulation were involved. There was no degrading of the victim other than the inherent humiliation involved in her being taken advantage of, there was no role playing.Subjective facts30. As I said earlier I am both entitled and required to have regard to the subjective facts. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender, Adam Stewart for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to this offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is desirable.31. Adam Stewart was aged twenty-two in the first year of offending and somewhere between twenty-four and twenty-five when the final series of offences were committed. His own childhood was difficult and disadvantaged. His mother was a heroin addict. He has given what at first blush appears to be differing accounts of his early childhood, firstly, to Probation and Parole and then to Terry Smith, a clinical psychologist. It may be that with some further probing they are consistent. On either view it is likely his childhood was difficult, disruptive, disadvantaged and deprived. I am satisfied by 17 he was well relieved to be away from home and, from what I gather, home was well relieved to be away from him. As I earlier mentioned at the beginning of these remarks at seventeen he fell into a senior role within the family of the complainant. He immediately became fully involved in the parenting role of the children. For him, the de facto relationship he regards as enduring and happy. He claims a prominent role within the family particularly in relation to the behavioural management of children and claimed a close relationship with all of the children. Since 1998 two further children have been born, one in 2002 and another in 2004. 32. He had an uncle. The basis of the relationship between him from nought to thirteen with this uncle is not made clear to me in the evidence other than that the uncle had some impact upon him. I sense the relationship between them was turbulent. Nonetheless the uncle went into custody and I think it is whilst in custody committed suicide. To the thirteen year old this had a significant impact, to a point where there is some suggestion in the psychological profile obtained by the defence from Terry Smith, the clinical psychologist, that there is still unresolved grieving relating to that. The offender refers to the suicide as a trigger for other acts such as his involvement in drugs and the like. Education skills and employment33. During the trial it became apparent Stewart is effectively illiterate and innumerate. His schooling also was troubled and was marked with disciplinary issues. He left Miami High School, which I assume is in Queensland, at the beginning of Year 9. He was diagnosed with ADHD and told Terry Smith he simply could not learn in class. After the death of his uncle he said he became highly distractible and defiant. He worked for his grandfather in a demolition business as a labourer for some six years. On occasions he drove small vehicles such as a bobcat, but sadly cannot read sufficiently to obtain other tickets and licences. His primary income stream through his adult years appears to be unemployment benefits and benefits arising from the Centrelink personal support program, which indicates to me that he was at least interested in addressing the problem of his unemployment. I am satisfied he will need assistance obtaining employment upon his release. There is material before me from which I can gather he was a very gifted skateboarder reaching an elite level in that sport. Regrettably as a consequence of an accident I think, that came to an end.General health34. During the trial the offender consumed copious quantities of water. On this issue there is no formal material before the Court but I understand it to relate to problems he was having with his teeth. The complainant’s evidence was that he often experienced toothaches and took showers to relieve the pain. There is also material before me that he has back problems. Drug and alcohol history35. He claims not to consume alcohol other than in small quantities when he was working in the demolition business. He experienced elevated pain from stomach ulcers and he commenced to consume marijuana from the age of eight years being introduced to it by partners and friends of his mother. He continued to consume cannabis regularly until about a year before his arrest. Aged seventeen years, and remember that is the year in which he met the complainant's mother, he was introduced to amphetamines and consumed them at elevated levels until the birth of his son four years later. I am not suggesting that she introduced him to them but I note the coincidence of timing. He said, 
     
      
      “I had so many stuff ups in my life, my uncle dying, losing contact with my mother, my grandfather kicking me out of the house, hating authority because of what had happened to my uncle. I went AWOL, disappeared .... I was using big time.” 
       
      
    What stopped him he said was his son’s birth. The birth of his son seemed to him to open his eyes, give him his life back, make him realise he had to stop, so he did.Mental health36. As I mentioned before there was an accident at the age of twelve. It was from a BMX cycle riding accident. As a consequence of that accident he was in a coma for four days with serious closed head injury. He said that there were residual problems flowing from that including even poorer concentration than previous, becoming highly distractible and more prone to spacing out, a reduced capacity to learn, weeping in his right eye and constant teeth pain. He says the death of his uncle has caused him enduring and intense emotional scarring. He described himself to Mr Smith as insecure and having no confidence.Psycho sexual profile37. The psycho sexual profile Stewart would argue he has was the one he gave to Terry Smith.  
     
      
      “Issues relating to sexual identity of Mr Stewart were discussed. He said he’s attracted to adult females that are older than he and who provide a sense of nurturing and comfort. He absolutely denied any attraction to pre-pubescent form. He denied pressuring, coercing or threatening complicity for sexual relating (sic) with any woman.”  
       
      
    Regrettably given he refuses to admit his guilt in relation to the serious offences I am dealing with I cannot accept what he told Mr Smith. The forensic psychology services of the Department of Corrective Services say that given his denial of these offences no accurate psycho sexual profile can be made and he remains unsuitable for appropriate therapeutic intervention. Criminal history and character38. After a rough start to his life he settled in well to family life with the complainant’s mother and children. It was only after some years into this period with the family that this offending conduct began and continued. He has no prior criminal convictions and is to be regarded, at least insofar as the first offence is concerned, as a person of immediately prior good character. So far as the other offences are concerned he continued within the role he had set out for himself in the family and there is no complaint from the other children or partner of anything untoward. 39. While there are other sexual offences that occur during this period there is no other offending of any kind. He can be given credit for the positive contribution he made to the family prior to offending and excising the offending from the circumstances of his three years he otherwise was of good character.40. Importantly, his absence of convictions is a matter of mitigation within s.21(3) and will need to be taken into account when determining if a standard non-parole period is to apply.Section 21A mitigating factors relating to the subjective matters41. 21A(3)(e) the offender does not have any record of prior convictions. And (f) he is a person of good character. While there was assistance to the prosecution during the trial by a series of admissions made I cannot regard that as qualifying under s 23(1)(3) or otherwise a mitigating factor in sentencing.42. At twenty two, that is at the time of the first offence, the offender it seems to me is entitled to have some consideration for youth. Even at 25 he is relatively young although by that time his claim upon youth as a mitigating factor must be almost minimal. Nonetheless I have taken the youth into account in the initial sentencing and hopefully in the overall sentencing outcome. 43. Insofar as rehabilitation are concerned there is of course the very serious issue as to his psycho sexual profile, notoriously sexual offenders have a greater pre-disposition to re-offend than perhaps all other groups of offenders except, say, for drug addicts. Equally notoriously it is difficult to predict rehabilitation prospects and the likelihood of future offending. There are some positive factors which need to be taken into account. 44. He has strong family support and I note even today there are a number of supporters in court including his partner. He has shown a past pre-disposition to be involved in work and to do something through the personal support program to bring him back into the workforce. He has average intelligence. In other words there do not appear to be any intellectual problems that would stand in the way of him rehabilitating although he does have a disability inasmuch as he is illiterate and innumerate. His conduct, whilst in custody initially, was not positive but the report before me suggests that things are improving. 45. There is no contrition and that must sound against him on rehabilitation, not just in terms of the absence of remorse, but equally significantly the absence of insight into why this conduct is criminal. I must say that notoriously against paedophiles, particularly paedophiles within a family structure have a great deal of difficulty disclosing, that can be because they are very conscious of the hurt that they have done, not just to the victim but to those who are also close to the victim and their sense of shame and embarrassment, and their already frail self image will not permit them to disclose. Be all that as it may, in the absence of public disclosure the only finding one can make is an absence of insight.46. These are offences calling for deterrence and I have taken that into account. The maximum penalties for the sexual intercourse without consent offences are twenty years. There is a standard non-parole period applying to them of ten years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the aggravated indecent assault offences is seven years, they too carry a standard non-parole period of five years.47. Because these offences are scattered through a three year period Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 requires that there be some accumulation of sentences. I have decided to accumulate them by incidence that is to say sentences imposed for the second incident will be accumulated by one year. Sentences for the third incident will be accumulated a further one year. And sentences for the fourth incident will be accumulated a further one year.48. I now have to determine my attitude to the setting of a non-parole period. From my reading of Way’s (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) case I am entitled to regard mitigating features identified within s 21A(3) as capable of removing a case within the mid range from one requiring a standard non-parole period. Indeed it was upon that basis that the plea of guilty appeared as a mitigating feature it being one of the items identified in s 21A(3). The plea of guilty jurisprudence commencing with Way’s case, rather that is, the standard non-parole period not applying in those cases, gained a life of its own through Way.Totality49. I have sought to reflect in the sentences for the sexual intercourse without consent offence of each incident totality of sentencing for that group of offences. I have also sought to effect totality by the accumulation of sentences as required by Pearce My inquiries of the custodial history of the accused indicate that as at today he has been in custody for 216 days. That is the figure that I am anchoring the commencement date upon should subsequent investigation discover that that period is wrong, the matter will need to come back to me for proper adjustment of the starting date. My intention is to give him credit for all days he has done in custody. 50. I find special circumstances. The reasons for finding special circumstances centre in the accumulation of sentences, his comparative youth, his first time in custody, and of the fact that he will require assistance of a significant kind upon release both in terms of securing and finding employment and in terms of re-entry into domestic life. HIS HONOUR: Does either party want to draw my attention to any matter before I go onto the formal sentencing?RUSSELL: No your Honour.BARBER: No thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: 51. Would you stand up please Mr Stewart. Adam Stewart you are convicted of the offence that you between 3 February 2003 and 2 March 2004 at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales did assault S P and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency upon her at a time when she was under the age of sixteen. For that indecent assault you are sentenced to a fixed term of three years to commence on 24 March 2008 and that sentence will expire on 23 March 2011. 52. I convict you of the offence the same time and place and against the same complainant, without her consent, and knowing she was not consenting she then being under the age of sixteen years you had sexual intercourse with her. That is the digital penetration that you were convicted of for that offence I sentence you to a minimum non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years. The whole sentence will expire on 23 March 2013. 53. For the offence that you between in exactly the same terms as the last one but involving the penile penetration I convict you of that offence. For that offence you are sentenced to a non-parole period of four years, and a balance of term of three years. That is a seven year overall sentence to expire on 23 March 2015.54. For the offence that you between 19 March 2004 and 17 December 2004 at Carlingford committed an indecent assault against the same complainant, she then being under the age of sixteen, you are convicted. You have a fixed term of three years to date from the 24 March 2009 and to expire on 23 March 2012. 55. For the offence of digital intercourse at the same time and place you are likewise convicted, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years, the balance of term to expire on 23 March 2014. 56. And you are sentenced on the sixth count which is account of penile intercourse for which you are convicted. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and a balance of term of three years making an overall sentence of seven years to expire on 23 March 2016.57. For the seventh offence, which is the stand alone offence of sexual intercourse against the same complainant at Carlingford between 19 March and 22 December, when she was not consenting, and under the age of sixteen years I set a non-parole period of four years and a balance of term of two years making an overall sentence of six years commencing on 24 March 2010 and expiring in total on 23 March 2016. 58. For the last group of offences for the indecent assault you are sentenced to three years to commence on 24 March 2011 and to expire on 23 March 2014. 59. For the digital penetration you are convicted, that is sexual intercourse without consent, knowing she was not consenting when she was under the age of sixteen, these offences occurring between 13 December 2005 and 4 July 2006. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 24 March 2011 and expiring on 23 March 2014. And then the additional term of two years expiring the same date 2016. And you are sentenced to an overall sentence of seven years with a non-parole of four years to date from 24 March 2011 and the four year non-parole period will expire on 23 March 2015. The additional term will expire 2018. HIS HONOUR: The effect of all that so that you can understand it, you earliest date of release is seven years from when you went in and the overall sentence is ten years from when you went in. So you will have three years parole.

   JUDGMENT 1. In the matter of Basri and Commissioner of Federal Police, Saripah Syed Basri, hereafter Ms Basri, is presently before the Court being tried upon a single charge that she, on 25 February 2008, at Sydney, she did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely, heroin, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. It is a serious charge. For a person found guilty it carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. While this is not a worse case, clearly Ms Basri's liberty is at stake. 2. On 16 October last I gave leave for short service of a subpoena upon the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The subpoena sought all notes, statements, memorandums, computer generated information, intelligence reports or similar documents concerning the statements of disclosure made by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, namely; 
     
      
      “The AFP advise they were aware Saripah Syed Basri was going to attempt to import a prohibited substance into Australia prior to her arrival in Australia.” 
       
      
    3. No objection was taken to the form of the subpoena or short service on the abridged return date. The AFP has now identified documents falling within the scope of the subpoena. These documents comprise:  
     
      
      A. Overseas liaison communication dated 15 February 2008 to Asia Desk (two pages);  
       
      B. Overseas liaison communication dated 22 February 2008 to Asia Desk (2 pages);  
       
      C. Official diary of Federal Agent (F/A) Kelly Mansfield (four pages);  
       
      D. Case note entry ID 149144969 dated 25 February 2008 by F/A -- at 12.41 hours (two pages);  
       
      E. Email from F/A Stephanie Leonard to F/A Kelly Mansfield and vice versa (one page);  
       
      F. Email from F/A Kelly Mansfield to Simon Hannaford (ACS) one page;  
       
      G. Email from F/A Kelly Mansfield to F/A Masi Laveta and F/A Rod Cooke (one page) and;  
       
      H. Case note diary entry, ID 149145352 dated 25 February 2008 FSA Rainer 22.03 hours (three pages). 
       
      
    4. On 16 October 2008 the AFP produced redacted versions of some or all of the documents to the Court. The documents were redacted by with holding information regarded by the AFP as irrelevant. It concerned what the AFP regarded as unrelated matters and telephone numbers of AFP; it also redacted out information subject to claims of public interest immunity.5. Although not identified in the original documents made available in answer to the subpoena, the current claims for the public interest immunity relate to ongoing investigations, relationship with foreign law enforcement agencies, methodology, not relevant, public interest immunity and now declassified. 6. Subsequent to the first production of documents and when reminded of its obligation, the AFP produced all documents sought, or at least copies of them, from their original condition. Counsel for Ms Basri sought access to the documents. The AFP claimed public interest immunity in respect of most documents produced. It was prepared to concede access to the redacted documents. In effect, what the court is dealing with is an application for public interest immunity to be granted to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police insofar as all items identified as public interest immunity claims in the unredacted documents produced.7. While I have had no opportunity overnight to research the situation, my sense is that neither, at law, nor by virtue of the terms of subpoena which, after all, is an order of the court, nor in terms of common law is it possible to require a party responding to a subpoena to edit a document sought. The subpoena order is an order to produce specified documents. Thereafter, the question of access to a produced document or to produce items (in this case documents) stands or falls upon the access, the argument why it should or should not be released from the custody of the Court.8. Some claims for public interest immunity in the documents are pressed upon more than one ground. For example, a number of claims were pressed upon grounds which related to “ongoing investigation”, to “relationship with foreign law enforcement” and to confidential “methodology”. In all there were more than 60 items through the 15 or so documents in respect of which claims for public interest immunity were made.9. My view, as I say tentative as it is, is that to uphold any claim for public interest immunity in respect of any document would result in the whole of that document being excluded or denied to the defence. Before claims are considered, Mr Russell, counsel for the accused Basri, was invited to identify the legitimate forensic purpose for which access to the documents was sought. The test to be applied to determine whether legitimate forensic purpose is made out is that it must be ""on the cards"" that the documents sought will materially assist the accused's defence. See R v James Salem 1989 A Crim R 406.10. When confronted by the authorities that heroin was in her suitcase, which had earlier been placed in the luggage hold of the aircraft, Ms Basri denied any knowledge of the heroin. Her case is being conducted upon the basis that there was, indeed, a commercial quantity secreted in the lining of the bag which she brought into Australia but its secretion was never a fact known to her; nor did she intentionally or recklessly import the heroin into Australia.11. Mr Russell's case is that the AFP, and through them Australian Customs Service, had prior knowledge that Ms Basri would be entering the country and would probably be the medium by which heroin was to be imported into Australia. The legitimate forensic purpose, Mr Russell claims, is that there may be material disclosed in the communications between India and Australia and the observations of those involved in monitoring progress of Ms Basri to Australia that would support her defence. He argues there may be material that may reveal a modus operandi of duping potential couriers by the principals behind this importation. 12. On the material thus far disclosed from the subpoenaed documents there is material that would fit the description referred to above of interest to Mr Russell. I should also indicate that if among the items in respect of which a public interest immunity claim is made there was material that ""on the cards"" assisted the defence in the way sought by Mr Russell, I would regard that material as meeting a legitimate forensic purpose.13. I have reviewed each of the items in respect of which claims have been made for public interest immunity. In the course of so doing I came across items where the claim for public interest immunity would need to be upheld. I also came across items where a claim for public interest immunity was made, even though evidence identical to the material in respect of which the claim was sought has been given before this Court. There were items where a claim was made for public interest immunity where, even though I doubt the merits of the claim, I was satisfied the material was attracted to a legitimate forensic purpose. I came across material that ""on the cards"" may have offered a legitimate forensic purpose, but for reasons I would give in final judgment I would uphold the claim for public interest immunity.14. Finally, I came across material that where an edited version of the information contained could be presented so as to protect both the ongoing investigation, foreign law enforcement contacts, the identity of any person of interest, and methodology, I have noted what I regard as an absence of jurisdiction when dealing with the return of subpoena and access to documents to order the AFP to edit documents they have been ordered to produce, so that a party may have access to a document in a form it never subpoenaed. 15. I disagree with the submission of Ms Gleeson that there is no material contained in the documents that is or might be relevant to the questions raised by Ms Basri's defence. Nor, incidentally in my view, is that a proper test. It puts the test of access to documents too high. See Salem ante. 16. Finally, I should say in determining the well-known competing tensions one needs to apply modern community standards. In the 20 or more years since much of jurisprudence was settled, the public had little knowledge or interest in ongoing investigations, intercontinental and intracontinental relationships between law enforcement groups or police or law enforcement methodology. Today, however, the scenario is vastly different. Programmes such as Border Control, CSI and the like, movies and media exposure, both sensational and thoughtful, have brought law enforcement, its methodology and interaction with other groups right into everyone's lounge room. 17. For example, there was material sought to be excluded on public interest immunity relating to law enforcement concerns about the dynamics of the group who dispatched Ms Basri to Australia. Lawyers involved in this case and jurors hearing this case would have little difficulty inferring conclusions identical to the material sought to be excluded. For my part, although I do not express any final opinion and hopefully I will not have to, I wonder whether in those circumstances it makes any sense to uphold a claim for public interest immunity. 18. What I am proposing to the parties now is to invite, particularly the AFP, to consider releasing material already before the jury and I refer particularly to material in respect of which a claim was sought in case note 149145352, and editing material found, particularly I refer to material to be found in document case note 149144969, a document which appears to be sent on Monday 25 February 2008 at 12.15pm, and on the page that I have got, which I will show the parties from here, halfway down the page is an AFP logo with Federal Agent Kelly Mansfield on it. I cannot better describe that document, and case note 149145352. The parties can indicate to me, perhaps by the end of today, what their attitude is to both the editing and whether a final judgment is required.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) v Freda LOUIZOS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 48 of the Bail Act 1978, to review the decision of Woods DCJ on 3 October 2008 granting the respondent, Freda Louizos bail following her conviction and sentence for soliciting Chad Williams to murder her former husband Barrie Leslie Bruce. The respondent was originally arrested and charged with the offence on 4 October 2006. 
     
      
    2 The respondent was discharged following a committal hearing but stood trial in the District Court following the filing of an ex officio indictment. She was granted bail before and during the trial.  
     
      
    3 The jury returned a guilty verdict on 25 August 2008. On that day the respondent was granted bail. The Crown sought a review of that decision which was heard by this Court on 9 September 2008 when the application was refused. One of the significant considerations for the Court of Appeal on that occasion was that the respondent was due for sentence on 25 September 2008. The trial judge passed sentence on that day imposing a term of ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years.  
     
      
    4 On 3 October 2008 his Honour granted the respondent bail. It is that decision which is the subject of the application for review before this Court.  
     
      
    5 Both the respondent and the Crown have filed appeals in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The respondent raises two grounds being: 
     
      
       
      1. Exhibit F ought not to have been admitted as evidence. 
       
      2. The verdicts of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
       
      
    6 The Crown appeals the sentence and will submit that it was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7 Exhibit F is a transcript of telephone conversations with Chad Williams. Two of the conversations are between the respondent and Williams. The other is between Williams and an employee of the respondent. The conversations between Williams and the respondent are capable of being understood as providing considerable support for the Crown case. 
     
      
    8 Woods DCJ granted a certificate pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Although not contemplated by the section his Honour identified two grounds for his certification being: 
     
      
       
      1. Exhibit F ought not to have been admitted as evidence. 
       
      2. The verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
    9 The Crown case at trial was that the respondent had arranged for Chad Williams, who it was said was beholden to her for a job and accommodation, to kill her former husband. It was alleged that Williams persuaded another man, Denning, to carry out the murder. An unsuccessful but severe attack was carried out by Denning with Williams and a third person, Moyes, at the scene. 
     
      
    10 The Crown called Chad Williams who stated that the respondent had enlisted him to kill her husband. He received a discount on his sentence for assistance. He admitted that he had been untruthful and told lies to try and minimise his role in the crime. The telephone intercept evidence was tendered to show that the respondent had urged Williams to deny any knowledge of the crime if questioned by the police. She provided information to Williams about the police investigation and attempted to reassure him. The respondent is recorded as saying to Williams “you keep your mouth shut, no one else will talk.” She also says “All I can say to you is, you keep your mouth shut, they have got no DNA, they’ve got nothing.” 
     
      
    11 The Crown evidence suggested that the respondent was the link between Williams and the victim and that by reason of her dispute with her former husband as to the custody of her children she had a motive for the killing. 
     
      
    12 Objection was taken at the trial to the tender of the telephone intercepts. The essence of that objection will be repeated on the appeal. It was submitted that each of them was a contrived conversation because at the time the calls were made Williams was in police custody but hid this fact from the respondent. In the first call Williams speaks with the respondent’s employee and asked her to pass on a message to the respondent saying “Lee has rolled on Freda and me.” The respondent rang Williams four minutes later. It was submitted by the respondent that in fact Lee Moyes to whom Williams was referring “had not rolled further than repeating Williams’ verbal allegation against the appellant in an induced statement.” Objection was also taken to the second call and it was submitted that without it the first and third calls could not have been admitted because their relevance could not be established. 
     
      
    13 A significant element of the objection to the telephone calls has to do with the fact that the telephone intercept warrant was allegedly used selectively, some calls not being recorded while others were. It was submitted that in these circumstances the terms of the warrant had not been faithfully complied with because in effect the recordings were edited when the warrant required all calls to be recorded. It was further submitted that the understanding to be gained from the calls was equivocal and the risk that the jury may misuse them meant that their probative value was outweighed by the potential prejudice and they should have been rejected. 
     
      
    14 During the course of the trial the respondent sought a Prasad direction but this was rejected. It will now be submitted on the appeal that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported. The essence of this submission as I understand it, is that Williams was a known criminal informer who admitted to lying and accordingly, without corroboration, his account of the relevant events could not be accepted. It will be submitted that even if the telephone intercept material was correctly admitted it was not corroborative of Williams’ account. 
     
      
    15 Section 48 of the Bail Act provides for the review of a decision in relation to bail. This Court has previously said that it is a hearing de novo (see the decision of this Court in relation to the previous application Director of Public Prosecutions v Louizos, [2008] NSWCA 220 at [23]). The Court must nevertheless exercise restraint taking into account the trial judge’s advantage in weighing the factors in support of bail: R v Budiman (1997) 97 A Crim R 548 at 549. 
     
      
    16 Before bail can be granted in circumstances where an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal it must be “established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail” (s 30AA, Bail Act). In R v MFA [2002] NSWCCA 49 this Court had regard to considerations identified by Callinan J in Marotta v R [1999] HCA 4; (1999) 73 ALJR 265. In that decision Callinan J doubted the observation of Brennan J in Chamberlain v The Queen [1993] HCA 13; (1983) 153 CLR 514 at 519-520 to the effect that a verdict of a jury was not to be treated for the purposes of an application for bail as provisional. His Honour said: “With respect, I doubt whether a grant of bail does treat a verdict of guilty as provisional. The verdict stands unless and until it is quashed. One of its consequences, the service of a custodial sentence, is only interrupted by a grant of bail.”  
     
      
    17 Marotta was concerned with an application made to the High Court following a grant of special leave to appeal. However, many of the matters considered by Callinan J are relevant to an application under s 30AA. In both Marotta and MFA it was accepted that it was relevant to the application for bail that the outcome of a successful appeal may be an acquittal. However, as I understand the reasoning, particularly in Marotta, the significance of that possibility increases if there is a close proximity between the likely time for the resolution of the appeal and the end of the sentence which the appellant is serving. Where a successful appeal may result in an acquittal the prospect that the person may nevertheless serve a substantial portion of the sentence imposed may justify a finding of special or exceptional circumstances. The significance of the relationship between the date for the appeal and the conclusion of the sentence will obviously be greater if an appeal is likely to be delayed.  
     
      
    18 It is apparent from the decision in Maroota that the merit of the pleaded ground of appeal will also be relevant. If the court concludes that an appeal is hopeless the court would be less inclined to find special or exceptional circumstances than if the appeal was found on the limited examination available to the relevant court to have good prospects of success. 
     
      
    19 In the present case Woods DCJ identified four matters from which his Honour concluded that there were special or exceptional circumstances. They were the fact that his Honour had granted a certificate under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act, uncertainty about the date when the appeal against conviction could be heard, the fact that the respondent had never been in custody before and any period of incarceration would be more damaging than in many other cases and the circumstance that if the appeal succeeds the outcome would be likely to be a quashing of the conviction rather than a retrial. The respondent advanced the same considerations before this Court. 
     
      
    20 In my opinion neither individually nor cumulatively do these matters constitute special or exceptional circumstances within the meaning of s 30AA. It may be accepted that by the grant of a certificate as s 5 requires Woods DCJ was of the opinion that this was a fit case for an appeal. His Honour said that the appeal “does raise a matter of considerable substance.” I understand that his Honour had in mind, in particular, the question of the admissibility of the telephone intercepts. However, it must be remembered that his Honour determined that they were admissible. It was the jury who were satisfied of the respondent’s guilt. Presumably they came to that conclusion after consideration of both the evidence of Williams and the telephone calls. Although I could not conclude that the appeal is hopeless, the prospects of success do not justify a finding of special or exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    21 With respect to the hearing date the appeal has been fixed for 11 December 2008. At the time his Honour considered the matter it was believed that there was a prospect that the appeal could not be heard until sometime in the early part of 2009. Where, as in the present case, the term of the non-parole period imposed extends well beyond the date of the likely resolution of the appeal, unless there is likely to be some extraordinary delay, the fact that the appeal cannot be heard in the immediate future could not justify a finding of special or exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    22 There are many persons who are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment who have never previously been convicted of any offence. That fact could not justify the relevant finding. Although there was evidence before us of the difficulties which the respondent faces and her concerns about the welfare of her three children I am not persuaded that the respondent’s circumstances are such that incarceration would be more damaging to her than many other offenders. 
     
      
    23 I have indicated that the possibility that an appeal may lead to an acquittal is a relevant consideration. However, because of the term of the respondent’s sentence that consideration is of minor significance in the present case.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion there is nothing in the respondent’s circumstances which could justify a finding under s 30AA of the Bail Act. In my opinion the application should be granted and the respondent’s bail revoked forthwith. 
     
      
    25 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    26 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    27 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are the application is granted and the respondent’s bail is revoked forthwith.

   JUDGMENT 1. The offender pleaded guilty before the Penrith District Court on 19 September 2007 before his Honour Knight to two counts of robbery in company, with a further count of robbery in company and one robbery to be taken into account on a Form 1. The offender was remanded in custody to 5 November 2007 at the Penrith District Court. On that date the matter came before me. I stood it over part heard to 21 November 2007. 2. On 21 November 2007 Ms Angell was released by me on s 11 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act bail. At the time I gave extensive reasons for taking the course I took and the terms of the s 11 bail were exposed by me at that time. The reasons I gave involved an examination of the facts, the objective seriousness of the offending conduct and an extensive review of the subjective features of the offender. My remarks made at that time are to be regarded as being incorporated in these remarks and as providing factors I have taken into account today in determining the sentencing disposition that I have determined. 3. Five months after her release on s.11 bail the offender was arrested in connection with an unrelated matter that is said to have had its origins in the events that occurred before the custody from which her s 11 bail order had released her. In respect of that matter (the newly arrested matter) she has been denied bail. She has been in custody on that matter from 3 April 2008 until today. Since her arrest on the matter the offender has been before Court, primarily on dates initially set for progress reports pursuant to the s 11 bail order. The purpose of those reports was intended to give the Court some insight into the offender’s rehabilitation progress in the community. The matter has not been finalised sooner, because the offender’s prospects for obtaining bail or perhaps of having the charge or charges dropped was unsettled. 4. If freedom was to be obtained for one reason or another it was anticipated Ms Angell would resume the s 11 bail given to her. The conditions of the s 11 bail were intended, among other things, to be stringent, concrete and focussed upon providing a basis for rehabilitation to occur. During the five and a half months some progress was made. There were, however, some matters I regarded as potential failures, which her counsel sought to explain as having no significance in terms of the overall rehabilitation. I will come to counsel’s explanations in a moment. Because of the offender’s arrest I am unable to say whether these areas I have described as possible failures were portents of worse to come or simply no more than hiccups on the way to rehabilitation. 5. Shortly after the s 11 bail the offender became pregnant, miscarried and became pregnant again. Her anticipated date of delivery is-- I put 15 October, but I see in your submissions you have got 15 November. GHABRIAL: Yes.6. The view of her progress during the five months on s 11 bail is most favourably set out in the submissions of Ms Ghabrial, her counsel, in written submissions handed to me today.  
     
      
      “3. Court set condition that she apply for TAFE course. Could not get into TAFE course so exercised ingenuity and went back to school to do Year 10, School certificate at Blacktown Youth College (refer to Probation & Parole Service progress report 27 March 2008).  
       
        
      4. Made application for and was placed on waiting list for personal support program with Centrelink.  5. Made application for and was placed on waiting list for housing with Department of Housing.  6. Missed a couple of appointments with psychologist due to miscarriage in January 2008 and further pregnancy, but did call ahead and reschedule those appointments.  7. ...She did not drink alcohol or take drugs during s 11 bail. 8. In February 2008 Probation & Parole opined that she appeared to suffer relapse in motivation (reference to her pregnancy), shortly before being taken into custody on further [other matters]. Note her evidence that she was in the first trimester of her pregnancy and quite ill during that time. Had only been able to attend to PPS appointment (7 March 2008 and 25 March 2008 for which a home visit on 26 March 2008 was arranged to accommodate her). This would explain her apparent relapse motivation. Note, not relapse in full sense, had done other positive things but for the situation with the miscarriage and pregnancy.  9. Had only called to reschedule two counselling appointments on 29 February 2008 and 26 March 2008 because ill due to pregnancy. Had explained this to the counsellor’s office.  10. Note her evidence that when she was ill with the pregnancy and when she earlier had the miscarriage in January 2008 this was something she had advised her psychologist and PPS about.”   
      
    The Plea  7. The Crown’s submission makes the following points: 
     
       
      
     “7. The plea was formally indicated on 17 September, being the date of trial. Some indication of a possible plea was given in the proceeding week. The plea was thus notified after arraignment but before date of trial.  
      
       
      
     8. A discount of fifteen per cent would be open for consideration.” 
       
     Guideline Judgment 8. The Crown in his submissions, which on any view demonstrates fairness to the offender, makes the following points: “11. In a number of authorities the CCA has held the Henry guideline to be relevant to sentencing for an offence of robbery in company [authorities cited].  
     
      
      12. The decision in  
      Henry  
      identified the following factors: 
       
        
       
      ( 
      1 
       ) Young offender with little or no criminal history. 
       
        
       
      ( 
      2 
       ) Weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
        
       
        
       
      ( 
      3 
      ) Limited degree of planning.  
       
        
       
      ( 
      4 
       ) Limited, if any actual violence, but a real threat thereof. 
       
        
       
      ( 
      5 
       ) Victim in vulnerable position, such as shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
        
       
        
       
      ( 
      6 
      ) Small amount taken. 
        
       
        
       
      ( 
      7 
       ) Plea of guilty. The significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case  
       
      as typical to cases seen by the courts. 
       
        
       
      13. Of these factors ( 
      2 
       ) have no application. Factor ( 
      5 
       ) does not appear relevant as it focuses on persons in especially vulnerable situations.  
       
        
       
      14. Factors ( 
      1 
      ) ( 
      3 
       ) ( 
      4 
      ) ( 
      6 
      ) are present. 
       
        
       
      15. Factor ( 
      6 
       ) is present, although in the present case the strength of the Crown case was moderated by the presence of another female of similar [appearance] to the offender.  
       
        
       
      16. Overall this last issue, plus the absence of a weapon would place the offender in a better position than the typical  
      Henry 
       offender. 
       
        
       
      17. Additionally, the offences here fall below the mid range of seriousness.  
      
    9. I accept the submissions made by the Crown as not only fairly made, but apposite to this case. I should also note whilst dealing with submissions of the Crown that when canvassed as to the appropriateness in terms of appellability of a minimum term of nine months and an additional term so that the overall sentence fell within the three-year range was appelable, the Crown indicated that while it was close, it fell within the range. A concession warmly accepted by defence counsel. 10. As to the aggravating features that Crown submitted the prior record was a factor that needs to be considered. His submission was:  
     
      
      “The offender has a prior conviction for a similar offence dealt with the Cobham Children’s Court in 2003. This should be viewed as a disentitlement to leniency rather than a specific aggravation to the offence, as set out in R v Veen.”  
       
        
      The is a submission again that I accept. He noted that s 21A(2)(e)(a) was not in existence at the time of this offence or at the date of conviction. He also conceded that the victims were not picked on because of their age, but rather, as it seemed to me, because they were there when the opportunistic decision by the accused was made to join in the robbery of them.  
      
    11. The Crown submitted that limited partial accumulation is required to reflect that these two offences were against different complainants. 12.  Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 is authority for the proposition that each case should reflect the criminality associated with it. This is done (a) by the sentence imposed, and, (b) by demonstrating its contribution to the totality of the sentence. The way in which it can demonstrate its contribution to totality is by accumulation. 13. I intend to pay obeisance to Pearce v The Queen (ante) by accumulating the sentences as I impose them by three months. However, the non parole period for the second offence will be three months shorter than for the first, making a total non parole period after discount of nine months. Rehabilitation Prospects 14. Because of the interruption to the s 11 bail I am not in the same position I would have been had the s 11 bail been completed to assess the offenders prospects of rehabilitation in the community. 15. I can say from a letter at hand to me and from her earlier efforts, that she appears to be strongly motivated to rehabilitate. She has the support of her mother. She has separated from her partner, who she did not regard as supporting her rehabilitation. I can also note that she made some progress in the period of five months or so that she had on s 11 bail. That progress is amply recorded in the past history of the case. 16. I intend to require supervision of her by Probation and Parole Service. Offenders should regard Probation and Parole as a service, or a resource, provided by the State to assist them in their rehabilitation. Ms Angell in particular should understand that a failure to progress her rehabilitation or the commission of a further offence would see her breached by the Probation and Parole in respect of the parole periods she is about to receive. In such circumstances her continued freedom may be jeopardised. Is there any matter that I have missed before I go to the formal sentencing? BORISH: Just that your Honour has taken into account the matter on the Form 1? Sentencing HIS HONOUR: 17. Monique Angell, you are convicted that you on 21 February 2007 at Emerton in the State of New South Wales, being then in company with Marama Arama and Selina Arama did rob Kimberley Driessen of her property, namely, a mobile phone and a wallet, containing a number of personal items. For that offence, but for the plea of guilty, I would have set a sentence of three and a half years. I have discounted that by 15 per cent making the overall sentence on my calculations one of two years, eleven months and twenty days. I set a non-parole period of nine months, to date from 10 January 2008. I have selected that date because you had been in custody for 274 days, which we earlier discussed as being nine months. That non-parole period will expire on 9 October, that is today 2008. 18. I find special circumstances, your youth, your first time in custody and your pregnant state are all matters that have influenced me to find special circumstances. When I say pregnant state I should say late term pregnant state. I set a balance of term of two years, two months and twenty days. That will expire on 8 January 2011. 19. I note that I take into account when setting that sentence the matter on the Form 1, which was originally on the indictment, but is a charge that you at Emerton, again in company with the same two co-offenders, did rob Leah Sams of her property, namely, a mobile phone. 20. In respect of the second offence to which you have pleaded guilty, that you on 21 February 2007 in the State of New South Wales, then being in company with Marama Arama and Selina Arama did rob Melody O’Keefe of her property, namely, a mobile phone. You are likewise convicted. 21. Because I am not taking into account those other two matters the overall sentence I would have set, but for the plea of guilty, is one of three years and three months. I have discounted that by five months. On my calculations strictly speaking the discount would be 4.95 months and I have decided that that is as close to five months as one could want. That results in an overall sentence of two years and ten months. I accumulate that sentence in this way; I set a non-parole period of six months, to date from 10 April 2008 and to expire on 9 October, that is today, 2008. I set a balance of term of two years and four months, to expire on 9 February 2011. I order you to be released to parole in respect of the offences I am dealing with on 9 October 2008, that is today. 22. Pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I make as a condition of your release that you will be supervised by Probation and Parole. Is there any other order I need to make? BORISH: No not from the Crown’s part your Honour.GHABRIAL: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I want to thank you both for you assistance throughout this matter. 23. Ms Angell, I wish you well, but you must understand Probation and Parole is there for two purposes. One, to guarantee to the community there is no more offending. But from your point of view, more importantly, to assist you rehabilitate. They are a resource and you should use them.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Murray Douglas Dale appears today for sentence in relation to two offences to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence to this court. He is also to be dealt with in relation to two related offences that are set out on a s 166 Criminal Procedure Act Certificate in accordance with the provisions of s 167 of that Act. 2 The offences to which he pleaded guilty are, firstly in time, that he on 6 October 2006 at Gulgong in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle, to wit an unregistered Toyota Hilux utility XOF 063, when it was involved in an impact occasioning the death of Gerard Haswell, and at the time of the impact the said Murray Douglas Dale was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to other persons. This is an offence brought pursuant to s 52(A)(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. There is no applicable standard non-parole period for that offence.3 The second offence to which the offender pleaded guilty is an offence alleging that he between 6 October 2006 and 25 October 2006 in the State of New South Wales did an act, to wit provide false information to police and other persons and conceal evidence, and did otherwise approach Justin Turner, Luke Turner and Jimmy Dean endeavouring to get them to provide a false account to police with intent to pervert the course of justice. This is an offence contrary to s 319 Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. Again, there is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 4 Although the second offence in time has a greater maximum penalty, it is clear that the more serious of the two offences is the first offence of dangerous driving causing death to Mr Haswell. The two matters on the s 166 certificate, which are integral in reality to the facts with which I am concerned are an offence of - as it is expressed in the certificate - driving with three unrestrained passengers, for which the maximum penalty is one penalty unit, and an offence of “use unregistered registrable class A motor vehicle” (sic) for which there is a maximum penalty of twenty penalty units. I note in passing that all the other offences on the certificate one related, the others - back up offences - are, in due course, to be dismissed.5 In this matter the proceedings commenced before me at the Orange sittings of the Dubbo list of the District Court. I was provided with what was literally a box of documents comprising two versions of the Crown brief and some other material, and ultimately a statement of facts was tendered. However, an understanding of that statement of facts, which appears to me to have been prepared on the committal of the offender, needed examination closely of the voluminous other material which was provided to the court. From the totality of the material tendered in court, including other exhibits that have been provided by the parties, and of course having regard to the submissions of the parties in respect of the objective facts, I conclude the facts in relation to the two principal charges are as follows.6 Firstly, in relation to the offence of dangerous driving causing death, the offender on 6 October 2006 lived at a property called, Westwood, which is described in the facts available to me as being approximately six kilometres west of Gulgong. Mr Dale at the time of these relevant events, as I understand the matter, was thirty-two years of age, he was a married man with children and was a farmer, as were his parents and, as I understand it, other generations beforehand of his family in this district. 7 On 6 October 2006 during the day he was working at another property described as “Kenobies”, which was located approximately two and half kilometres east of Gulgong, approximately eight and a half kilometres from his own property. After work at about 5.30 pm, in company with some men by the names of Chris Jackson, Jimmy Dean, Anthony Westerway and two juveniles, LT and JT, he drank some alcohol at a shearing shed until about 8pm. 8 At some time during this period the offender received a telephone call from a friend of his called Nicholas Wright enquiring as to whether or not he and the deceased Gerard Haswell could go shooting at the offender’s farm, which I take to be Westwood, although the Dale family apparently own at least two properties in the district. The offender returned to his own property, and eventually Mr Wright, Mr Haswell, a man called Peter Curran, Ian Vale and a woman named Justine Ford came to the property to go on what was described in the statement of facts as a “hunting party”. The offender’s family owned another property called “Suitors” located about one and a half kilometres south of Gulgong. 9 Whilst the offender was at home at Westwood a neighbour of that property had rung the offender’s wife to tell him that there was a dog amongst the sheep on his property. The offender was initially proposing to go over to that property but ultimately decided not to go. The circumstances of a dog being on the property became quite relevant to matters more pertinent in most respects to the second charge in the indictment.10 The offender apparently, apart from a registrable vehicle, owned an unregistered motor vehicle described as a Toyota Hilux tabletop utility. It had numberplates fitted but was effectively a farm vehicle used as a shooting vehicle. It had a number of large spotlights fitted on the roof. I have seen a photograph of the vehicle. It appears to have some type of roll bar or protective bar across the roof and around the side and front of the vehicle. When interviewed on 10 October 2006 the offender admitted that the back brakes did not work and that the front brakes were inadequate. In fact, when the front brakes were eventually inspected by relevantly qualified police, it was found the foot pedal did not operate the front brake. It is clear that this vehicle had been in this condition for at least some weeks, as was admitted by the offender, and it was in no state to have been driven at all, let alone on a public road.11 The offender went shooting with Justine Ford and Mr Wright in the front passenger seat. Mr Wright was in possession of a rifle. The three other men, Mr Curran, Mr Dale and Mr Haswell were on the tabletop at the back of the truck. I understand these men, or at least some of them, had firearms. None of the passengers on the real tabletop were either restrained or could be restrained and clearly the tabletop was not designed for, or capable of, safely conveying passengers. The party shot some deer and a kangaroo and a rabbit. 12 There was asserted in the facts that the offender’s driving was criticised to some extent by at least one of the passengers whilst driving, as I understood it, on the Westwood property. Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that this criticism, or the observations of his driving at that time, is not of relevance to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence with which the offender is concerned. This aspect of the matter, in my view, is disconnected in time and circumstances to the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased, although it is true to say that at the relevant period of time the offender was driving the same unregistered vehicle with unrestrained passengers as he was later on when the deceased was killed. 13 I note in relation to his driving, as I understood it on the Westwood property, that some passengers saw no problems with his driving, and such criticisms that were made on close examination of their versions were ultimately of relatively minor character.14 Eventually, after the initial shooting exercise, it was decided to drive on a public road to another property approximately twelve kilometres from Westwood. The offender drove the motor vehicle along what was called the Spring Bridge Road, as I understood it. On this occasion Nicholas Wright sat in the cabin with Peter Curran. Ms Ford moved to the back with Mr Vale and Mr Haswell. My understanding is Mr Curran was sitting on the near side of the tray, Ms Ford was sitting in the middle between the two men, and Mr Haswell, who was carrying a firearm in one hand, was travelling behind the driver standing up. I understand that he travelled with a hand on, or gripping, the roll bar. 15 There are various estimates of speed of the offender immediately before the deceased fell from the vehicle. One could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the vehicle was travelling greater than fifty kilometres per hour. There are a range of estimates as low as thirty up to sixty kilometres per hour, but the general consensus was that the speed was no greater than fifty kilometres per hour, probably somewhere between forty and fifty kilometres per hour. I would have understood that the vehicle was driving within the applicable speed limit.16 At approximately 9.30pm, about four kilometres from Westwood, an animal described as a possum appeared across the road. The offender either swerved or moved to avoid the animal, although there is some confusion amongst those present as to whether the vehicle moved to the left or the right in their various versions of events. In fact, Justine Ford, admittedly sitting at the back of the vehicle, did not believe the vehicle swerved at all, but understood or thought the vehicle was negotiating a slight bend and she felt hardly any deviation. The vehicle, at least in part, left the roadway briefly and then returned to the roadway. I would have understood this to suggest the vehicle moved primarily to the left. However, a combination of circumstances, including the unrestrained position of the passengers and the action of the vehicle, caused Mr Haswell to lose his grip, if in fact he had a grip at that point, and to fall to the roadway. Someone yelled out, “Ged’s off”, which was obviously a reference to the deceased. The vehicle stopped. 17 Some comment was made by Mr Wright to the offender, although in the circumstances one could not conclude with confidence that it was necessarily a reference to the manner of driving rather than the general circumstances. I must say on several occasions the Crown particularly focussed on what Mr Wright had to say about relevant matters. This matter was not addressed in the submissions made to me, but I have some reservations about the reliability of Mr Wright’s account in some respects, particularly when one has regard to the circumstances in which he came to give a truthful version in relation to relevant events, which is reflected upon by Charteris DCJ, and to which I will refer later. It must be pointed out that some of the observations made by Mr Wright are not confirmed by other persons. Ultimately it should be pointed out it is difficult to come to particular conclusions on some of these aspects because of the conflicts between various witnesses.18 In any event, Mr Haswell was lying on the ground unconscious and he was bleeding very heavily from the head and had a faint pulse. It is clear everyone appreciated that he was seriously injured, but the facts are that no immediate aid was provided to him at that point. There was some debate and discussion as to how the matter should be handled. There were concerns expressed not just by the offender but by other people present about the state of the vehicle, the possession of firearms or the possession of a particular firearm that may not have been registered. There was some dispute about whether emergency services should be contacted or the victim should be taken immediately to hospital. And there was concern amongst those present about the unregistered state of the vehicle, as I have said. 19 The evidence available does not establish in my view that this delay was solely the fault of the offender. As I have said, there appears from the versions I have read some degree of panic amongst the group, and certainly an element of group mentality went into the relevant decision making.20 There was a delay in leaving the scene. Some local witnesses heard some of the discussion, including raised voices, and estimated that this took place for up to ten to fifteen minutes. Certainly it would seem that approximately ten minutes after Mr Haswell fell to the ground passed before the offender in company with Mr Wright drove back to the offender’s property at Westwood, transferred the victim into a registered motor vehicle, a Nissan utility, and then drove to the Gulgong Hospital. Medical records suggest that they arrived at the Gulgong Hospital at 10.07pm.21 Before I go on to subsequent events, there are some important matters that need to be analysed from the objective facts. The manner of driving dangerous, as established from the evidence, was driving a vehicle with brakes that did not work on a public road and in those circumstances manoeuvring to avoid an obstacle that ought have been foreseen to be on the road, although I am not satisfied the avoidance involved any violent movement of the motor vehicle, and driving with unrestrained passengers on the back tray at the time. There is no suggestion of excessive speed. In fact, although the vehicle clearly was in a dangerous condition, the speed was objectively modest. 22 Although there is some reference in the statement of facts to prior consumption of alcohol, it is not part of the Crown case that the offender was affected by alcohol at the time of this incident and this is not relied upon as a relevant factor. 23 In assessing the objective facts for the purposes of sentencing, one is required to have very close regard to several decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, principally Regina v Whyte & Others (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 and Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. Jurisic, of course, was the very first guideline judgment in New South Wales and set a guideline for sentencing for offences of dangerous driving causing death and grievous bodily harm, absent statutory aggravating factors. As was said in a range of decisions, including Jurisic, Regina v Henry (1999) 47 NSWLR 346 at 357, Regina v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 (at 349, 363 and 369) and in the decision of Whyte (at 264-270), the guideline judgments were intended to be indicative only, they were not intended to be applied to every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing judges but represented a relevant indicator in sentencing for offences of this type. The general purpose of guideline judgments, as I said, is set out in those various judgments. Particularly in the decision of Whyte, the Court of Criminal Appeal reconsidered the guideline judgment in Jurisic in light of the High Court’s judgment in Wong v Regina, where the fixing of a guideline for Commonwealth sentencing was overturned by the High Court and because of recent decisions to that time concerned with what could be called the ‘black and white’ character of the concept of abandonment of responsibility. The deep gap that existed between a state of abandonment of responsibility and momentary inattention and/or misjudgement, was discussed, for example, in the case of Foster to which I was referred, from 2001 in the judgment of Badgery-Parker J. 24 The Jurisic guideline was altered in two significant respects. In relation to the first leg, as it has been called, of the guideline judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Whyte held that a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. The second limb in forming the guideline to be applied varied what was held in Jurisic by holding that where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full-time custodial head sentence of less than three years imprisonment in the case of death and two years in the case of grievous bodily harm would not generally be appropriate [229]. 25 The learned Chief Justice said in the case of a low level of moral culpability: “A lower sentence will of course be appropriate.” He went on to say: 
     
      
      “The guideline is to reiterate a ‘guide’ or a ‘check’. The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all the factors required to be taken into account by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act [232].” 
      
     
     
      
      Spigelman CJ said: 
      
     
     
      
      “This guideline focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender also require consideration for reasons I have given above when discussing the proportionality cases, particularly R v Todd, this approach reflects the principle of proportionality as discussed in those cases [223].” 
      
     
     
      
      His Honour went on to say: 
      
     
     
      
      “Insofar as this guideline involves a two step approach to sentencing, it is, in my opinion, as a ‘check’ for the reasons given, consistent with an ultimate discretion that involves the exercise of a broad discretion sometimes referred to as instinctive synthesis [234].” 
      
    26 Of course since that judgment the instinctive synthesis approach has been amplified and confirmed in the High Court judgment of Markarian [2005] HCA 25. The guideline of course was concerned with a typical case, as it has sometimes been described. The characteristics of a typical case being set out, for example, at [204] of the decision in the guideline. This matter in many respects fits within the rubric of a “typical case” if such a typical case is even capable of definition. I appreciate there is a dispute in this case as to the extent of any weight to be given to any remorse expressed by the offender, but on the other hand a plea of guilty in this matter is not one of “limited utilitarian value”, and I further point out that the victim in this matter was not a stranger to the offender. In relation to the matters identified in Whyte and Jurisic as aggravating factors, these aggravating factors of course have been set out again in Whyte at para 216. 27 The particular aggravating factors arising here are that at least three people were put at risk by driving a dangerous motor vehicle on a public road where those people were not restrained. The length of the journey contemplated was, as I understand it, the twelve kilometres to the other property and back again, although the impact occurred after four kilometres. I note the nature of the injuries suffered by the deceased is of course part of the elements of the offence, in that the deceased unfortunately died as a result of his injuries. The relevant maximum penalty with which I am concerned here, which is always an important matter in any sentencing exercise, is in fact as a result of the death of the deceased. 28 Although I have referred to the fact that there was some warning given by at least one person to the offender about driving on his own property, it could not be said that the particular driving giving rise to the charge involves any ignorance of warnings on his part. I have read the accounts of those present when driving on the property, as I have said, and I have noted the conflict between the versions. Some people, including the woman who was sitting in the passenger seat, were comfortable with the driving. Such criticisms, as were made of his conduct on the property, to my mind were, in the scheme of things, not of a serious character. Be that as it may, the driving prior to the falling off of Mr Haswell, including the movement of the car to avoid the possum, arose out of the circumstances then confronting the offender, not as a result of any prior course of conduct other than that identified in the particulars of dangerous driving to which I have referred earlier.29 Allowing for these aggravating factors, but noting the absence of speed and alcohol as contributing factors, it could not be said, in my view, that the conduct involved amounted to a high level of moral culpability. The victim fell from the vehicle because he was unrestrained and because it would seem the car shifted direction to avoid collision with an animal. Whilst there was a potential risk at all relevant times because of the absence of brakes and the unrestrained situation with the passengers, and of course bearing in mind that s 52A Crimes Act is concerned with objective risk which may be potential and actual, the conduct of the offender that caused the death of the deceased was primarily limited to a very short period of time, even allowing for the distance contemplated to be travelled with unrestrained passengers in the absence of a proper braking mechanism. 30 I note at the time the deceased was a friend of the offender, and Mr Wright had sought the offender’s permission to come to his property to shoot on his property. Although this is not a mitigating factor, it is, as I said, a feature different from the typical case. I should point out of course, in the context of what the High Court has said subsequently in Markarian, an assessment of the varying aggravating factors and their significance in the sentencing exercise will vary depending upon the facts of the case. The circumstance of intoxication or substance abuse might, in a particular case, be seen as an aggravating factor far more serious than the number of people put at risk by particular driving which is absent features such as excessive speed and intoxication.31 I accept, as the Crown has put to me, that the section is designed to protect road users, not just the victim. The Crown took me to the decision of R v Errington [1999] NSWCCA 18 at [27-28], and of course I accept and acknowledge the force and wisdom of the observations of Dunford J in that case. No issue as to contributory negligence arises in this matter, nor is it relevant, as was held in Errington. 32 Assumption of some of the risk involved is itself part of the factual matrix, but of course there is no evidence that the victim knew that the car was going to change direction. Of course I bear in mind that the offender must have foreseen that people would have been standing on the back of the tray. It would appear that they had done so earlier in the evening, and it must have been reasonably foreseen, given the fact that they were out there shooting animals, that an animal may come onto the road and that he may in some way have to avoid it. In relation to matters concerning the application of the guideline judgment that has been discussed in other cases, I note what has been said in another decision referred to: Regina v Errington (2005) 157 A Crim R 553, at [40] (involving a different appellant than the 1999 case):  
     
      
      “It is erroneous to treat the Whyte guideline as a starting point rather than a reference point. The reference point is not the same thing as a starting point so long as appropriate adjustments are made in accordance with the guideline.” 
      
    33 In Regina v Berg (2004) 41 MVR 399 Howie JA, with whom the learned Chief Justice and the learned Chief Judge at Common Law agreed, said at para 21: 
     
      
      “The factors in the list set out in Whyte as indicative of a typical case to not operate as a check list for the presence or absence of characteristics having some mathematical relationship with sentence to be imposed, they merely describe the typical case and were not intended to circumscribe the sentencing judge’s discretion.” 
      
    34 Of course these observations are entirely consistent with the observations made in Markarian reflecting upon earlier High Court dicta about lack of mathematical precision required in sentencing (R v Wong). In fact there is a lack of mathematical precision that it is possible to undertake in sentencing when weighing competing considerations. While the guideline focuses on the objective circumstances of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender may require consideration and may be deserving of considerable weight: Regina v Tzanis (2005) 44 MVR 160, of course referred to in a different language by Spigelman CJ in Whyte. Furthermore, the aggravating factors listed in Whyte remain “illustrative” not definitive of what is capable of representing either abandonment of responsibility - to use the words in Jurisic - or a high level of moral culpability - to use the words in Whyte (see Regina v Errington (No 2) [36]).35 With regard to the length of the journey, it is the intended journey not the journey attenuated by the collision that is to be considered. But in Regina v Takoai (2004) 149 ACR 593 her Honour has pointed out that the danger created by the length of the journey will vary according to other circumstances, such as the time at which the journey is undertaken, the amount of traffic and the locale. I bear in mind that this was in the evening and I would assume, and I read no evidence to the contrary, that traffic was extremely light. There appears to be nothing in the conditions that might have suggested danger in driving, putting aside of course the dangerous aspect of driving a motor vehicle with no brakes. There is no reference to any other traffic at relevant times.36 With regard to the issue of what is moral culpability and how it can be measured, in Regina v Gardiner [2004] NSWCCA 365 Smart AJ, with whom the Chief Justice and Grove J agreed, said at para 41: 
     
      
      “In determining the degree of moral culpability regard is had to all the circumstances. On occasions it is the combination of a number of circumstances which leads to the conclusion that there is a high degree of culpability. It is erroneous to take a restrictive view of the circumstances that can lead to the conclusion that there is a high degree of moral culpability.” 
      
    37 And of course there are the observations in the decision of Errington (No 2), where Mason P, with whom Grove and Buddin JA agreed, set out the various matters at paras [26-27]. The learned President said that there was a wide spectrum of behaviour indicative of differing levels of moral culpability, indeed differing levels of abandonment. It is not required that cases be assigned to one or the other two pigeon holes marked respectively momentary inattention or misjudgement and abandonment of responsibility. His Honour was referring to what Simpson JA said in Regina v Khatter (2000) NSWCCA 32, in keeping with the observations of Badgery-Parker J in Foster.38 It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the driving offence was a case of misjudgement. It was submitted that this was an exceptional case which calls for consideration of a non-custodial sentence. I do not believe that this is an exceptional case that calls, in effect, for no penalty, so to speak, in the sense of a non-custodial penalty. But there are objective factors in the context of the Whyte criteria that make this offence short of a case of high moral culpability, as discussed in the authorities to which I have referred. 39 Of course, then there are, in fixing the appropriate sentence, the relevant mitigating factors arising from favourable subjective circumstances. The Crown submits that this is not a case of misjudgement, not of misjudgement in the momentary sense certainly. His submissions are centred on, quite properly, a period over time where any alleged misjudgement had occurred. If the conduct of the offender could be categorised by the word “misjudgement”, it was misjudgement over a period of time not concerned with a momentary lapse on the part of the offender, having regard to all the particulars of the dangerous driving.40 There is a degree of moral culpability to be identified. Whilst it is not high, it is not at the lowest level. It is extremely difficult for a human such as myself to quantify such matters. The concept involves the consideration of many matters, some of which were debated, in the most amiable of senses of course, with the learned Crown prosecutor at one point. Ultimately I would categorise the moral culpability of the offender on a synthesis of all the objective circumstances as at the lower end of the mid level, if that expression can be seen to have any proper meaning. The offence itself focuses on the objective factors, which of course go to the issue of assessing the moral culpability.41 The events upon the offender’s arrival at the hospital and subsequent events give rise to the second charge. The offender before arriving at the hospital had taken the victim in the unregistered motor vehicle back to Westwood and then on to the hospital in a registered vehicle. There was a diversion which would appear to be of at least, on my calculation, one kilometre, although it is difficult to measure, and there was a loss of time. It is argued that changing vehicles enabled the offender to take the victim in a car that was capable of being driven at a higher speed than the unregistered vehicle. Even allowing for this it seems again that ultimately there was lost time. There may have been some element of self interest in this, but I am satisfied ultimately that the self interest that has been identified at various points in the Crown’s submissions arose out of a confusion of considerations, including the reaction engendered by panic.42 Without any medical evidence to the contrary, I am unable to conclude that this delay contributed to the victim’s death. Whilst I have no doubt that the medical staff at Gulgong Hospital are highly professional and took heroic efforts to save the deceased, the victim suffered catastrophic life threatening injuries, and the capacity of the local hospital to prevent death or even sustain life without dramatic neurosurgical intervention, which was not available, must have been very limited indeed.43 However, the delay in getting the victim to hospital and the subsequent false story told to police does reflect adversely on the offender and others involved in this, and it does reflect a greater degree of interest in themselves and their own circumstances than care of the victim, or the truth of the situation at that particular time. I believe in the context of the wider facts, that is the friendly relationship, as I understood it, between the victim and the offender, the good character of the offender, and the fact that the death of the deceased was an unintended consequence of what was meant to be an enjoyable leisure activity, indicates clearly that was done was done out of a degree of panic.44 The offender gave a false story on arrival at the hospital to the doctor, critically to the victim’s father and the police. One of the features of the facts available to me is that it would seem, bearing in mind it must have appeared that the offender was at least in some way responsible for the victim’s death, that the victim’s family offered compassion to the offender and the opportunity of, as I understood it, staying at their house, or staying with them, to be comforted. The offender gave a false version to the police, and it is what is provided to the police in part that forms the particulars of the second charge. Both Mr Wright and the offender maintained a story throughout that night, that the victim had fallen from the utility while they were at the property, Suitors, that there were only three people in the vehicle and they were looking for a dog amongst sheep. 45 The victim had passed away within an hour of his arrival at the hospital. In relation to this matter the offender provided a false statement to police on 9 October. He went through a false reconstruction of what had happened to the victim, and identified the wrong location consistent with this false statement. This statement and the offender’s demonstration led the police to conclude that it was a farming accident, bearing in mind that the physical injuries to the deceased were consistent with the version given by the offender, which was itself consistent, in a very general sense, with the way in which the victim had in fact been injured but in a different location. The injuries to the deceased were consistent with the victim falling from a moving vehicle.46 On 10 October 2006 however, Justine Ford attended upon the medical practitioner who treated the deceased on 6 October and gave a true account of events. Mr Wright was being interviewed on 10 October 2006 when the offender attended the Gulgong Police Station with his wife. It is clear on this evidence, and this is a relevant matter to some of the matters advanced unfavourably to the offender by the Crown, that the offender’s conscience had got the better of him, and his family, bearing in mind he must have revealed the truth to his family, persuaded him to go to the authorities. He, on that date, participated in a short interview and acknowledged that the incident had in fact occurred on a public road in the general circumstances to which I have referred. 47 He told police that he could not lie any further, and he admitted to lying as to how many people were in the car and as to which vehicle he had been driving. He admitted that it was dangerous to have so many on the back of the utility, and he said that he had panicked. Of this I have no doubt, and this caused he and others to abandon their common sense. Of course the offender’s involvement with the second offence did not end with these false versions to police. Inquiries of course began to focus on the extent to which alcohol was a contributing factor, and other persons who may have shed light on this matter were spoken to. 48 The offender again spoke to police on 25 October 2006 in company with the two juveniles, LT and JT. The police made an arrangement for these young males to speak to police later in the company of their parents. They were brothers. Before they gave their statements however, the offender said to them, “Just tell them that I had two beers, one when we finished work and one when I went back to take you home. Just remember that.” He also said that he would write out a letter for them to remember what to say, and LT was provided with a handwritten piece of paper which contained a version the offender wished to relate to police. The offender also told Jimmy Dean to tell the police that he only had two beers, and told him to tell the police a story concerning how they came to buy a carton of beer. The versions of the brothers, Jimmy Dean and Chris Jackson, as to approaches made by the offender to some or all of them, corroborate one another.49 I note in relation to the initial lie told by the offender as to the circumstances of the offence, that it did involve by definition an admission of some responsibility for the death of the deceased. But the concern was directed on his part at other aspects of the matter, including the fact that he knew that he was driving on a public road with an unroadworthy vehicle and he had unrestrained passengers, which clearly contributed to the victim’s death, and clearly these matters were matters of self interest, whether engendered by panic or not. It is to be borne in mind that three to four days later he went back and sought to correct the story. He could have held out for much longer against the inevitable, which would of course have aggravated the circumstances of the second offence. 50 Then fifteen to sixteen days later he showed glimpses of further self interest. To my mind these matters reflect human failings. They can occur with people even of good character. Ultimately the conduct of the offender over this period of time, reflected in count 2, is to be considered as lessening the weight to be given to claims of contrition. Some suggestion was made, as I understood the submissions, that it reflected upon the moral culpability of the first offence. In my view this cannot be so. Conduct and the character of consciousness of guilt in this case is not part of the moral culpability for the offence of driving in a manner dangerous. I would have thought what the learned Chief Justice said in Whyte makes that clear.51 I bear in mind the offender confessed ultimately on the urging of his family, and the responses to his family’s urging are themselves a reflection of what one would expect of a person of good character to do, even if his good sense had been abandoned for some period of time, having made a series of mistakes. His continued attempt afterwards to cover his tracks was, on one view of it, limited. It was ultimately unnecessary because the issue of alcohol has faded away.52 In the Crown’s submissions the Crown reflected upon the conduct after the incident as suggesting that the offender thought it more important to protect himself than to give aid to Mr Haswell. If the offender’s conduct be characterised as that in the context of what I said earlier, there are elements of a joint decision being made in relation to this matter, as the various versions of those present make clear. The offender is said not to have any genuine remorse in this matter reflecting upon what occurred, particularly immediately after, and relying upon what was said by Mr Wright, I believe to some extent out of self interest. It does reflect, as I say, adversely upon the weight to be given to any expressions of remorse, but I do not believe ultimately that the remorse that has been expressed by the offender could be said not to be genuine.53 Mr Wright was convicted of hindering a police investigation, and on 31 March 2008 at the Dubbo District Court he was dealt with pursuant to s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have Charteris DCJ’s remarks on sentence. It is clear from his Honour’s remarks of the facts presented to him that Mr Wright admitted his wrong doing in this purported cover up because of the offender’s sudden appearance at the police station with his wife. I note Mr Wright pleaded to a lesser offence than that originally levelled against him and the offender. Of course the offender had more to gain than Mr Wright from this cover up, if we can call it that, but it seems to me that the offender’s conscience came a little earlier than that of Mr Wright, although Mr Wright of course bore no ultimate responsibility for Mr Haswell’s tragic death. No parity issue arises out of Mr Wright’s sentence for quite obvious reasons. But it is a matter to be taken into account. 54 In relation to the pleas of guilty the matter was listed as a committal for trial, and a number of witnesses were to be called to give evidence. As I understood it, this was to occur in April this year. Before the evidence was called, the offender indicated an intention to enter pleas of guilty at the Local Court and he was committed to the District Court for sentence on the principal charges.55 It must be said there is substantial utilitarian value in the pleas of guilty. Thomson and Houlton sets out a range of discounts that may apply to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in a particular case. The offender cannot receive the highest discount usually allowed despite pleading guilty at the Local Court, bearing in mind that the proceedings at the Local Court had involved arrangements being made for witnesses to attend. However, I am of the view, in accordance with the guideline judgment and in accordance with subsequent decisions, including Sharma, that the discount on the otherwise appropriate sentences for each matter ought to be twenty per cent, having regard to the timing of the plea and the substantial savings in time and cost to the community in the pleas of guilty. This is generally in accord with the submissions of the prosecution.56 The offender has no criminal convictions. He does have a conviction at the Gulgong Local Court a few years ago for carrying an unrestrained dog on the back of a moving vehicle on a street, for which he was fined a hundred dollars and ordered to pay court costs of fifty-two dollars. I do not relate that offence to the circumstances of this matter. As for his traffic record, or other traffic record, he has traffic infringement notices issued to him for exceeding the speed limit by not more than fifteen kilometres per hour on 4 October 2005, not wearing a seatbelt on 16 January 2002 and 6 November 1999, and exceeding the speed limit by more than thirty kilometres per hour on 3 April 1998. He was issued with a learner’s licence in October 1990 and an unrestricted licence in June 1991. Although there appears to be some error in the traffic record because the provisional licence appears to have been issued on the same day. Be that as it may, noting the matters on the record, it could not be said that his traffic record shows the offender has a consistent disregard for road safety. Whilst his traffic record is not exceptional, it does not give any indication of an attitude of lack of responsibility as might be reflected in the case of prior convictions for drinking driving, driving in a manner dangerous or driving in a speed dangerous to the public, or other traffic offences of a more serious nature than those for which he received infringement notices.57 I have a Probation and Parole Service report dated 16 June 2008 in relation to his social conduct. It notes the offender is a social drinker and a family man. It notes the background of the offender, to which I will come to in a moment, his father’s age and the fact that the offender bears the responsibility for managing the family properties. It notes the financial circumstances are difficult at the moment with the drought. The property apparently managed by the offender has been receiving two years of drought assistance, at least up until the time of the report. The report notes that the offender comes from a very close and supportive family and he has successfully conducted the family’s affairs as an adult, and he has a close and supportive relationship with his wife and children. He does not take any prohibited drugs. He was born in April 1974 and is now thirty-four years of age. 58 He did not give evidence before me, but I am prepared to accept on the totality of the material from various histories given to a psychologist and the Probation and Parole Service report, and from the character evidence that he has adduced, that he was educated to Year 10, he has undertaken a series of courses of an agricultural and related character, and, as I said, he has worked all his life on family properties. He has two small daughters aged four and two and he has been married for seven years. He has qualifications as a wool classer and a welder, amongst other matters. There are a large number of referees from different aspects of the Gulgong community and beyond who have provided references attesting to the good character of his family, who are respected farmers within the Gulgong district for a number of generations, and the offender is described as a family orientated man, who is generous, usually cheerful and helpful to neighbours and other persons within the community. The local stock and station agent describes him as “Compassionate, thoughtful and caring” with “an extraordinary work ethic. 59 His family are regarded as “quite decent law abiding people.” A local retired solicitor has described the offender’s conduct as “totally out of character”. This gentleman found the offender to be “quite conscientious, hard working, generous and caring.” He finds it difficult to reconcile the offender’s actions, both in relation to his driving and his subsequent conduct with the person with whom he is acquainted. The offender has expressed his remorse to that person and others. Business people with whom he has dealt speak of his honesty and responsibility and his personal affairs and his business affairs. A former local policeman described him as “honest, trustworthy and a man of integrity”, and he regarded the offender during his time in Gulgong as a “law abiding and an all round good decent person.” Several of the referees speak of the offender’s expressions of regret for his conduct and that his conduct was uncharacteristic. 60 A medical practitioner at Mudgee treated the offender since 2007 for symptoms of depression, obviously reactive to his current circumstances. The offender has presented as anxious and suffering a difficulty in sleeping and enjoyment of life. The doctor felt that he was suffering from anxiety, with some features of what the doctor described as post traumatic stress disorder. He referred the offender to a psychologist. I have no doubt of course that the offender is reflecting symptoms reactive to the circumstances in which he now finds himself.61 Today I was given a report from Dr Glenys Caterson, who is a medical practitioner, it would appear now practising in Dubbo. She was present at the time that Mr Dale drove the deceased to Gulgong District Hospital the night he died. She said she was in charge of resuscitation procedures. She said at the time Murray was very helpful and assisted with CPR and lifting him into the hospital. She said that Murray was “quite genuinely distressed at the time and immediately after while he was at the hospital.” She understood what she calls the “subsequent problems” that have resulted from this court case. 62 She saw the offender recently in September 2008 and she noted he was distressed, some suicidal ideation and was concerned for the impact of his current predicament upon his wife, his children and his parents. He stated that he had lost a friend, a true friend through a terrible accident and was terribly sorry for his actions. He said never a day passed that he does not think about that night, and she believed that his condition - depressive symptoms and the like - was reactive to this situation. He was placed on Zoloft. She said he needs counselling. I have taken her report into account, both as to relevant subjective matters to the sentencing process and reflecting upon circumstances pertinent to particularly count 2. 63 The psychologist, having undertaken a Personal Assessment Inventory (PAI) noted an elevation on the depression scale and noted symptoms consistent with a significant depressive experience. The offender had feelings of sadness, loss of interest in normal activities and other enjoyment of life. He complained of anxiety and feelings of stress. There was no history of antisocial behaviour, problems with empathy, moodiness, impulsivities, suspiciousness or hostility. There was no significant alcohol and no drug dependence problems. On assessment, through the inventory, he was described as being self critical and pessimistic, dwelling on past failures and lost opportunities, blaming himself for setbacks in life. He had transient thoughts of self harm, but there are no other abnormalities. Certainly there are no psychological conditions which could contribute to the assessment of his criminality. 64 The psychologist was not, in my view, qualified to express any medical opinions, but he did say the offender presented with symptoms consistent with a person suffering a major depressive illness and a post traumatic stress disorder. He undertook two counselling sessions and requires further counselling. I do not believe the psychologist’s opinions are compromised by some self serving statements made by the offender in relation to the second offence, and I believe that there are some limitations to the opinions by reasons of the qualifications of the reporter.65 The offender has written a document addressed to the court, as I understand it, reflecting upon the impact of what has happened. He makes the point that the words, “if only” had been played over and over again, and constantly driving past the scene of the incident is a constant reminder of what happened, and the event has had a significant effect on the offender’s life as it will do into the future.66 I have a statement of the offender’s monthly duties on the property over the period from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, and it sets out a large number of seasonal activities which I have taken into account in considering the ultimate disposal of this matter. There are not exceptional circumstances of hardship I would have thought arising out of that material, nor are they urged to be considered that way. But the matters within that report and in the character evidence reveal that the offender is an industrious person within the community. He has a contribution to make to the community and in my view this is a relevant factor to the orders that I have foreshadowed.67 The father of the deceased read a victim impact statement concerning the effect of the deceased’s death upon himself and his wife. The deceased was, as I understood it, unmarried without children, but he was a young man with his life ahead of him. He was a valued member of the local community. He was productive and industrious and properly well loved by his family. The family feels a great sadness at the fact that their son’s life has been cruelly and prematurely brought to an end without the deceased having the opportunity to achieve his potential and to achieve his aspirations in his life, and particularly in business and his sporting interests, having his own family and the like. 68 I accept that the deceased’s death occurring suddenly was a very cruel blow, and the effect on the family has been made much greater by reason of the events immediately after his death when the father of the deceased was given a false story as to his son’s death. I note that a previous impact statement which tended to concentrate more on criticising the offender was withdrawn by the Crown. I read that document of course. I had to first of all read it to assess it but it is no longer relied upon.69 I note however, as it might fairly be understood, that the parents of the deceased are very bitter towards the offender, not only because of his actions causing the death of the deceased. In fact, as I said, there was an offer of compassion from them to the offender, notwithstanding the fact there may have been some suggestion the offender was ultimately responsible. The bitterness stems from the way the offender handled the situation. The bitterness, anger and of course distress is very much to be expected. I am required to take into account the material within the victim impact statement pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 70 In fairness to Mr Haswell (Snr) what I have said is no criticism of him. The reactions of the parents of the deceased are very natural reactions to be expected from most, if not all people, and I note that he read his statement with dignity and I would expect, great courage.71 It should be understood however that the sentencing of offenders for crimes is not to be undertaken in a context of emotion, vengeance, bitterness and the like. It is to be undertaken in accordance with the law and in the context of recognising the various purposes of sentencing that are to be considered pursuant to s 3A and all other relevant matters. Retribution, as it is expressed as a purpose of sentencing, is not about revenge. This court and other courts regularly are required, very unfortunately and in very difficult circumstances for the judge, to sentence offenders responsible for the deaths of others. The conduct in question converge from the very deliberate to the very malicious to the negligent and the inadvertent. The sanctions of the law and the objective seriousness of the offending are not measured solely by the consequences of the actions of the offender, or even the views of individual judges, but are to be assessed in the context of the character of the offence charged, the relevant objective circumstances, but knowing always that relevant objective circumstances need to be considered in the light of matters of mitigation that may arise from subjective circumstances. The sentence imposed is not an expression of value for a lost life.72 In respect of the sentencing of the offender in regard to the dangerous driving case, I have had regard to several authorities to which I have been referred: Regina v Vitasovic (2000), Regina v Pisciuneri [2007] NSWCCA 265, particularly between [53] through to [77], Regina v Katoa [2000] NSWCCA 223, and of course Errington. I have also, in the context of dealing with the second charge, had regard to Regina v Giang. 73 I have been helped very much, as I said, by the submissions of the parties. Mr Dalton SC provided very helpful written submissions. I have taken into account the statistics provided in relation to the two offences with which I am concerned. They, of course, cover a range of conduct and I appreciate the limitations of statistics discussed most pointedly by the Chief Justice in the 1998 case of Regina v Bloomfield, discussed again in fact recently by the learned Chief Justice in an article for the Judicial Review. The factual circumstances of particular offences will vary markedly, as will the subjective circumstances of offenders. Of course, one needs to consider whether sentences have been imposed having regard to periods of time in custody previously served and whether sentences are imposed by relationship to other sentences and the like. But the statistics provide a general outline of the range of sentences that might be applicable under particular statutory provisions.74 I am required to sentence the offender in accordance with the decision of Pearce v Regina (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly the observations of the majority at para [45]. Here, in my view, apart from fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence, I am required to partially accumulate one sentence upon another to reflect the totality of the criminality. It should be fairly said the two offences have a relationship to one another, one arises solely in reality out of the circumstances of the other. In my view, it could not be fairly said that the second offence provides an aggravating feature of the first offence, the criminality of each matter must be considered separately.75 I am required to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which I do. The various purposes of sentencing were said, in another sentencing era in the decision of Veen (No 2) v Regina, to sometimes point in different directions. Of course then the majority of the High Court could only identify four purposes of sentencing and now there are at least seven to be identified from the section. In some respects it should be fairly said that aspects of the purposes of sentencing are somewhat incorporated into the reasoning behind the sentencing guideline set out in Whyte and Jurisic, matters of general deterrence reflected in the need for a guideline and the like. There is a need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished to deter him and others, although personal deterrence, in my view, is not a significant matter in this case, because I do not believe that the offender is at risk of re-offending. I do not believe that the community needs protection from the offender. I believe I should promote his rehabilitation in the orders that I make and promote his opportunity to make a contribution to the community perhaps, make a contribution that might, to some extent, supplement the contribution too that could have been made by Mr Haswell had he survived. However he must be made accountable for his actions and his conduct should be denounced and the harm to the victim should be recognised.76 Turning to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I note in relation to s 21A that the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors therein contained, although they are not exclusive aggravating and mitigating factors that may be taken into account, are matters which, if relevant and known to the court, do not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. In relation to the dangerous driving offence under s 21A (2) of the Act, there are ultimately to be identified no “aggravating factors”. The aggravating factors in the offence are to be found in the facts as I found them by reference to other matters. This offence was not planned in any way. Clearly it was an offence that arose out of the circumstances of seeking to undertake a pleasurable activity, and the planning suggested in sub para (n) is of a different character than that contemplated in this particular offence. Ultimately, having regard to what was said in Regina v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43, I have come to the conclusion, for the reasons therein discussed, that this was not an offence committed without regard to public safety.77 In relation to the second offence however, it seems to me there are two aggravating factors, or certainly one which is clearly established. The first aggravating factor is the offence involves a series of criminal acts, because the conduct involved the conduct of the offender between 6 October and 10 October, to which I have referred, and also involved the conduct on or about 25 October. I have considered the issue of whether the offence was “planned”. There was a limited amount of planning, at least to the second aspect of it, the writing out of some instructions, if I can call them that, or some notes for the juveniles has an element of planning. The early part of it seems to me to be more a reaction to the crisis, so to speak, even allowing for the fact that the offender carried on with the subterfuge, that I have referred to, for a few days until the 10th.78 The mitigating factors arising are common to both offences. First of all, the first offence was not planned, as I have said. That is probably, limited to that first matter given what I have said about the second offence just a moment ago. More importantly, the offender does not have any record of previous convictions. 79 I am satisfied the offender was a person of good character. In that regard I just wish to deal with one aspect of the submissions of the learned Crown, who very fairly and ably represented the Crown’s interest. The Crown sought to assert that character in this case was “neutral”, and the Crown sought to assert that character was neutralised by the offender’s conduct in the second offence. In my view, firstly the character of the offender at the time of sentence must consider the good character of the good person at the time of the offence. Many a time one is sentencing an offender for an offence committed in the past when there have been subsequent offences, and usually the subsequent offences will be irrelevant to consideration of the character of the offender at the time of the commission of the offence, but not always. 80 The offender’s subsequent conduct to the accident and the conduct reflected in count 2, whilst it does not reflect well upon the offender, cannot neutralise a lifetime of good character. Bearing in mind that the respective conduct reflected in the offences is said by many of the character witnesses to be “uncharacteristic”, and it seems to me, with respect, without having the opportunity to over analyse it, the suggestion that the conduct of the offender in relation to the second offence abrogates his good character in some way involves some element of double dipping. It seems to me, to some extent, to confuse the objective circumstances of the offence with the character and extent of the evidence of a subjective nature, which is relevant to the assessment of the good character of the offender.81 There is, I suppose, one matter of fine distinction to be pointed out. That is the good character of the offender available in relation to the first offence in time, may not be as strong in relation to the second offence because the offender had, by the time of the second offence, committed the first offence, and because the conduct involved in relation to the second offence showed an element of self interest, which is an aspect of bad character that might otherwise diminish good character reflected in suggestions of altruism in the past. But, ultimately, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence, given my assessment of all matters, that the offender can rely upon good character in relation to both offences, perhaps to a lesser degree in respect of the second.82 I am quite satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and I am quite satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation by reason of the support network he has and his prospects of employment and industry. 83 With regard to remorse, I can note that the offender has expressed remorse. However, it would be fair to say as a mitigating factor under s 21A(3), the offender has not satisfied what is now required to establish remorse as a relevant “mitigating factor” under that particular provision, and in any event such remorse has been expressed, even though I believe he has expressed genuine remorse since late October, is diminished by the conduct set out in charge two.84 I note the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor, as provided for in s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and I also note the offender gets the benefit of a discrete discount.85 Ultimately I have concluded that the extent of accumulation should be six months. I have concluded that the discounts upon the otherwise appropriate sentences should be twenty per cent. Thus, the starting point for the second offence in time is eighteen months reduced to fifteen months imprisonment, and the starting point for the first offence in time is forty months - three years and four months imprisonment reduced to two years and six months, as I foreshadowed earlier.86 I have determined that the term of imprisonment imposed should be by way of periodic detention. I am mindful of the fact that periodic detention carries within it inherent leniency. I am approaching this matter in the way that was discussed by Howie JA in Regina v Zamagias (2002) NSWCCA 17, that is by taking the several steps approach that is required before one arrives at an appropriate method of serving a term of imprisonment. It will be seen of course, as an act of leniency, to have imposed a term of imprisonment to be served by periodic detention but there are some features of this case that need to be noted. The offender is not a man who lays around his house watching television all day and will jump on a bus and go off to the Corrective Services institution and to come back to a week of rest. 87 The offender is a hard working man, I accept, and he will have to serve his periodic detention between the many tasks required of him for performance on the farm. He will be required to travel from Gulgong to Bathurst to complete the periodic detention in circumstances where he will not have a driver’s licence. Of course, in relation to the ultimate determination of the matter, giving due regard to the objective facts, I have concluded that in the scheme of things, both for the interests of the offender and the community, ultimately the opportunity for the offender to continue the family business by having the opportunity to work five days a week will be more productive for the wider community than the alternative of the offender serving a term of imprisonment where the opportunity for him to support his family and to maintain a business, which is in some difficulty at the present time, will be denied. 88 I am very very conscious about what has been said about the element of leniency. It has been discussed in a range of cases; Regina v Douar (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 and of course Hunt J in a decision of some years ago of Regina v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67. It was also discussed in Regina v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284.89 Thus, in relation to this matter I will make the formal orders, noting the Probation and Parole Service report, which was provided to me, as I said, earlier, in relation to the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, that is the second offence in time, you are convicted. I am satisfied of the matters mentioned in s 66(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have had regard to the matters mentioned in s 66(2). In respect of that offence you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment without non-parole period of one year and three months. That sentence will commence on 25 October 2008 and expire on 24 January 2010. 90 The sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. In respect of this sentence you are to report to the officer-in-charge at Bathurst Periodic Detention Centre on Saturday, 25 October 2008 at 8.30 am to commence the sentence. Thereinafter you will be required to report every Friday evening at 7pm and perform the period detention ordered by this court.91 In relation to the first offence in time, that is the offence of dangerous driving causing death, I am satisfied of the matters mentioned in s 66(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have had regard to the matters mentioned in s 66(2). You are sentenced to imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years. I order that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention. In relation to that sentence I fix a parole period of eighteen months. That will commence on 4 April 2009 and will expire on 24 October 2010. The balance of the sentence will be one year and it will expire on 24 October 2011. 92 At the conclusion of the non-parole period I direct that you be released to parole. In respect of that order I do not require you to report to the officer in charge at a particular date because that sentence will be partially accumulative upon the periodic detention order that I have ordered, so it will involve an extension of the original order, such as to require you to continue to attend for periodic detention. 93 In fixing the non-parole period, I have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The special circumstances are firstly that there is a partial accumulation of sentence requiring some adjustment of the non-parole period in relation to the balance of sentence. Furthermore, in my view, although the offender is not being released from full time custody, he will require professional assistance to adjust to community living. As will often happen for a person serving their first term of imprisonment, the offender, having served a first term of imprisonment by way of periodic detention, in my view will require an extensive period of counselling, as the medical evidence reveals. In that regard, although the Probation and Parole Service says there are no, if I can call them, crimogenic issues to be addressed, I believe the offender ought to have the benefit of the supervision of the Parole Service for the balance of the sentence for one year to enable those matters to be put in place. Thus, the non-parole period for the total sentence of two and half years is eighteen months with a balance of sentence of one year.94 In relation to the various matters on the s 166 certificate, all the back up charges are dismissed, and the related charge described as ‘Related charge G’, “failure to stop and assist after impact causing injury” is dismissed as well, at the request of the Crown. 95 In relation to the offence of driving with three unrestrained passenger, the offender is fined the sum of one hundred dollars. The maximum penalty I hasten to say is one hundred and ten dollars. In relation to the offence of using unregistrable class A motor vehicle, bearing in mind of course that matter is one of the circumstances taken into account in relation to the principal offence, the offender is fined the sum of five hundred dollars. The maximum penalty is twenty penalty units.96 In relation to the fines, the offender is granted twenty-eight days to pay those fines. If he needs an extension of time an application can to be made at the Local Court. In respect of the offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public causing death, noting the entire criminality involved, in my view the offender should be disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver’s licence of any type for two years from today. That two year period will commence today, which is 9 October 2008 and expire on 8 October 2010. 97 That means, Mr Dale, over the two year period you will not be permitted to drive a motor vehicle of any type on a public road. If you are detected driving whilst disqualified you may expect a magistrate to gaol you in light of the orders that are currently outstanding. You will need to surrender your driver’s licence today. Have you got your driver’s licence? 98 OFFENDER: Yes, I do.99 HIS HONOUR: Would you surrender it to the court officer and she will give it to my Associate. Now, Mr Crown, any technical matters or other matters?100 BAILEY: Would your Honour make an order that the offender’s fingerprints be taken?101 HIS HONOUR: Today?102 BAILEY: Thank you.103 HIS HONOUR: Mr Dale, you will temporarily go into the custody of the Corrective Services people in order for your fingerprints to be taken, but you be released and you will be given the relevant paperwork in relation to the orders I have made within the next half hour or hour. Anything else, Mr Crown?104 BAILEY: Other than that, your Honour, no.105 HIS HONOUR: Anything else from you Mr Dalton?106 DALTON: No, thank you, your Honour.107 HIS HONOUR: I may have said the sentence for the dangerous driving matter commence on 24 April, I meant to say 25 April 2009 expiring on 24 October 2011 for the non-parole period, and for the total sentence and non-parole period expiring on 24 October 2010.

      JUDGMENT – On application for directed verdict 
       
      
    1 At the close of the Crown case the accused moved for a directed acquittal on counts 1 and 3 of the indictment. I refused the motion and indicated that I would later express reasons. Those reasons follow. 
     
      
    2 Each of those counts charged a breach of s 232 (2) of the Corporations Law. The kernel of the submission was that the Crown had failed to lead evidence, that as a director of FAIG, the accused either profited from his position as a director or failed to avoid a conflict of interest. It was acknowledged that an identical submission was rejected by Howie J in a trial at which, coincidentally, the accused was also, with others, charged. It was submitted that his Honour was not referred to relevant High Court authority and that his ruling was wrong. I consider that it was not. See R v Burroughs, Mainprize and Wilkie 28 October 2005. 
     
      
    3 Reference was made to the history of s 232 and in particular a discussion of one of its “predecessors” which was s 229 of the Companies Code, which had been traced in the judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Angas Law Services v Carabelas (2005) 226 CLR 507. Also referred to were several cases dealing in one way or another with the extent of fiduciary duties. I do not recite what can be read in those cases. 
     
      
    4 The accused’s submission was entirely dependent upon the proposition that the offence created by s 232(2) is equivalent to, and therefore limited to, breach of fiduciary duty. Such equivalence and limitation is not specified in the terms of the provision which reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “An officer of a corporation shall at all times act honestly in the exercise of his or her powers and the discharge of the duties of his or her office.” 
        
       
      
    5 The definition of officer contained in s 232(1) includes persons who would not in the ordinary course of things and by the nature of their offices come to owe fiduciary duties by this provision but they would be bound to act honestly. I see no reason to read down the scope of s 232(2) to apply only to those whose duties are fiduciary in nature. 
     
      
    6 Further, I am in agreement with the understanding expressed by Howie J of the judgment in Marchesi v Barnes (1970) VR 434 and the reservations about what could be thought to flow from the reasons of Allen J in Corporate Affairs Commission v Papoulis (1990) 20 NSWLR 503. 
     
      
    7 In short, a charge of dishonesty by an officer punishable pursuant to s 232(2) does not comprehend as an essential element either the acquisition of profit from position by the alleged offender or failing to avoid a demonstrated conflict of interest.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 21 April, 2008, the offender was convicted by a jury following a trial in the District Court at Campbelltown on the following count:2 On 6 September 2005 at Campbelltown in the state of New South Wales, being in the company of other persons, did break and enter a building, namely the Campbelltown Hospital, the property of the Sydney South West Area Health Service at Therry Road, Campbelltown, with intent to commit a serious indictable offence inside those premises, namely larceny. 3 The maximum penalty for that offence pursuant to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is fourteen years imprisonment.Facts4 In terms of the facts, consistently with the verdict of the jury I find the following facts to have been established on the evidence given in the trial. 5 At about 4.20am on 6 December 2005 two vehicles, a Mitsubishi van and a four-door cabin Nissan utility, crashed through the foyer of the Campbelltown Hospital. There were three individuals involved in the raid. The purpose of the entry into the hospital was to try to remove a large ATM machine located in a wall on the foyer of the hospital. There was considerable damage caused from the attempt to remove the machine. After numerous attempts to remove the ATM, those involved were unable to actually remove it from the premises. 6 A video of the break and entering into the hospital was played in the trial. In the course of the getaway the van apparently malfunctioned and either stalled or was unable to move, or be moved, despite attempts by at least two of the offenders to push start the vehicle. 7 All three of them got into the utility. It was driven at high speed through another glass section of the foyer wall, out and onto an exit road from the hospital. A trail of broken glass was followed by a security guard, Mr Brad Johnson, who located the van, which was by then abandoned with its engine still running a short distance away in Jaggers Place, Ambarvale. 8 Mr Johnson had seen the utility on an earlier occasion that evening. He described it as having had three occupants, one of whom had a shaved head and was leaning out of the window from the waist up. 9 After locating the vehicle Mr Johnson called the police. A police dog squad handler was called with a sniffer dog. The dog was unable to pursue a scent. Ultimately a police-contracted tow truck operator, Mr Ahmed Zahabe, turned the engine off. He said there were no keys in the ignition and it appeared that the car had been started using wires underneath the steering wheel. It was clearly a stolen vehicle.DNA evidence10 The utility was removed to a holding yard. The police located a number of items in the utility including a screwdriver. The screwdriver contained a sample, which was subjected to DNA analysis. It contained DNA consistent with the DNA of a Mr Shane McGee. 11 Miss Vivian Bilby from the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe gave evidence that the probability of that DNA occurring in the general population was one in 280 million persons. Co-offenders12 Both the Mitsubishi van and utility had been stolen. A statement of the van owner was written by consent. He did not know the offender nor Mr McGee nor Shane Pope, the other person said to be a co-offender. Ms Crawford did not know either Mr McGee or the offender or the other person said to have been involved in the proceedings, as I say, the individual named Shane Pope, who was referred to as ‘Popey’ throughout the trial. 13 No proceedings have been initiated, I am informed, against Mr Pope, or anyone else other than Mr Innes and Mr McGee.Other witnesses14 Evidence had been given by the user of the utility, Miss Emily Crawford, to the effect that she had just driven the vehicle down from Singleton the previous evening. She parked it outside her sister’s home in the Campbelltown area. It was missing the next morning. 15 Ms Crawford, who is a boilermaker by occupation, identified the screwdriver in which the DNA, said to be that of Mr McGee, was located. She had a set of the same, or similar, screwdrivers.Damage16 In terms of damage, the hospital foyer was also extensively damaged, as the photographs tendered in the trial indicated.17 The damage caused in the commission of the offence was extensive. Damage was caused to the glass doors and windows, the floors, various walls and structural supports, the ATM, Christmas decorations and both stolen vehicles.18 The cost of repairing the damage was as follows:* damage to the hospital $75,259.59, * damage to the ATM $27,234, * damage to Emily Crawford’s utility $3,500.The total value of the damage was, accordingly $105,993.59. 19 There has been no restitution of any amount for those damages, given the offender’s circumstances that is not likely to occur, those costs will have to be borne by the community.Evidence identifying the offender: Ms Sarah Allan20 In terms of evidence identifying the offender, and I list this because of the offender’s refusal to accept his guilt in relation to this particular matter, evidence was given by Miss Sarah Allan, the former girlfriend and partner of the offender. She said the offender had left the premises which she then occupied with him on the afternoon of 5 December 2005 in Shane McGee’s car. 21 There was evidence given by both Miss Allan and her father, Mr Allan, and the deputy principal of the school Mr McGee and Mr Innes had attended, to the affect that they were close friends and associates both at the time of the offence and at school. 22 Miss Allan saw Mr McGee the following afternoon on 6 December 2005 at about 3.30pm. She said that Mr Innes had not come home the previous night. When she saw him in the afternoon of 6 December he had a shaved head, which he had not had the previous afternoon. 23 He, the offender, told her that he had “fucked up” and she said to him, “What the fuck are you doing?” He said to her, “that was my first ATM and my last”.24 He also said to her that he had to drop his jumpsuit in the field next to the Campbelltown Hospital and the sniffer dogs were probably already there to sniff the jumpsuits out (transcript 17 April 2008 page five). The offender also told her to watch the news. 25 Ms Allan watched the Channel Seven news that night and saw coverage of a ram raid incident on the Campbelltown Hospital early that morning. Miss Allan was not aware of any other publicity in relation to the incident and did not read the newspapers. Clearly then she got that information from the offender.Mr Alex Allan26 Mr Alex Allan, Ms Allan’s father, also gave evidence. He had met Mr Innes when Mr Innes and his daughter commenced a relationship sometime during 2005. He used to accompany them shopping and occasionally going to hotels. He had also met the individuals known as Popey or Popeye and McGee on one or two other occasions. He understood from comments made by the offender that they were friends of the offender’s. 27 Mr Allan also said that on one occasion after he, his daughter, and the offender had been for a drink at the local hotel at Minto, they went to the offender’s parents home. He had been there some four, five or six times. 28 He recalled hearing about the ram raid at the Campbelltown Hospital on the news. He said to the offender, “Did you hear what happened at Campbelltown?” The offender just shrugged. 29 The offender said that he, Popey or Popeye and McGee were involved and that Popeye was driving the vehicle and he got it jammed between the wall and the pillar at the hospital. He also said that they “had to do a runner”. 30 Mr Allan then said to the offender, “You want to start looking at yourself, looking after or doing something different or you’re going to get yourself into serious trouble”.31 It appears from the evidence of Ms Allan that the relationship between them was volatile. It included on one occasion, Ms Allan attacking the offender with a stick because of his apparent association with other women and in particular a close friend of Ms Allan’s. 32 There had been further incidents, or at least allegations of, assault. Ms Allan had informed her father of this and he, Mr Allan, was of the view that Ms Allan would be better off out of the relationship.Inconsistencies in evidence33 The defence at the trial mounted an attack on the veracity of both Ms Allan and Mr Allan, essentially going to matters of inconsistencies about the date and place of the admissions made by the offender, to each of them as I have outlined it above. It was put to both witnesses that they were motivated by feelings of revenge over matters arising out of the relationship between Ms Allan and the offender and its breakdown. The jury clearly did not accept those criticisms and the related submissions.Chronology of admissions and DNA34 Evidence was also led as to the chronology of when the DNA sample was obtained and identified as being a similar match to that of Mr McGee as occurring in the July of 2006. An essential part of the Crown case was that both details could not possibly have been known to either Ms Allan or Mr Allan at the time the offender made his comments and admissions to them. 35 That evidence, the veracity of Miss Allan and Mr Allan, and those submissions as to the effect of the admissions in relation to the overall chronology were clearly accepted by the jury.Evidence on sentencing proceedings36 The offender did not give evidence at the trial, however after some hesitation, he did so at the sentencing proceedings. It is clear that from his presentation and his evidence that he has some difficulties and has limited insights and maturity. 37 The evidence was given by him on the basis of an understanding, apparently that he would not be cross-examined on matters relating to the offence. In those circumstances, the Crown submits and I think correctly so, that I can give limited weight to any other matters giving his account, or more accurately, the denial of his involvement in the offence.Pre-sentence report38 A pre-sentence report dated 26 May 2008 was prepared by Shannan Mulligan of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, Silverwater Parole Unit (exhibit S2). That report details that the consistent contact that Mr Innes has had with the criminal justice authorities. He has served periods of incarceration, bonds, as well as periods of parole supervision, which appear to have been less than satisfactory. The offender himself advised that he has never managed to stay out of custody for an extended period of time. 39 The Court notes that the police antecedents relating to previous offences for this offender, indicate him to be a high risk offender for the Macquarie Fields Local Area Command, due to his association with active offenders, as well as a lengthy criminal history. The report notes, however, that the supervision closure summary for the offender’s parole order expired in April of 2005. It reported a favourable response to the order requirements and his successful engagement with appropriate authorities and services relating to his substance abuse. He successfully completed this order. The author of the report states that attempts to contact the offender’s family were unsuccessful but it detailed the offender’s history based on his self report.40 Other relevant areas have been covered by the author of the drug and alcohol report, which I will refer to below.Drug and alcohol report41 A drug and alcohol report dated 10 July 2008 of Heather van Bruinessen was tendered and marked as exhibit 3. The offender in his oral evidence has demonstrated that he clearly benefited from a one-on-one relationship with counselling with Ms van Bruinessen. Subjective features42 That report gives a relevant background of the offender being a 25-year-old male; although 22 at the date of the offence. He was born in Macquarie Fields in Campbelltown. He is single and he has no children. 43 He is the fourth eldest of six siblings. He was raised by both parents until they separated when he was 12 years of age. Currently he has a good relationship with his mother and father. 44 He has stated that he experienced difficulties at school and would often truant. He was placed in a special class for children with behavioural problems in high school. He used to fight with his teachers. No investigation was ever undertaken to assess or determine the reason for his misbehaviour. Mr Innes was frustrated at school as he could not keep up and was always tired. He left school half way through year nine and worked at Bradford Batts for approximately six months. He then did car detailing for a short period of time.45 Mr Innes states that, as a child, his home was very stressful and he would not want to go home. He witnessed domestic violence and the bashing of his mother by his father in the home. Both of his parents were alcoholics. There was little food in the house and whatever money was available appeared to be spent on alcohol. Mr Innes also stated that his father also used marijuana. Police were apparently called to the home regularly.46 The defence submits that his level of his emotional and intellectual immaturity is significantly lower than his chronological age. Further, that this is directly related to his childhood experience at growing up in a dysfunctional home with an absence of positive role models. It is submitted that the impact of this deprivation has been so severe that it can be reasonably regarded as a form of disability. 47 While I do not agree with this submission, what is clear is that the offender has had no positive adult role models in his life. He has also had a dysfunctional family background, he has also got clear conflictual attitudes in relation to authority.48 Throughout Mr Innes’ childhood until 2003, his father would leave the family home for long periods of time and then return. In 2003 his father left the family home permanently and he now resides with another sibling. Mr Innes stated in the reports and in evidence that he now has a good relationship with his parents and his mother is very supportive of him. The pre-sentence report notes that the offender’s older brother is currently incarcerated and his younger sibling is currently supervised by a community officer.Drug history49 In terms of his drug history, Mr Innes first consumed alcohol at the age of 12 and he would steal alcohol from the family fridge on a weekly basis and get intoxicated. He would then go to bed and avoid all the arguments and fights that would usually take place in the home. He continued this behaviour for about six months until he began using marijuana on a daily basis. He estimated that at the time of the offence he was using between one and one and a half grams of marijuana per day. 50 At the age of fifteen he was introduced to heroin by a friend and stated that heroin was his preferred drug of choice. 51 Mr Innes stated that he has used other drugs including speed, ecstasy and ice. He claims that prior to his incarceration his drug use was out of control. He was using half a gram to one gram of heroin a day and speed twice weekly. He concedes that he was addicted.Drug/crime relationship52 In terms of his attitude to this offence, Mr Innes has stated and repeated that he is not guilty of the offence for which he is currently before the Court, however, he did state that prior convictions had been all related to his drug use. 53 He also has indicated an insight in that he has now attained an age where he has started to review his life and he has examined his future possibilities and his desire not to continue to return to custody.54 It is clear that he has a good relationship with Ms van Bruinessen and that is to be encouraged. However, if the offender did not realise it before, he should accept what he has been told, that with his current drug habits and his lifestyle if he continues the way he is, he is likely to die by the time he is 40 given all the currently available statistics.Treatment in the community55 In terms of his treatment in the community, in July 2005, Mr Innes entered the MERIT Program, however he was discharged from the program due to urinalysis testing proving positive to drugs. He admits he was not ready to deal with sensitive issues relating to his drug use and offending behaviour at that time. He readily admitted that he used the program as an alternative to a gaol sentence and that his motivation was misguided.56 The pre-sentence report indicates that he was subject to a breach report due to his poor attendance and compliance with groups counselling and pharmacotherapy appointments. Treatment in custody57 Mr Innes has completed the SMART Program, referred to as in an acronym being the Self Management and Recovery Training Program, whilst he has been in Parramatta gaol. He attended every session and contributed to group discussions. 58 He has attended six counselling sessions with the author of the drug and alcohol report and one with a psychologist at the Parramatta centre. Prior to the incarceration he has never participated in counselling or involved himself in other interventions.59 Mr Innes was able to identify that on previous occasions when he was released from custody, he returned to his home environment, and he has said, and I quote from the phrase, “not congruent with his rehabilitation.” To me, that seems to be an understatement.60 Mr Innes also discussed how his sister had had the same childhood experiences as him but she has turned her life around and is raising her children in a loving home environment. He has expressed his admiration for her and his desire to emulate her.61 Mr Innes has attended four alcohol and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in the Parramatta Centre.Conduct in custody62 In terms of his conduct in custody, in January 2008 Mr Innes had a drug related charge whilst in the Parramatta centre, when a urinalyses test returned positive due to prescription medication Avanza, which was not prescribed for him. He readily admitted his guilt and stated that the stress of his impending court case and being on remand for two years, during which time there had been two mistrials, was his self justification for taking the pill to help him sleep, however, he recognises his behaviour was not justifiable.63 Mr Innes was confined to cells for three days in July 2008 with a charge of “fight or other combat”. The offender states that he was confronted while making a phone call and that he walked away from the incident, however, later in the day he was confronted by the same person who made movements to strike the offender and he stated that he responded in self defence.64 The pre-sentence report indicates the offender has incurred the following institutional misconducts:a) give false or misleading information, b) failed a urine test, c) possess drug implements, d) enter other cells, e) possess drug, f) failure in testg) and enter other cells. 65 My concern about this is that, this does, in my view, cast doubt on his capacity to undertake any effective form of drug rehabilitation on his release from gaol. Without such rehabilitation his overall prospects of rehabilitation, in my view, must be regarded with great circumspection. 66 He has also, apparently while in gaol, the subject of what is called association alerts, presumably because of his associates within the gaol. 67 He has had some limited contact with the education facilities and made inquiries regarding TAFE courses, but does not appear to have followed those up.Release plans68 In terms of his release plans, he has stated to the author of the drug and alcohol report that on his release he has no intention of returning to the family home. That seems to be somewhat inconsistent with his evidence to me, although he does seem to be relying very much on his sister in that regard. 69 He is currently on the Department of Housing waiting list and intends to follow this up with welfare services before his release. 70 He plans to start his own painting business and continue TAFE to broaden his business management skills. 71 He states that, in order to maintain his abstinence from drugs in the community, he would attend one on one counselling and Narcotics Anonymous meetings. However, I must emphasise these are only wishes and intentions.Recommendations72 The drug and alcohol counsellor, Ms van Bruinessen, recommends that the offender be encouraged and given the opportunity to continue on his recovery pathway, and to continue with one to one counselling and pursue the goals with which he has identified and initiated while at the Parramatta centre. Ms van Bruinessen is of the view that, with a network of support persons, Mr Innes has the capacity to implement positive lifestyle changes and living within the acceptable normalcy of society.Objective seriousness73 In terms of the objective seriousness of the offence, the Crown submits that the objective seriousness is towards the upper end of the range of seriousness for offences under s 113(2). That submission is supported by the following considerations, mainly that the building, the target of the offence, was a public hospital where there were both patients and staff working at the time. The fact that the target was a public institution dedicated to providing critical and other medical care gives the following conclusions, mainly that there is an added interest in denouncing the offender’s conduct, and there must be appropriate recognition of the harm done to the community, it includes a significant disruption to the hospitals usual service delivery. 74 As was clear on the voir dire exhibit, the Channel Seven News Report, the public use of the main entry foyer was disrupted, for the purpose of the police investigation an engineering assessment of the safety of the building following structural damage and clean up and subsequent repair works. During those periods it could have reasonably been anticipated by those involved that the access of members in the community needing critical and other medical care was compromised. In addition, the community has subsequently been deprived of the convenience of an ATM at the hospital, which has never been replaced.75 The targeting of such an important public institution for no purpose, other than greed, demonstrates a level of callousness and anti-social behaviour. Which firstly, demonstrates an increased need for personal deterrence if the community is to be protected in the future from such highly anti-social crimes and secondly, demonstrates the offenders prospects of rehabilitation are less than they might be, given that he was prepared to engage in such a callous act in the first place.76 I must say, that the manner of break and entering, namely crashing a stolen utility vehicle at speed through the glass entry way of a foyer of a facility such as a public hospital, was a considerably more objectively serious case than the ordinary case under s 113(2). In my view that needs to be reflected in the finding of at least a mid-range criminality in these circumstances.Subjective features77 In terms of subjective features, the offender is aged 25. His family background was set out in the pre-sentence reports and the drug and alcohol reports, and I will touch on that briefly below. 78 His education was at the Sarah Redfern High School in the immediate area. There is no remorse expressed by him, nor is there any explanation of his behaviour. He does not accept the jury’s verdict nor his guilt, despite the opportunity extended to him to do so.Defence submissions79 Counsel for the offender has submitted forcefully that the offender’s background needs to be taken into account. That is because the offender struggled at school, not just because of the lack of intellectual capacity, but also because of an apparent total lack of support and assistance in his home environment and the lack, and indeed complete absence of parental nurturing. The lack of intellectual and educational maturity is reflected in the ill-considered nature of the offence, a criminal endeavour which was guaranteed, as submitted, to be disastrously unsuccessful.80 Mr Innes also grew up in a home where there was abuse of alcohol and drugs as I have outlined them. From a young age he was replicating this behaviour by commencing to abuse alcohol from about the age of 12, cannabis shortly thereafter and heroin from age 15.81 At the time of the commission of the offence, the offender reported that his drug use was out of control and that he was using half a gram of heroin per day and amphetamine twice weekly. It is submitted that that can only be the one explanation for committing an offence of such grave irresponsibility and stupidity. I agree with that submission and description. 82 I do not however agree that his tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol constitutes a particular form of disability. As I have indicated in the course of submissions, other members of his family with the same background have been able to avoid this. What is clear is that he does really have a drug problem, and as I have said earlier, I am not satisfied that he is going to be able to deal with it.Offender’s prior convictions83 A copy of the offender’s prior convictions was tendered becoming exhibit S1. That showed the offender has had an involvement with the criminal justice system from February 2000 commencing at the Campbelltown Children’s Court, however, because those are children’s court matters I do not take them into account. But thereafter he has had a series of convictions for various offences of dishonesty, including larceny, affray, assault, car stealing, unauthorised use of vehicles, possess car break implements, drug matters, assault police, receive stolen property, possess cutting implements and ammunition, as well as possessing a shortened firearm. 84 That record indicates an escalating and increasing criminality on a very serious basis.Sentencing factors – s21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act85 In terms of the relevant factors under s 21(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the elements of the offence include breaking and entering into a hospital in company. 86 Against that background I am bearing in mind the relevant R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 principles and the need to avoid double counting. The aggravating factors, which seem to me to be established on the facts are as follows.Planning and premeditation87 Firstly, planning and premeditation. That the commission of the offence involved a high degree of planning, as demonstrated by the following:a) that there were two separate vehicles stolen prior to the offence and used in the commission of it. One of the vehicles (the utility with a bulbar) was clearly stolen specifically for the purpose of breaking through the entry glass, while the second vehicle (the van) was stolen it would seem specifically for the purpose of carrying away the ATM. b) additional stolen number plates were used in the commission of the offence.c) as is apparent from the CCTV footage, the offenders knew where in the foyer the ATM was located. It follows that one or more of them must have previously reconnoitred the scene; and finallyd) the offenders all wore balaclavas to disguise their identities. e) there is a reference in the admissions made by the offender to Ms Allan that they were wearing jumpsuits. None were found by the police, including the police tracker dogs, nor are those suits apparent, at least to me, from the video of the actual road taken by the hospital CCTV cameras. f) although the enterprise was probably doomed to failure, it showed all the hallmarks of considerable criminality in it planning, premeditation and execution.The offender knew persons were present88 The offender must have known that persons were present. Indeed one of the eyewitnesses, Ms Joanne Venn was exposed to the risk of potential injury by her presence in the foyer, or in the vicinity of the foyer at the time of the offence. Given that it was a public area in a 24-hour establishment, there was a real risk of danger to the members of the community, despite the fact that the front door was closed at that time of night. There are also obviously, patients and staff on the premises and that could have been foreseen.Prior criminal history89 In terms of prior criminal record, I have already indicated that the offender’s prior record does not entitle him to any leniency. 90 He has got a substantial history of larceny type offences, as well as a previous break and enter offence. I think the Crown is correct in the submission that his record is an aggravating feature, in the sense that is described in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] 164 CLR 465, and that, in combination with the callous nature of the offence warrants, in my view, some increase in the sentence which might otherwise have been imposed. Those are essentially the submissions of the Crown - with which I agree in this respect.Mitigating factors91 In terms of the mitigating factors, there are no relevant mitigating factors other than the possibility of some rehabilitation. 92 The offender, as I have noted, has not shown any remorse. He maintains his innocence in regards to this offence. 93 As I have said, I do not accept the submission that he was not fully aware of the consequences of his action, by virtue of his dysfunctional background and lack of insight.94 Counsel for the offender also submits that there are good prospects of rehabilitation, given he has made considerable efforts while in custody to address the underlying cause of his offending behaviour. I disagree that there are good prospects. There are some prospects, which I will reflect in the finding on special circumstances, but that will very much depend, in my view, on the personal resources and determination of the offender. 95 As I said to him directly when he was in the witness box, I do not see a great deal on his track record which indicates that he has that capacity or those personal resources on which he can fall back.Authorities96 In terms of authorities, the guideline judgment of R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 is relevant to the offences of break and enter under s 112 of the Crimes Act. There are some different considerations in relation to offences under s 113, under which the offender has been convicted. Nevertheless, it does seem to me that some of those factors indicate that the facts here prompt consideration of these headings. 97 Mainly the offence was committed at premises where sick or disabled persons could be expected to be present that is a public hospital. It was accompanied by significant damage. It was also likely the premises would be occupied, particularly at night. Even though the offence took place in the early hours of the morning, a hospital is a place where there are likely to be numbers of shift workers, including nurses, other paramedical staff, cleaners and security staff.98 As I have said, one of the witnesses to the robbery was Ms Joanne Venn, who was on her way to access the ATM machine when the robbers were still in the foyer.Findings as to role99 In terms of findings as to role, the Crown based its case on a joint criminal enterprise involving the offender, Mr McGee, and another person. On the evidence available before me, it is not possible to find which of the offenders played what specific roles in the break and enter or the prior planning for the offence. 100 Mr McGee has since been found guilty by a jury and is to be sentenced later in 2008.101 The offender and, as I understand the position, Mr McGee, have not given any assistance in identifying or locating the other co-offender. 102 The offender still regards Mr McGee as a friend as was evident from the content proceedings before Judge Bennett. However he says, when cross-examined about that, that the reason he refused to give evidence in those proceedings was that he considered that he would be regarded as an informer and subject to physical violence when he got back to gaol.Consideration103 In terms of my overall consideration, the factors that should be noted are as follows, what was involved in this incident was a violent and destructive breaking and entering of a large hospital community facility in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. Such areas are notoriously under resourced in terms of public health facilities, accordingly such facilities are very important to the society generally, particularly that community, those using such facilities and the facilities themselves must be afforded considerable protection. 104 The likelihood of people being present in the foyer of the hospital was apparent even at that time of the morning with shift workers, cleaners, nurses and paramedical staff likely to be present. 105 What was clearly the object of the enterprise was the removal of an automatic teller machine. This again is a community facility designed to be available to members of the public at all hours of the day and night without the concomitant problems associated with going to banks and other similar institutions. The evidence is, the ATM has been removed and not replaced.106 Any violent ram raid can expect to induce fear in the likely occupiers of such premises including, in this case, anticipated members of the public and staff. 107 Against this count’s background, defence counsel properly concedes that this is a case of serious criminality. He also submits that it was not an offence of gratuitous violence. I have difficulty also in accepting that submission. It seems to me that what was involved was an act of premeditated violence involving considerable damage to property, with not a great deal of consideration being given to the likelihood of interfering with people in the position such as Ms Venn who was crouched down behind the central stairway.Absence of restitution 108 There was, as I said, been considerable damage done to the hospital of the order of $105,000. There is no recompense or restitution either to the public or the owners of the motor vehicles or the relevant insurers. Accordingly, those are all costs which will need to be borne by the community. 109 There was also substantial damage done to both stolen vehicles. Again, those costs will have to be absorbed by the owners and insurers and thereby the community. Deterrence110 In those circumstances there is a clear need to establish a sentence which involves proper and full recognition of the requirements of general deterrence.Rehabilitation111 As I have outlined above, the offender has been extended a series of sentencing options in the past by a number of different courts, certainly over the last seven years, which have not resulted in any change of behaviour by him. 112 Despite his relatively young age there is nothing which militates against the sentence of full time custody that, in my view, is clearly mandated and required by the requirements of general and specific deterrence in these circumstances.Authorities113 I have reviewed the authorities, in particular those of: R v Morris [2008] NSWCCA 115, which is a s 112(2) offence, and R v Guthrie [2002] NSWCCA 77. JIRS Statistics114 I have also examined the statistics published by the Judicial Commission for offenders between the ages of 21 and 25 with prior convictions. That shows that the range of sentences is of the order of between one year and 42 months imprisonment. The non-parole period is in the range of between six months and two years, however, those samples are relatively small in total. 115 Here I have set out in particular the two decisions I have referred to that an appellant review in the decision of R v Guthrie [2002] NSWCCA 77 resulted in a situation of a s 113(3) offence, a sentence of six years and six months imprisonment with four years and six months non-parole period. 116 There were different factors in that particular circumstance, in that particular case, but there are many commonalities.Sentencing options117 In terms of sentencing options, the offender was 22 at the time of the offence, as has been submitted on his behalf, a relatively young man. He has had, over the course of his criminal career, a series of sentencing options extended to him, including fines, probation, suspended sentence, community service orders. He has failed to comply with suspended sentence and, in particular good, behaviour bonds. He has been imprisoned on a number of occasions, commencing in 2000. The reality is he knew the system, the reality of the consequences of his actions. 118 He was also at the time of the offence, on bail in relation to a shoplifting charge and it is clear that his criminal record does not entitle him to any leniency whatsoever. 119 He has been deemed unsuitable for a community service order and ineligible for a periodic detention order.Suitability for supervision120 The author of the pre-sentence report identifies four areas of a criminogenic need. a) Pro-social associates. His choice of associates in the past has been very poor and any release order should be strengthened if a non-association direction regarding co-offenders is provided. I propose to do that. A similar direction preventing him from making contact with his former partner, Ms Sarah Allan, would also be desirable and I think that is not properly before me at the moment, those are remedies which if Ms Allan wishes to initiate them, could be initiated, but I would regard that as a proper matter for a term of his probation order.b) Substance abuse counselling/rehabilitation. The fact that the offender has resorted to the use of drugs in custody, in order to deal with the stress related to this court matter, is of concern. He has claimed he will clearly need some intervention in this area generally if he is to obtain a drug free lifestyle, as I have said, I am not optimistic that that will happen however, that depends on him.c) Employment and education. He has clear needs in that respect, again, those are matters that only he can address if he wants to. d) I think it important that he attend an anger management or violence prevention program where it is available.Special circumstances121 In terms of special circumstances, it is submitted on his behalf that special circumstances should be found by virtue of his age, his dysfunctional background, the absence of role models, and his prospects of rehabilitation. 122 Initially I was of the view that there was nothing in the offender’s record which would give any confidence for any prospect of rehabilitation, indeed, his lack of remorse or contrition did not and does not auger well for rehabilitation. 123 He, however, has accepted, albeit very late in the piece that he needs to change all the risk factors associated with his current lifestyle, such as employment, his mates and his accommodation, and he accepts that those have attributed to his current position. 124 He has also, it seems, got problems because he has not completed the MERIT program, however there is light in this particular dark tunnel, in that he has completed the SMART program, so perhaps it is that he is able to change.125 But what is of concern that he has, in terms of his own record, a non-compliance with the number of the sentencing options which have been extended to him, meaning that there would be some problems in fully accepting the recommendations or the submissions that have been made. 126 It does seem to me to be clear that he needs a longer period than average on probation to equip himself for a useful and non-productive, non-criminal life. 127 As I have said to him, if he does not and if he reverts to drugs, let alone any of the other anti-social aspects of his lifestyle, he is likely to be dead by the time he is 40.128 I do note that he has also identified a positive role model in his family, particularly his sister. He does admire his sister, who suffered the same damaging childhood experience but seems to have been able to turn her life around. I watched him carefully while he gave his evidence and I think he was genuine in that respect, and he was also prepared to give that a go and I think he will do so on his release from gaol.129 His relationship also with Ms van Bruinessen is, as he says, the first time he has been able to open up about the circumstances of his upbringing and the impact of that on his self destructive behaviour. I accept that he was telling me the truth about that, however, I just hope that he has got the personal resources to follow that through on his release from gaol and does not run into his mates or his lifestyle as soon as he is released. 130 That is going to take considerable personal fortitude. I hope he has got that determination. 131 But on that basis and given I think that there is some turn around, I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances such at the ratio which the parole period bears to the head sentence be reduced from three quarters to two thirds. 132 I think it is and will be to his benefit if he accepts the terms and conditions as I have outlined them to him already, that he may well benefit from a longer period on probation.133 In terms of the commencement date for his sentence, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on 1 February 2006 in relation to a shortened firearm offence that was backdated to 21 January 2006. The non-parole period for that expired on 20 October 2006. 134 On Friday 23 May 2008, the offender was sentenced by his Honour Judge Bennett SC to a total period of one month imprisonment for two offences for contempt, concerning proceedings relating to the co-accused Mr McGee. He had a two sentence of 28 days partially accumulated by four days, in other words a total of thirty-two days. 135 Those sentences expired on 1 June 2008 as I understand the position. 136 The offender has been in custody for this offence since 21 January 2006. In my view, the sentence should commence from 21 November 2006, in other words, at the expiration of the period after the non-parole period for the shortened firearm offence and after a relevant period attributable to the contempt offence. There is some measure of leniency about that, but I think that ought to be taken into account in the offender’s favour.137 Now is there anything on that Mr Crown?138 CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.139 HIS HONOUR: I’ll give you an opportunity, do you want an opportunity to discuss this with your client, I’ll wait on the bench if you like or do you want me to go off the bench Mr Stewart, just to see if there was anything else? That I’ve either got your submissions wrong. I’m not asking you to change my view, but if I’ve got your submissions wrong or the facts wrong.140 STEWART: No, everything your Honour said is fine.141 HIS HONOUR: All right, okay. Could you stand up please Mr Innes?142 Following the jury’s verdict you were convicted and I confirm that, in relation to the charge for which you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of five years and six months imprisonment to date from 21 November 2006 and to expire on 20 May 2012, with a non-parole period, that means inside, of three years and eight months imprisonment to expire on 20 July 2010.Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: It will be a condition of your release to parole and I would recommend that your parole be subject to the following conditions, firstly that you be of good behaviour, you accept that, that to include that you not approach Miss Sarah Allan, do you accept that?OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour, understood.HIS HONOUR: Secondly, that you notify the probation and parole service of your housing details and your accommodation. Thirdly, that you comply with any programs that they direct as to your alcohol and drug treatment, and then finally, that you comply with and give them details of your associates, because they will be monitoring you in relation to that. Now I cannot tell you not to mix with people Mr Innes, but I think you know who I am talking about and the problem is, if you end up back in that area, you know who is going to be knocking on your door. So, I wish you good luck with that and I hope--OFFENDER: Thank you very much.HIS HONOUR: All right, thank you, I thank counsel for your assistance.

      JUDGMENT (on fitness of Accused to be tried) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an inquiry conducted for the purpose of s.10 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 to determine whether the Accused, Paul James Wilkinson, is fit to be tried for the offences of murder and arson.  
     
      
    2 The Accused has been charged that on or about 28 April 2004 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Kylie Labouchardiere, and that on 16 May 2004, at Picnic Point, in the State of New South Wales, he did intentionally damage the property at 38 Kelvin Parade, Picnic Point, the property of Garry Phillips, by means of fire. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Legal Principles 
       
      
    3 Section 12(3) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides that the onus of proof of the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings in respect of the offence. The proceedings are by way of inquiry which is not to be conducted in an adversary manner: s.12(2).  
     
      
    4 The sole question to be determined is whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Accused is fit to be tried for the alleged offences of murder and arson.  
     
      
    5 This issue falls to be determined by application of what is commonly described as the Presser test. That test emerges from the decision of Smith J of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48. This is the test concerning fitness to be tried to be applied in an inquiry of this type: R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at 294-295 [279]-[286]. 
     
      
    6 In Subramanian v The Queen (2004) 211 ALR 1; [2004] HCA 51, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ, in a joint judgment, summarised the Presser test in the following way at 5 [9] footnote 2:  
     
      
       
        
        “In his reasons, Smith J suggested that before a trial can proceed without unfairness or injustice, an accused should meet certain ‘minimum standards’. Such minimum standards includes the ability to understand the offence with which the accused has been charged, the nature of the proceedings, and the effect of any evidence given against the accused. Additionally, his Honour said that an accused should possess sufficient capacity to be able to decide whether he or she will rely upon a defence, and, if so, be in a position to communicate either to the Court or counsel, the facts necessary for the defence"". 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      It is the  
      Presser 
       test summarised in that way which I apply in this case.  
       
       
      Evidence in the Inquiry 
       
      
    7 The evidence adduced in the inquiry has been entirely documentary in nature. The Crown has tendered a folder of documents (Exhibit A), including reports of psychiatrists, statements of witnesses, and copies of various interviews involving the Accused. In particular, for present purposes, within those documents are reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 31 July 2008 and 24 September 2008 (for the Accused), and a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, dated 27 August 2008 (for the Crown). Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt are well known to the Court as most experienced forensic psychiatrists.  
     
      
    8 It is the first report of Dr Nielssen dated 31 July 2008 which raised a question concerning the fitness to be tried of the Accused. I will return to that report shortly.  
     
      
    9 Tendered in the Accused’s case on the inquiry is a further report of Dr Nielssen dated 13 October 2008 (Exhibit 1). Also read in the Accused's case on the inquiry is an affidavit of his solicitor, Frances McGowan, sworn 26 September 2008.  
     
      
    10 No oral evidence was adduced and no witness was cross-examined in the inquiry.  
     
      
    11 It is not necessary, in the light of the evidence which is now before the Court and the submissions made, to elaborate in any detail upon the evidence before the Court. It is sufficient to note that Dr Nielssen's first report of 31 July 2008 raised a question concerning the Accused's fitness to be tried in one respect. It was not said in that report that the Accused did not understand the proceedings or was not capable of entering a plea, nor that he was incapable of following proceedings. The issue which arose, as to which a question was raised as to fitness, focused upon his ability to give instructions to his legal advisors with respect to an aspect of his defence.  
     
      
    12 Dr Allnutt examined the Accused and reached the firm conclusion that he was fit to be tried. Dr Allnutt had the benefit of Dr Nielssen's first report in expressing that conclusion. Dr Nielssen's second report of 24 September 2008 involved a documentary review and consideration by Dr Nielssen of Dr Allnutt's report. Dr Nielssen, at that time, maintained his opinion concerning the Accused's fitness to be tried, expressing the conclusion that he was not fit to be tried on what may be described as the narrow basis which I have mentioned.  
     
      
    13 Dr Nielssen examined the Accused today and there was an opportunity for a further conference with him. Dr Nielssen has produced his latest report today, in which he states ""I am now of the opinion that he is on balance fit for trial"". Dr Nielssen explains the reason for this conclusion and, in particular, states:  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Wilkinson was able to provide a version of the events that was consistent with the account he gave you this morning and could form the basis of instructions in his defence. His account was assessed to be a plausible summary of what took place, in contrast to his previous version"".  
        
       
      
    14 Accordingly, the psychiatric evidence before the Court on the inquiry is now all one way. It points to the fitness of the Accused to be tried.  
     
      
    15 The psychiatric evidence before the Court, and in particular that of Dr Nielssen, explains how the question of fitness has come to be raised. The question for me, however, is what the evidence demonstrates as at today, concerning that question. The two doctors whose opinions are before the Court (who, as I have said, are most experienced forensic psychiatrists), are of the same view that the Accused is fit to be tried. Each of the medical practitioners, in reaching that conclusion, has had specific regard to the principles contained in the Presser test.  
     
      
       
      Finding on Inquiry 
       
      
    16 I have had regard to the totality of the evidence called at the inquiry. The evidence is clear, in my view, as to the Accused's present fitness to be tried. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Accused is fit to be tried on the charges of murder and arson. I make that finding for the purposes of ss.10(1), 13 and s.15(b) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.

   SENTENCE1 The offender is before the Court for sentence in relation to two incidents.2 On 26 June 2008, a jury found the offender guilty of three offences that occurred on 25 November 2005 at Marrickville. i. Robbery in company. The victim was Albert Franklin. A black wallet and contents, including about a hundred dollars in cash was stolen.ii. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Franklin;iii. Stealing a motor vehicle, the property of Mr Franklin.3 The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence for the offence or robbery in company on 12 May 2007 at Darlinghurst. The victim was ME. A mobile telephone, keys, credit card, driver’s licence and cash were stolen. 4 The maximum available penalties are: i. Robbery in company - twenty years imprisonment;ii. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm - five years imprisonment;iii. Steal motor vehicle - five years imprisonment.  
     
      
      No standard non-parole period applies to any offence.  
      
    5 In relation to the incident on 12 May 2007, the Crown concedes that the offender entered a plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity and is entitled to a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.6 The offender has been in custody since 12 May 2007. The first sentence should commence on that date. 7 In relation to the incident on 25 November 2005, the brief facts are that the victim was a sixty-nine year old taxi driver. At about 5.45am in the morning, he was working in the inner-city. He stopped his taxi at traffic lights in Surry Hills. Two men, one of whom was the offender, jumped into the car. The offender entered the rear seat. The co-offender, who has never been identified, entered the front passenger seat. Initially, the two men asked the taxi driver to take them to Dulwich Hill. However, in the course of the trip they redirected the victim to a dead-end street in Marrickville. 8 The co-offender demanded money from the victim. The victim gave him one hundred dollars in cash. The victim was directed to get out of the car. He did so. The offenders got out of the vehicle. The co-offender demanded the victim’s car keys. The victim handed his keys to the co-offender. 9 The offender demanded the victim’s loose change. He reached towards the pocket of the victim’s shirt, feeling for its contents. In the course of so doing, he left a DNA trace, the means by which he was later identified. The victim handed his coins to the offender. 10 The offender told the victim to lie down on the road. The victim hesitated for a moment. He was uncertain about the danger, given the proximity to his vehicle. When the victim hesitated, the offender struck one blow to the face with significant force. It impacted the victim’s face just under the left eye and caused a substantial injury. The striking constitutes the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offenders then drove from the scene in the victim’s cab. The co-offender was in the driver’s seat and the offender was in the passenger seat. The taking of the vehicle constitutes the offence of steal motor vehicle. The offender was guilty on the basis that he was travelling as a passenger, knowing that the vehicle had been taken without the consent of the owner. The cab was located nearby, about thirty minutes after it had been taken. I accept the offender’s evidence that he has an almost complete lack of memory in relation to the incident because he was so affected by alcohol or drugs.11 The victim read a victim impact statement. The victim felt nervous after the incident when carrying out his job as a taxi-driver. That is perfectly understandable. He continues to experience facial numbness. There is a depression in the cheek-bone area and one of his eye droops due to nerve damage. The depression could be assisted by surgery but the nerve damage is permanent. 12 As the objective seriousness of the offence of robbery in company on 25 November 2005, there was no actual violence committed in the course of the robbery itself. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a separate matter. The victim felt fearful primarily because the offenders appeared aggressive in that they were, as the victim described them, “hyped-up”. The co-offender was the person who took the initiative. It was he who sat in the front seat of the cab, made the demand for money and drove the vehicle from the scene. I accept that the offence was planned at the last minute, probably as the two men were driving along in the taxi. There was conversation between them in the taxi and, in the course of the journey they directed the driver to change routes from Dulwich Hill to Marrickville, where the incident occurred. The robbery was very serious because of the vulnerability of the victim. A taxi driver is someone who, because of the circumstances of his or her employment, places him or herself in a vulnerable position, and that vulnerability requires the protection of the law. In addition, in this case, the victim was sixty-nine years old and somewhat more vulnerable because of his age. The second matter that renders the robbery in company of particular seriousness is that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time that the offence occurred. He was on a s 9 bond and a s 12 bond. Each of those bonds was imposed earlier in 2005.13 The assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a matter of some seriousness. The conduct was a completely gratuitous assault against an apparently cooperative victim. It is true that there was only one striking, but the victim was struck with considerable force. He is left with significant and permanent injury, albeit injury short of an injury amounting to grievous bodily harm. The seriousness of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm is such that it calls for some partial accumulation of sentence.14 The steal motor vehicle arises from the offender travelling for a short distance as a passenger in a vehicle that he knew had been taken without the consent of the owner. It is not a particularly serious matter. The vehicle was recovered soon after the incident.15 In relation to an offence of robbery in company, the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111must be considered. There are similarities between the typical scenario discussed in Henry’s case and the facts of the incident on 25 November 2005. In each case, the offender was a young offender with limited criminal history. There was limited planning and limited actual violence. In this case, there was no violence in the sense that the assault is the subject of a separate charge. In each case, the victim was a vulnerable victim and a small amount of property was taken. In the present case, unlike Henry’s case, there was no plea of guilty and the offender was on conditional liberty at the time that the offence occurred. However, it could be argued that a robbery in company is generally less terrifying for a victim than an armed robbery. Overall the level of culpability in the present case is similar to that considered in Henry’s case. 16 In relation to the incident on 12 May 2007, the facts have been agreed. At the time, the offender was twenty years old. It was a Friday night. He had been binge drinking and consuming methamphetamine. He has no clear recollection of the period of twenty-four hours up to and including the time that the offence occurred. 17 At about 6.10pm on a Saturday night, the victim was in a hotel at Taylor Square, Darlinghurst. He entered a toilet cubicle. Unfortunately, the lock on the cubicle was not working. The offender and the co-offender Timo forced their way into the cubicle. The offender grabbed the victim by his throat and punched him with a closed fist, demanding money. The co-offender stood directly behind the offender reinforcing the threat. The victim handed over the property in his possession. 18 Nevertheless the offender continued to punch the victim. The victim raised his hands to protect his face. The offender demanded that the victim drop his arms and again punched the victim. In all, six or seven punches were delivered. The victim turned out his pockets to show that he had no other property. 19 At that stage, the co-offender said “Let’s go”. In effect, the co-offender terminated the confrontation. The offender told the victim to remain where he was for ten minutes. The offender also delivered the significant verbal threat, “I’m going to kill you if you call the cops or the people from the pub,” a threat that the co-offender repeated. 20 After a few minutes, the victim emerged, very distressed. The police were called. The offender and co-offender were identified by hotel CCTV. Two hours later, they were arrested in the vicinity. The victim’s mobile telephone was found in the possession of the co-offender. 21 In relation to the objective seriousness of this offence, I accept that the offence was an opportunistic offence. The offender and co-offender, decided to follow the victim to the toilet cubicle at the last minute. As it transpired, that cubicle had a lock that did not function. However, actual violence was used in that the victim was grabbed by the throat and punched. Furthermore, after the property was handed over, there was gratuitous violence in that the offender continued to punch the victim. A serious verbal threat was made, following the offence warning the victim that he ought not to report the matter. The offender was the person who took the initiative. The co-offender terminated the incident by proposing that they should leave. At the time the offence occurred, the offender was still on conditional liberty pursuant to the 2005 s9 bond.22 The Henry guideline judgment is to be considered. The matter is a robbery in company as opposed to an armed robbery, armed robbery being the offence that was considered in Henry case. The victim in this matter was not in a vulnerable position per se, in that he was not a taxi driver or a person working at a service station late at night, or anything of that nature. However, the circumstances were very serious because actual violence was employed and, after the offence, there was associated gratuitous violence and a serious verbal threat. 23 There was no victim impact statement provided, nor was the Court given any information as to any ongoing difficulties suffered by the victim. However, the incident must have been very traumatic for the victim. There must have been some short term emotional upset at least. 24 In July 2004, when he was just eighteen years old, the offender was charged with offences of malicious damage and taking and driving a vehicle without consent of the owner. In October 2004, he was charged with receiving stolen property. On 19 May 2005 he received community service orders and a two year s 9 bond in relation to the offences committed in July 2004. In July 2005, he received a sixteen month sentence in relation to the receiving offence, but that sentence was suspended under s 12 and he was released into the community. On 25 November 2005, he committed the offence that went to trial. About two weeks later, on 10 December 2005, the offender was arrested and charged with another matter. He was bail refused. He remained in custody for almost exactly twelve months, until 7 December 2006. Having been acquitted of the charge, he was released. Five months later, on 12 May 2007, he committed the second offence before the court. He was arrested on that day and has been in custody ever since.25 It is appropriate that the sentences that I impose commence on 12 May 2007, the date when the offender went into custody. The period that the period that he spent in custody from December 2005 to December 2006 cannot be taken into account in any direct way as it relates to an entirely different matter. However, particularly given the age of this offender I do consider it relevant to observe that, since December 2005, when he was nineteen years of age, he has been in the community for a period of only five months, from December 2006 to May 2007. The overall picture of incarceration is relevant when considering how the sentences should be structured.26 The offender was born in Tonga. When he was very young, his mother left him and his twin brother in the care of his maternal grandparents in Tonga. The offender and his twin brother remained with the maternal grandparents until they were eleven years old. At that time, both of the maternal grandparents died. The offender and his twin brother were sent to Australia to live with their mother. She was a woman whom they did not really know. She had remarried and given birth to three children in Australia. The offender arrived in Australia somewhat traumatised by the death of his primary carers, to be placed in the care of someone whom he did not really know in a country where he barely spoke the language. Fortunately, the offender did form some bonds with his re-established family, and in fact became quite close to his stepfather in Australia. 27 The offender has a four-year-old daughter of a relationship that ended in 2006. He remains in contact with his former girlfriend and the Court has been told that there are some prospects of reconciliation. The offender is unhappy because he has been unable to maintain regular contact with his daughter. 28 The offender was educated to Year 12. After leaving school he obtained occasional labouring work, work as a removalist and similar types of unskilled employment. 29 The offender was a gifted rugby league player. He aspired to become a professional footballer. In 2003, he suffered the double trauma that his stepfather, to whom he had become close, died. Second, he failed in an attempt to gain selection for a football team that may have resulted in a professional football career. 2003 was a very difficult period in the offender’s life. 30 The offender’s drug and alcohol abuse worsened in 2003. He had been a heavy drinker since high school, engaging in binge drinking. Unfortunately, binge drinking is frequently associated with the playing of football, and that has been the case for the offender. He has engaged in heavy binge drinking at weekends, often at the club where he has played football. At weekends, he consumed up to 150 standard drinks in the course of a thirty-six hour period, a staggering level of consumption. The offender now appreciates that the culture of heavy drinking, particularly at the football club and among his family and friends, is a major problem for him. Indeed, as the author of the pre-sentence report notes, the offender’s entire criminal history is related to alcohol and/or drug abuse. In March 2007, the offender sustained a stabbing injury to his back when he tried to break up a fight. That led to a three-week hospital admission and removal f kidney and spleen. The offender has been informed that because of the surgery he is particularly unsuited to drinking large amounts of alcohol. 31 When the offender was acquitted and released in December 2006, his alcohol use rapidly escalated. He began using ecstasy and ice. Although the author of the pre-sentence report says that the offender has limited insight into his problems, a more recent report from Justice Health in July 2008 describes the offender as having considerable insight into his problems with alcohol and to appreciate the difficulties that he will face upon his release because of the heavy drinking among his peer group. 32 The Court has been provided with a report from a psychologist. It describes the offender as follows (p 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “The impression gained of Mr Takai-Taufu is of a man of below average adaptive intelligence and with equivalent interpersonal and communication skills. He is able to superficially converse on a range of subjects. He seems to possess a positive sense of self and seems to be self-assured with a resilient character. He did not blame the world or anyone for his lot in life or for his current circumstances. He is well-informed about personal responsibilities and the legal process he is facing. He argues that as a person he has many good qualities.”  
        
       
      
    In conclusion the author states; 
     
      
       
       “It would seem that the prognosis of Mr Takai-Taufu is dependent upon him participating in a residential rehabilitation program. He is completely uninformed about issues relating to relapse prevention, and he acknowledges his susceptibility to the influence of his cultural peer group with whom he will reform relations upon his release from custody. The major trigger to relapse is returning to the environment in which the substance abuse occurred, and this will occur in his case. He is accepting of completing a residential rehabilitation program to enhance his chances of controlling his substance abuse and his offending. He has intentions of pursuing his football career and gaining regular employment. He has strong supports in his family and will be able to reside with his mother. He expressed genuine remorse and was able to expound with significant insight into the harms he caused the victims. He appeared to be genuinely sorry for his actions.”  
       
      
    The offender has expressed his remorse and shame at the injury he has caused to the victims. He has expressed those sentiments to a number of persons. 33 The co-offender in the offence of 12 May 2007, Mr Timio, received a four year sentence with a two year non-parole period. That followed a late plea of guilty on the day when the matter was fixed for trial. The percentage discount for the plea of guilty is not known, but I infer that it was in the range of 10-15%, given the timing of the plea. Her Honour took the view that Mr Timo played a significantly lesser role in the offence. He did not deliver the punches and he encouraged the offender to leave the scene. On the other hand, Mr Timo’s criminal history is far worse than that of this offender. He had convictions for aggravated robbery with wounding and armed robbery. He had spent a period of approximately four years in custody and was on parole at the time that he committed the offence of 12 May 2007. His subjective circumstances are not known, but he must have had a significant problem with drugs and alcohol because her Honour referred to the need for treatment in that regard as a special circumstance. 34 The Crown and the offender’s legal representative submitted, and I agree, that when one balances the subjective and objective facts for Mr Timo with those for this offender, there is little difference and that it is appropriate to impose the same sentence.35 In sentencing the offender for each of the incidents, I take into account the sentencing purposes set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Relevant purposes are punishment, accountability, denunciation for the crime and recognition of the harm done to the victims and to society. Rehabilitation is of significance as the offender is a young man with deep-seated personal problems, but it should not be given such significance as would overshadow other sentencing purposes. In relation to general and specific deterrence, insofar as such considerations can operate in the case of highly intoxicated persons, they are purposes to be acknowledged. The community regards with abhorrence offenders who take advantage of victims in vulnerable positions such as that of Mr Franklin, who was a somewhat older person driving a taxi alone in the early hours. 36 I am required to take into account the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have noted most of the relevant considerations. In referring to them again it should not be thought that I am double counting them. The relevant aggravating features in relation to the 2005 offence of robbery, that being the most serious matter, are that the offender was on conditional liberty and the victim was a vulnerable person. In relation to the 2007 robbery matter, the aggravating features are that the offender was on conditional liberty and there was actual and gratuitous violence associated with the offence. 37 In relation to mitigating features, in each case, the offence was impulsive and involved limited planning. I accept that there are reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The offender’s criminal behaviour is very closely associated with drug and alcohol abuse. He has taken the first step to rehabilitation in that he has acknowledged that he has a problem, he has gained some insight into the circumstances which lead to drug and alcohol abuse, namely the environment at the football club and among his particular peer group. Whether he can translate insight and acknowledgement into action remains to be seen. The offender is remorseful in the sense referred to in a s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.38 Unfortunately, the offender does not qualify for the Drug Court Correctional Centre because he does not have enough pre-existing serious matters. 39 I have considered the judicial statistics in relation to sentencing patterns for offences of the type for which I am sentencing the offender. I have perused two recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Antonio v R [2008] NSWCCA 213, and R v Boulder [2008] NSWCCA 222. 40 I consider that there are special circumstances, they being the offender’s youth, the fact that he has not previously served a sentence of imprisonment, the need for there to be a long period of support in relation to drug and alcohol and emotional issues when the offender does re-enter the community, and the total picture of his incarceration.41 Because I am sentencing the offender for a number of offences I need to take into account (in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 the total criminality and structure the sentences so as to appropriately reflect the total criminality. 42 Would you please stand. Mr Takai-Taufa, you are convicted of each of these matters. In relation to the 2007 offence, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years from 12 May 2007 to 11 May 2009. There is a balance of term of two years, the sentence will expire on 11 May 2011. In relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 you are sentenced to a non-parole period of twelve months from 12 November 2007 to 11 November 2008 and a balance of term of twelve months. That sentence will expire on 11 November 2009. In relation to the steal motor vehicle, you are sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months’ imprisonment from 12 November 2007 to 11 November 2008. 43 In relation to the 2005 robbery, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years from 12 November 2008 to 11 November 2010 and a balance of term of two and a half years, which means that the sentence will expire on 11 May 2013. 44 The effect of these sentences is that you are sentenced to a non-parole period of three and a half years and a total sentence of six years. You are eligible for release to parole on 11 November 2010.

     JUDGMENT 
    1. Syed Basri (Ms Basri), and Mohammed are each charged with importing a border control drug into Australia. In the case of Ms Basri the quantity alleged is a commercial quantity. In the case of Mohammed the quantity alleged is less than a commercial quantity. Madubuku (as his name appears on the indictment) and Okonwko are jointly charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border control drug, which had been unlawfully imported into Australia. This charge on the Crown case relates to their attempted receipt of the drug imported by M/s Basri. Madubuko is also charged with attempting to possess a marketable quantity of a border control drug, which had been unlawfully imported into Australia. This charge (on the crown case) relates to the importation alleged against Mohammed. All offences are said to have occurred on 25th February 2008 at Sydney.2. The Crown proposes that all accused be tried together. The trial was scheduled to commence on Tuesday 7th October 2008. It was placed before me on 8th October. Prior to the trial commencing, the Crown served a Notice dated 24 September 2008 of its intention to lead what it described as coincidence evidence against all accused. Although Mr Russell of counsel appearing for M/s Basri objected to the late service of the Notice that objection was faintly pressed when made, and not otherwise argued in the course of events. No other defence counsel sought to challenge the Notice on the basis of its service date. All accused parties, however, argued that the Court should not permit the claimed coincidence evidence to be led as coincidence evidence, or at all in some cases.3. By Notice of Motion filed 23rd September the accused Mohammed sought that the trial date of 7 October be vacated; that he not be tried with the other accused and that a separate trial be ordered in relation to his offence. Subsequent to argument, Dr Glennan, counsel for Madubuko, made an oral application, contingent upon my acceding to the orders sought in the Notice of Motion, to have the 4th count in the indictment severed (the attempt to possess a marketable quantity of heroin brought in by Mohammed) and have that charge tried together with the charge against Mohammed.4. Thus it became necessary to spend the first and subsequent days of the first week of the trial debating these issues on the Voir Dire. Prior to the Voir Dire hearing commencing, each accused was arraigned and her and his “Not Guilty” pleas were received and entered upon the indictment.The Crown Allegations5. The Crown case starts with the arrival of M/s Basri at the Kingsford Smith Airport. She had flown from India. She travelled from Deli to Mumbai internally. From Mumbai she travelled to Sydney via Singapore. By the time she had passed through Customs to collect her baggage Customs Officers had examined her bag. Concealed under the internal linings of the bag, behind the extendable handle frame was located a 3+ kilogram packet of admixture containing 1.8 kilograms of heroin. The package of contraband was flat, bound in brown masking tape, rectangular in shape, a slight A-frame shape to it. The bag’s main compartment had been filled with multiple saris and other personal items.6. Some 5½ hours later Mohammed arrived at the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. He had travelled from Deli to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. His check-in bag was found to contain a similar package in terms of construction, concealed within his bag in a very similar fashion. Mohammed told Customs Officers that a friend gave him the bag, that he was unaware of its contents and he did not pack it. The packet itself was smaller, and the admixture found yielded 1.2 kilograms of heroin. The bags, although different colours and sizes, were both new and carried the same brand name. 7. By the time M/s Basri reached her bag, Australian Federal Police were waiting for her. She was arrested. There was a short interview with her. She denied knowledge of the illicit contents of the bag, but agreed to undertake a controlled delivery of the bag under the supervision of the AFP. She was told she was a “protected suspect”. Items taken from her during a police search were returned to her. One was a mobile phone; another was US$1500. She was escorted to a Travelodge Hotel at Bankstown. During the time between her arrest and the delivery of the bag she received a number of phone calls, some from India. She delivered the bag to Madubuko and Okonkwo. They returned to a car, placed the bag in the boot and, with Okonkwo behind the wheel, drove away. Shortly after their attempted departure from the area the car was stopped and both were arrested. The arrest of Madubuko and Okonkwo occurred at approximately 7:30pm. After his arrest AFP discovered US$1,000 had been given to Madubuko by M/s Basri. On her account this was to purchase a ticket for her to return to her country of origin, Malaysia. 8. It is of significance to note Madubuko and Okonkwo were arrested prior to Australian Customs discovering heroin concealed in Mohammed’s bag.9. In the course of an interview given to police after the controlled delivery, M/s Basri stated she had looked for and found a job on the Internet which involved travelling to India from Malaysia, collecting sample sari material and taking the material to other countries such as Australia. On her account she travelled to India on 14 February 2008, met a woman called Gina. Her ticket to India had been paid for by a middleman who also supplied her with money and an Indian visa. She had met this unidentified man at a place called Jusco, in Kepong, which in turn is in Kuala Lumpur. Initially she stayed at a Delhi hotel, and subsequently with Gina. Gina’s boyfriend was a Nigerian named Johnny. She and Gina shopped the local markets purchasing saris. M/s Basri’s task was to give the Saris to Gina’s brother in Australia. M/s Basri packed the saris into her bag. Johnny provided airline tickets to cover the journey from Delhi to Australia. He also gave her the US$1,500. He gave her the name and address of the Bankstown hotel, instructed her to catch a taxi to it, and told her that somebody would give her a ticket back to Malaysia. She then flew to Australia with the bag.10. I pause to note Madubuko and Okonkwo are Nigerian.11. M/s Basri told police Johnny had given her an AirTel SIM card. She also had her own local Malaysian SIM card. Johnny instructed her that she was not to contact Gina, but Gina would be contacting her when she got to Sydney and that she should delete all their numbers from her phone in India. 12. M/s Basri conceded to police she had met Mohammed at Jusco. He was one of her friend’s husband. There is a photograph of him on her phone. She denied any connection between him and India. On the Crown case this was a meeting of the two couriers, although it is unclear to me whether the Crown means that this meeting was a deliberate meeting of them as potential couriers.The Crown Sees Coincidences13. On the Crown case there were a number of features of its case against each of Ms Basri and Mohammed that it sought to rely upon as coincidence evidence. Both were Malaysian, resident in Malaya until a short time prior to her/his arrival in India. Before on-travelling to Australia, M/s Basri had left Malaya on 14th February and Mohammed on 21st February 2008. Neither appeared to have “planned” holidays to Australia. Air tickets for both, although independently purchased, were booked and visas granted, just prior to travel. Yet both made reference to holidays on their respective Immigration Entry Card as the purpose of their arrival in Australia.14. There were similarities in the bags, concealment of the heroin in the bags, and packaging of the heroin. One bag contained 12 saris, the other, brought by Mohammed, had 15 t-shirts.15. Both Ms Basri and Mohammed arrived in Australia with a mobile phone. Each had in his/her possession two mobile SIM cards, one of which was an AirTel SIM card, apparently used in India. In a notebook found in Mohammed’s possession is an entry “Papar: 450415120 (code + 61) Aus”. When arrested after delivery of the bag to him by Ms Basri, Madubuko was found to have a mobile phone with the call sign “0415415120”. 16. A number “0173068907 was found saved as “Babe/M” and also as “Babe W” on the AirTel SIM card in Ms Basri’s possession, and as “Johny” on the same mobile phone’s contact list. SMS messages from “Boy H.gina M’ originating from this number were saved on Ms Basri’s phone. The same number appeared listed in Mohammed’s diary against entries “John” and “Johnny”. 17. A number, 60173989643 sent an SMS to the mobile phone later seized from Mohammed. That number appears in M/s Basri’s mobile phone contact list against the entry “Ming”. I am informed and accept that the numbers “60” constitute the international dialling code for Malaysia. Another number, “60162720316” is found in each of the mobile phones carried by Ms Basri and Mohammed. Ms Basri has the number stored against the entry “Babe M” and Mohammed has it saved against the entry “John”.18. There was also the existence of the photograph of Mohammed stored in M/s Basri’s mobile phone taken sometime between 12th and 14th February 2008.19. Finally, the Crown argues both accused arriving in Australia with substantial sums of United States currency is a coincidence upon which it can rely.The Defence Cases as revealed thus far20. M/s Basri’s and Mohammed have each made clear to police they were unaware of the presence of any contraband substance in the suitcase each was bringing to Australia. M/s Basri told police the bag was hers, although that explanation appears to have been later qualified. In her interview she told police the bag was her brother’s, it was a bag she used from time to time. In effect she borrowed it from her brother. She says she inspected the bag thoroughly before packing it herself in India. There was no contraband in the suitcase.21. Mohammed denies ownership of the suitcase or packing it prior to leaving India. He denies any knowledge of the illicit drugs being present in the bag.22. Neither Madubuko nor Okonkwo, but for the pleas of “Not Guilty” has otherwise sought to advance a defence he will be running during the trial. Of course there is no onus upon either to advance any defence. Each may remain mute and require the Crown to prove his guilt if it can. While I cannot speculate, it is unlikely either has any interest in challenging the physical importation of heroin into Australia via two suitcases, one of which was, at the relevant time in possession of Ms Basri and the other in the possession of Mohammed. The outcome of each accused’s case is likely to depend upon the capacity of the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the necessary fault elements apposite to the charge or charges each accused faces. The threshold question23. In effect there are two major applications before the Court. Mohammed seeks severance of his charge from the indictment and a separate trial. All counsel seek the rejection of “coincidence evidence” sought to be lead by the Crown. The Crown has indicated in the event of the Mohammed charge being severed from the present indictment, it still proposes to lead “coincidence evidence” in both trials. Should Mohammed be successful in obtaining a separate trial, Madubuko applies to have the charge he faces of attempting to possess the proceeds of the alleged Mohammed importation heard in what I will call the Mohammed trail. As I understand it, even in the absence of co-incidence evidence, Mohammed still seeks a separate trial.24, The Crown concedes it cannot allege any common purpose or joint criminal enterprise in its cases against Ms Basri and Mohammed. The Crown case is that Madubuko was to be involved in the receipt of the product brought in by Mohammed.25. I propose to approach the question of coincidence evidence initially. Once the outcome of that matter has been determined, then I shall determine the separate trial application. It seems to me more appropriate to determine the coincidence evidence issue as though all accused were present. A case for coincidence evidence is more likely to be made with Mohammed present. Clearly one of the factors in determining whether coincidence is made out will be its impact in the case against Mohammed. 26. Once I have determined my attitude to coincidence, I shall then look at the question of whether Mohammed should have a separate trail. In the event he is given a separate trial I shall then have regard to Madubuko’s application. In the event that a severance is given, there may be some need to review the coincidence evidence question in the light of altered circumstances.Relevance of Coincidence evidence to the Crown case. 27. The Crown says that because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally that Madubuko, Okonkwo and Ms Basri had a particular state of mind, that is, they intended to possess the heroin imported by Ms Basri; and that Madubuko and Mohammed had a particular state of mind, that is they intended to possess the heroin imported by Mohammed. [T. 08/10/08 p.25/4-9]. The Crown puts his case on coincidence this way later in the submissions. “…it goes to possession and state of mind in relation to …counts 1 and 2. The coincidences are such that each of the couriers knew that there was something illicit in their bags and were reckless as to what is was….” [T.08/10/08 p. 28/27-30]. The Crown argued the fault element in relation to the importation charges was intention, belief or knowledge. The Crown case was that each accused was at very least reckless as to whether the bag each imported contained a substance, and reckless as to what that substance was. 28. The Crown acknowledged the real dispute in the trial was likely to centre upon whether the Crown could prove the fault elements required in the importation cases and the fault elements in respect of the attempt possess a border control substance charge.29. The crown submitted that the coincidence show the mental elements can be made out.The Coincidence rule30. The Evidence Act 1995 (Cwlth) (the Act) provides: 
     
      
      The coincidence rule 
      
    (1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
     
      
       
      
    (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or(b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
     
      
       
      
    (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar; and (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.(3) Para 1(a) does not apply if: 
     
      
       
      
    (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100; or(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.31. An “event” is defined as meaning  
     
      
      1. anything that happens or is regarded as happening: an occurrence, esp. one of some importance. 2. the fact of happening (chiefly in the phrase:

    32. Section 98 (2) provides that events are taken to be related if and only if two conditions apply – namely they are substantially and relevantly similar and secondly the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.33. Traditionally, “coincidence evidence” has been the mechanism by which similar fact and circumstances has been led against a single accused, with a view to demonstrating that because of the similarity of the past events an inference adverse to an accused can be drawn by comparing the Crown allegations made in respect of the instant case with past conduct of an accused. (see for example R v Maxwell John White [1999] NSWCCA 336; for common law cases involving the same principle see Perry v The Queen 1982 CLR 580; Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528).34. However, in this case the Crown seeks to rely upon the concept of “related events” to expand the use of s.98 of the Act. The Crown relies on s.98 to harness it for the purposes of demonstrating a system of conduct undertaken by two accused who separately imported, on its case, heroin into Australia. The Crown concedes there is no joint enterprise or common purpose alleged in its cases against each accused. Nonetheless the Crown case is the “related events” would establish a common point of origin of the heroin from which a jury would then be able to infer a system or modus operandi, from which a jury could then move on to further infer knowledge, intent or recklessness in each accused as to the product she/he was importing into Australia. 35. With respect to him, the Crown appears to have made two significant errors in his approach to matters falling within s.98 of the Act. Firstly, he appears to have failed to distinguish between “events” and “circumstances”. It is important to note s.98 relates to the use to be made of “related events”. By comparison s. 97 of the Act deals with the use that may be made in some circumstances of “evidence of character, reputation or conduct …or tendency of a person”. 36. In this case, the Crown, for example, seeks to rely upon the presence of Mohammed’s photograph being stored in M/s Basri’s mobile phone as an “event”. Similarly he relies upon a telephone number noted in a notebook in Mohammed’s possession at the time of arrest as being consistent with being the phone number of a phone in Madubuko’s possession at the time of his arrest as being an “event”. While these matters may amount to coincidences, they are circumstances rather than events. These are matters which may constitute circumstantial evidence in the Crown case against Mohammed and Ms Basri in the first instance, and against Mohammed and Madubuko in the second.37. The second significant error is that he seeks to have the question of whether matters constitute coincidental “related events”, upon an overview of the entire package of matters he has nominated. It may well be that the question of whether the package of coincidental related events is to be admitted as coincidence evidence will depend upon an overview of the evidence. However, the question of which evidence qualifies as “related events” must be determined, if the evidence’s status is challenged, upon an analysis of the evidence itself. In this case the parties have challenged whether any of the items were “related evidence” as envisaged by s.98 of the Act.38. Applying the distinction I have identified between a “related event” and a matter of circumstance, I can exclude immediately from consideration as related events a number of items sought to be relied upon by the Crown. By reference to the Prosecution’s Schedule of Coincidences, I exclude items 1. Nationality of each of Mohammed and Ms Basri; 7. Photograph of Mohammed in M/s Basri’s phone; 9. the presence in Mohammed’s notebook of a phone number which is the same as the Madubuko’s mobile phone number; 10. the presence of another number, and the SMS texts (assuming they are to be led in evidence) found sent and received from the number found in Mohammed’s phone; and other SMS messages received in M/s Basri’s mobile phone; 12. the common numbers and names against which those numbers are found in Mohammed’s mobile phone and Ms Basri’s mobile phone; 13. entries upon incoming Immigration Entry cards in relation to holidays; 14. the fact that neither Ms Basri nor Mohammed appeared to have planned holidays to Australia before departing from either Malaysia or India as the case may be; 16. the possession by each of Ms Basri and Mohammed of 2 SIM cards, one of which was an AirTel; 17. the clothing contents of each suitcase upon arrival in Australia.39. If I be in error in determining the above matters should be excluded from consideration as “related events”, then I should indicate my view they fail to qualify as related events because they fail to conform to the requirements of s.98 (2). Shortly I shall look at that more closely. I pause so that I can indicate that just because I have excluded these items as “related events” does not mean I have necessarily excluded any or all of them from admission into evidence upon some other basis. For example, the possession by Mohammed of a phone number upon which Madubuko could be contacted is capable of being circumstantial evidence against both accused on the question of whether there was any common purpose shared by them regarding the delivery of heroin to Madubuko. 40. While I do not exclude for the purposes of this judgment that actions of different accused cannot be captured within the coincidence rule as “related events”, the provisions of s.98(2) make such a proposition difficult. That two accused can be associated by “related events” is likely to be difficult because of the impact of one arm or the other of the s.98(2) tests. A useful example is the presence of the photograph of Mohammed in Basri’s phone. Firstly, the presence of the photograph in Ms Basri’s phone is not relevantly or substantially similar with any other item listed against Mohammed in the schedule of coincidence. Nor is its being taken by Basri (Item 8) relevantly or substantially similar with any other item against Mohammed in the Prosecutions Schedule of coincidences. The photograph being taken and stored is not a “related event” it is the same event. 41. So far as Ms Basri and Mohammed are concerned, the taking of the photo is an event which involves both of them. In the case of each it cannot constitute a “related event” in the case of the other, because it is the same event. In fact the Crown relies upon their being present at the same time and place and both participating in the same event. Further, the photograph’s storage by M/s Basri has no corresponding related event in the case against Mohammed. That is, no relevantly substantial and similar related event (s.98(1). Nor is there any circumstance in which the event (the storage of the photograph) occurred relevantly similar in Mohammed’s case (s.98(2)). Had he taken a photograph of her, for example at the same time and place and stored it in his camera, an argument that the taking and storage of the photographs by each were related events may have some merit.42. In fairness to the Crown, I have sought to encapsulate the items on his schedule and in his Notice as “events” to test whether it can be said they could in that way be described as related events. Whether an overview on the items qualifies them as related events requires an analysis of the prosecutions items. Nine of the Crown’s so-called items of coincidence if translated into “events” may suggest the Crown is arguing:  a) Two accused, both Malaysian residents, without prior planning, travelled at short notice to India, and within a short time of their arrival there, travelled to Australia by plane arriving at Kingsford Smith Airport on 25th February 2008, each carrying substantial amount of US currency, and with suitcases of the same brand containing heroin concealed in a false lining of the case beneath the mechanism housing the handle extensions, bound with brown tape. Each accused, departed from India within a day or so of the other. Both made reference on their incoming Immigration and Customs Entry card of coming to Australia for holidays. 43. A further four so-called items of coincidence may be expressed as an event thus: b) Each carries a mobile phone with her/him. There has been stored by someone within the mobile phone of each, items – phone numbers, SMS messages, photograph, and entries such as “John” and “Johnny” which suggest some link or links in common between the two users of the phone. Ms Basri and Mohammed each has travelled whilst having in their possession two SIM cards, one of which is an AirTel SIM card.44. Assuming for the moment the description encapsulated in a) could be properly described as a description of two events – one involving Ms Basri, the other Mohammed, then those events would not qualify as a “related events” pursuant to s.98 (2) of the Act. Once any detailed comparison is made between the circumstances of Ms Basri’s trip to India, and on-travelling to Australia with that undertaken by Mohammed, neither is substantially and relevantly similar. One is male, the other female. One arrives in India 11 days prior to departure and stays for that time with Gina (on the Crown case involved in the importation). There is no comparison as to how Mohammed spends his 4 days in India, or what, if any contact he has with any one associated with the importation. Both are done at different times; one trip is constituted by an internal trip to an airport and an international trip from that airport to Sydney, the other by a direct trip from Mumbai to Sydney. Each is done on a different airline. For all I know differing sums were paid for the total airfare, and possibly for the international airfare. One was undertaken after 4 days in India, the other after 11 days. Each travels at different times and by different routes to Sydney. The suitcase are of differing colours and sizes. When closely examined there are differences in the packaging and size of the packets containing the contraband. One brings in a commercial quantity of heroin, the other less than a commercial quantity. There is no evidence the proportion of heroin to admixture is substantially and relevantly similar. The heroin in each packet is of different origin. The quantity of United States currency each is carrying differs significantly. Mohammed is carrying if my maths is correct 66% more than Ms Basri. The origin of Mohammed’s US currency is not disclosed in evidence. The purpose (assuming there is a specific one) of bringing the money is also unexplained in Mohammed’s case. In Ms Basri’s case it is said that $1000 is for a return ticket home (an explanation, incidentally, that a jury may have difficulty accepting). 45. From remarks earlier made, it will be readily understood, assuming the matters referred to in item b) could properly be described as two events – one relating to each of Ms Basri and Mohammed, then I would not regard them as “related” because of the provisions of s.98 (2) of the Act.46. In the normal course of events the coincidence rule may be a mechanism used to establish the same accused committed a number of crimes having a similar modus operandi. In my experience I have not seen it being harnessed to link different accused to the same criminal organisation, or to a system. While I am in no position to rule out that it may be harnessed for such a task, on the evidence before me it cannot be so harnessed in this case. I do note however the terms of the test required by s.101 (2) of the Act appears predicated upon a proposition that coincidence evidence would for the purpose of that section be considered as it related to a single defendant.47. Because of my approach to “related events” as set out above, it becomes unnecessary for me to have regard to the tests imposed by s98 (1)(b) or s.101 (2). However, given the purpose relied upon by the Crown for the tender of such evidence, namely to prove the fault elements required of him in respect of all accused, I would have ruled the items he relied upon would have no probative value against Okonkwo, very limited probative value against Madubuko, and in all cases substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect on each accused.Determination of the Coincidence Evidence Issue48. The objection to the use of coincidence evidence pursuant to the Notice given by the Crown is upheld.49. Consistent with an indication, earlier given by me, the Crown will be entitled to lead circumstantial evidence against both Mohammed and Madubuko of the presence in Mohammed’s notebook of a telephone number that is the number of the phone in Madubuko’s possession at the time of his arrest.Mohammed’s Application for Separate Trial50. Both Crown and Mr Coyne have favoured me with written submissions. I am grateful to have had the benefit of those submissions.51. I have reviewed above the Crown case against Mohammed, and so far as is known his response to it. I have noted the Crown’s concession that it does not allege common purpose or joint criminal enterprise with M/s Basri. I have noted a link between Mohammed and Madubuko. 52. I have also made clear the Crown will not be leading coincidence evidence against Mohammed. 53. The Crown case is both M/s Basri and Mohammed have been used as couriers by the same principal(s). It is clear from the Crown submissions that he sees benefit in relying upon circumstances which may point towards both couriers being dispatched by the same principal(s). In order to advance that case the Crown will seek to rely upon evidence it was initially intending to lead as coincidence evidence. 54. Both M/s Basri and Mohammed deny knowledge of the presence of heroin. M/s Basri goes further denying she packed any contraband in her suitcase. She also denies the heroin was in her suitcase when she packed it. She knows this because she checked the internal lining.55. The state of the evidence will invariable lead to a jury to comparing the cases of M/s Basri and Mohammed. There is a real danger of a jury relying upon their attitude to the evidence in one accused’s case, particularly in respect of any explanation given (such as I didn’t know there was heroin in the bag), to colour their attitude to the other case, again including any explanation given by that accused. I am far from confident that any direction I may give will be sufficient to divert a jury from any such impermissible comparison.56. The law in relation to separate trials is well settled. The onus is upon the accused to satisfy the court a separate trial is in the interests of justice. The remedy is a discretionary one, which must be arrived at by application of proper principle.57. At common law the inclusion of several accused on an indictment can be restricted. 
     
      
       
      As a general rule, it is of course no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that had nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are, upon the available evidence, so related whether in time or other factors that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together then they can properly be the subject of counts in the one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together. Such a rule, of course, includes case where there is evidence that several offenders acted in concert but is not limited to such cases.

       [1966] 2 QB 249; approved  
      Annankin v R 
       (1988) 17 NSWLR 202. 
      
    58. The functions of an indictment were reviewed in R v Janeceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10. Significantly insofar as this trial is concerned two of the five functions are significant: 
     
      
      (ii) Providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he or she is called upon to meet,  
      including identification of the essential factual ingredients 
      . (emphasis supplied; authority omitted). 
       
      (iii) Enabling the court to ensure that only relevant evidence is admitted and to properly instruct the jury on the relevant law. (authorities omitted). 
      
    59. The principles to be applied in determining whether to grant a separate trial are to be found in R v Middis unreported NSWSC 27 March 1991 per Hunt CJ at CL. They were approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Baartman (unreported) NSWCCA 6 October 1994. 
     
      
      1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and  
       
      2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and 
       
      3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that a positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial. 
       
      
    60. Mr Crown argues the prosecution case against Ms Basri and Mohammed is basically the same. With respect, that is not so. There are significant differences. Ms Basri’s admitted association with Gina for several days, and the link to Gina to be found in post India phone contact. Upon her arrival, although denying knowledge of the heroin, she willingly participated in a controlled delivery. Evidence emerging from the controlled delivery is relevant in her case but not in Mohammed’s. A jury may well take the view that evidence arising from the controlled delivery greatly enhances the case against Ms Basri. No doubt the Crown thinks so, for he intends to lead the evidence against her. However the same jury may regard it as filling in gaps in evidence against Mohammed and throwing light on his contacts in India and his intended course after arrival at Kingsford Smith Airport.Determination of the Notice of Motion61. I order that Lokman Mohammed be tried separately on the charge upon which he was arraigned before me on 8th October last.Severance Application by Madubuko62. As earlier noted Dr Glennan sought severance of Count 4 in the indictment upon the basis that it be joined in the indictment upon which Mohammed is to be tried. Count 4 arises out of the Crown case that Madubuko intended to possess the heroin brought in by Mohammed. As a matter of common sense, he should be tried on this charge with Mohammed rather than Madubuko face the charge in the context of the Crown’s allegations against Ms Basri. The principles I have referred to above have equal application when severing a charge. 63. In Madubuko’s matters the Crown case is immeasurably stronger on count 3 than it is on count 4. For that reason alone he is entitled to have the count severed, so that he can face the charge in its proper context.Determination of Application by Madubuko64. I order that count 4 in the indictment upon which the accused Henry Madubuko was arraigned on 8th October last by severed from the indictment.65. I further order that Henry Madubuko be tried on that charge at a time and place when Lockman Mohammed is tried upon the first count in the said indictment.

      JUDGMENT - On applications for separate trials re accused Elomar and Hasan - (Trials separate from that of Moustafa Cheikho) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: There are two applications before the Court, each for a separate trial. The first is brought on behalf of Mohamed Elomar (""Elomar""). The second is brought on behalf of Abdul Rakib Hasan (""Hasan""). 
     
      
    2 The submissions on behalf of both men were prepared and given, in the main, by Mr Dalton SC. Ms Yehia, who appears for Hasan, made some brief submissions in support but was otherwise content to rely upon the submissions made by Mr Dalton. 
     
      
    3 Nine men were, last year, indicted before me on a charge of conspiring with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The span of the alleged conspiracy, in terms of the indictment, is between about 8 July 2004 and November 2005. 
     
      
    4 In general terms, the Crown case is that each accused was party to an agreement to do an act or acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Each of the accused believed that he was a devout Muslim. Each of the accused held certain beliefs in common relating to their interpretation of the Muslim faith. Their common beliefs included the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) Islam throughout the world was under attack and there was a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims;  
       
       
      (b) jihad was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled; 
       
       
      (c) a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent jihad, which involved the application of force and violence, including, in certain circumstances, the killing of ""infidels"" or ""kuffir"", that is, persons who do not have the same fundamental beliefs.  
       
      
    5 In accordance with the holding of those common beliefs, the accused, according to the Crown case, entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or terrorist acts. This involved equipping themselves with knowledge, ability and means to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. In furtherance of the agreement, the Crown alleges that the accused: 
     
      
       
      (a) obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used (directly and/or indirectly) in the construction of an explosive device; 
       
       
      (b) obtain or attempted to obtain weaponry and ammunition; 
       
       
      (c) possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material.  
       
      
    6 The Crown case is, broadly speaking, a circumstantial one.  
     
      
    7 One of the co-accused is Moustafa Cheikho. In the decision given on 15 April 2008 (R v Baladjam [No 7]) I had to determine whether to exclude certain evidence sought to be tendered against Moustafa Cheikho. At the same time, I had to determine whether, if admitted, the evidence would be admissible against all the accused.  
     
      
    8 The nature of the evidence sought to be led against Moustafa Cheikho was that he had gone to Pakistan in late 2001, and there trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp (LeT). The evidence came essentially from a man named Yong Ki Kwon, who had attended the same training camp in Pakistan. Kwon purported to identify Moustafa Cheikho as one of the trainees at the camp, known to him as Abu Asad. Kwon's evidence suggested that “Abu Asad” had participated in religious training, physical training and firearms training. 
     
      
    9 The Crown had indicated that it proposed to rely on the evidence of Abu Asad’s training at the Pakistan camp in two ways. First, it proposed to place the evidence before the jury as evidence against Moustafa Cheikho himself. On this basis, the Crown argued that the fact of LeT training was relevant and admissible as part of the overall circumstantial case against Moustafa Cheikho. If admitted, the Crown proposed to use it as relevant material going to proof of both the physical and fault elements of the offence charged against him in the indictment. These were said to be, first, the fact that he entered into the agreement; secondly, that he did so intentionally; and, thirdly, that, in accordance with s 11.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, he had an intention that an offence, or offences, would be committed. Secondly, the Crown proposed to lead the evidence against all the accused on the basis that Abu Asad's training represented ""an available resource"" to the conspiracy. 
     
      
    10 In my earlier decision, I ruled that the evidence was relevant and admissible against Moustafa Cheikho. Secondly, I ruled that it should not be excluded under ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. I held, however, that it should be admitted against Moustafa Cheikho only, and that it should not be permitted to be used against the other accused. I held that there was no direct evidence (at the time) to suggest that any of the co-accused knew of, or adverted to Moustafa Cheikho's alleged training in Pakistan in 2001. Further, I held that there was no evidence to suggest that Moustafa Cheikho's experience and expertise, such as it may have been, was in fact used or relied upon throughout the period of the alleged conspiracy. 
     
      
    11 The present applications arise directly out of the findings I made on 15 April 2008. The simple proposition, embraced by counsel for Elomar and Hasan, is that the presence at trial of evidence of the training by Moustafa Cheikho in Pakistan in 2001 will raise a real risk of positive injustice to the two men. Consequently, they seek an order for a separate trial. 
     
      
    12 I should make it clear, however, that the application is that Hasan and Elomar be tried jointly with all the other accused, but not with Moustafa Cheikho. In effect, the application is to have Moustafa Cheikho tried separately from all the other accused. 
     
      
       
      Relevant principles on application for a separate trial 
       
      
    13 The applications for separate trial are brought pursuant to s 21(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act. This section confers a discretion upon the Court to make an order for a separate trial ""if of the opinion...that for any (other) reason it is desirable"" to do so. 
     
      
    14 With one or two minor qualifications, the parties are in complete agreement as to the relevant principles which govern an application for a separate trial. Those principles may be summarised as follows:  
     
      
       
      (a) Where the Crown case is that the accused were parties to some form of joint enterprise, the starting point is that they should be tried jointly ( 
      Webb v R 
       (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 per Toohey J;  
      Domican v R 
       (1989) 43 A Crim R 24 at 26.  
       
       
      (b) The accused bears the onus of establishing the reasons for the making of an order granting a separate trial ( 
      R v Bikic 
       (2000) 112 A Crim R 300).  
       
       
      (c) To succeed, the applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice would be caused to him (or her) as a consequence of a joint trial ( 
      R v Ce 
       (2005) NSWCCA 362 per Grove J at paras 4-5). In that case his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “It is well-established that principle and policy both indicate that persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought be tried together, even where accused persons seek to cast the blame upon each other:  
        Webb & Anor v R 
        . That rule is subject to a proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered ( 
        R v Oliver 
         (1987) 57 ALR 543;  
        R v Patsalis & Anor 
         (1999) 107 A Crim R 432).” 
        
       
       
      (d) A separate trial is to be ordered where an applicant is able to demonstrate: 
       
       
        
        (i) the evidence against the applicant is significantly weaker than, and different to, that which is admissible against another co-accused with whom he is to be tried; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the evidence against the other accused contains material which is highly prejudicial to the applicant, although not admissible against him; and 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material ( 
        R v Middis 
         (SC NSW - 27 March 1991, Hunt J - unreported, at page 4);  
        R v Baartman 
         (CCA NSW - 6 October 1994 - unreported);  
        R v Georgiou 
         (1999) NSWCCA 125 at (5)). The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial. 
        
       
       
      (e) In determining the issue as to whether a separate trial should be ordered, the Court must take into account not only the interests of the applicant but also the interests of the administration of justice. In fact, it is the interests of justice as a whole that are to be the governing factor. But, of course, among those interests are the interests of the accused.  
       
       
      (f) One reason which has led to joint offences being tried together is the important policy reason related to the desirability that the same verdict and the same judgment should be returned against all those concerned in the same offences. That is to say, there is a need to avoid a situation, which might commonly arise where inconsistent verdicts might be given because of the holding of separate trials. It is not simply a question of saving time and money, although this is a consideration that may be taken into account ( 
      R v Merrett 
       19 A Crim R 363 per Slattery CJ at CL and Carruthers J;  
      R v Fernando 
       (1999) NSWCCA 66 at (195-226)). 
       
       
      Suggested qualifications 
       
      
    15 The suggested qualifications to these principles were raised in the oral submissions made by Mr Dalton SC. Senior Counsel referred to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pham ([2004] NSWCCA 190) and, in particular, to the decision of Adams J in that case. The relevant passages appear at paragraphs 39 and 40, in a part of his Honour's judgment where he had been discussing the three Middis principles referred to above (at (d)(i) to (iii)). Adams J wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “(39) Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, 'immeasurably', usually connotes something of such an enormous size that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant 'significant, though incommensurable'. The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction, then this would, I think, amount to 'positive injustice'. Of course the likelihood cannot be measured: If it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence. 
        
       
       
        
        (40) I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case...as it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case.” 
        
       
      
    16 Mr Dalton identified the two qualifications from these passages. The first related to the adverb ""immeasurably"" where it had been used by Hunt J in R v Middis. Adams J preferred ""significant, though incommensurable"". The Crown does not quarrel with this suggested qualification. It has no bearing on the present debate. 
     
      
    17 The second qualification suggested by Mr Dalton emerged from the discussion by Adams J as to whether the weakness of the applicant's case (as compared to that of a co-accused against whom the prejudicial evidence is to be tendered) is, or is not, a relevant consideration. The Crown took issue with this ""qualification"", and suggested that, in this regard, the proper test had not been ""watered down"" by the remarks of Adams J. Mr Dalton suggested that the observations of Adams J had been accepted by Spigelman CJ and Hulme J in R v Pham. I do not think that this is correct. In fact, Hulme J said at para 5: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant submitted, and the Crown did not dispute, that the relevant principles governing the exercise of a trial judge's discretion when asked to grant a separate trial, are set out in  
        R v Middis... 
        and accepted by this Court in  
        R v Baartman 
        ...and  
        R v Georgiou 
        ...there was no discussion about these in either the written or oral submissions in the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Chief Justice simply said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subject to the additional observations of Hulme J, with which I agree, I agree with Adams J and the orders he proposed."" 
        
       
      
    19 I do not think it can be said that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has substantially qualified, or watered down, the well-established principles often described as the Middis principles. They were applied, for example, by Price J in R v Lu & Anor (2007) NSWSC 1141. They had been applied earlier, for example, in R v Chami; R v Sheikh (2002) NSWCCA. My brief researches have been unable to discover any case in the last three years where the Court of Criminal Appeal has doubted, or been critical, of the Middis principles.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case against Elomar 
       
      
    20 The case against Elomar (and, for that matter, against Hasan) involves a considerable body of evidence arising from the activities of other persons, including the other accused. This is so in two ways. First, there is a considerable body of evidence that is admissible against each of Elomar and Hasan on the basis that it is evidence going to the nature and scope of the alleged conspiracy. 
     
      
    21 Secondly, there is evidence of the activities of the other accused, which the Crown will lead as being admissible against each and every one of the accused, pursuant to the co-conspirators' rule. 
     
      
    22 Finally, there is direct evidence against each of Elomar and Hasan, that is evidence relating to their individual activities. It is this direct evidence that I will now recount in summary form, commencing with the activities of Elomar. 
     
      
    23 The direct evidence in the Crown case against the applicant Elomar includes (inter alia) the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) his purchase of scopes and ammunition at the Horsley Park Gun Shop on 27 January 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) his travel to Melbourne on various occasions, and his related association with Benbrika; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) his role in the ordering of equipment from Haines Educational Pty Limited; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) his attendance at the two camps; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the finding of various items upon the execution of a Search Warrant on his vehicle and premises on 27 June 2005, including: 
        
       
      
    (i) instructions (written in Arabic) for the manufacture of explosive devices; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    (ii) a document entitled “Security and Intelligence” which contained material relating to sabotage and counter espionage, surveillance and the manufacture and detonation of improvised explosives;(iii) 4 boxes of compressed hexamine;(iv) a quantity of firearms and pistols; and(v) a large quantity of assorted ammunition;(vi) his use of a false telephone service in the name of Mark Jenkins and his related association with the co-accused Baladjam and Mulahalilovic;  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
          (vii) his use of a false telephone service in the name of John Pham and his related association with the co-accused Khaled Cheikho; 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    (viii) his activities on 2 November 2005; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    (x) his attendance at Bunnings Warehouse on 3 November 2005 and his purchase of quantities of insulation tape and anti-bacterial containers; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    (xi) his attendance, on the same day, at Ronnie’s Discount Store in Bankstown and his purchase of 5 containers 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    (xii) his possession of the items seized pursuant to the execution of a Search Warrant at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      Evidence against Hasan 
       
      
    24 The direct evidence in the Crown case against Hasan includes the following: 
     
      
    (a) his attendance at retail outlets and his purchase of (inter alia) camping equipment, maps, thermometers/flasks/beakers, sulphuric acid and water and acetone; 
     
      
    (b) his enquiries about the availability of CB radio scanners, iceboxes, methylated spirits and acetone, and wireless CCTV security cameras; 
     
      
    (c) his possession of documents (inter alia) providing instructions on how to make explosive devices, how to construct an M 14 Antipersonnel Mine and how to prepare a non electric firing system; 
     
      
    (d) his possession of a box of hexamine, a document relating to industrial thermometers, and a receipt for the sale of a telephone activated in the false name of Anfony Commito; 
     
      
    (e) his role in the ordering of equipment from Haines Educational Pty Limited; 
     
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    (f) his association with Benbrika;(g) his attendance at two camps; 
     
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    (h) his possession of the items seized at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
       
      The Defence Case 
       
      
    25 Mr Dalton has indicated that the defence will argue at trial that many of the acts, and other matters to be relied on by the Crown, will not be found to support the ""sinister"" interpretation the Crown wishes to place upon the evidence. The defence case will be that the overall circumstantial case, represented by the substantial body of Crown evidence, leaves alive an explanation inconsistent with guilt. The concern of both Mr Dalton and Ms Yehia is that their case will be substantially prejudiced by the evidence relating to Moustafa Cheikho's training in Pakistan. 
     
      
       
      The argument of the parties - separate trial 
       
      
    26 It is necessary to say something in a little more detail about the arguments presented on behalf of Elomar and Hasan. The starting point is the submission that the evidence of Moustafa Cheikho's training is ""highly prejudicial"" (I have held in my earlier ruling that it was not unfairly prejudicial). Indeed, Mr Dalton suggested that the presence of this piece of evidence would result in the case against Moustafa Cheikho being ""an overwhelming one"". (I hasten to add that Mr Button SC, who appears for Moustafa Cheikho, did not agree with this proposition at all.) 
     
      
    27 The essential point made by Mr Dalton, however, was that the jury, no matter what directions they might be given, would conjecture that the other accused must have known of his training, and must have been infected by it in one form or another. The prospect of guilt by association, Mr Dalton argued, was very real. Thus, the case against each of the two men would be transformed into an ""overwhelming one"" by virtue of a piece of evidence that was not admissible in their cases at all.  
     
      
    28 Mr Dalton gave an example: The Crown case, he said, was one that emphasised these men were training themselves for jihad, albeit in an unsophisticated and rudimentary way. The presence of this piece of evidence at trial would suggest their ""training"" was being directed by a professional ""graduate"" of a terrorist training school. 
     
      
    29 Ms Yehia took a variant of the same example to illustrate her concerns. She referred in particular to the Crown case evidence relating to two camping trips in 2005 in rural New South Wales. The first was at Curranyalpa, and the second at Mulga Creek Station southeast of Bourke. Moustafa Cheikho had attended the second of these camping trips. Elomar and Hasan had attended both of them (see R v Baladjam [No 11] for the detail). 
     
      
    30 Ms Yehia pointed out that there was no evidence as to what had happened at those camping trips, beyond the finding of the detritus left behind by the men. The defence would argue that it was a perfectly normal and innocent camping trip engaged in by a group of men enjoying their leisure. Counsel argued, however, that the jury would speculate as to the nature of the events at the camps, because of the presence of Moustafa Cheikho at the second camp. They would speculate that there may have been training, and that the training might be of the same kind Cheikho received at the LeT camp.  
     
      
    31 Ms Yehia argued that the image of a person training at an overseas terrorist camp, one seen frequently on the media, would be a dramatic and graphic image. Particularly as the training alleged against Moustafa Cheikho occurred very shortly after the atrocities of September 11 2001, the image would impermissibly taint the jury's approach to the Crown case against the other men. Both Mr Dalton SC and Ms Yehia suggested directions would be futile in this situation and might, indeed, worsen the speculation. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues - general comments 
       
      
    32 I must state at the outset that, despite the forceful arguments of counsel, I do not agree that the matters relied upon are persuasive of a finding that there should be a separate trial. First, I do not think the evidence concerning Moustafa Cheikho's alleged training at a Pakistani LeT camp is as highly prejudicial as has been claimed. It is certainly prejudicial, in a general sense, in the case against Moustafa Cheikho. But, even in the case against him, its value may be curtailed somewhat by a number of matters that are likely to be raised by Mr Button SC on his behalf. For example, there is a real issue as to whether it was he at the camp. Was the man Abu Asad in fact the accused Moustafa Cheikho? Mr Button will argue strongly that the identification itself, and indeed the process, were seriously flawed. In addition, there will be a real issue over the reliability and credibility of the witness Kwon. This man will be painted as something of a ""stooge"" for the FBI, a person who was acting as a professional witness to secure his own release from custody for serious terrorist offences.  
     
      
    33 An alternative position likely to be taken by Mr Button is that he will, no doubt, make much of the fact that the training, if it were undertaken by his client, occurred a number of years prior to the commencement of the alleged conspiracy. In addition, he will argue that the training was of a limited nature. It certainly did not embrace the making of IEDs designed to bring about the death of civilians in urban areas. There is no evidence that the training had anything to do with Australian conditions. On the contrary, Mr Button will argue that it was concerned with a local issue, namely the expulsion of Indian troops from the Pakistani section of Kashmir. Mr Button will no doubt point out, as well, that, in 2001, LeT was not a proscribed terrorist organisation. All these matters will, in the case against Moustafa Cheikho, be likely to be before the jury.  
     
      
    34 The second reason for my rejecting the submissions made on behalf of Elomar and Hasan is the firm belief I hold that the giving of appropriate directions will be sufficient in the circumstances of this matter to prevent the unwarranted speculation and conjecture painted so colourfully by the submissions of counsel.  
     
      
    35 The fact of Moustafa Cheikho's training in Pakistan, if it were he, is a single isolated piece of evidence. It is isolated both temporally and geographically. It predated the alleged conspiracy by about two and a half years. There will be, as I understand it, no evidence of any adverse behaviour by Moustafa Cheikho after he returned to Australia from overseas up until the commencement of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    36 As I presently understand the evidence, it will not be suggested that there is evidence from which it might be inferred that Moustafa Cheikho was used as some kind of resource during the period of the conspiracy. There are, literally, hundreds of intercepted calls and listening device conversations relied on by the Crown to show extremist thinking and intentions in the words and thoughts of many of the accused. This is especially so in their interaction with one another and with their spiritual advisor. There is, however, not one word in all of these conversations, which on occasions are very candid indeed, where there is any mention of Moustafa Cheikho having trained in Pakistan some three to four years earlier.  
     
      
    37 In all those circumstances, it seems to me that an appropriate set of directions, given both when the evidence is introduced, and again in the charge to the jury, will be both adequate and effective to compartmentalise the piece of evidence, and to isolate it from the cases against the other men. 
     
      
       
      Application of the Middis principles 
       
      
    38 The first matter to be considered is the strength of the case against each of the applicants. It may readily be said that the Crown evidence against each of Hasan and Elomar, indeed against all the accused, is very similar in content. Quite apart from the application of the co-conspirators' rule, much of the evidence will reflect common activities, common association and common interests. This will include, for example, the mutual possession of a number of the accused of extremist material. The only possible qualification to these general observations is the case against Mulahalilovic, because of his apparent late arrival on the scene. 
     
      
    39 The case against each of the accused, leaving to one side altogether the training evidence relating to Moustafa Cheikho (which is to be admissible only against him) is a strong one. Indeed, neither Mr Dalton nor Miss Yehia suggested otherwise. The isolated piece of evidence relating to Moustafa Cheikho training’s at the LeT camp is of course “different” to the evidence against Hasan and Elomar, but it is not a significantly different case that each of them must face 
     
      
    40 The next matter to consider is whether the evidence concerning Moustafa Cheikho (and admissible only against him) contains material highly prejudicial to Hasan and Elomar, although not admissible against them. The answer to this question must be that it does not. The evidence against Moustafa Cheikho in relation to his training does not relate to the other men at all. It is capable of being viewed as an isolated piece of evidence, occurring in a different country and at a time significantly removed from the commencement of the conspiracy. By its nature, it is easily susceptible to an effective direction to make it clear to the jury that the evidence cannot be used against the others.  
     
      
    41 Is there a real risk that the case against Hasan and Elomar will be made stronger by reason of the evidence of Moustafa Cheikho training at an LeT camp? In my opinion, given that proper directions will be placed before the jury, there is no real risk at all of the kind referred to in the third aspect of the Middis principles. 
     
      
    42 I am comfortably satisfied, having regard to the matters I have mentioned, that the applicant has failed to show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial that includes Moustafa Cheikho. 
     
      
       
      Other cases 
       
      
    43 In deference to the arguments advanced by counsel on behalf of Elomar and Hasan, I will make brief reference to but three cases. There is, in one sense, little value in dwelling on other cases because, in the area of ordering separate trials, so much turns upon the particular facts and circumstances that will arise in an individual case. However, three decisions of those discussed during argument are, I think, instructive.  
     
      
    44 The first is the case of R v Baartman itself. This is a seminal case because a strong Bench, including Gleeson CJ, Powell JA and Smart J, adopted and approved the principles which had been stated by Hunt J in Middis.  
     
      
    45 Three men had been charged with the murder of another man. A joint criminal enterprise was alleged. Two of the accused were together in a house where a listening device had been attached. The police wished to observe the reaction of the two men to an item being run by a television company concerning the killing of the victim. The tape recording of the reaction of the two men to the television program was dramatic in every respect. It powerfully implicated the two men, but some of their remarks plainly referred to the involvement of the third accused against whom the evidence was not admissible. The third man, Baartman, sought a separate trial.  
     
      
    46 The judgment of Gleeson CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) concluded, not surprisingly, that the application of the three Middis principles resulted in an inevitable conclusion that there should be a separate trial. The point to be made from the case is that the dramatic reactions of the two men, captured on the listening device, contained inextricably intertwined remarks that clearly implicated Baartman in the killing, even though the case against him was otherwise a comparatively weak case.  
     
      
    47 The second decision is that of R v Pham, the case I discussed earlier. Again, this involved a joint criminal enterprise involving the execution of a man in which a number of persons, including the applicant for a separate trial, were implicated. There were two witnesses whose evidence was critical in the trial. One of them was one of the members of the joint enterprise who had pleaded guilty and indicated a readiness to give evidence against his accomplices. He was clearly a compromised witness whose reliability was very much in issue. The second witness was not charged with any offence but he was in the motor vehicle when the victim was bundled into it, and driven to the place where he was executed. His reliability was also, to a degree, compromised. Against this background, the problem that arose is succinctly stated by Hulme J in his judgment at paras 7 and 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “7 However, in this case there is a further factor which to my mind compels the conclusion that the trial miscarried. During the Crown Prosecutor's address, very substantial attention was given to the extent to which the accounts given by the two witnesses to whom I have referred were supported by the statements in the appellant's brother's recorded interview. In substance, it was submitted that the jury could have confidence in the reliability of the evidence of those witnesses because it accorded with, and was supported by, similar evidence in the interview. 
        
       
       
        
        8 Whether or not the jury could have put out of its mind, when considering the case against the appellant, the recorded interview, inadmissible against him, there was no practical way they could have assessed the credibility or reliability of the evidence of the two witnesses differently in the case against the appellant than they had or would have done in the case against his brother. Thus, in effect, the interview must have intruded into the case against the appellant when it was not admissible against him. In reaching this conclusion, I do not disregard the Judge's direction to the jury, nor the commonly accepted view, which I share, that juries can and generally do, adhere to the directions they are given. But I do not believe that the jury could, in this case, separately form two assessments of the reliability of each of the Crown's principal witnesses, one assessment using the evidence of the interview and the other, by ignoring it.” 
        
       
      
    48 Thus it will be seen that, in Pham's case, it was the impossible position that resulted from the inadmissible interview intruding, as a matter of necessity, into the applicant's case that led to the finding that a separate trial should have been ordered, and hence that a miscarriage of justice occurred.  
     
      
    49 The third and final case is that of R v Chami: R v Sheikh. The majority of the Court comprised Ipp JA and Bell J. Their Honours ordered that the trial of Sheikh be severed from the indictment, and that he have a separate trial in relation to the offences with which he had been charged. Sheikh was one of five men who had been ordered to stand trial in respect of an indictment containing nineteen counts. Only two of those related to Sheikh. The remaining counts in the indictment related to consecutive but separate incidents involving sexual misconduct of a particularly gross and revolting nature. Ipp JA applied the Middis principles. His Honour said at para 17: 
     
      
       
        
        “The central point made by Mr Wasilenia is that while Sheikh was involved in the first incident he was not involved in the others. Sheikh has been joined in an indictment which has 19 counts, only two of which are in respect of him. None of the evidence that relates to the other 17 counts bears on Sheikh's guilt or otherwise in respect of the two charges he faces. The trial is likely to last some 12 weeks and involve some 70 witnesses. The charges against Sheikh should not take more than two weeks (and could take less) and will involve far fewer witnesses.” 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour continued at paras 19 and 20: 
     
      
       
        
        “19 The conduct giving rise to the 19 counts on the indictment can only be described as brutal, cruel, callous and horrifying. The alleged offenders are all, or all but one, from the same ethnic group. The details of the offences are likely to arouse extremely hostile feelings against these persons. The common ethnicity of the offenders could well give rise to generalised feelings of disgust and anger. It is possible that the jury may be influenced by such feelings, brought about by the conduct of all the offenders, when considering their verdict in respect of the counts alleged against Sheikh. 
        
       
       
        
        20 It is true that the trial judge would no doubt give very careful and explicit directions warning the jury against allowing any such feelings to affect their judgment. But in the highly charged atmosphere of such a trial where there will be a mass of evidence of these appalling crimes, it may be difficult for a jury, with the best will in the world, to remain entirely objective. In summary, I think that there is a risk of guilt by association.” 
        
       
      
    51 (Sully J dissented from the majority and considered that directions would have been sufficient and adequate, and that positive injustice would not result if a separate trial were denied.) 
     
      
    52 It can be readily seen from Ipp JA's comments that the case he was dealing with concerned a very different situation than the one involved in the present applications. Mr Dalton has argued that ""guilt by association” is likely to arise. But I am not satisfied that this is so. In my opinion, the cases against Elomar, Hasan and Moustafa Cheikho are very much the same and have much in common. There is an individual piece of evidence against Moustafa Cheikho which is not admissible against the others. It is an isolated piece of evidence and can easily be the subject of a satisfactory and effective direction. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any real risk of positive injustice.  
     
      
    53 The applications for separate trials are each refused.

    1 HIS HONOUR: Mohammed Omar Jamal is one of nine men charged with an offence of conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. In this decision I shall refer to him as ""the accused"". He was arrested by police on 8 November at about 2.39am. At the time of his arrest the police were in possession of a search warrant for his family home at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield. From 2.39am the accused was detained for the purposes of the investigation. Subject to any extension, the maximum time for which he could be held was four hours (s 23CA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). The legislation allows for an extension of time. The application may be made personally, or it may be made by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means. (Sections 23DA and 23E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). As might be expected, the legislation makes specific provision for periods of time which operate as ""discounts"" where it is necessary to calculate whether the four hour period has expired. To give but one example, the legislation permits a ""discount"" for any time during which the questioning of a person is suspended or delayed to allow the person to communicate with a legal practitioner or other specified person (s 23CA(8)(b)). There are thirteen specified categories of ""discount"".  
     
      
    2 Mr Scragg, counsel for the accused, here seeks to exclude, pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the evidence of answers given by the accused in an ERISP, along with DNA analysis arising from samples obtained from a motor vehicle located at his premises during the search.  
     
      
    3 The exclusion of the evidence is sought on three separate bases. These are: 
     
      
       
      (a) that false information was provided to a magistrate in support of an application for extension of the investigation period; 
       
        
       
      (b) that the police failed to inform the accused of his right to speak with a magistrate in connection with the extension application; and 
       
        
       
      (c) that police failed to comply with the provisions of s 23E(4) and (5) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
      
    4 In relation to the first basis of exclusion, the accused submits that the information in the application was false in that the investigation had not, in fact, been suspended because of three circumstances. These were, firstly, that the police continued to bag and label exhibits after the ""suspension"" at 6.03am; secondly, that police officers continued to walk through the various rooms of the house and inspect them after the moment of ""suspension"", and thirdly, that a police officer, Senior Constable Hackett, spoke to the accused during the ""suspension period"" in such a way as to give rise to a suggestion that the investigation was continuing. 
     
      
       
      The first issue 
       
      
    5 The relevant application to extend time (it was one of a number made at that time) was made by Ian Knight at 6.30am on 8 November 2005. The “written” form of the application to extend time is part of Exhibit 1. The applicants for extension were Ian Knight of the Australian Federal Police and Detective Senior Sergeant Steven Day of the New South Wales Counter-Terrorist Coordination Command. It is common ground that the four hour period, without an exclusion having been granted, would have run out at 6.39am. It is also common ground that the investigation and search of the premises had been ""suspended"" at 6.03am. Notionally, time ceased to run from that point. 
     
      
    6 It is clear, as I have said, that the application for extension of time was one of a number made in the early morning of 8 November 2005. In general terms, all of the accused were arrested on that morning, or during that day. There were applications relating to five of the accused, including Jamal, on that day. 
     
      
    7 At 7.18am Ian Knight faxed through documentation relating to the extension of the investigation period. This documentation followed on the telephone application that had been made at 6.30am. It was apparently received by Ms Albu, the Duty Registrar at about 7.50am. The document recorded in written form the information that had been conveyed to Registrar Albu during the 6.30am phone call. The purpose of the extension sought by Ian Knight was, the document recorded, to enable the police to complete the search in the presence of Mr Jamal, and subsequently to allow police to interview Mr Jamal at the Sydney Police Centre.  
     
      
    8 On the “application” document itself, Ms Albu has written that ""suspect did not wish to make any representations"". This form contains other information, but it is not necessary to set it out in detail. The authorised justice records in her own handwriting: 
     
      
       
        
        “Police have been conducting a search of the premises at 2.39am, the suspect is with police at the premises while the search is being carried out. Police still need to search bedroom, under the house, back veranda, kitchen...police estimate they will need two to two and a half hours to complete the search. Police will then need time to interview the suspect about the offence and/or items seized. Numerous police are involved in conducting the search as quickly and thoroughly as possible having regard to the items being sought.” 
        
       
      
    9 The document records in two places that the ""suspect or his legal representative"" had been given the opportunity to make representations about the application - ""however, suspect did not wish to make any representations"".  
     
      
    10 There is also, on the document, a section where the authorised justice recorded her findings. Ms Albu stated that she was satisfied that the investigation period should be extended for a period of four hours. This authorisation was made at 10.20am on 8 November. According to the form signed by Mariaelena Albu, “an authority pursuant to s 23(4) was completed and signed at 10.20am on 8 November 2005”.  
     
      
    11 The document apparently sent by the AFP at 7.18am is headed ""Authority by Telephone to Extend Investigation Period in Relation to a Terrorism Offence"". This document has noted on, it in the writing of Ms Albu, ""extension granted for four hours from 10.20am on 8 November 05."" The form has a line for signature by the investigating official. The copy in evidence, however, does not contain a signature.  
     
      
    12 Ms Albu has provided a statement. It is part of Exhibit “A”. In this statement, Ms Albu indicates that she was the on-call authorised justice between 5am and 8am on 8 November 2005. She confirmed that she was spoken to by Ian Knight from the AFP at 6.30am on that day. He told her that he intended to fax written authorities to her for consideration under s 23DA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. These were received by her at 7.50am. Ms Albu then spoke to a number of police officers regarding four men who were then under arrest. One of these was Omar Jamal, the present accused. The statement continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. Before I considered any of the applications I advised each police officer that the suspect must be informed that an application was being made to extend the investigation period and also that the suspect must be informed of their right to make representations to me on their own behalf, or through their legal representative. 
         
         
        12. I recall that I spoke with three of the suspects to explain the nature of the application that was being made by police to extend the investigation period.” 
        
       
      
    13 Ms Albu provided, as an annexure, to her statement the handwritten notes she had made on a pro forma document that complied, apparently with departmental procedures in relation to applications for Commonwealth detention after arrest warrants. There are in fact two applications. The first document is headed ""Application for Extension of Investigation Period"". It describes the applicant as Steven Day"" and the suspect as ""Omar Jamal"". The date of the application is 8 November and the time of the application is shown as 6.30am. The handwritten note at the top of the document indicates that Ms Albu spoke ""at 10am on 8 November"" but indicates in the body of the document that: 
     
      
       
        
        “No reps made (suspect did not indicate a desire to make reps).” 
        
       
      
    14 The document indicates Ms Albu's satisfaction that the investigation period should be extended for a period of four hours. It stipulates that the commencing time is 10.20am on 8 November 2005. Once again, this document refers to an authority under s 23E(4) that was completed and signed at 10.20am on 8 November 2005.  
     
      
    15 The form is signed by Ms Albu.  
     
      
    16 The second document is in similar form, but has a different layout. It has annexed to it a document containing 13 typed questions relating to an extension of the investigation period. Ms Albu has completed answers to each of these questions which generally conform to the material I have already identified.  
     
      
    17 Ms Albu explained in her statement that the forms she had at the time were old and almost illegible. Consequently she prepared a document that was easier to read. This explains why there were two “application” forms relating to Omar Jamal. There was an old form and a new form. Both forms, however, were prepared on 8 November 2005, by Ms Albu. They contain, as I have said, essentially the same information.  
     
      
    18 There are also some separate handwritten notes Ms Albu annexed to her statement. These presumably relate to the occasion when she ""spoke at 10am"". The notes indicate that she was speaking to the police. It confirms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applicant officer has advised the suspect the application was being made - he did not indicate that he wished to make reps.” 
        
       
      
    19 On 19 June 2008, Ms Albu had located a further document that she thought might be relevant to the present matter. This was the facsimile cover sheet that she has received from Ian Knight of the AFP on 8 November 2005. She made various handwritten notes on the fax cover sheet and on the reverse of that cover sheet. This shows the time at which she called each particular police officer in relation to each of the suspects the subjects of the extension applications. The entry in relation to Mr Jamal indicates a contact telephone number and the name of an officer, in this case ""Peter Austin"". It also indicates that she called at 10.18am to notify there would be an extension of four hours from 10.20am. A handwritten history of the various telephone calls is located on the back of this document. These were the numbers that she had dialled from her departmental mobile phone on 8 November 2005. Although Ms Albu does not remember who it was she spoke to in connection with the Jamal application, she believes it was “Peter Austin”, and that that call was made at 10.18am on 8 November 2005.  
     
      
       
      The bagging and labelling of exhibits 
       
      
    20 The accused accepts that the police did not continue to physically seize items and log them as exhibits after the suspension of the investigation time at 6.03am. However, the accused argued that the process continued, in the sense that the police then set about ""catching up"" with exhibits. The police had earlier seized 31 CD and 18 audio tapes which required bagging, labelling and recording. This process meant that the investigation continued for a period of time after the suspension, according to the accused’s arguments.  
     
      
    21 Exhibit “B” is the transcript of the video taping of the search warrant. It shows at page 38 that Officer Day said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The time is three minutes past six. We're just going to suspend the search momentarily. The reason for that is just to catch up with exhibits and for police just to grab some air. It is now suspended. 
         
         
        (Search warrant suspended).” 
        
       
      
    22 The next entry is at 12 minutes past eight when there was a brief reference to the second warrant for the search, namely, a warrant relating to a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    23 There is no doubt that the search was suspended at 6.03am. I do not consider that the bagging and labelling of a number of items which had previously been seized under the warrant, prior to the time of the suspension, represented a continuation of the investigative process. As the Crown submitted, those tasks were simply administrative in nature, and did not involve any further investigation at all.  
     
      
    24 Officer Liddiard provided a statement to the Court (part of Exhibit “A”) which said: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the search warrant there was a number of police who were responsible for the identifying of the premises. On seizing any items, the searching officers would give custody of the item to the exhibit officer. In relation to this warrant there was only one exhibit officer and another officer who was allocated to assist him. It was primarily the responsibility of the exhibit officer and his assistant to bag and label the items which had been seized, before writing them up in the property seizure record. Because of a backlog of this work, the searching of the premises was suspended at 6.03am.” 
        
       
      
    25 This statement explains the reason why the bagging and labelling took place after 6.03am. The evidence satisfies me that these tasks were not part of the investigative process, and did not bring about a situation where the suspension of the search and investigation could be classified as illusory. 
     
      
       
      Investigating officers walking though the house 
       
      
    26 Once again, this matter is described by Detective Sergeant Liddiard in his statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between the time that the investigation was suspended and the time of the granting of the extension, police continued to move around the house, but they did not search the premises during that period. Nor was any item inside the premises seized or removed in that period. The only exception to this was when the warrant was resumed to seize the accused's vehicle which was parked in the street opposite his residence.” 
        
       
      
    27 In addition to the evidence from Detective Liddiard there is also relevant material in the transcript (part of Exhibit 1). There, Officer Day informed the accused that the police had been granted an extra four hours in investigation time by a local magistrate (transcript page 38-39). This statement was made shortly before 10.20 and the officer indicated that once 10.20 arrived the search would resume. The following conversation is recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SD: 
         So you agree that whilst we suspended our search at three minutes after six, police haven't conducted any search in any way on these premises.  
         
         
        ... 
         
         
        SD: 
         Do you agree with that, Omer? 
         
         
        OJ: 
         I believe that these officers walked around my house (ind) so I don't know what they're up to.  
         
         
        M: 
         But no physical search has been done? 
         
         
        OJ: 
         I don't know what they were up to, they were walking around my house (ind).  
         
         
        M: 
         We might start the search now.” 
        
       
      
    28 Both Detective Liddiard and Senior Constable Hackett (who gave evidence on the voir dire) were cross-examined in an endeavour to ascertain whether investigative steps had been taken by police who were moving around the house during the suspension period. Cross-examination did not raise any doubts that the position was as it appears to be from the evidence above. It seems clear to me that there was no investigation during the period. It could hardly be expected that the police would behave as if they were statues, or remain in some type of state of administrative petrification during the suspension period. There is not the slightest evidence, however, to suggest that any investigation continued during this period of time.  
     
      
       
      Conversations between the accused and Officer Hackett 
       
      
    29 Senior Constable Hackett provided a statement. He confirmed that the search warrant process had been suspended in the early hours of the morning on 8 November 2005. He was given the task of ""looking after"" Omar Jamal during the suspension period. He said that during this time he and the accused had been sitting in a bedroom at the front of the house. His statement continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “During this time myself and Omer Jamal engaged in general conversation to pass the time. We spoke about such topics as the conflict in the Middle East, the cyclone that had recently devastated New Orleans and religion. Omer Jamal even attempted to convert me to Islam...At no time did I formally question Omer Jamal to elicit information to assist our investigation and thus he was not cautioned. I estimate that we spoke for about one hour, maybe more. After this time the extension of the search warrant was granted and its execution was resumed.” 
        
       
      
    30 Senior Constable Hackett was cross-examined extensively about these conversations. He impressed me as a very honest and sincere young police officer. He was somewhat out of the mould, in that he seemed to be quite genuinely interested in religious and spiritual matters. I have no doubt that he was, as he said, simply chatting with the accused about matters that were of general interest to both of them. The conversation was clearly civilised, friendly and informative. He said it was not his intention, during any part of the conversation, to make use of the opportunity as any part of the investigation process. Detective Hackett said the conversation was “just for his own personal interest”. There was nothing in it to be gained that he would have used in the investigation and, in fact, he didn't use any of the discussion for the purposes of investigation.  
     
      
    31 Having listened to the evidence of Senior Constable Hackett, and having observed his demeanour, I accept without hesitation that his conversations with the accused on 8 November were of a purely personal nature and did not form part of the police investigation. 
     
      
       
      Second major issue: Was the accused given the opportunity to speak with a magistrate? 
       
      
    32 There are two aspects to this argument. The first is the position argued by Mr Scragg on behalf of the accused to suggest that the police have simply failed to demonstrate that there was compliance with s 23E(2). The second relates to the timing of the applications. Sections 23DA and 23E are in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SECTION 23DA 
          
         
         
         
        Extension of investigation period if arrested for terrorism offence  
         
         
        (1) If a person is under arrest for a terrorism offence an investigating official may, at or before the end of the investigation period, apply for an extension of the investigation period. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (2) The application must be made to:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) a magistrate; or  
           
           
          (b) if it cannot be made at a time when a magistrate is available--a justice of the peace employed in a court of a State or Territory or a bail justice; or  
           
           
          (c) if it cannot be made when any of the foregoing is available--any justice of the peace.  
           
          
         
        The magistrate, justice of the peace or bail justice to whom the application is made is the judicial officer for the purposes of this section and section 23E.  
         
         
         
        (3) The application may be made before the judicial officer, or in writing, or as prescribed by section 23E, and the person or his or her legal representative may make representations to the judicial officer about the application.  
         
          
           
          
         
        (4) Subject to subsection (7), the judicial officer may extend the investigation period, by signed written authority, if satisfied that:  
         
          
           
           
          (a) the offence is a terrorism offence; and  
           
           
          (b) further detention of the person is necessary to preserve or obtain evidence or to complete the investigation into the offence or into another terrorism offence; and  
           
           
          (c) the investigation into the offence is being conducted properly and without delay; and  
           
           
          (d) the person, or his or her legal representative, has been given the opportunity to make representations about the application.  
           
           
          
         
        (5) The authority must set out:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) the day and time when the extension was granted; and  
           
           
          (b) the reasons for granting the extension; and  
           
           
          (c) the terms of the extension.  
           
           
          
         
        (6) The judicial officer must give the investigating official a copy of the authority as soon as practicable after signing the authority.  
         
         
         
        (7) The investigation period may be extended any number of times, but the total of the periods of extension cannot be more than 20 hours.  
         
         
         
        SECTION 23E 
         
         
         
        Applications by telephone etc. 
         
         
         
        (1) An application under section 23D or 23DA for extension of the investigation period may be made by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means in accordance with this section.  
         
         
         
        (2) Before making the application, the i 
        nvestigating official must inform the person under arrest that he or she, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the judicial officer about the application 
        .  
         
         
         
        (3) If the judicial officer extends the investigation period, he or she must inform the investigation official of the matters set out in the authority under subsection 23D(4A) or 23DA(5) (as the case requires).  
         
         
         
        (4) As soon as practicable after being informed of those matters, the investigating official must:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) complete a form of authority and write on it the name of the judicial officer and the particulars given by the judicial officer; and  
           
           
          (b) forward it to the judicial officer.  
           
           
          
         
        (5) If the form of authority completed by the investigating official does not, in all material respects, accord with the terms of the authority signed by the judicial officer, the authority granted by the judicial officer is taken to have had no effect.  
         
         
        (6) In any proceedings, if the authority signed by the judicial officer is not produced in evidence, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that the authority was granted.  
         
         
         
        Note: These obligations apply in relation to protected suspects as well as to people under arrest.” 
        
       
      
    33 It can be seen that s 23E(2) places an obligation on the investigating official, before making the application, to inform the person under arrest that he or she, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the judicial officer about the application.  
     
      
    34 Mr Scragg's arguments were, firstly, as I have said, that the investigating official had failed to inform the accused of the entitlement under s 23E(2). Secondly, that if the accused had been informed of his right to make representations about the application, it was not done before the making of the application, but after it had been made and prior to determination. This second argument assumes that the application was made at 6.30am.  
     
      
    35 There was an earlier voir dire in held June 2008. It related to an application then advanced on behalf of Omar Jamal. It dealt with a different issue, but focused on the same circumstances and events as does the present application. In the event, the voir dire application made in June 2008 was subsequently withdrawn by the accused. It was not pursued. By agreement, however, the parties sensibly placed before the Court, in relation to the present application, the transcript of the evidence taken in the voir dire to supplement the documentary material on this application. The Crown has relied on what it described as the “unequivocal” evidence of the accused when he had been cross-examined by Ms Abraham QC in June 2008.  
     
      
       
        
        MR CARROLL 
         
         
         
        Q. Your name is Mohammed Omar Jamal?  
         
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
         
        Q. On 8 November 2005 were you ever told of your right to make representations to an on-call Magistrate to extend your detention?  
         
         
        A. No, I wasn't.  
         
         
         
        CARROLL: 
         That's the evidence-in-chief.  
         
         
         
        Then CARROLL 
         
         
         
        Q. The one question which I asked earlier this week was whether or not you were ever asked to make representations about your detention. Do you recall that?  
         
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
         
        Q. And you answered--  
         
         
        A. No.  
         
         
         
        Q. Was a mobile phone ever handed to you on the pretext that you could speak to a magistrate or justice?  
         
         
        A. No.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were told between 6.03 and 10.20 if you would like to speak to a justice about what was occurring at Punchbowl Road, would you have taken that opportunity up?  
         
         
        A. Yes, I would have.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were asked this question, Is the investigation being conducted properly and without delay, what would you have told the justice?  
         
         
        A. Repeat the question.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were asked a question between 6.03 and 10.20 by the justice, Is the investigation being conducted properly and without delay, what would you have told her?  
         
         
        A. I would have told her, no, it is not being conducted properly.  
         
         
         
        Q. In what way?  
         
         
        A. Well, there are people - like there was police walking around my house without being photographed or camera-ed or anything like that.  
         
         
         
        Q. Anything else?  
         
         
        A. That's what I can recall at the moment.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were asked the question as to whether or not the police have continued to investigate matters in your house after 6.03, what would you have told them?  
         
         
        A. I can't really say that. I can't recall, sorry.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were asked the question at 10.18, Mr Jamal, Have you or your legal representatives been given the opportunity to make representations about this application, what would your answer have been?  
         
         
        A. Yes, I would have taken up the representation if I was given it.  
         
         
         
        Q. If you were asked the question of the magistrate, Has anyone told you that you can speak to me about your detention, what would your answer have been?  
         
         
        A. Repeat, I didn't understand it.  
         
         
         
        Q. If the justice asked you, Have you been told by the police that you can speak to me about what is going on at the house, what would you have told the justice?  
         
         
        A. Well, like I said before, it is not being conducted properly, the search, and there's people around my house without the camera being there.  
         
         
         
        Then 
         
         
         
        Q. The police at various stages were explaining a number of things to you; for example, what they were searching for?  
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And they asked you whether you understood what they were saying?  
         
         
        A. I can't recall that.  
         
         
         
        Q. They asked you more than once whether you understood what they were saying, didn't they?  
         
         
        A. I don't recall.  
         
         
         
        Q. You didn't respond. You basically said: Do your job?  
         
         
        A. Like I said, I wasn't in the mood at that moment because my mind was somewhere else. It's not that I didn't want to know; it's just because my mind was somewhere else at that moment.  
         
         
         
        Q. What the police were offering at any stage you were basically knocking back?  
         
         
        A. I wasn't really knocking it back; I was just in a different state of mind at that moment.  
         
         
         
        Q. For whatever reason, you knocked it back, basically. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. I knocked it back in your terms but in my terms I didn't really knock it back because my mind was somewhere else and I wasn't really thinking about it at that moment.  
         
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR  
         
         
         
        Q. You were told you could speak to a magistrate?  
         
         
        A. Yes, I was told.  
         
         
         
        Q. And you didn't want to?  
         
         
        A. Sorry? I didn't want to? 
         
         
         
        Q. Yes. You said ""No""?  
         
         
        A. I told you ""Yes"". Can you tell me what time frame this was?  
         
         
         
        Q. Sorry. Let's go back a step. You agree that you were told you could speak to a magistrate. You have agreed with that. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. Can you tell me what time frame this was?  
         
         
         
        Q. I will get to the time in a moment. You agreed a moment ago you were told you could speak to a magistrate. That's correct?  
         
         
         
        OBJECTION

         The question is unclear.

        CROWN PROSECUTOR  
         
         
         
        Q. You told us a moment ago you were asked or you were told you could speak to a magistrate. You said you were told that. That's correct.  
         
         
        A. Yeah. According to when I watched the video, yes. I heard that on the video when I watched the video. I said that. I was entitled to speak to a magistrate.  
         
         
         
        Q. You declined?  
         
         
        A. I did not decline.  
         
         
         
        Q. You said you wanted to, did you?  
         
         
        A. Sorry?  
         
         
        Q. You said you wanted to, did you?  
         
         
        A. No. No. I'm saying in the video my state of mind, or when they were doing the search, my state of mind was somewhere else. If I had known to speak to a magistrate, I would have spoke to them.  
         
         
         
        Q. Go back a step. You have agreed that you were told you could speak to a magistrate. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. You did not take the police up on that offer. That is correct?  
         
         
        A. Yes, I didn't take them up on the offer.  
         
         
        Q. There was down time whilst the police were trying to get an extension?  
         
         
        A. I just want to go back on the last question.  
         
         
         
        Q. There was down time while the police were trying to get the extension. By ""down time"", the video--  
         
         
        A. Yes, there was a wait.  
         
         
         
        Q. That was for some considerable period, I think. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. Two hours.  
         
         
         
        Q. And you were told that's what they were trying to do; get on to the Magistrate. In effect, they were in a queue?  
         
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
         
        Q. That's correct. It was during that time that you were asked or told you could speak to the magistrate. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. Can you repeat that?  
         
         
         
        Q. It was during that time that you were told you could speak to a magistrate?  
         
         
        A. Well, I can't really recall - what I can recall in the video is he was saying there's going to be a lengthy delay because he wants to get in touch with the Magistrate and I didn't reply anything then to him. That's basically what happened. That's what I remember.  
         
         
         
        Q. You have told us you recall being asked whether you wanted to speak to a magistrate. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. From the video, that's right, because I watched the video again, but my state of mind when I was in the search was different. My mind wasn't there.  
         
         
         
        Q. Ignore the video. You have told us that you were asked that question; ""Do you want to speak to a magistrate""?  
         
         
        A. Yes, because that was my recollection from the video; not from my state of mind from the house.  
         
         
         
        Q. You didn't hear it at the house. You didn't hear that at the house?  
         
         
        A. No.  
         
         
         
        Q. Only on the video?  
         
         
        A. Yes, only on the video.  
         
         
         
        Q. At what stage of the video was that?  
         
         
        A. It is about halfway through, when they had a break. When they had a break for that two hours, for the two hour break.” 
        
       
      
    36 The accused had previously said in his evidence-in-chief on the voir dire that he had not been told of his right to make representations to an on-call magistrate to extend the investigation period. However, it seems quite clear that he resiled from this during his cross-examination. The Crown says that this was ""unequivocal"" - e.g. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You were told you could speak to a magistrate? 
         
         
        A. Yes, I was told.” 
        
       
      
    37 As appears from the transcript above, the accused confirmed this on two occasions. However, he then sought to suggest that it was from the video shown in Court that he concluded he had been told that he could speak to a magistrate, rather than from his own recollection. To confuse the issue further, he said, during his evidence, that his state of mind was not “engaged” (for various reasons) during the time the police were at his home.  
     
      
    38 A viewing of the video of the search does not, in terms, reveal that the accused is shown on film being told he could speak to a magistrate. That conversation does not occur during the filming process. This is understandable because the process was suspended at 6.03am, and not revived until a considerable time later. It is properly to be inferred that, if the accused were told of his rights to speak to the magistrate, this would have occurred during the time when the filming process, and the search itself, had been suspended.  
     
      
    39 On the other hand, the video does show that there was a gap between 6.03am and 8.12am. The camera was started again on that occasion so that the police could mention to the accused that there was a warrant in relation to the car. It was to be seized as an exhibit and the accused was shown a copy of the warrant. The transcript of the recording continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SD: 
         The delay, the gap between 6.03am and 8.12am has been for the purposes of granting an extension warrant which is to extend our search warrant so we can leave the search here. Do you understand that we have been placed in a very long queue, apparently, and we are just waiting for the magistrate to give us a call and review that warrant and once that happens we will be able to continue the search and until that time we are in a holding pattern. Do you understand that? 
         
         
        OJ: 
         How long will that be? 
         
         
        SD: 
         I've asked, we've been, we're in the hands of the on-call magistrate. As you know the courts aren't open as the other morning whether (ind) services an on-call magistrate and he or she is reviewing our application, they'll let us know in due course. For the purposes, the time is now fifteen minutes past 8. The execution of this search warrant is now suspended.” 
        
       
      
    40 The search warrant remained suspended until approximately 19 minutes past ten, at which time the accused was told that the local magistrate had granted an extra four hours of investigation time, beginning at 20 past ten.  
     
      
    41 There was evidence from Detective Sergeant Liddiard on the voir dire which touched upon the present matter. He had said in his statement that he could recall an application being made for extension of the investigation period, but he was not involved in that application himself. He thought it was made by an officer or officers of the Australian Federal Police.  
     
      
    42 During his oral evidence, D S Liddiard said that he had been told of the application having been made by Detective Day. He thought he could recall a conversation between Detective Day and the accused in relation to the fact that an application was to be made for an extension of the detention period (transcript 2418). He was not completely sure when this conversation would have occurred, but thought it would not have been far into the suspension that the application itself was made, probably about 6.30am (transcript 2418).  
     
      
    43 Detective Sergeant Liddiard was asked point blank by Mr Scragg whether he had any recollection of Jamal ever being informed by any police officer of his right to make representations to the Registrar in relation to the application. D S Liddiard said that the accused was given the opportunity to speak to the Registrar and, in fact, he believed that he did do that. His recollection was that he heard the accused talking on the phone to a person, and he believed that was the Registrar. He thought this was shortly before the detention warrant was granted. As far as he could recall, the accused had been in the front bedroom by himself, although in full view of the police when he was speaking on the phone. He thought it was Detective Day's mobile phone. He conceded, however, he did not know who the accused was talking to, and he did not know what was said.  
     
      
    44 Finally, there is a need to mention a letter from the Crown Solicitor's Office to Mr Scragg's instructing solicitor dated 27 August 2008. This became part of Exhibit 1. It was an indication that Detective Day had been spoken to, that his telephone records had been examined, and that there was nothing to indicate that he had contacted the on-call magistrate or his/her phone in relation to the extension of the investigation period on 8 November 2005. 
     
      
    45 From all this evidence, I make the following findings of fact: First, although the accused asserted in his evidence-in-chief that he had not been given the opportunity to speak to the magistrate, I am perfectly satisfied that he unequivocally agreed during his cross-examination that he had been told he could speak to a magistrate. Secondly, I find that in fact he had been told of his rights in this regard but declined to take them up. Thirdly, I consider that one reason, but not the only reason, the accused made this very unequivocal concession was that he thought (erroneously) that he had been ""caught"" on the video being told of his rights. Fourthly, the accused then attempted to obfuscate the point by asserting that his mind was “elsewhere” during the search warrant process, and that by implication this extended to the information involved in the concession he had made. Fifthly, I do not accept that his ""mind was elsewhere"". An examination of the video throughout demonstrates that he was very focused, very deliberate and, despite the difficulty of his custodial situation, fairly much in control.  
     
      
    46 Mr Scragg argued that Mr Jamal did not acquiesce in or agree to the questions put to him as to whether he had been told he could speak to a magistrate. I reject this submission and find, as I have indicated above, that he unequivocally agreed to the proposition. It was only a little later that he attempted to prevaricate by making the reference to what he had seen on the video, and to his alleged state of mind at the time. Mr Scragg's central point however, is that there is no evidence before the Court from Detective Steven Day, and that a powerful inference should be drawn in the absence of evidence from that officer. However, in the light of the accused's unequivocal assent to the question put to him by the cross-examiner, I am not prepared to draw an inference adverse to the Crown. The matter has been satisfactorily proved out of the mouth of the accused. I infer from all of the circumstances, and the totality of the evidence I have described, including the documentary material, that the accused was told that he might make representations to the magistrate about the application. He declined to do so. In my view, subject to the next matter I will discuss, that was sufficient compliance with s 23E(2) of the Crimes Act 1914.  
     
      
    47 The final matter is whether I can be satisfied that the accused was informed of his entitlement before the application was made. The phrase in the section is ""before making the application"". This is perhaps a minor, but nevertheless, difficult point of construction. Given the nature of the application dealt with in s 23E, there is much support for the construction urged by Mr Scragg, namely that the entitlement must be conveyed to the person under arrest before the telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means is utilised to make the application. On the other hand, it makes little sense in a situation such as the present where the application was made at 6.30am, was supported by a later document not received by the magistrate until shortly before 8am, was not expected to be dealt with until some time later, and was in fact, not dealt with by the magistrate until after 10am. Those circumstances might be thought to support a more flexible construction that would lead to satisfaction of the statutory duty so long as the person under arrest were told of his rights before the magistrate came to deal with the application. I am perfectly satisfied that the accused was told of his rights before Ms Albu came to finally deal with the extension application. I could not be satisfied, however, that he was told of those rights before the telephone application was lodged. I could not be satisfied that he was told of those rights before the faxed material came into the possession of Ms Albu at about 7.50am. He may have been told prior to that time, but I am simply unable to say one way or the other. 
     
      
    48 In my view, the better view of the section is that the person under arrest should be told of his entitlement before the ""lodgement"" of the application, whether by way of telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means. In that sense, it seems to me, there was a technical breach of s 23E, although I am perfectly satisfied that the “entitlement” was conveyed to the accused at some stage prior to Ms Albu dealing with the application. Just how close this was to the determination period, I am unable to say.  
     
      
    49 This finding will make it necessary for me to consider s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. I will turn to that when I have dealt with the final matter relied on by Mr Scragg. 
     
      
       
      Alleged breach of s 23E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       
      
    50 The statute requires that the judicial officer who extends the investigation period inform the investigating official of the matters set out in the authority under 23D (4A) or 23DA(5), as the case may require. This means, firstly, that the judicial officer must notify the investigating official of the day and time when the extension is granted, the reasons for granting the extension and the terms of the extension. This plainly happened. 
     
      
    51 Section 23E(4) then requires, as soon as practicable after being informed of those matters, the investigating official must complete a form of authority and write on it the name of the judicial officer and the particulars given by the judicial officer; and (b) forward it to the judicial officer. The issue here is whether that was done, and, if it were not, what consequences may follow.  
     
      
    52 Sub-section (5) of 23E does not impose a direct sanction if its terms are not complied with, but does provide that, if the form of authority that is completed does not, in all material respects, accord with the authority signed by the judicial officer, the authority granted by the judicial officer is taken to have had no effect.  
     
      
    53 In the present matter, the paperwork is somewhat incomplete and is certainly rather untidy. This is hardly surprising, given the period of time that has elapsed since the process was undertaken, and the additional fact that at the time there was a considerable amount of work for both the judicial officer and the police to undertake in that regard, not only in relation to the present accused, but to the other persons as well whose names appear on the documentation. Indeed, given the scope of the police operation on that morning in the western suburbs of Sydney, it is remarkable that the paperwork is as fulsome as it appears to be.  
     
      
    54 The Crown have submitted that the document headed ""Australian Federal Police - Authority by Telephone to Extend Investigation Period"" et cetera, answers the description of the document mentioned in 23E(4). In my view, notwithstanding its imperfections, it does generally answer that description. Ms Albu states on the form she has signed that “authority” pursuant to s 23E(4). It was completed and signed at 10.20am on 8 November 2005. The “authority” document purports to record, inter alia, the name of the judicial officer who had granted the authority to extend the investigation period. It provides the particulars of the extension itself. It is cast in the past tense. The fact that it lacks the signature of the investigating official does not of itself deprive it of validity as being a document forwarded to the judicial officer in purported compliance with sub-s (4). However, the chronology does not make it clear when the document was sent. It may have been sent in draft form, before the extension was made, and, in that case, it may have been necessary for Ms Albu to complete it by writing in the time and terms of the extension. Importantly, as might be expected, it does accord, in all material respects, with the authority signed by the judicial officer. That, to my mind, is the critical point. The section creates a type of audit procedure so as to ensure that there is a close correlation between the particulars of the extension given by the judicial officer as understood by the investigating official. In this case, although the final details of the authority were completed by Ms Albu rather than by the police, the records enable an independent observer to conclude that the order granted by the Registrar accords precisely with the terms of the order, as understood by the police. There is no disparity or lack of concordance between the two documents. It also appears the completed authority document may have been faxed, or sent, back to the police. Assuming that to be the case, the procedure contemplated by the statute has been, in part, reversed. 
     
      
    55 For those reasons, there appears to me to be an obvious irregularity. This is because the draft document appears to have been sent before the order was made, and it required completion in part by the Registrar, rather than being completed by the investigating official as s 23E(4) contemplates.  
     
      
    56 What follows from this irregularity? In my view, it does not mean that the extension granted by the judicial officer had no effect. That would have been the position had the form of authority not been in accord with the terms of the authority signed by the judicial officer. But that was not the situation. The procedures followed by the applicant for extension and the Registrar, were clearly unorthodox but they did not, in my opinion, bring about a situation where the extension of time was rendered invalid. Nevertheless, there was an irregularity. This finding will make it necessary for me to consider, once again, the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. I will now turn to consider those provisions in the light of the two irregularities I have found to exist.

          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; and  
           
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    58 There are several first instance judgments in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court that I regard as helpful. The first is that of Adams J in Director Public Prosecutions v Coe [2003] NSWSC 1 May 2003. In that decision, Adams J examined the common law principles, which had preceded the introduction of the section. He also examined the discussion by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report on Evidence (No 26) of the issues sought to be addressed by s 138. Although his Honour was principally concerned with the meaning to be given to the word “obtained” in s 138(1), he also gave consideration to the general principles, which underpinned the public policy discretion, reflected both at common law and in the section of the Evidence Act. Adams J referred to a passage in Robinett v Police (2000) 78 SASR 85; 116 A Crim R 492 where Bleby J had cited Lobban (2000) 112 A Crim R 357 per Martin J (with whom Doyle CJ and he agreed). The passage is at 367 where Martin J said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion however the history of the public policy discretion has been centred upon the discretion being enlivened only when the evidence is obtained by unlawful, improper or unfair conduct on the part of law enforcement authorities. In identifying the rationale for the existence of the discretion, the High Court and other authorities have emphasised the importance of preventing the courts from being ‘demeaned’ by the use of the ‘fruits of the illegality’ or being used ‘to effectuate the illegal stratagems of law enforcement agents or persons acting on their behalf’. The focus is thus upon bringing the administration of criminal justice into disrepute through the use of the courts in this manner. The courts have not undertaken the role of supervising the conduct of law enforcement authorities generally in circumstances divorced from any attempt by those authorities to use the courts to further the aims of their unlawful, improper or unfair conduct”. 
        
       
      
    59 Adams J thought this statement of the position was “plainly correct”. His Honour added however: - 
     
      
       
        
        “But I would not interpret this passage as doing anything more than restating the principle that the courts will not allow themselves to be manipulated into condoning crimes or serious improprieties by law enforcement officers or their agents, as is made clear by the concluding sentence.” 
        
       
      
    60 A second decision which I have found particularly helpful is that of Howie J in an interlocutory judgment Regina v Richard Bruce Cornwell Supreme Court, Common Law Division (unreported 20 February 2003). In that case, his Honour was considering an application by the accused asserting that evidence obtained as a result of the use of a listening device was inadmissible under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The basis of the ruling sought was that the evidence had been obtained in consequence of an impropriety by the investigating officers. The impropriety was said to have been a misstatement in the affidavit in support of the warrant. 
     
      
    61 Howie J held that the evidence had not been obtained as a result of an impropriety, and that the particular misstatement, seen in the context of the affidavit as a whole, led him to the view that all that was involved was an inadvertent mistake in an otherwise carefully drawn affidavit. His Honour held that such conduct could not alone be reasonably be regarded as improper, notwithstanding the significance of swearing an affidavit in support of a Listening Device Warrant. His Honour also found that there was no causal connection between the impropriety alleged and the obtaining of the impugned evidence. At para 20, his Honour said: - 
     
      
       
        
        ”I am of the view that, otherwise than when sub-sections 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section in engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect. On the other hand the terms of sub-section 138(3)(e), which sub-section requires the court to take into account whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless make it clear that the conduct need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power”. 
        
       
      
    62 To these two authorities I would also add a reference to the two decisions by Johnson J, R v Petroulias [No 8] 2007 NSWSC 82 and R v Petroulias [No 9] 2007 NSWSC 84. They are to like effect. 
     
      
    63 These authorities were, strictly speaking, dealing with an allegation of evidence that was obtained improperly. They have, in my opinion, a resonance however for the situation that has arisen here where I have found that there were breaches of an Australian law, namely a breach arising in the context of s 23E(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and a breach, or at the very least, an irregularity under s 23E(4).  
     
      
    64 The Court of Criminal Appeal has itself considered the operation of s 138 of the Evidence Act in recent times. In R v Camilleri [2007} 68 NSWLR 720 (McClellan CJ at CL, Bell and Howie JJ) reinforced the views expressed by Howie J in R v EM, to the effect that s 138 is concerned with balancing public interests. McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said at 727 (31): - 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental concern of the section is to ensure that, if the law has been breached, or some other impropriety has been involved in obtaining evidence, this is balanced against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The competing interests are obedience to the law in the gathering of evidence and enforcement of the law in respect of offenders. In R v EM (at 74), Howie J said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The discretion under s 138 is similar to that which was described in R v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159 as the public policy discretion at common law. Of course, there is a significant difference between the discretion under s 138 and that at common law: the section requires that the Crown persuade the Court to admit evidence that was improperly or unlawfully obtained. But just as at common law, the public policy discretion was distinct and separate from the unfairness discretion, so the discretion to admit evidence under s 138 is a distinct and separate discretion from that arising under s 90. The two discretions may overlap but they are not synonymous. Section 138 is not, in its terms at least, concerned with the Court ensuring a fair trial for the accused. Certainly that is not a paramount consideration when exercising the discretion. The discretion exercised under s 138(1) seeks to balance two competing public interests, neither of which directly involves securing a fair trial for the accused.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    65 Considering the matters stipulated in s 138(3), McClellan CJ at CL said at (35): 
     
      
       
        
        “This case is to be distinguished from a situation where evidence is obtained by police in knowing breach of the law or, where they may be reckless as to whether or not it has been lawfully obtained. Where the breach of the law is innocent, and the alleged offence serious there must be powerful countervailing considerations before the evidence should be rejected. The fact that the evidence is of high probative value will weigh in favour of its admission.” 
        
       
      
    66 I turn now to consider the application of the matters in sub-s (3) of s 138. I bear in mind that the terms of s 138(1) require me not to admit the material into evidence unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in a way in which the evidence was obtained. I will deal with each breach separately. 
     
      
    67 In my view, the breach of s 23E(2) in the present matter was of the utmost technicality. The accused was told of his entitlement before the judicial officer came to consider the application. I do not think that the failure to inform him of those rights before the telephone call was made at 6.30 impinged on those rights in any material way. I am satisfied that he had declined to make any representations to the magistrate, and the magistrate knew of this when the application was properly considered after 10am on 8 November 2005. It is against that background that I consider the matters in s 138(3). I make the following findings: 
     
      
       
      (a) It is difficult to assess the probative value of the evidence that is sought to be excluded. This is because it is not entirely clear what the defence case will be. The evidence about the accused’s facility with computers is clearly an important circumstantial fact in the overall Crown case. The “identification” evidence relates a serious issue in the trial. It is especially important in the case against Jamal. The DNA evidence goes to the nature of the association between the accused and other defendants. It is clearly an important issue in a conspiracy charge. My view, overall, is that the evidence is highly probative, but not critical to the Crown case.  
       
       
      (b) The same comments may be made in relation to the issue as to the importance of the evidence for the purposes of the Crown case. The case, however, is a circumstantial one and each circumstance plainly has a value for the Crown's ultimate case at the conclusion of the evidence. Many of the circumstantial facts are likely to be hard fought, as the vigour and length of the pre-trial procedures demonstrate. That is certainly so in the case against Jamal. 
       
       
      (c) The offence charged against the accused is, however, of the utmost seriousness and carries a significant penalty. Because of the seriousness of the offence, the more likely it is the public interest will require the admission of the evidence (see  
      Rodney Joel Dalley  
      132 A Crim R 169 at 171 per Spigelman CJ) 
       
       
      (d) I do not consider that the breach here was, in any sense, deliberate or reckless. As I have explained the police operation on this morning was a massive one, and the logistics of making, for example, extensions of time were quite difficult. It was likely that the police would have realised that the application for extension of time could not be dealt with until later in the morning and the failure to tell the accused of his entitlements before the telephone application was made is quite understandable.  
       
       
      (e) I do not consider that it is necessary to make any specific finding about the matters in the other paragraphs of subsection (3). None of those considerations lead me to a different overall conclusion than the one I have stated.  
       
      
    68 I turn now to consider the breach under s 27E(4). Once again, I do not consider that the irregularity involved here was deliberate or reckless (DPP v Leonard [2001] 53 NSWLR 227 at 248 per James J). There can be no suggestion that the police were manipulating the system deliberately or wilfully condoning an impropriety. The mistake in procedure arose, I infer, from a simple lack of understanding of the strict requirements of the section, coupled with the need to make multiple applications for extension of time as a matter of urgency. The form of authority prepared and sent to the Magistrate in draft contained most of the information necessary to legitimately reflect the matters that would be expected to be included in the document, if it had been be sent after the order was made. It appears, moreover, that a copy of the completed authority was returned to the police. All that was incomplete in the draft, however, was the time of the making of the order and the corresponding statement of the period of the extension. The procedure involved clearly reflected some type of understanding, probably never articulated, between the AFP and the Registrar designed to ensure that there would be, at the end of the process, a complete accord between the police and the judicial officer as to the terms of the extension. I infer that one reason it was done this way was because of the urgency of the applications, and the fact that there were multiple investigations running concurrently. Of course, as I have said, there was also a lack of understanding of the strict requirements of the statute as well. 
     
      
    69 So far as other individual matters required to be considered under s 138(3) of the Evidence Act 1995, I make the same points in relation to this breach as I did in relation to the breach under s 23E(2). 
     
      
    70 In each instance, I am satisfied, for the reasons I have given, that the desirability of admitting the evidence out weighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained irregularly or in breach. 
     
      
    71 In these circumstances I do not propose to exclude the evidence identified at the commencement of this decision.

      JUDGMENT - Application by Jamal to exclude evidence at trial – s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) – Statement not influenced by oppressive conduct 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Scragg, on behalf of the accused Jamal, has raised an issue about whether a statement made by his client in the early hours of the morning on 8 November 2005 should be admitted. The issue having been raised, it is necessary for the Court to determine whether the evidence is made inadmissible by virtue of s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    2 The statement is one that I considered at some length in an earlier decision, (R v Baladjam [No 32]). In that judgment the primary question related to the relevance of the statement to the issues at trial, and as to whether s 137 of the Evidence Act required its exclusion. For the reasons there given I concluded that the statement was relevant and that no basis had been demonstrated for it to be excluded. The present application does not require a revisiting of those issues, but is concerned with a different matter altogether, namely, whether the evidence should be found inadmissible under s 84 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    3 The statement occurred during the execution of a search warrant on 8 November 2005 at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield. The transcript recording the statement is part of Exhibit 1. The relevant portion of the transcript records Jamal as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        ““For one thousand four hundred years the Koran has never ever been changed. 'Til this day it's proven by even Christian scholars that it has never been changed. All the other books have been changed except this book. If you do not believe you see where you're gonna end up. Allah is gonna put youse into a fire. Well Allah heats the most disgraceful fire that can ever be and youse, well Allah, youse are gonna regret every single thing that youse ever did from the day youse were born. Remember that. Fourteen hundred years, never been changed, and if you don't believe in it you'll see what's gonna happen to you. Allah is gonna take care of you. Allah curses youse all. Allah curses youse and your children and your wife. Allah curse all of youse. May Allah put a disease in your body. All your bodies. May Allah put a very great disease in there so youse can just rot slowly. May Allah put a very big disease. May Allah curse youse, your children and your wives...A great disease in your body and your family doesn't ever help youse. Keep it there...” 
        
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    4 In the early hours of the morning on 8 November 2005 the police and other support authorities had mounted a massive series of ""raids"" on the homes of persons suspected of being involved in a conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Nine of those men have been charged under the present indictment, Mr Jamal being one of them. The authorities had been involved in covert investigation of the alleged conspirators and their associates for many months prior to 8 November 2005. As I understand it, all nine men were arrested on 8 November 2005 and search warrants were executed at their premises, the premises of other persons, and in relation to a number of motor vehicles.  
     
      
    5 The search warrant for the premises at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield is very lengthy. It demonstrates inferentially, by its terms, the width of the investigation that had been involved in both the open and covert aspects of the joint operation leading up to the arrests. I have set out the terms of the warrant in full as an annexure to this decision.  
     
      
    6 The police arrived at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield, at about 2.39am. In attendance were the warrant holder, Detective Senior Sergeant Stephen Day, Detective Senior Constable Liddiard and Detective Senior Constable Hackett. In addition, there were two searching officers, two video operators, an exhibit officer and two Federal Agents observing on behalf of the Australian Federal Police. As well, there were a number of uniformed police from the Operational Support Group tasked with security for the search warrant. The independent officer appointed to observe the propriety of the operation was Inspector Glinn.  
     
      
    7 I infer from the material placed before me that operations of a similar nature and scope were being carried out at roughly the same time at a considerable number of other premises in the Belfield, Bankstown, Lakemba district and beyond.  
     
      
    8 In his statement (Exhibit 3) Detective Senior Sergeant Day states that when the police arrived at the house, Mr Jamal was standing on the footpath in front of the house, holding a mobile phone in his left hand. He appeared to be talking on the phone. The police approached, asked him to put down the phone and place his arms out. He was then handcuffed, cautioned and told that a search warrant was to be executed on his premises. Almost immediately afterwards, a police video operator commenced to record the events which followed, including details of the execution of the search warrant. Any conversations Detective Liddiard and Detective Day had with the accused were electronically recorded on video cassette tape during the execution of the search warrant.  
     
      
    9 There were members of the accused's family in the house at the time of the arrest. These included his mother, Amena Jamal, his brother Noureddean Jamal, and his three sisters. After a time, the mother and sisters left the premises, although the accused's brother elected to remain at the premises until he had to go to work.  
     
      
    10 The warrant process continued until shortly after 6am on 8 November 2005. A suspension of the process then occurred to enable an extension for the investigation period to be sought and granted. This was made through the Australian Federal Police. Shortly after 8am the execution of the search warrant was resumed. As the warrant indicates, it involved not only a search of the house, but a search of the motor vehicle ULK 830, which was also seized as an exhibit. The search warrant process was concluded at about midday. The accused was then taken to Sydney Police Centre. 
     
      
       
      Evidence Act s 84 
       
      
    11 Section 84 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Exclusion of admissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct, whether towards the person who made the admission or towards another person; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a threat of conduct of that kind. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) only applies if the party against whom evidence of the admission is adduced has raised in the proceeding an issue about whether the admission or its making were so influenced.” 
        
       
      
    12 An ""admission"" is defined in the dictionary. It includes a representation which is ""adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceedings"". Accordingly, s 84 is not limited to confessions alone, but is concerned with any statement made by an accused which may be used by the prosecution to the accused's detriment, and can include a lie told by the accused and a statement which might otherwise be regarded as exculpatory (R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; 105 A Crim R 27; R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426; 104 A Crim R 306).  
     
      
    13 Section 84 replicates in part the common law concept that a confession must be voluntary before it can be admitted. Section 84, however, goes further and requires the Court to be satisfied as well that the admission is not influenced by the conduct set out in the section.  
     
      
    14 The thinking behind the proposal on which the provision is based is set out at ALRC 26 volume 1 para 765, page 436: 
     
      
       
        
        “Techniques which are perceived as particularly likely to substantially impair the mental freedom of a suspect may be prohibited, and any evidence produced as a result of them excluded. If interrogators engage in acts of violence, threats of violence, torture or inhuman, degrading or oppressive conduct, then an admission made subsequent to such conduct may be untrue, regardless of the characteristics of the suspect being interrogated.” 
        
       
      
    15 Where the issue is raised, the onus falls upon the Crown to prove the admissibility of the admission. The standard of proof is upon the balance of probabilities (s 142 (1) Evidence Act 1995). Consequently, the Crown must prove to the requisite standard that the conduct referred to in the section, if it occurred, did not influence the making of the admission. In R v Ye Zhang (2000) NSWSC 1099 Simpson J (at 44) observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “...section 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason or a single event or incident or instance of conduct provoking the confession; there may be a number of factors working together, that, combined, cause the admission to be made. If oppressive conduct on the part of police is one of those factors (or, more accurately, if the Crown has failed to negative such conduct as one of those factors) then the evidence is inadmissible.” 
        
       
      
    16 Simpson J's remarks were approved by Hoeben J (with whom Sully and Bell JJ agreed) in Higgins v Regina (2007) NSWCCA 56. At (26) Hoeben J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that s 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason or a single incident of conduct provoking the confession. There may be a number of factors working together ( 
        R v Zhang 
        ...). I also accept that there is no definition of 'oppressive' in the Act and that the concept should not be limited to physical or threatened physical conduct but can encompass mental and psychological pressure. That said, I am firmly of the view that nothing in the bank interview, either on its own or in combination, amounted to 'oppressive conduct' as envisaged by s 84.” 
        
       
      
    17 (The Crown referred to a Macquarie Dictionary (third edition) definition of ""oppression"". This had been adopted and commented on in Hugh Wily v Peter Gerald Fitz-Gibbon (1998) FCA 121, 2 March 1998. At page 8 Hill J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary in this case to attempt an exhaustive definition of what constitutes 'oppression'. As the Macquarie Dictionary makes clear, the ordinary meaning of the word involves the exercise of authority or power 'in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner'. It may be possible, at least in some cases, to say that conduct will be oppressive when there is some impropriety in the way the admission is obtained.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Scragg provided a definition of ""oppressive"" which was obtained from a WordNet search. This referred to the adjective in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “...”oppressive” weighing heavily on the senses or spirit ('the atmosphere was oppressive'), 'oppressive sorrows' 
        
       
       
        
        ...'oppressive, - tyrannical, tyrannous (marked by unjust severity or arbitrary behaviour)' 
        
       
       
        
        e.g. 'The oppressive government', 'oppressive laws', 'a tyrannical parent', and 'tyrannous disregard of human rights'.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on behalf of Jamal 
       
      
    19 Mr Scragg relied upon a number of specific circumstances, both individually and in combination. The first was that the search occurred in the early hours of the morning, and it occurred in circumstances where members of the accused’s family, including his elderly mother, were present. Mr Scragg accepted that Jamal was “distressed” about the circumstances in which the search was taking place, but he pointed to the additional fact that members of the family were also significantly “distressed” and “disturbed” about what was happening at their home in the early hours of the morning.  
     
      
    20 Secondly, Mr Scragg pointed to the handcuffing of Mr Jamal and its consequences. Thirdly, there was an incident described as ""the crowbar incident"" involving Detective Hackett. Fourthly, there was the searching of family members which Mr Scragg submitted was an unlawful exercise. Fifthly, Mr Scragg pointed to the fact that the warrant was not shown and explained to members of Jamal's family prior to those members of the family being searched. This, counsel argued, was a clear breach of s 3H of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and that members of the family were unlawfully detained for a period from leaving the premises. Sixthly, there was the intimidatory nature in which the video camera was continually trained upon Mr Jamal. Seventhly, counsel pointed to the assertion that Jamal was not afforded a statutory right to be present at all times while the search was being conducted. Finally, there was mention of ""inappropriate comments"" by the police during the course of the search. 
     
      
    21 Mr Scragg took the Court to each of these matters in some detail. In the end, he submitted that the Crown had not discharged the onus it bore to demonstrate that the accused had not been influenced by the various matters relied upon. Mr Scragg submitted that the conduct of the police on the morning in question, both individually and in combination, clearly weighed heavily upon ""the senses and spirit"" of Mr Jamal. The atmosphere, counsel submitted, was one of “oppressive conduct”. It was in the context of that atmosphere that the accused made the statement attributed to him. Consequently, the Court should find that the statement was inadmissible. 
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions 
       
      
    22 The Crown took issue with each of the matters raised by Mr Scragg. The Crown accepted that it bore the onus of demonstrating that Mr Jamal's statement was made uninfluenced by matters of the kind relied on by the accused.  
     
      
    23 First, the Crown submitted that the handcuffing of the accused was a matter that fell well within the discretion of the arresting officers. There was no evidence to suggest there was anything improper or inappropriate about the method of handcuffing, or that it caused undue or excessive pain or anything of that kind. Indeed, the Crown submitted that the accused's belligerent behaviour after the handcuffing provided ample justification for the obvious concerns of the police officers involved.  
     
      
    24 Secondly, the Crown submitted that, in effect, it was the accused himself who created the angry, belligerent atmosphere during that part of the proceedings prior to his making the impugned statement. Moreover, behaviour of the same abusive kind occurred on the accused’s part after the statement was made.  
     
      
    25 Thirdly, the Crown submitted that there was no substance in the allegation that Officer Hackett may have acted in some sort of intimidating or threatening manner simply because he had a crowbar in his possession. The Crown submitted there was no evidence to support this, and that the evidence of the accused's brother (who voluntarily decided to remain at the premises) put paid to this proposition. Specifically, the Crown pointed to the fact that the brother himself was abusive to the police on a number of occasions and that this was, so notwithstanding that Hackett was there holding a crowbar. So far as the searching of the accused's family was concerned, the Crown argued that the only reason this took so long was because of the behaviour of the accused himself.  
     
      
    26 Fourthly, the Crown pointed to the fact that an independent officer was present throughout. Officer Glinn did not receive any complaints from the accused or from any member of his family about anything that occurred during the search process. The accused had been informed that there was an independent officer present and that he might make complaints to him. According to the Crown submission, the accused treated both Officer Glinn and the prospect of his utility as an independent officer with complete disdain and indifference.  
     
      
    27 The Crown argued that the various complaints now relied upon by Mr Scragg were not matters of concern to Mr Jamal at the time. He had every opportunity to complain if he wished to. Not only did he not do so, but he was abusively disruptive and dismissive of the police endeavours to obtain his cooperation. The Crown submitted that an overall examination of the accused's behaviour demonstrated the very antithesis of a person who had been subjected to a degree of oppressive conduct. The Crown argued that the police behaved properly and courteously at all times. They were confronted with abuse and inappropriate behaviour by the accused, but did not respond to it other than by way of patient and polite behaviour designed to defuse a difficult situation that was not of police making at all. 
     
      
       
      Response by Mr Scragg 
       
      
    28 Mr Scragg accepted that individual passages in the transcript showed that his client was ""very upset as to what had happened"". However, Mr Scragg argued that these passages had to be read in context as to what had occurred up until the point of time each outburst happened. Mr Scragg submitted that initially the accused had cooperated, but that after his handcuffing and the treatment of his family, he became upset for “understandable reasons”.  
     
      
       
      Resolution 
       
       
      (a)  
      A preliminary question - was the statement an admission?  
       
      
    29 The Crown had submitted that, as it did not intend to rely upon Mr Jamal's statement as an admission, s 84 did not, in any event, apply. This proposition raises an aspect of the evidence which I have, in previous decisions, regarded as one not entirely easy to resolve. Specifically, the Crown has said that it did not intend to rely upon the statement to prove the truth of what was said, but rather as evidence going to the state of mind of the accused. Clearly enough, the state of mind of the accused is, or at least may be, highly relevant to the establishment of the charge in the indictment. Indeed, at least in two respects, the accused's state of mind and, for that matter his intentions as evidenced by his state of mind, are properly described as matters capable of bearing upon the existence of the essential ingredients that the Crown will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt to sustain the charge. Here, it seems to me, the accused's state of mind, as revealed by his statement, is capable of being regarded as directly relevant towards the establishment of at least two of those essential ingredients. Accordingly, the better view is to regard the statement as capable of being an admission, notwithstanding the position taken by the Crown. Consequently, s 84 will have potential application to the evidence. In a proper case, a statement of this kind, if oppression has not been negatived, will be capable of being found to be inadmissible. Of course, whether the statement is an admission, and the degree of weight to be given to it, will be a matter for the jury. 
     
      
       
      (b)  
      A general comment 
       
      
    30 Obviously it will be necessary for me to address the individual matters raised by Mr Scragg. I propose, however, to say something of a general nature at the outset.  
     
      
    31 There are a number of matters involved in Mr Scragg's submission that I accept. Obviously, the fact that the police arrived in considerable numbers at the accused's home in the early hours of the morning would represent something of an unusual or startling event. People in the house would, in general terms, be upset by the arrival of police intending to conduct a detailed search of their home and motor vehicle. I also accept that Mr Jamal, as the elder of the two brothers, would have had concerns for the welfare of his mother and his siblings. I also accept that the sudden arrival of the police would have entailed a need on their part to respect the cultural niceties of the situation they encountered. By this, I mean that the police needed to keep in mind that they were dealing with an Islamic family and, in particular, that respect would need to be paid to the concerns of the female members of the family particularly. So, in all these respects, there was a clear need for the police to act with restraint, patience and with an eye to calming down any emotionally explosive situation they might encounter.  
     
      
    32 That said, it is my general impression that the police acted very responsibly in that regard. A careful examination of the video of the search, and a careful reading of the transcript of the search, demonstrate, to my mind, that the police behaved properly, reasonably, and with a considerable degree of tact and discretion in a difficult situation. The behaviour of Mr Jamal and, to a degree, the behaviour of his brother was by contrast, deplorable. Even allowing for the unexpected intrusion into his home in the early hours of the morning, the behaviour of Mr Jamal, in particular, was on this occasion aggressive, abusive, threatening and unreasonable. The words and actions of the police, in my view, have to be measured against the background of this menacing, unpleasant and abusive behaviour by the accused himself.  
     
      
    33 I will, when examining the individual complaints relied on by Mr Scragg, point to precise examples of the type of behaviour I have described as abusive and aggressive. These illustrations will demonstrate the unpleasant and unreasonable nature of Mr Jamal's response to the police presence on the occasion. The police were there, armed with a lawful warrant to search the premises and the car. They had a power, in certain circumstances, to conduct an ordinary search and/or a frisk search of any person at the premises. It is clear that the police thought it appropriate to conduct a brief search of the other occupants of the premises, and then to let them go. There were female officers there to assist in that regard. The police officers were significantly, if not thwarted, at least hampered by the behaviour of the accused in particular, by his brother, and to some minor degree by his mother. Noureddean Jamal's behaviour was generally abusive to the authorities. Omar Jamal displayed, at least on this occasion, an attitude of considerable contempt for Australian law. As one of the passages I will set out below (from page 9 of the transcript) shows, he described it as ""your fuckin' shit law"". That expression, I thought, was fairly typical, on this occasion at least, of his general attitude to the authority represented by the search warrant. 
     
      
    34 As I have said earlier, there was a need for the police to display a sense of tact and discretion in dealing with the accused's family, particularly the female members. By and large, I consider the police displayed such an attitude. That can be hardly said of Omar Jamal, who spoke in a most unpleasant way to female police officers.  
     
      
    35 My general impression is that, far from the police conduct being oppressive in any sense, the only abusive behaviour emanated from Mr Jamal himself and, as I have said, to a lesser degree his brother.  
     
      
    36 The impugned passage appears at the top of page 16 of the transcript. Immediately prior to it Noureddean Jamal said to one of the police officers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Think you're tough because you've got that bullet thing beside ya...take it off and see what happens. Not so tough then, nah.” 
        
       
      
    37 Omar Jamal then said to his brother: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not even that ( 
        Arabic 
        ) they have no life. They're scums.” 
        
       
      
    38 It was in that immediate context that Jamal commenced his “outburst”. He had earlier (at page 11 of the transcript) cursed the police, their family and children. On this second occasion, however, the statement was very calculated and very deliberate. As I said (para 40 of my earlier judgment) the statement was delivered in a very calm manner and, indeed, in a very intent manner. No doubt Jamal was angry when he said it, but this was not an uncontrollable outburst of anger. It was a statement dredged up from the depths of his belief. It expressed, on that occasion at least, a fundamentalist religious view, and an intolerance towards Australian laws and authority.  
     
      
    39 The statement, obviously enough, occurred in the context of all the events of that night. I am satisfied, however, that the making of the statement was not influenced by oppressive conduct, or by any other of the kinds of conduct referred to in s 84 of the Evidence Act. If Mr Jamal's ""senses or spirits"" were weighed heavily upon, it was not as a consequence of any oppressive conduct by the police, but rather it related to his resentment towards the simple fact that his home had been entered by authorised police officers embarking upon a lawful exercise expressly sanctioned by Australian law. 
     
      
       
      (c)  
      Handcuffing 
       
      
    40 Mr Scragg's submission was that Jamal waited for the police when they arrived at his premises on 8 November 2005. He complied with all police directions. Nonetheless, he was handcuffed and Mr Scragg submitted that this was in breach of ""1999 Constable Education Program dealing with physical skills and operational safety"". The notation (which comes from the Police Service Handbook) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The decision to handcuff rests with you. 
        
       
       
        
        Generally, you are justified in handcuffing prisoners only when they have tried to escape or to prevent escape or injury to themselves or others. 
        
       
       
        
        You must have a good reason for handcuffing. Someone handcuffed unnecessarily has a right of action for damages. When you handcuff a prisoner, take all reasonable measures to prevent injury.” 
        
       
      
    41 As to the initial handcuffing, I consider that this was a matter completely for the discretion of the arresting officers. Hindsight is generally a valuable educator, but not necessarily a useful tool for the making of preliminary decisions. In the present matter, however, Mr Jamal's subsequent behaviour certainly justified the initial decision to handcuff him. Although only a young man at the time, he was powerfully built and presented a physically threatening appearance, particularly when angry. The nature of the investigation into the present conspiracy, the nature of the proposed charge itself and the ambit of the investigation provided ample justification for a decision to handcuff the accused prior to his arrest and the subsequent search of his home and car.  
     
      
    42 The only reference to there being some discomfort in relation to the presence of the handcuffs is at page 13 of the transcript, where Jamal, having said to his family, ""Don't speak to these pigs, don't even have sympathy for them"" then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Are these little things necessary?” 
        
       
      
    43 This was a reference to the handcuffs. He was told that they were necessary because he was ""aggressive"" and under arrest. The following conversation then occurred between Jamal and Detective Day. 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        OJ: 
         Yes, so youse are count poofs, uh?  
         
         
        SD: 
         If that's your interpretation. 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Yes, youse are poofs ( 
        Arabic 
        ). How am I supposed to read this thing and I can't turn it with my fingers? 
         
         
        SD: 
         Sit down and read a page and I'll turn each page for you. 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Flick the next one. 
         
         
        SD: 
         Have you read the first page?” 
        
       
      
    44 Nothing in this conversation suggests that the accused was in pain or complaining about being in pain.  
     
      
    45 Later in the transcript, during the actual search procedure and after the impugned statement had been made, Detective Day referred to the fact that during a pause in the video, the police had loosened Jamal's handcuffs. The police officer asked the accused, ""Are they much more comfortable now?"" And he agreed they were.  
     
      
    46 This passage may properly suggest that the handcuffs were becoming, at the particular time, uncomfortable and needed loosening for that reason. There is no other indication either in the video or the transcript to suggest that the handcuffing caused pain, or even a degree of undue discomfort. 
     
      
       
       
      (d)  
      The crowbar incident 
       
      
    47 The evidence about this appears in the voir dire transcript taken on 17 and 18 June 2008. The particular transcript related to an application of a different kind focusing, however, on the same events I am concerned with here. The transcript from the earlier application was, by consent, tendered before me on the present application. Noureddean Jamal gave evidence about some aspects of the search. He said he was not given any documents or told why he was being searched. He went into the lounge room and it was there that he saw an officer walking up and down the house with a crowbar. This was a reference to Officer Hackett. His evidence is recorded as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You have spoken about a police officer walking around your house with a crowbar. Can you describe to his Honour what that police officer looked like?  
         
         
        A. Well, I had come, after they had searched me, I had come into the lounge room, and I was sitting with my mum. I was actually standing up. My mum and my sisters were there, and there was this police with a suit, and he was walking up and down the lounge room with a crowbar, as I remember, and it was a big crowbar. And because I felt threatened at the time I didn't like him walking up and down, up and down the house with a big crowbar in front of my family. So I had said to him, ""Excuse me, you know, can you please put the crowbar down? There is no need to walk up and down the house with the crowbar.""  
         
         
         
        Q. I will ask you to slow down and follow his Honour's pen.  
         
         
        A. Then at that stage, as I had told him, ""Can you please put the crowbar down? I don't like you walking around my house with a crowbar.""  
         
         
         
        Q. What did he say in response?  
         
         
        A. He came up to me and he said, ""This is not your house anymore, it's ours.""  
         
         
         
        Q. Did you respond to that?  
         
         
        A. I think I said, ""It's your house, is it?"" I think I said, ""It's your house, is it?"" That's it.”  
        
       
      
    48 (The transcript of the search does not indicate that Hackett spoke in a threatening manner, rather it was an attempt to explain the police presence and their lawful entitlements).  
     
      
       
        
        ‘Q. Can you stand up and demonstrate how Officer Hackett--  
         
         
        A. As Hackett came out of kitchen, as the video showed, the footage of the kitchen, he came out and the crowbar was like that (indicating).  
         
         
         
        Q. For the record you have your left hand extended behind your thigh?  
         
         
        A. Yeah, as in that (indicating). I seen that in the earlier video, the one that you showed me before.  
         
         
         
        Q. From your position in the lounge room, did you see Rodney Hackett with the crowbar?  
         
         
        A. From the position that I was in, yeah.  
         
         
         
        Q. Can you describe how Rodney Hackett held that crowbar when you were in the lounge room? If you have to, stand up and demonstrate. It may be useful to use the people in front of his Honour to give relative positions, if that helps.  
         
         
        A. I come out of the lounge room and standing up, and he was walking up and down, say that was me (indicating), he was walking up and down with the crowbar in his hand like that (indicating).  
         
         
         
        Q. You put out your left hand.  
         
         
        A. Yeah.  
         
         
         
        Q. Was any contact being made with any object with that left hand?  
         
         
        A. No. He was just walking up and just had the crow bar in his hand, walking up again and turned around, up again, with the crow bar. That's when I said to him ""I don't like you walking around my house like that."".” 
        
       
      
    49 Noureddean Jamal described how the police officer was walking around the house and how he was holding the crowbar. In fact he was walking, the witness said, about between 1 and 2 metres away from members of the family in the lounge room. He said he was searched two times, the first being in the bedroom and the second in the lounge room. He was sitting in the living room with Officer Hackett. He said he felt “insecure” sitting next to the officer with the crowbar.  
     
      
    50 Jamal's brother was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on 18 June 2008. This revealed that, after other family members had been searched and allowed to leave the house, he remained. He said that he chose to stay. He agreed that when he was having the ""confrontation"" with Officer Hackett his brother told him to, in effect, “shut his mouth and not to talk”. He agreed he had been abusive to the police on that day on a number of occasions. The fact that Hackett was there did not stop him abusing the police. He also agreed that Inspector Glinn was in the lounge room, he thought, at the time he had the discussion with Hackett. No complaint was made to the independent officer. Noureddean Jamal was content to remain in the house with his brother until he had to leave to go to work. 
     
      
    51 During the same voir dire hearing, the accused Jamal gave evidence. He confirmed that he had been asked at the end of the search, before he was taken back to the police station, whether he had any complaints. He agreed that he had been asked this question and responded ""No"". He agreed that the police officers had placed the copy of the warrant on the coffee table in the lounge room and that he was invited to read it. He agreed that the police officers offered to turn the pages, but he said that he wasn't in the mood to read it at that time. He said his mind was ""somewhere else"". He said he was ""ignoring what they were saying"". He repeated ""I wasn't taking them up on the offers because my mind was somewhere else"". He was re-examined by Mr Carroll and was asked why his mind was somewhere else at the time when the police were reading out the first part of the warrant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because I was looking into my lounge room where my mother and my sisters and my brother were and there was a man walking up and down with a crowbar. I didn't know his name, but he was walking up and down with a crowbar and I felt they were being threatened by that man, so that's where my mind was. I wasn't really concentrating on anything else except my family.” 
        
       
      
    52 He said that he was telling his family: 
     
      
       
        
        “'Don't say anything' or 'Don't do anything', just in case they would hurt them or anything like that. I was trying to make them not do anything.” 
        
       
      
    53 He said he was concerned about his mother because: 
     
      
       
        
        “When I was outside they were going to arrest her. She is a very old lady. She is very sick, and they were going to restrain her.” 
        
       
      
    54 I was less than impressed by the evidence of Omar Jamal, and of his brother, at least so far as their evidence purported to give genuine insight into the situation in the house on that evening. I am perfectly satisfied there was no conduct by Officer Hackett of a threatening or intimidating kind. I accept that he had a crowbar in his hand, but I do not accept that any threat was made. Moreover, I do not accept that there was any material that would have justified an apprehension that Mr Jamal's mother was about to be arrested. The conversations that are recorded (or translated) in the video show that Jamal was saying to his mother and family, in effect, ""Do not talk to the police"". It was not a statement made because of a fear the police might do something to members of the family. Rather, it represented his belief that it would be inadvisable for them to say anything in front of the police officers. Jamal himself had been cautioned and he no doubt, knew that he was not obliged to say anything. He was, as he was entitled to do, exhorting his family to take the same attitude.  
     
      
    55 In short, there is nothing demonstrated of a threatening nature emanating from any of Officer Hackett's actions. I am quite dissuaded from any belief that his conduct was threatening to Jamal and his family in any way. I do not accept that Jamal was threatened by Officer Hackett's presence or actions. I do not accept that his ""mind was elsewhere"", as he said. Quite to the contrary, the video shows that he was very focused, and very much in control of the situation. 
     
      
       
      (e)  
      Searching family “unlawfully” 
       
      
    56 It is necessary to say something about the manner in which the process of the search evolved. It will be recalled that the accused was arrested outside of the house. He was cautioned by Detective Liddiard at the time of the arrest, and it was shortly after that point in time that the video camera operator commenced recording the events seen on the exhibit. For a short period of time, the accused remained outside the house while the police entered, determined who was in the house and made preliminary arrangements in order to secure the premises. As soon as the accused's attention was drawn to the fact that a video camera operation had commenced, he protested angrily about it, ""I don't want it on"". From this moment onwards, the accused's attitude was one of attempting to “order” the police as to the way they should conduct themselves during the search. For example, he said to Officer Day: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don't go into my house until everybody comes to the lounge room.” 
        
       
      
    57 When Officer Liddiard then sought to calm him down, he said angrily: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don't want to speak to youse.” 
        
       
      
    58 He then threatened the police that he would take them to court (""youse are gonna pay for it in court""). Officer Liddiard, once again, tried to calm the accused down. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Omer, Omer, it is not a time to discuss that now.” 
        
       
      
    59 Once again, the accused replied angrily and dismissively: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don't care.” 
        
       
      
    60 Detective Liddiard introduced himself, but while he was in the process of doing this, the accused interrupted him and gave directions to his family that they should go into the lounge room. The accused asked whether his family ""need to be here"". He demanded an answer to this question initially on three occasions. Detective Liddiard told the accused that everyone inside the premises would be searched and that the premises would be searched. The accused said to police officers who were trying to coordinate the situation inside the house: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don't go fuckin' near her.” 
        
       
      
    61 And then more angrily and emphatically: 
     
      
       
        
        “Do  
        not 
         go near her."" (My emphasis to record the manner in which the words were spoken) 
        
       
       
        
        “You go near her you see what happens to you alright.""  
        
       
      
    62 Detective Liddiard informed the accused that the police were endeavouring to be respectful of his wishes but the accused became even more uncooperative, hostile and abusive: 
     
      
       
        
        “Everything'll be alright, just don't touch me, let go of me, just go inside. And hurry the fuck up, you piece of shit. Do you want to go inside now everybody's in the lounge room?” 
        
       
      
    63 Once again, Detective Liddiard endeavoured to calm the accused who said that he was “100% calm”. The police brought the accused into the house and asked him to have a seat in the main room. It was at that stage that the accused's brother said to the police: 
     
      
       
        
        “You piece of shit. Look how you've got my brother, you piece of shit.” 
        
       
      
    64 Once again, the accused asked whether his family needed to be there. He was told again by Detective Liddiard that once the premises had been secured, his family would be searched and they would be then free to go. The accused protested about this process. Clearly, the police were becoming exasperated by this behaviour, and told him that the longer he misbehaved, the longer it would take to conduct the family search. The accused's real concern was his stated contention that his family had nothing to do with whatever it was the police were searching for at the premises. He said this on a number of occasions. He insisted they be allowed to leave without search, but the police insisted even more firmly that they would be allowed to go only after they had been searched. It was in that context that Officer Day said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, they don't have to go. They will be searched. Now let me tell you one thing, Omer, if you want to make it hard we will make it harder.” 
        
       
      
    65 Criticism was aimed at Stephen Day in respect of this remark. I think it is fair to say that the remark was incautious, but at the same time it was understandable in the provocative circumstances that existed. I took the officer to mean that the delay in allowing the family to leave would be all the more longer, if the accused did not desist from his abusive behaviour and his attempt to organise the search on his own terms. The same comment applies to Detective Day's next remark when he said, ""No, I will tell you what we're here for and we will make it last as long as we can, all right."" (This remark needs to be understood in the context that Officer Day wished to read to the accused the details of the search warrant. This is apparent from the next part of the transcript [page 6] where Detective Day introduced himself and the other police officers, including Inspector Glinn, the independent officer.) The conversation, including the interruptions by the accused, appear as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “

        OJ: 
         Who gives a shit.” 
        
       
      
    66 It will be seen from this interchange that Detective Day was endeavouring to commence the reading of the search warrant and, in that context, he introduced Inspector Glinn to the accused. He was endeavouring to point out that any complaints about the conduct of the search warrant could be made to the independent officer. Throughout this introductory part of the process, the accused continually interrupted in an abusive manner. It was clear that his real complaint was that the police were there at all. There was no complaint about any particular aspect of the process and the accused made it clear that he was going to ignore the presence of the independent officer. Because of his abusive interruptions, Detective Day once again cautioned the accused and reminded him that he was not obliged to say anything, but that statements he made would be used later in evidence. The accused's response to the caution was again one of abuse. 
     
      
    67 Detective Day, however, continued to attempt to explain to the accused his rights. He asked him whether he understood those rights. The following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SD: 
         Omar, do you understand that? 
         
         
        OJ: 
         I don't understand shit, just do your work and that's (ind).

         No, I need you to understand your rights. 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Mate, you don't need me to do nothing, you can do your job and that's your job to do it and get out of here. Just do your job and that's it.” 
        
       
      
    68 Detective Liddiard commenced to read the warrant to the accused. Once again he was interrupted by the accused who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever youse do, don't plant shit in my house.” 
        
       
      
    69 Detective Day ignored the interruption and continued to read from the warrant. While reading out the first two pages of the warrant the detective was again interrupted on two occasions by the accused.  
     
      
    70 The warrant was then placed in front of the accused and the officer told the accused that he would leave the copy of the warrant there for the accused to read.  
     
      
    71 The accused showed no interest whatsoever in reading or examining the warrant and angrily demanded once again whether his family had to be there, did they have to be there ""by law"". At that point the following conversation took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “

    72 The police then discussed searching the accused's brother and indicated that he would be free to go then. Detective Day said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And once he leaves the premises he's not coming back in.” 
        
       
      
    73 To which the accused replied, ""No worries."" The accused then spoke to his brother and pointed out to him that he was not under arrest and that he was free to leave after his search had been completed.  
     
      
    74 The next matter to be arranged was the search of the accused's mother. This was to be done privately by a female officer. There were further interruptions by the accused and, on this occasion, by his mother as well. The accused's language and behaviour were again abusive, and he told his mother not to talk to the police. While the search was going on, the accused said to a police officer, who was apparently moving in the direction of the search room: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don't go out there, you fucking little poof.” 
        
       
      
    75 This led to the police remonstrating with the accused once more and forcibly requiring him to resume his seat. (See s 3G of Crimes Act 1914 for use of reasonable and necessary force). The accused then called on Allah to curse the police, their family and children. Detective Liddiard said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We've got everything under control and we'll get everyone out in five to ten minutes.” 
        
       
      
    76 The accused's mother then attempted to leave. The police would not let her go until they had checked the contents of the bag she was carrying. This led to another abusive series of remarks by the accused directed towards the police. The accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Go, don't come back in. You have to record you little fucking pigs over here because they might plant something into my house. So you have to record these little pigs, especially that little pig over there. You're a pig and you think you're a fuckin' man, come outside and I'll show ya, see whose a man, think youse are a bloody man, uh.” 
        
       
      
    77 At that point the accused's brother indicated that he wished to stay in the house and not to leave with the other family members. Detective Day asked one of the officers to search the brother who said, ""You just searched me, mate, I've been sitting in the same spot."" (He, in fact, had been searched earlier in the bedroom). 
     
      
    78 Notwithstanding, the relevant police officer briefly searched the brother a second time.  
     
      
    79 There was then discussion whether the family members who wanted to leave, could leave. Detective Day indicated that once everyone's details had been given to the police, they could go. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We need to obtain all the details of everyone that was here. A Commonwealth warrant entitles us to do that, okay, so I just need full names, okay, of who was here, that's all I'm asking.” 
        
       
      
    80 (Strictly speaking, the warrant did not appear to confer this entitlement on the police executing the warrant, but I do not consider this a major breach of proper process). 
     
      
    81 The accused then asked Detective Day, in relation to the search warrant: 
     
      
       
        
        “How am I supposed to read this thing and I can't turn it with my fingers?” 
        
       
      
    82 Detective Day asked the accused to sit down and indicated that he would turn each page for him so that the accused could read the warrant. The accused appeared to become disinterested in pursuing this process and then proceeded a short time later to engage in further abuse of the police officers. The following exchange occurred in relation to a female officer:

         Oh you fuckin', you're a rat. 
         
         
        SD:

        OJ: 
         Shut up, man, just shut up.” 
        
       
      
    83 The police were then engaged in taking photographs of the rooms prior to the video camera recording of the actual search. During this process Detective Day offered to turn the next page of the warrant for the accused to read. The accused appeared disinterested in the process. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “How do I know if these poofs are not plantin' stuff in my house. Are they gonna take, er, are they going to video camera with them? 
        
       
       
        
        TL: 
         That's why we are photographing all the rooms. 
        
       
       
        
        OJ: 
         Yeah? You can't just slip something under the bed or something before you photograph it.  
         
         
        TL: 
         We're photographing all the rooms, Omer...if you've got any questions in that regard I suggest Inspector Glinn might be the one to refer them to.” 
        
       
      
    84 The accused did not raise any questions with, or make any complaints in that regard to Inspector Glinn. Shortly afterwards Detective Day indicated that the process of searching the house one room at a time was shortly to commence. The accused said that he wanted to be present ""Everywhere youse go"". Detective Day agreed to this and the video camera processing of the search of each room then commenced with the accused present.  
     
      
    85 During the search of one of the rooms, the accused became abusive once more. The following is recorded at transcript 18 to 19: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        TL: 
         Omer, take your foot off the door, alright, okay. [BANGING NOISE] If you inhibit the execution of this warrant you will be charged in relation to it, do you understand that?

        OJ: 
         Can youse keep on searching? 
         
         
        SD: No, we can't. We're recording the exhibits we've got. 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Do your job. 
         
         
        SD:

        OJ: 
         Do your job. 
         
         
        SD:

        OJ: 
         That's it, just do it, and don't speak to me, that's it, do your job and don't speak to me. 
         
         
        SD: 
         No, I won't be speaking to you. Do it again like that and you will be going. 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Alright, do your, just do your job, hurry up, man.” 
        
       
      
    86 I have taken some considerable time to set out not only the process and timing of the searching of the accused's family, but all the surrounding circumstances and happenings. The detail quotations from the transcript do not necessarily give the flavour of the level of abuse involved in the accused's remarks and behaviour. It is necessary to view carefully the video itself to get the full picture. As I have said earlier in my general comments, the level of abuse and disruptive behaviour by the accused remained persistent throughout the preliminary stages of the process and continued into the search process itself. 
     
      
    87 In my opinion, it is not open to the accused to complain that the warrant was not fully read to him, or to assert that he did not have the opportunity of reading it, notwithstanding that he was handcuffed at the time. It is quite apparent that Detective Day intended to read the whole of the search warrant to the accused, but his interruptions to the process simply made this virtually impossible. Moreover, the delay in having the searches carried out on members of the family to enable them to leave may fairly be sheeted home, not to the police, but to the behaviour of the accused. So far as the search warrant was concerned, the police offered to turn the pages for the accused so that he could read them carefully and at his leisure. The video indicates that he was not interested in taking up this offer. 
     
      
    88 The accused gave evidence on 19 June 2008. In his evidence-in-chief he said that he had never seen a document headed ""Rights of the Occupier"". His attention was drawn to one of those rights, namely entitlement of a person who is to be searched under a search warrant to have a copy of the warrant provided before the search. He said he was not told about this right and it was a right he would have insisted on for the benefit of his family.  
     
      
    89 In cross-examination, however, the accused agreed that he had made no complaint to the independent police officer about any matter involved in the search process. He was also taken to transcript 45 of the video recording. At that point he had been asked whether he had any complaints or anything that he wished to raise with the officers in regards to the way the search warrant had been conducted. He agreed that he had replied in the negative to this question.  
     
      
    90 In relation to the warrant that had been partially read to him and then placed on the table before him, he agreed he had been invited to read it and that the police officers had offered to turn the pages. He said that he ""wasn't in the mood to read it at that time"". He said his ""mind was somewhere else"". He insisted he wasn't ""really knocking (the offer) back"". He maintained he was ""just in a different state of mind at that moment"". At pages 10 and 11 of the transcript of 19 June 2008, the following questions and answers appear:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You told us it is because of that mindset that you didn't take the police up on what they were saying; for example, reading the warrant?  
         
         
        A. I was ignoring what they were saying.  
         
         
         
        HIS HONOUR  
         
         
        Q. Sorry, I was--  
         
         
        A. Ignoring.  
         
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR  
         
         
        Q. It is more than ignoring. You weren't taking them up on the offers. That's correct?  
         
         
        A. I wasn't taking them up on the offers because my mind was somewhere else.”  
        
       
      
    91 I have earlier rejected the suggestion made by the accused in his evidence that ""his mind was elsewhere"". The truth was, as appears from a careful examination of the video recording, that the accused was completely disinterested in the content of the search warrant, and in a recitation of his rights. His real resentment related to the fact that he was the subject of a search warrant at all. Despite being under arrest and handcuffed during the early part of the search warrant, he was the dominant and controlling figure in the process during that period. This extended to the position and behaviour of his family. 
     
      
    92 As I have indicated, the accused had no interest himself in the warrant or its contents. Equally, I do not accept his complaint that he would have insisted, had he known of the entitlement, that his family members be shown a copy of the warrant. 
     
      
    93 The search warrant authorised the executing officer or a constable assisting to conduct an ordinary search and/or a frisk search of any person at the premises when the warrant was executed. This power arose if the executing officer or the constable ""suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his or her possession evidential material"".  
     
      
    94 ""Evidential material"" means a thing relevant to an indictable offence, including such a thing in electronic form. (Section 3C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). 
     
      
    95 ""Thing relevant to an indictable offence"" means: ... 
     
      
       
        
        (a) either of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) anything with respect to which an indictable offence has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) anything with respect to which a State offence that has a Federal aspect … has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such (indictable) offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) anything as which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence (s 3(1) of the Crimes Act 1914”. 
        
       
      
    96 Similarly, s 3F(1)(c) and (d) of the Crimes Act 1914 authorise persons executing a search warrant to search for and seize the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to enable the seizure of things that are believed on reasonable grounds to be evidential material. Section 3F(1)(b) also permits the warrant to enable an ordinary search or a frisk search on, for example, the grounds specified in the warrant issued to Detective Day relating to the accused's premises at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield.  
     
      
    97 Consequently, I conclude that the police were acting within their authority when they determined to search briefly the members of the accused's family. The timing of the process they adopted in attempting to read to the accused his own rights, including the details of the warrant, prior to searching the family members and letting them go, was a reasonable one. The premises had to be secured, five people had to be briefly searched and the accused had to be arrested, cautioned and shown the police entitlements under the terms of the search warrant. All this could have been done in quite an orderly and timely fashion. The fact it took longer than might be expected was primarily because of the behaviour of the accused. It was a matter for the discretion of the police as to how the sequence of these events were to be organised and scheduled. 
     
      
    98 The fact that Noureddean Jamal was searched twice does not appear to me to involve any impropriety or irregularity. He had been searched briefly once in his own bedroom. It was only later when he was in the lounge room that police conducted a second brief search. It is open to infer that the police wanted to determine, prior to his leaving the house, that he was not taking any evidential material with him. This was not, in my view, unreasonable and was not prohibited by the terms of the warrant. 
     
      
    99 Section 3H of the Crimes Act 1914 requires that, if a person is searched under a warrant in relation to premises, the executing officer or a constable assisting must show the person a copy of the warrant. In addition, the executing officer must identify himself or herself to the person at the premises or the person being searched, as the case may be. (Section 3H(3) and (4)). 
     
      
    100 In my opinion the police officers failed to comply with these sections. It was incumbent upon the searching officer (or his superior), to show the warrant to each of the persons being searched and to identify the executing officer. It does not appear so far as I can gather, that either of these steps were taken.  
     
      
    101 It appears, however, that the family members were gathered in the lounge room. They were able to see, or at least hear, the attempts the police made to read the warrant to the accused. They were able to hear the identification of police officers made to Omar Jamal. They were able to hear the attempts made by the police to turn the pages of the copy warrant to enable the accused to read the warrant if he had wished to do so. It would have been apparent to them that the accused himself had no real interest in having the warrant read to him, or in inspecting the details of the warrant for himself. Neither of those situations exempted the police from showing a copy of the warrant to the family members prior to the search of each of them being conducted in the bedroom adjacent to the lounge room. The general circumstances make it understandable, however, as to why these formal matters, important though they be, were not observed. In all the circumstances of the matter, I do not consider that the breaches involved were major or deliberate and, indeed, some sympathy can be extended to the police officers, in all the circumstances, for their failure to comply strictly with the requirements of the Commonwealth legislation. 
     
      
    102 I do not consider that the family members were detained unlawfully. They were free to go as soon as the searches on their persons had been concluded. The fact that this took longer than normal was primarily due to the disruptive behaviour of the accused. No complaints were made about this situation by the accused or by any member of the family. Both the accused and his brother certainly knew there was an independent officer there whose task would include the receipt of complaints, legitimate or otherwise. No complaints were made. The brother chose to remain in the premises after his second search had been completed. He heard the warrant being read to his brother although he too apparently had no real interest in the process 
     
      
       
      (f)  
      The accused not given the right to be present at all times 
       
      
    103 Section 3P of the Crimes Act 1914 gives a right to the occupier of premises to be present at the premises and entitled to observe the search being conducted. This right ceases if the person, however, impedes the search. The section does not prevent two or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time. In my opinion, there was substantial compliance with s 3P. The accused was taken around the premises while the video search took place. Indeed, he was disruptive on one occasion and, notwithstanding this, the police allowed him to remain with the searching officers while other rooms were searched. He made no complaint about the conduct of the search at its conclusion. It is true he expressed a concern that, prior to the search commencing, officers were taking photographs of the rooms. The concern he expressed was that something might be ""planted"" in the rooms. The police explained to him that the photographing was occurring so that there would be a record of the contents of the rooms. The reason for the photographing was to provide independent proof that nothing had been planted during the search. The photographs, consistently with this precaution, were taken before the search proper commenced. In any event, s 3J of the Crimes Act 1914 gives a power to take photographs for a purpose incidental to the execution of the warrant. In all those circumstances, I consider that the accused was not denied his rights to observe the search being conducted.  
     
      
       
      (g)  
      The video camera was inappropriately trained or focused on the accused 
       
      
    104 It is true that the video camera was predominantly focused on the accused during the early part of the proceedings before the search proper commenced. This was hardly surprising as the accused had made himself the focus of all attention by his abusive and disruptive behaviour. It was appropriate, in my opinion, that the video did focus on his activities during this early period of the search, precisely, because of the type of complaint that is now being made. The video taping in this fashion, enabled the Court to determine, in an objective manner, whether oppressive conduct had occurred from shortly after his arrest to the time when the search proper commenced. An examination of the video taping shows that the camera thereafter focused on the search rather than simply on the accused himself. The power to use a video camera for purposes incidental to the search warrant is confirmed by s 3J of the Crimes Act. It is clear enough that the accused did not want to be videotaped. Indeed, he resented the fact that he was being videotaped, just as he resented the search warrant procedure generally. I am satisfied, in any event, that the videotaping process that was undertaken did not influence the making of the impugned statement by the accused.  
     
      
       
      Inappropriate comments by the police 
       
      
    105 The only suggestion that an inappropriate comment was made appears from a remark appearing at page 14 of the transcript. The conversation occurs as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        OJ: 
         Where's my phone? 
         
         
        TL: 
         (On phone) Hello? 
         
         
        OJ: 
         Hey, you poof. 
         
         
        TL: 
         (On phone) G'day mate. Yeah (ind). 
         
         
        M: 
         We're just having a good time...happy to put off the search for security.” 
        
       
      
    106 This last remark, attributed to an unknown male police officer, may or may not have been inappropriate. It is impossible to know either from the transcript or the video what its real context may have been. Assuming, however, in favour of the arguments advanced on the accused's behalf that the remark was inappropriate, it does not appear to me to have had any influence on the accused. It will be recalled that the accused’s next remark was an extremely abusive statement to a female police officer, although the context of that remark is itself unclear. It does not appear to have anything to do with the apparently flippant remark passed by the unknown male officer. 
     
      
       
      General conclusion 
       
      
    107 In my view, the Crown has clearly discharged the onus it has to prove the admissibility of the impugned statement. I am perfectly satisfied that the conduct referred to in the accused's submissions, whether viewed generally or in individual terms, could not possibly be classed as oppressive conduct, and did not, in any event, influence the making of the admission. The accused was undoubtedly angry. But his anger and resentment arose out of the fact that his home and family had been the subject of a lawful search warrant. It was only in that sense that the conduct of the police had aroused his ire. In any event, the real context of the statement made by Jamal at page 16 of the transcript was the conversation recorded between his brother and himself reinforcing their mutual dislike and distrust of police officers carrying out their duties. That was, as I have endeavoured to show earlier, the immediate context of the remark, even though it occurred, obviously enough, in the overall context of all the circumstances of the evening. The statement was delivered, however, in a very calm manner, and indeed in a very intent manner. It was, no doubt in part, motivated by anger and resentment, but it was very deliberate nonetheless. The statement was made by the accused in the exercise of his free will to speak. In that sense, it was a voluntary statement. There was no conduct on the part of the police, in my view, that could legitimately be described as oppressive so as to undermine the reliability of the statement made. Of course, the issue of its reliability and the weight to be given to it is a matter for the jury not the trial judge. 
     
      
    108 The application that the statement be held to be inadmissible is refused.

   JUDGMENT1. Jason Little was watching television one night in his room at the Auburn Hotel when one of his neighbours provoked an altercation between them. The result of that altercation was that Mr Sedat Yuksel whom I am sentencing today produced a knife and stabbed Mr Little in the back. He was tried and convicted by a jury of maliciously wounding Mr Little with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. That is an offence against s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years.

One of the main issues in this sentence is the question of where the offence lies in the range of objective seriousness, specifically whether or not it lies in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That question is relevant to whether or not the standard non-parole period becomes applicable to this sentence.  
    3. Briefly, what happened is this. The offence occurred on 31 October 2007. Both Mr Little and Mr Yuksel were residents at the Auburn Hotel. Mr Little was watching television in his room, as I said. There was a loud knocking on his door. He ignored it for a while but finally got up and found that his neighbour, Sedat Yuksel, known as Sam Yuksel, was standing at the door.  
    4. Mr Yuksel verbally abused him claiming that Mr Little was yelling at him. Mr Little gave evidence that Mr Yuksel then punched Mr Little in the face and Mr Yuksel was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The jury in fact acquitted him of that charge.  
    5. Despite Mr Yuksel trying to get into Mr Little’s room, Mr Little managed to repel him. Mr Yuksel stayed outside and continued to try to get into the room although the door was locked. Mr Little regained his composure but became angry and went back outside again to confront Mr Yuksel. When he did this Mr Yuksel continued to yell abuse at him. Mr Yuksel, both in the earlier incident and at the stage that I am describing now, formed the view that Mr Little was yelling out abuse towards him. Mr Little explained that the only noise coming from his room was that of the television.  
    6. A fight broke out. They were in the hallway. Punches were thrown by both men. Mr Little fell because he lost his balance. He fell awkwardly and badly injured his ankle. He found that he could not get up. There was, as he described in his evidence before the jury, “no way I could stand up on both feet. I tried but I couldn’t.” He said that once he was down on the ground he was “absolutely helpless”. He was trying to knock on his neighbour’s door with his feet and he was calling out for help but there was no answer. Mr Little described Mr Yuksel as “still standing over the top of me as I was lying on the ground with a knife in his hand.”  
    7. Mr Little then describes Mr Yuksel as stomping with his foot on the top of his ankle. Mr Little was of the view that that action resulted in a broken ankle. I am not quite sure because I cannot recollect whether the assault occasioning actual bodily harm charge was the result of the initial punch when Mr Little first opened the door or that action. I do not take either into account because Mr Yuksel was acquitted of the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
    8. Mr Little went on to describe his feeling of panic when Mr Yuksel produced a knife. He then described Mr Yuksel as kicking “my legs, my body, my stomach and then he rolled me over and stabbed me in the back, just under the right shoulder blade. I had to have fifteen staples and four stitches in my back.” He said he saw the knife and recalls being rolled over and stabbed in the back, what he described as a very long slash across the back of his back.  
    9. Mr Yuksel gave evidence in the trial and was cross-examined about the circumstances of Mr Little being on the floor and the stabbing. He denied stabbing Mr Little. He frankly admitted the fight that developed between them but has always denied, and denied before the jury, stabbing Mr Little. When he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Yuksel acknowledged that Mr Little had fallen to the ground and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He tried to get up, he still tried to get up, he goes ‘Let me get up’. He goes, ‘My ankle, my ankle’, you know, he’s screaming about his ankle, and you know.” 
         
        
       
      
    Mr Yuksel said that Mr Little tried to get up but then fell back down screaming that his ankle was hurting. Indeed he acknowledged that Mr Little tried to get up a few times but could not and was complaining about his ankle. He acknowledged that when he was down Mr Little was knocking on the bedroom door that was opposite his own room and yelling out “Help me, my ankle, help me”. 10. Mr Little did indeed receive a bad gash to his back just under the right shoulder. That gash was photographed whilst he was in hospital and the photographs of the gash, namely photographs number 1, 2 and 7 and 6 became part of exhibit G in the trial. I accept Mr Little’s evidence that the wound needed stapling and stitches. That is obvious from looking at the size of the wound which measures between thirteen and fifteen centimetres across.  
    11. Another neighbour came upon the scene. He assisted Mr Little. The police were called. Mr Yuksel was arrested. As I said he was tried before a jury which convicted him on 16 June 2008.  
    12. The first and most important finding that I need to make is where this offence lies in the range of objective seriousness. That means just how bad this crime was in the range of malicious wound with intent to inflect grievous bodily harm. The Crown Prosecutor, in her submissions, says that the offence is within the middle of the range of objective seriousness or above it. She emphasises that the victim was effectively helpless at the time that the offence was committed. She also draws attention to the fact that the offence was committed with the use of a weapon.  
    13. On the other hand, Mr Buckman, who appeared for Mr Yuksel at the trial and on the sentence, argues that the offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He argues that the injury was not permanent, nor did it lead to any disfigurement. It did not require surgery other than obviously the stitches and the victim has made a full recovery. There was no need for ongoing treatment. So far as the helplessness of the victim was concerned, Mr Buckman argued that the offence had to be seen in the context that it was a fight between two men. It was, as he said, in the context of a fight mutually agreed upon. It was not, for example, an unprovoked attack. In addition, Mr Buckman pointed out that his client was not to know that the victim’s ankle had been broken. He also pointed out that the crime occurred over a relatively short period of time.  
    14. Mr Buckman’s main emphasis in his submission that the offence fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness was a reliance on the psychiatric evidence. There was admitted into evidence as exhibit C on the sentence a psychiatric report by Dr Barbara Sinclair dated 4 September 2008. She undertook a psychiatric assessment of Mr Yuksel at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater on 29 August 2008. Significantly, she expressed the opinion that “at the time of the alleged offence it is likely that Mr Yuksel was suffering from an acute paranoid psychosis, most likely fuelled by heavy cannabis use and/or alcohol.” She went on to say that she believed that Mr Yuksel is suffering from a paranoid psychosis. She thought that at the time of the offence Mr Yuksel “appeared to be experiencing hallucinations and ideas of thought interference and paranoia. This was a probable drug induced psychosis fuelled by cannabis.”  
    15. Mr Buckman points to that expression of opinion which he says is supported by the evidence of his client apparently hearing abuse from Mr Little in circumstances where it was clear that all Mr Little was doing was watching television. Mr Buckman argues that the episode of acute paranoid psychosis was clearly a causative factor in Mr Yuksel’s offending behaviour and that, therefore, added to the other factors, brought the offence below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
    16. Before turning to make my own finding on where the offence lies, I record that I accept the evidence of Dr Sinclair. I accept her findings and her conclusions.  
    17. The factors which are relevant for me to take into account on where an offence lies in the range of objective seriousness include, according to Simpson J’s judgment in R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [13], the objective facts of the offence itself, the consequences of the conduct and factors which impinge upon the mental attitude of the offender such as motivation and mental state or mental illness. By reference to those factors, I need to determine where this offence lies in the range of objective seriousness. That is just how bad an example of this crime Mr Yuksel’s offence was.  
    18. I find that Mr Little was a vulnerable victim in accordance with s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I accept his evidence that he was effectively helpless at the time. I do not find that Mr Yuksel knew that Mr Little’s ankle was broken, but it is clear from Mr Yuksel’s cross-examination that he had a full appreciation of the fact that Mr Little was helpless and crying for help. This, in my opinion, is a seriously aggravating feature of the offence.  
    19. In addition, I find that there was the use of a weapon which is an aggravating feature in accordance with s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I was inclined to think that, because of the nature of the offence being a wounding, that the use of a weapon would be regarded as part of the definition of the offence. But my attention was drawn by the Crown Prosecutor to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19. Simpson J, with whom Beazley JA and Rothman J agreed, said that in her opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The actual use of a weapon is not an essential element of an offence against s 33 and it was an error for his Honour so to hold. The infliction of grievous bodily harm can be brought about without the use of a weapon and using only the body of the offender. The offence may be committed without any weapon at all.” 
        
       
      
      
    That was, I acknowledge, a case about a car being used to run over a victim. It is obviously possible for a wound to be inflicted without the use of a weapon. It would probably be unusual; most crimes of this kind would be committed with the use of a weapon. I do take into account as adding to the objective seriousness of this crime that it was committed by use of a weapon but I do not place significant weight upon that factor because I expect a vast majority of wounding offences would involve a weapon. Nevertheless, it adds to the objective seriousness of the offence. 20. Mr Buckman submitted that the injury was not substantial and therefore a mitigating factor under s 21A(3). I do not accept that submission. Whilst not finding that the injury was substantial, I do regard the injury as significant. Factors such as a significant loss of blood, the injury being life-threatening or requiring significant surgery, in my opinion, would be examples of substantial injuries and injuries which may bring an offence such as this into the upper range of objective seriousness. It is plain from the photograph of the injury and from the evidence of the requirement for hospital treatment that Mr Little received a very bad wound. It was certainly not the most serious kind of wound that he could have received but it was far from insignificant.  
    21. Although I accept that the offence occurred in the context of a brawl between two men, two factors need to be taken into account in assessing that submission. The first is that the brawl was initiated by Mr Yuksel in the first place. He approached Mr Little’s door and then persevered in demanding the confrontation. That perseverance produced two confrontations. The second factor is that, although there was a fight between the two men, the evidence makes it abundantly clear that Mr Little had been rendered practically helpless at the stage that he was stabbed by Mr Yuksel. I therefore regard the circumstance that it was a fight between the two men as not taking away significantly from the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour. 
    22. The most significant factor, in my opinion, which has the potential to reduce the objective seriousness of the offence in this case is the psychiatric evidence which, as I say, I have accepted. It is clear that Mr Yuksel was suffering a significant psychiatric illness at the time that he committed this offence. The psychiatrist found that that was most likely fuelled by heavy cannabis use or alcohol. That finding which I make about Mr Yuksel’s psychiatric condition needs to be seen in the context of the pre-sentence report prepared by a Probation and Parole officer dated 24 July 2008 which is part of exhibit A. In that report the author expresses the opinion that Mr Yuksel “lacks any family support and has declined advice and direction to seek psychiatric assistance whilst in the community.” Whilst I am not sure that he is completely lacking family support, I accept the evidence from the Probation officer that Mr Yuksel had declined advice and direction to seek psychiatric assistance whilst in the community. The author also said that the Probation and Parole Service records indicate “that he failed to follow direction to address his apparent psychiatric status.”  
    23. I make reference to those findings, as I said, to put the finding that I make about his psychiatric condition into context. This is not a case of a person who suddenly and unexpectedly becomes the subject of an acute mental episode. Nor is it a case of a person who has an undiagnosed long-term mental condition such as depression. The evidence is clear that Mr Yuksel’s mental state, or mental condition, is something which had been drawn to his attention in the past and the evidence is, and I accept, that he has refused or at least declined directions and recommendations to have that treated. Hence the impact of his mental condition on the offence in this case needs to be seen in the context that he knew about his condition and had declined to get assistance for it. 
    24. I am satisfied that this offence falls within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I have not found this finding an easy one to make but the factors which clearly puts it, in my opinion, within that range are the vulnerability of the victim and the extent of the wound requiring hospitalisation and suturing and the fact, to a lesser extent, that a weapon was used. Although I regard the mental condition of Mr Yuksel as a significant factor, I do not regard it as sufficiently significant to bring the offence below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, particularly given the finding which I made about the context of that mental illness. 
    25. I therefore am required by s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to set the standard non-parole period for this offence unless I determine that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. There are, in my opinion, no reasons for setting a longer period.  
    26. The same section goes on to provide that the reasons for which I may set a shorter period than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to s 21A of the same Act. The only mitigating factor which may impact upon the standard non-parole period in this case is the submission made by Mr Buckman, acknowledged by the Crown, under s 21A(3)(b) that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I accept Mr Buckman’s submission that the offence was spontaneous and opportunistic rather than planned. However, that is the only mitigating factor which I regard as relevant.  
    27. Mr Buckman had submitted that the offence was provoked by the victim. I do not accept that submission. The whole course of events was provoked by the persistent and aggravating behaviour of Mr Yuksel. It is true that the victim, Mr Little, stepped outside his door on more than one occasion and engaged in a fight but that, in my opinion, is not the kind of behaviour which would enable me to find that the offence in this case, namely stabbing Mr Little whilst he was helpless on the ground, was provoked by Mr Little.  
    28. I have already given reasons for rejecting the submission that the injury was not substantial. I do accept that it was not planned in a sense that is no doubt the result of Mr Yuksel’s mental condition at the time. I do not regard that mitigating factor as significant enough to cause me to set a non-parole period that is shorter than the standard non-parole period.  
    29. I am therefore required by the legislature, by Parliament, to set as a non-parole period in this case, the standard non-parole period fixed for this sentence, which is seven years.  
    30. That is a very significant non-parole period. However, when one looks at other aggravating features not directly relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective features of Mr Yuksel, I regard the non-parole period of seven years as appropriate. Briefly, the other aggravating features are that the offence was committed whilst Mr Yuksel was on conditional liberty. A court had granted him freedom and he abused that freedom by taking a knife to the victim in this case, and I take that conditional liberty abuse into account under s 21A(2)(j). Under s 21A(2)(d) is Mr Yuksel’s criminal record. He has a bad criminal record. He has been offending since he was a child. He has been committing significant and serious offences for the last twenty years as an adult. He has been serving gaol sentences for assaults between 1988 and 2001. Around about 2000 or 2001 he received a significant sentence for armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. Significantly, two of the offences in his record are serious personal violence offences. Section 21A(2)(d) requires me to particularly take those into account when, as is the case here, an offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence.  
    31. Mr Yuksel’s personal features do not assist him. He is now thirty-eight years of age, having been born on 3 June 1970. The pre-sentence report describes him as responding poorly to supervision. He has had limited employment in the past, having been expelled from school in year 9. He has expressed an attitude to pursue the victim if he gets a long sentence. That is a matter of some concern to the Probation and Parole Service. The Probation and Parole Service regards him as having a high risk of re-offending. It has great concerns for the community if there is no psychiatric assessment and treatment before he is released. Both the pre-sentence report and the psychiatric report contain recommendations for his future management and treatment. I propose to direct in due course that both of those reports accompany Mr Yuksel’s papers so that both are taken into account by the Parole Authority when, in due course, he comes to be assessed for parole.  
    32. Mr Buckman submitted that there are special circumstances warranting a longer than normal balance of the sentence. The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that and I propose to increase the balance of the term of the sentence slightly to reflect that submission which I have accepted. The submission was that there was a need for ongoing and significant counselling for him on his release because of his mental health condition. I find that that is a special circumstance which warrants setting a period longer than the standard period.  
    33. The sentence which I propose to impose is a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of seven years.  
    34. Mr Yuksel, I set a non-parole period for your sentence of seven years from 31 October 2007 to 30 October 2014. The balance of the term will be two years from 31 October 2014 to 30 October 2016. There are special circumstances for that term being more than one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence.  
    35. I direct that the pre-sentence report dated 24 July 2008 and the Justice Health report of Dr Sinclair dated 4 September 2008 both accompany Mr Yuksel with his papers into custody and be drawn to the attention of the Parole Authority when he is considered for parole.  
    36. Mr Yuksel I am required to explain to you, I am going to date your sentence from the date of your arrest, 31 October 2007. The first date upon which you become eligible to considered for parole will be 30 October 2014. Whether or not you are granted parole depends upon the Parole Authority. Your overall sentence expires on 30 October 2016. The prisoner can be taken down.

    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Khaled Cheikho to exclude statements made on 8 November 2005, and to exclude material taken in the execution of a search warrant at 3/63 Taylor Street, Lakemba.  
     
      
    2 On 7 November 2005, an authorised issuing officer signed two search warrants in favour of Federal Agent Colin Hunt. The warrant was ""signed over"", ultimately coming into the possession of Detective Sergeant Paul McDonald whose task it was to be responsible for the execution of the warrants.  
     
      
    3 The first warrant related to premises known as Unit 3, 63 Taylor Street, Lakemba, New South Wales 2195. I shall refer to it as the premises warrant (a copy of it appears as annexure A to this decision). The second warrant - a vehicle warrant - related to a proposed search of a Holden motor vehicle, registration AG61GE. The premises and motor vehicle were associated with Khaled Cheikho, one of nine men presently on trial for a charge of conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts (ss 101.6 and 11.5 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). 
     
      
    4 The search of Khaled Cheikho's premises and car were part of a wider counter-terrorism operation. The early hours of the morning of 8 November 2005 had been set aside as the time for a major police ""swoop"" on a number of homes in Sydney's western suburbs. This was a very large-scale operation involving a considerable number of New South Wales Police, Federal Police and other persons. The premises at unit 3, 63 Taylor Street, Lakemba, were one of those targeted for search and seizure as part of the overall counter-terrorism operation. It was plainly envisaged as part of the operation that a number of persons would be arrested and their homes searched. As it happened, during the early hours of that morning and later that day, all nine of the present accused were arrested. Khaled Cheikho was cautioned and placed under arrest at about 2.30am on 8 November 2005. His premises were then subjected to a detailed forensic procedure. At the conclusion of that operation, during which time Detective Sergeant McDonald had read and explained the search warrants to the accused, the search proper in relation to the vehicle and premises commenced. The accused himself was taken away shortly before the search commenced. He was taken to Surry Hills Police Station at about 4.50am and there placed in custody. The search at his home commenced at about 5am and concluded at about 9am.  
     
      
    5 The searching officers seized a considerable number of items from the premises and the motor vehicle, details of which were entered by Senior Constable Telfer into a Fields Exhibit Book. Senior Constable Telfer retained custody of the various items for a time. Later, an independent officer, Acting Inspector Wright, Detective Constable McDonald and Senior Constable Telfer went to a nearby property at Lakemba. Prior to the search commencing, the accused's wife, Ms Wisudo and her child had been taken at their request to Ms Wisudo's mother's place. They were escorted there by two female officers. Ms Wisudo was at her mother's place when the police officers called shortly after 9am on 8 November 2005.  
     
      
    6 Ms Wisudo signed each page of the property seizure exhibit form and was given a copy of the forms. The seized items were then taken to Bankstown Police Station, entered into the Bankstown Police Station exhibit book and retained there.  
     
      
       
      The present applications by notice of motion dated 4 July 2008 
       
      
    7 Khaled Cheikho has by his notice of motion, sought to challenge or exclude various pieces of evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown at trial. These related, in a number of instances, to evidence sought to be led not only against Khaled Cheikho but against other of the accused as well. The present applications, however, relate to two specific areas involving only Khaled Cheikho. The first identified aspect seeks to exclude a statement made by the accused shortly after he had been cautioned and arrested on 8 November 2005. The statement appears at page 4 of Exhibit “A”. Detective Gawel had explained to the accused that the police were then conducting a forensic procedure in the premises. He told the accused that ""when they come out the premises will be sealed and then we'll wait for the return of the forensic examination"". At this stage, the accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [ARABIC]  
        Did Howard ever tell you this, did that cock sucking mother fucker tell you this. Tell him from me, tell him, tell him the guy that you raided at 2 o'clock told you to get fucked. Tell him I told you to...told you to go and get fucked Howard you motherfucker. Tell him I swear by Allah [ARABIC] you fear me not, you have put no fear in my heart, no fear [ARABIC] with all thanks to Allah (ind) destroy the wrongdoers. The annihilator of the tyrants and of the infidels. This is who we worship, who do you worship, Howard and the legislations. Your democracy full of hypocrisy. Is that it? We worship Allah [ARABIC] Sharia law is gonna prevail throughout this land, it's gonna be ruled by it, you tell Howard this, tell him, Islam is gonna rule this land. Sharia law, Sharia law you poofter, Sharia law, go and learn about it because you're gonna be ruled by it, this is a promise by Allah. The prophets (ind) promised us... said the land, all the lands, all the lands, is Allah's land, Allah created it and he's given it to the Muslims and the Muslims are gonna rule in it. By Allah's law, the one and only law that's worthy, worthy or ruling mankind, no democracy rubbish. It's full of shit. So you tell Howard this and pass it on to Bush the motherfucker. Tell him Abu Mosayed is gonna come and chop him up.  
         
         
        DG: 
         Who, sorry? 
         
         
        KC: 
         Abu Mosayed hopefully because (ind) they're the champions. Is it wrong to say that, fuck youse”.  
        
       
      
    8 (Detective Sergeant Gawel agreed that the second reference to Sharia law in the text was a remark by him, repeating the expression Khaled Cheikho had used). 
     
      
    9 Khaled Cheikho argues that the statement is not relevant to any fact in issue in the trial. Secondly, his lawyers, Messrs Waterstreet and Lange, argue that the evidence, if relevant, is inadmissible pursuant to s 84 of the Evidence Act, or that it ought to be excluded pursuant to ss 90, 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    10 The second area of attack focused upon s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. This section was sought to be applied to exclude, firstly, the statement made by Khaled Cheikho referred to in the last paragraph. The ""significant breaches"" of the law identified were (a) failure to inform the accused of his rights pursuant to s 23G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and (b) a failure to accord the accused a right to be present while the search of the premises and vehicle was undertaken. 
     
      
    11 Secondly, s 138 of the New South Wales Evidence Act was sought to be relied upon to exclude all the material seized from both the premises and the motor vehicle. There were identified, however, specific ""breaches"" by the police in relation to the four computer hard drives and the CDs taken from the premises. On the assumption that these items were not ""seized"" within the terms of the warrant, but were removed for subsequent examination pursuant to the powers in s 3K(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the police had failed to comply with the legislation in the following respects: First, neither the accused nor his wife, as occupiers, were informed of the place and time at which the ""examination"" of the items was to be carried out. Secondly, they were not allowed, as a consequence, to be present at the subsequent examination, whenever it occurred (ss 3K(3)(a) and (b) Crimes Act 1914). Thirdly, neither the occupiers nor their representatives were given an opportunity to be present when the application for an extension of the examining period was sought and granted on 10 November 2005 (s 3K(3B) Crimes Act 1914). Fourthly, the application for an extension of time was not made by the ""executing officer"" but by another police officer and, as a consequence, the extension granted was invalid. (Section 3K(3B)). Fifthly, in relation to the CDs (as opposed to the hard drive), the police took no steps whatsoever to comply with the provisions of s 3K at all.  
     
      
    12 In relation to all items seized, the submissions of the accused (in their final form) identified the following further alleged breaches: First, use of the wrong property seizure form (a New South Wales form rather than one designed to reflect the items taken after a Federal search); service (if it occurred at all) of an imperfect occupiers form. Thirdly, there was a failure to allow either Khaled Cheikho or his wife to be present (as occupiers) during the search. Fourthly, there was a failure to show a copy of the warrant to Ms Wisudo, and, finally, inappropriate procedures had been adopted in relation to Ms Wisudo and the signing of the Property Seizure document.  
     
      
       
      The facts surrounding the matters involved in the applications 
       
      
    13 The original search warrants were issued by Ian Peebles, an issuing officer within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1914. The warrant recites the issuing officer's satisfaction that, by information on oath, there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that ""evidential material"" as defined in the Crimes Act 1914 would be present at unit 3, 63 Taylor Street, Lakemba. The warrant recites that the ""evidential material"" satisfied all of three stipulated conditions. The first was that the evidential material (being a thing relevant to an indictable offence) included some 62 items, which related to one or more of 31 persons or businesses (including Khaled Cheikho himself). The third “satisfied” condition was that, in relation to those items, there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that they would afford evidence as to the commission of certain stated terrorism offences. The “things” stipulated included Internet files and/or print-outs; political, extremist and/or religious propaganda; and photographs, videos, CDs, DVDs or other imagery. It also included personal computers, magnetic and digital storage media. It extended to any “of these stored on a computer or on a computer storage device”.  
     
      
    14 The premises warrant authorised Federal Agent Hunt to carry out a number of the functions generally authorised under s 3F of the Crimes Act 1914. These included entering the premises, searching for and recording fingerprints found at the premises, and taking samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes. It extended to searching the premises for any evidential material that satisfied all of the three conditions referred to in the warrant, and to seize any such evidential material that might be found. It also authorised the executing officer to seize any “other thing” found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer for the constable assisting believed, on reasonable grounds, to be evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant related. The warrant also authorised ordinary searches and frisk searches of any person who was at or near the premises in the circumstances outlined in the warrant. The warrant asserted, in its terms, that a statement of the rights of the occupier of the premises was attached to the warrant. The warrant was in force for a period of seven days and permitted execution ""at any time"".  
     
      
    15 A statement from Federal Agent Hunt shows that he had been in attendance at the Downing Centre Court complex Liverpool Street on 7 November 2005 where he obtained search warrants in relation to some 14 premises and 19 motor vehicles. On the same day he signed over the search warrants for the subject premises to Detective Senior Constable Robert George. A statement from D S C Robert George shows that on the evening of 7 November 2005, George had attended a briefing at the New South Wales Crime Commission. He spoke to some of the warrant holders and signed over the warrants for the subject premises to Detective Sergeant McDonald. Later he and a number of other policemen attended the Westmead area where there was a detailed briefing regarding the proposed execution of all the search warrants.  
     
      
    16 In attendance at this briefing were Detective Sergeant McDonald and Detective Sergeant David Gawel. The latter is attached to the investigation unit of the Counter-Terrorism Coordination Command of the New South Wales Police Force. The statements of the two police officers, McDonald and Gawel, confirmed that they were actively involved in the extensive briefing process that took place on the evening of 7 November 2005 at the New South Wales Police Campus, Westmead. It was D S Gawel's understanding that he was would be responsible for the arrest and taking into custody of Khaled Cheikho. D S McDonald would be responsible for the conduct of the search itself.  
     
      
    17 After the conclusion of the general briefing at Westmead, D S Gawel conducted a more specific briefing with the members of the search team in relation to the specifics of the premises at 3/63 Taylor Street, Lakemba. He also discussed other issues relating to a police operation then known as ""Strike Force Hammerli"". Following this briefing, D S Gawel, in company with Detective Ryan Malcolm and Plainclothes Constable Telfer travelled to the Enfield area. There, they had a final briefing with the search warrant team. Officers from the Forensic Services Group took a control swab for explosives from DS Gawel and other nominated members of the search team. Once this task was completed, the entire search team then travelled to the vicinity of Taylor Street, Lakemba.  
     
      
    18 According to the statement by DSC Ryan Malcolm, the officers involved in the search warrant team included the following: 
     
      
       
      Inspector Peter Wright (independent officer) 
       
      Detectives Neil and Bevan (video officers) 
       
      SC Telfer (exhibits officer) 
       
      Officers Hunt and Jones (searching officers) 
       
      Sergeants Jones, Hamilton, SC Thompson and Constable Rowney (forensic officers) 
       
      FAs Nahmius and Moss. 
       
      
    19 Also assisting in the execution of the warrant were Sergeants Finley, Roach, Skeffington and Senior Constables Lee, Seirota, Petheram, and Tull from the Operational Support Group.  
     
      
    20 According to Ryan Malcolm's statement, the team arrived, comprising about 20 persons, at 3/63 Taylor Street, Lakemba, about 2.30am. The statement reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 2.30am I have, along with the rest of the search warrant team, approached the front door of the premises at 3/63 Taylor Street, Lakemba. Detective Sergeant McDonald has knocked on the front door, identified himself verbally as a police officer and asked if someone could open the door. I heard a male voice from inside the premises reply...Khaled Cheikho has opened the main front door, with the security door remaining closed and locked. Detective Sergeant McDonald informed the occupants that he was a police officer and that he had a warrant to search the house... 
        
       
       
        
        7. Mr Cheikho opened the security door and walked out on to the landing. Two OSG officers, Detective Sergeant Gawel and myself approached Mr Cheikho. 
         
         
          
          I said, 'Khaled, I'm Senior Constable Ryan Malcolm of the New South Wales Police Counter-Terrorism Command. You are now under arrest under section 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code - acts in preparation for a terrorist act. Do you understand that?' 
          
         
         
          
          Khaled Cheikho said, 'No.' 
          
         
         
          
          Detective Sergeant Gawel said, 'Khaled, I'm Detective Sergeant Gawel from the New South Wales Police Counter-Terrorism Command. Do you understand you are under arrest?' 
          
         
         
          
          Khaled Cheikho said, 'No.' 
          
         
         
          
          Detective Sergeant Gawel said, 'Do you understand you are not free to go?' 
          
         
         
          
          Khaled Cheikho said, 'No.'“ 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 In his statement Detective Sergeant Gawel said that Khaled Cheikho was then handcuffed and was surrounded by four police officers. A number of other police were standing in the near vicinity. Detective Sergeant Gawel formed the opinion that Khaled Cheikho could clearly understand him and was aware that he was not free to go.  
     
      
    22 Detective Gawel then said to Khaled Cheikho: 
     
      
       
        
        “Khaled, what we intend to do is to have a female officer enter the house and get your wife and child out. Then some forensic police will enter and conduct a forensic procedure.” 
        
       
      
    23 Khaled Cheikho said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No way, get fucked, no one is going into my house, motherfucker.” 
        
       
      
    24 Detective Gawel then administered the usual police caution to Khaled Cheikho. A female officer then entered the house and a short time later this officer, in company with a female and child, came out of the house. Officers Gawel, Malcolm and McDonald then entered the house and ensured that there were no other persons within the premises. They then left the house to enable forensic officers to set about starting the implementation of forensic procedures. By this time the video operator had commenced operating the video camera and statements made by Khaled Cheikho were recorded on video cassette. The transcript of the video recording statement indicates that the video-taking commenced at 2.46am. DS Gawel introduced himself and Detective Malcolm, presumably for the benefit of the video camera. At that time police officers appeared to be ""frisking"" the accused. The accused said, ""Loosen my hands first...loosen my handcuffs before I talk."" DS Gawel said the handcuffs would be loosened when they had finished the search. (This was explained later as a reference to the frisk search.) Almost immediately after the ""complaint” about the handcuffs, a police officer asked the accused which handcuff felt tight, to which the accused replied ""both of them"". There was then a pause while the handcuffs were loosened.  
     
      
    25 Khaled Cheikho then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me take my glasses off, I've gotta have lenses, I can't see. I can't see with these glasses.” 
        
       
      
    26 Detective Gawel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We can fix it up very shortly. Just wait until the handcuffs are sorted out.” 
        
       
      
    27 The accused's behaviour then took a turn for the worse. Presumably he thought police were talking to one of his family members. He called out angrily: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hey, no one can talk to her, don't talk with no slut...you leave her alone, you fuckin' dogs.” 
        
       
      
    28 (During this conversation, the police were still trying to adjust the handcuffs.)  
     
      
    29 The accused continued his disruptive behaviour. He shouted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hey don't get called by a little mouth that fuckin' bitch, they're all fuckin' enemies.” 
        
       
      
    30 Detective Gawel asked the accused to restrain himself but to no avail. The following conversation then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        KC: 
         Fuck you, you left me...I don't know what the fuck you're doin' in my house, you bastards. 
         
         
        DG: 
         Okay when your handcuffs are changed I'll explain to you. 
         
         
        KC: 
         I don't want to hear nothing, I'm not listening poofter. 
         
         
        DG: 
         ...exactly what is going on. 
         
         
        KC: 
         Fuck you and your John Howard, the fuckin' motherfucker. 
         
         
        M: 
         I've just got one more cuff to do if you just stand still, it's a bit easier for us okay and easier for you okay. 
         
         
        KC: 
         What are you gonna, are you gonna restrict us from hating youse, we hate youse you motherfuckers. Justify your laws you bastards. 
         
         
        DG: 
         Are you comfortable now, Khaled, are you comfortable? 
         
         
        KC: 
         Nuh, they're even tighter. 
         
         
        DG: 
         The police here have assured me that they're looser. 
         
         
        KC: 
         No they're tight.” 
        
       
      
    31 In his oral evidence D S Gawel said that he looked at the handcuffs on the accused and concluded that they had been loosened, and that they were not too tight. He did not believe the accused was telling the truth when he made the second complaint about the handcuffs (transcript 2282). 
     
      
    32 Detective Gawel then attempted to explain the search warrant to the accused. The accused's behaviour did not improve to any marked degree during this discussion. For example, D S Gawel administered a further caution and asked whether the accused understood that. The accused responded ""use what you want to use, you use it anyway you poofter"". D S Gawel then explained that it would be necessary to carry out the forensic procedures before a proper search of the premises could begin. The forensic officers were identified for the video and it was shortly after this, during a lull, that the accused made the statement that is the subject of this first application for exclusion.  
     
      
    33 Sometime later, the handcuffs were changed once again. This time the accused was handcuffed with his hands in front of him rather than behind him. By then it was raining, and the rain increased in heaviness as the morning wore on. Detective Gawel said that he had endeavoured to keep the accused out of the rain by keeping him on the porch where he was largely under cover. The accused however, was not allowed access to the premises while the forensic team were conducting their procedures.  
     
      
    34 At approximately quarter past three, or perhaps a little later, D S McDonald, laboriously and slowly, read to the accused the full details of the premises search warrant. At the conclusion of the reading, D S McDonald said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences to which this warrant relates are those specified above in the third condition and you actually have a copy of the warrant which dictates your rights as an occupier.” 
        
       
      
    35 (The reading of the warrant had included a full reading of all the conditions, including the third condition.) 
     
      
    36 The conversation then continued as follows:

        DG: 
         (ind) just (ind) here.

         (ind) real life unfortunately, seeing pigs in real life. Never had the misfortune (ind). You got 'em of all ages, shapes and sizes, species.” 
        
       
      
    37 Detective Gawel said that he did not recall the last part of this conversation, but agreed that although he was there as part of the search team, he was there “to interview Mr Cheikho”. He agreed Cheikho, on the video, appeared to have asked whether he could contact his solicitor. Detective Gawel indicated that his practice was that when a person is placed under arrest, he or she is conveyed back to a police station and put into custody. Once a person is lodged into custody, he is then allowed to contact support people and legal representatives. Detective Gawel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was not our purpose at that search warrant to interview him, other than to simply undergo the execution of the search warrant.” 
        
       
      
    38 Detective Gawel maintained that he did give the accused the right to contact friends or lawyer, but agreed this did not happen until around 7am after the accused had been taken back to the police station. He said, however: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was not my intention to interview him at that time, nor was it an appropriate place for those conversations to occur...my recollection of those conversations was simply informing him of the processes that were occurring and to be fair to him.” 
        
       
      
    39 Detective Gawel insisted that he had not deliberately refrained at the premises from telling the accused he had a right to contact a friend or a lawyer. He said it simply was not appropriate to do so at that point of time, and at that place. Detective Gawel said he specifically refrained from asking any questions in relation to the offences for which the accused was charged. Detective Gawel admitted that he was not familiar with s 23G of the Crimes Act, but he said that s 10C of the State legislation was very similar.  
     
      
    40 Another matter that was put to Detective Gawel in cross-examination was an examination of why it was that he did not allow the accused to be present “when the search took place”. D S Gawel conceded he was not aware of the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), but he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I gave consideration to fairness to the accused. The detention after arrest, and the current conditions under which he was situated, being outside with a great deal of rain, and it being unfair for him to remain there, not knowing how long it was going to be before we could actually execute the search warrant.” 
        
       
      
    41 Detective Gawel said he had to consider the four-hour detention issue, and he also had to consider whether the accused would be charged. He had no real idea when Forensic Services would be back so they could continue the warrant. He did not know how long he would have to remain there with the accused outside. In addition, the accused indicated that he wished to go to the toilet, and wished to pray. The current situation, where he was, was not acceptable to the accused. Weighing all that up together, D S Gawel decided that the accused should be taken away from the premises, given an opportunity to go to the toilet, and to pray if he wished. He would be placed in custody and then given the opportunity to contact friends and/or a lawyer. That done, the task awaiting Detective Gawel would be to conduct an interview with Khaled Cheikho at the police station. The officer said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “…the correct situation where he was unacceptable to him. Weighing all of that up, I thought about his concerns, and we went in favour of what was right for him”. 
        
       
      
    42 The next matter to be dealt with is the situation relating to the accused's wife and child. 
     
      
    43 Detective Senior Constable Sharon Neil provided a statement. This officer indicated that, while forensic police were inside the premises, Khaled Cheikho was being detained by police on the driveway. At this time, investigators spoke with Cheikho, and S C Neil commenced recording the conversations by way of hand-held video recorder. The statement continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sometime later Detective Senior Constable Bevern took over video recording and I escorted Khaled Cheikho's wife and child on foot to a nearby premises.” 
        
       
      
    44 (These were premises occupied by Ms Wisudo's mother at Garrong Road, Lakemba). 
     
      
    45 DC Neil was then conveyed back to Unit 3, 63 Taylor Street by Detectives Jones and Hunt. Accompanying the women to the Garrong Street premises was Federal Agent Carolyn Moss. It was she who had first brought Ms Wisudo and her child from the house to the area of the driveway in front of the premises. 
     
      
    46 FA Moss’ statement indicates that Ms Wisudo and her child were escorted to her mother's place at about 4am on that day.  
     
      
    47 In his second statement (18 August 2008) D I McDonald indicates that Ms Wisudo, her child and the accused, were outside the premises awaiting clearance from the Forensic Services Group to enable the search proper to commence. While they were awaiting this clearance, it commenced raining. Apparently, there was limited shelter at the location to provide cover from the rain. Although D I McDonald cannot recall any specific conversation with Ms Wisudo, it was determined at some point that she could attend a friend's premises nearby to shelter her and her son from the weather. The statement adds: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the time of night, assistance was provided by police to escort Ms Wisudo and her son safely to those premises.” 
        
       
      
    48 And later the statements recites: 
     
      
       
        
        “I recall Ms Wisudo was escorted from the premises due to concern for her and her son, due to the time of night, the inclement weather and lack of reasonable shelter and amenities”. 
        
       
      
    49 So far as I am able to ascertain, the video recording does not appear to capture any conversation between the police and Ms Wisudo relating to the decision to attend her mother's premises. There is a conversation in Arabic in which Ms Wisudo told her husband “she and the child were going with the police”. There is no evidence, or at least no witness has any recollection, as to whether Ms Wisudo was shown a copy of the warrant before she left the vicinity. There was a tape change at about 3.46am. There is a reference to the situation after the tape change. This appears on the video and is captured on the transcript. The transcript records the following conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        P McC: 
         The time is approximately 3.50am and just for the purpose of the video - we're just going to swap video operators - we just require the services of a female officer to assist in an operational aspect of this warrant. Video is going to be taken over by detective... 
        
       
       
        
        DB: 
         Bevern. 
         
         
        M: 
         ...Bevern. Right. 
         
         
        P McC: 
         Khaled, just for your information, your wife and child are going to be escorted away from her around to her mother's place. You understand? It's going to be two female officers who are going to take her away. Okay? The time is approximately 3.52am.” 
        
       
      
    50 The search proper began at about six minutes past five in the morning. The first area searched was the garage area attached to the unit. The independent observer, Acting Inspector Wright, was present during this part of the search. Neither Khaled Cheikho nor his wife were, by this time, present. Khaled Cheikho had been taken away at about 4.50am to Surry Hills Police Station. He was taken there by DS Gawel and other police. The transcript shows at approximately 4.40am, while the police were waiting for the forensic procedures to be finalised, Khaled Cheikho had first complained that he wanted to go to the toilet. He also said he wanted to pray. The police indicated to him that he would not be able to enter the house for these purposes, although they indicated he was free to pray outside if he wished. It was at that point of time that Detective Gawel apparently made the decision to take the accused to the police station. The transcript records on page 16 Detective Gawel saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “We're going to take you into town. We can't have you standing out in the rain, so (ind) and you can pray here (ind) [ 
        VOICES ARE DROWNED OUT BY SOUND OF RAIN 
        ].” 
        
       
      
    51 It appears by 4.54am, the accused had been taken away by Detective Gawel. Forensic Services, however, were continuing with their examination of the property and the police were still awaiting for the “all clear” to commence the search. As I have said, at approximately five or six minutes past five, the “all clear” was given for the search to commence in the garage area.  
     
      
    52 The seizures made at the garage included a number of items, including documents in both English and Arabic. There is no need for me to detail all the documents found. They are itemised in the Property Seizure Exhibit Form as items 1 to 6 inclusive (see Exhibit “A”). A few examples will give the flavour of the first set of seizures. There were, for example, two cassette tapes marked ""Basrah - the War on Terror"", six pages of handwritten documents titled ""The Fundamentals of Islam"", documents from Sydney newspapers relating to reports on terrorism, articles written in Arabic with pictures referring to war and conflict outside of Australia, two 90 minute TDK audio tapes and an exercise book with Arabic symbols on it. Finally, mention may be made of a white plastic garbage bag containing numerous documents and books relating to “terrorism” and al-Qaeda.  
     
      
    53 The search of the house began shortly afterwards. The independent officer was present throughout. First there was a video walk through which gave an overall perspective of the unit. The searching officers had changed gloves, and the searching appears to have formally commenced in the house around 6am, or shortly after. D S Neil for example, found her first item at 6.19am. D C Jones made his first seizure at about 6.20am 
     
      
    54 Shortly before these first seizures in the house, and immediately before the overall video perspective of the unit was undertaken, D I McDonald is transcribed as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “...as indicated before, we don't have any of the occupiers present due to the fact that one of them has been under arrest and the, been placed under arrest, and Mrs Cheikho has declined to be present. We have the independent here with us at this time.” 
        
       
      
    55 I infer from these statements, which were also captured on the video, that Ms Wisudo had been given the opportunity to be present at the search but, for perfectly understandable reasons, had declined to be present. It is proper to infer that she was concerned about her child and preferred to be with her mother in all the circumstances. The accused's mother-in-law, Rabiah Hutchinson, gave evidence on the voir dire. Ms Hutchinson confirmed that her daughter and grandchild were brought to her house in the early hours of 8 November 2005. Ms Hutchinson says this occurred at ""2 o'clock in the morning"", although the evidence clearly indicates that Ms Hutchinson was wrong by two hours. She lived approximately 20 minutes walk away from the accused's premises.  
     
      
    56 There was no suggestion in the cross-examination of Detective Inspector McDonald, or in the evidence of Ms Hutchinson, to suggest that an opportunity had not been given to Ms Wisudo as the occupier or the occupier’s representative to be present during the search. I infer from the whole of the evidence that such an opportunity was presented to Ms Wisudo, but that she, for perfectly proper reasons, declined to accept the offer. Indeed, it is clear that, at the conclusion of the search, the police treated Ms Wisudo as the occupier of the premises. She was the person who was asked to, and in fact did, sign the property seizure forms. It appears, however, that prior to the accused's removal to Surry Hills Police Station, he had been treated as the occupier because he was the one served with the warrant and the occupier's rights document. The principal warrant had been carefully and laboriously read out to him, word for word. It is open to infer that Ms Wisudo would have seen and heard this procedure, or at least a considerable part of it. The accused had also been given a copy of the vehicle warrant. Detective Inspector McDonald was unable to recall however, whether Ms Wisudo had been served with a copy of the search warrant or an occupier's rights document, and it is possible, I infer, that she may not have been served. As I have said, the search of the unit commenced, in a practical sense, at about 6.20am. The video and the transcript indicate the detail of the procedures that were followed and identify also material that was seized. The full detail of this is once again contained in the Property Seizure Exhibit Form. The items seized from the house are numbered 7 to 42.  
     
      
    57 It seems that there was a computer specialist from the AFP present at the search of the unit. His name was Jarred Murphy. He was introduced on the video tape (see transcript page 30). D I McDonald introduces him as a computer specialist “whose task is to have a look at the computer system in the unit”. During the search a hard drive was located (at 6.32am) on the bottom shelf of a bookcase in a living room extension. The Property Seizure Exhibit Form indicates that this was seized from the computer room by Officer Jones. A second computer hard drive and 33 compact discs were seized at approximately 7.23am from the computer room by Officer Hunt. Fifty-nine compact discs stored in a CD holder were also seized by Officer Neil at 7.26am. There were a further 30 compact discs in various cases seized at the same time. A third hard drive was located by Officer Neil in the children's bedroom at about 7.36am. It appears this was also seized. A fourth computer hard drive was found in the main bedroom by Officer Neil. This was seized at about 7.50am. Weaponry of various kind was found and seized, including a samurai sword and a Colt Double Eagle gas pellet firearm with silencer and other related equipment. A machete was found in the main bedroom. There were a considerable number of other documents but it is unnecessary to detail these for present purposes. A set of keys was located in the lounge room at 8.51am. Three items were seized from the motor vehicle.  
     
      
    58 The search concluded at about 9am. The premises were then secured. The exhibits were handed over to the Exhibits Officer and taken to his vehicle.  
     
      
    59 After the conclusion of the search warrant, the field Exhibit Book was taken by SC Telfer and given to the independent officer Acting Inspector Wright. It appears he examined it, no doubt to make sure that the entries in it had been made correctly. D S McDonald then made contact by phone with Ms Wisudo who directed him to the address in Garrong Street, Lakemba. Mr McDonald, Acting Inspector Wright and S C Telfer then drove to the address in Lakemba where Ms Wisudo had been taken. There is a dispute about what happened at the front door of those premises.  
     
      
    60 According to D S McDonald's statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “At this time, A/Inspector Wright had with him the Field Exhibit Book. This was handed to Ms Wisudo who appeared to go through the record of the items seized. Ms Wisudo then signed the Property Seizure Form/Exhibit Form and was given a copy of the forms.” 
        
       
      
    61 Acting Inspector Peter Wright made a statement on 31 December 2005. He states: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. At the conclusion of the search of the premises I ensured that the premises was locked and secured prior to operational police leaving the scene. I then travelled to another premises not far from the site of the search, where I requested to speak with Mrs Cheikho. I was sternly informed that Islamic women do not take their husband's name. I was informed that Mrs Cheikho preferred to be addressed as 'Ms Wisudo'. 
        
       
       
        
        10. I then showed Ms Wisudo the entries in the Field Exhibit/Property Seizure Forms numbered A68026-A68029 and explained to her that the items recorded in that document were items of interest seized from her home in compliance with the search warrant. Ms Wisudo read each entry of the document provided and, after having checked the entries quite carefully, signed the bottom of each page of the documents acknowledging receipt of a copy of the property lists. I then countersigned each entry witnessing Ms Wisudo signature.” 
        
       
      
    62 Regrettably, neither Inspector Wright nor Ms Wisudo were available to give evidence about the dispute that arose concerning these matters. The dispute centred upon the evidence of Rabiah Hutchinson, the mother-in-law of Khaled Cheikho. Ms Hutchinson gave evidence that her daughter had been quite distraught when she came to the house in the early hours of the morning. She said her grandson was “in shock”. Later at about nine o'clock there was ""banging on the door"". Ms Wisudo said she was asked if Mrs Cheikho was there. She said she remembered very clearly that she told them that there wasn't any such person as Mrs Cheikho as Muslim women do not take their husband's name. Her daughter’s name, she told the police, was Rahmah Wisudo. According to Ms Hutchinson, there were two men at the door. One was an older man with grey hair. The other one (presumably D I McDonald) did not speak. The older man said he had to speak to Ms Wisudo personally. She had covered herself (as had Ms Hutchinson) and came to the door. The transcript of 26 August 08 records Ms Hutchinson saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The older officer proceeded to say that he had come with her keys and he had them, the keys in one hand and some sort of pad in the other, and he said, 'If you want these' and he is jangling the keys, 'you have to sign this'. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What took place after that?  
         
         
        A. When I asked him what it was, he said 'I'm not speaking to you, ma'am, I'm speaking to her.' And he said this was a list of things that were in her house and to enable her to receive the keys back, she had to sign them. 
         
         
         
        Q Did she say anything or do anything after that?  
         
         
        A. She said, 'Mama, what do I do? What should I do?' Because we'd had no previous experience with the law I told her, 'I don't really know, but if you want your keys, I suggest you sign it.' And without reading it and I remember this quite clearly, because I have very poor eyesight, I can't read without my reading glasses and my daughter has always worn contact lenses, I didn't have my reading glasses and neither did she have her contact lenses. 
         
         
         
        Q. So did she sign? 
         
         
        A. She signed it and we were given a green copy.” 
        
       
      
    63 Ms Hutchinson maintained that neither she nor her daughter really understood what it was that was signed. Ms Hutchinson thought they had written everything down that was in the house. She didn't realise it was things that had been taken away and apparently belonged to her daughter and husband. Ms Hutchinson volunteered: 
     
      
       
        
        “The copy we received was illegible. It couldn't be read.” 
        
       
      
    64 Senior counsel for the Crown cross-examined Ms Hutchinson. He asked her whether she recalled the officer (at the door) saying to her daughter that those items had been seized under a search warrant that was executed on the premises. Ms Hutchinson answered non-responsively: 
     
      
       
        
        “We actually never saw any search warrant or were given any copy of a search warrant.” 
        
       
      
    65 Ms Hutchinson then denied recalling the particular statement being made by the police officer at the door. It was suggested to her that she was, in effect, not telling the truth about the alleged conversation, but she adhered to her evidence. She did not recall her daughter appearing to read the forms she had been asked to sign. She denied that her daughter “appeared to read” the documents before signing them. She agreed, however, that her daughter had asked her what she should do (as to signing the document) in the presence of the two officers standing at the front door.  
     
      
    66 Inspector McDonald was cross-examined about the alleged conversation at the front door. He was recalled to give evidence on 26 August 2008. 
     
      
    67 The relevant cross-examination is reasonably brief. It commences at transcript 2329: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you went there with Inspector Wright and Detective Telfer? 
         
         
        A. That's correct, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Detective Telfer had with him the property seizure exhibit form book? 
         
         
        A. I believe Inspector Wright had custody of the book and-- 
         
         
         
        Q. And the three of you went to the premises after you say you made a phone call to Ms Wisudo? 
         
         
        A. That's correct, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And all three of you went into the house? 
         
         
        A. No, I believe only myself and Inspector Wright approached the front door. We didn't actually - I don't recall going into the house, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. Okay. And what took place then? 
         
         
        A. I believe, or I recall that Inspector Telfer showed Ms Wisudo the property seizure document and went through the list and asked her to sign it. 
         
         
         
        Q. And did Ms Wisudo appear to read it? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall. I believe she may have. 
         
         
         
        Q. You said in your statement she handed it - Wright had it with him in his field exhibit book. This was handed to Ms Wisudo, who appeared to go through the record of the items seized? 
         
         
        A. Yeah, that is right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And then she signed it and was given a copy? 
         
         
        A. That's correct, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Would you agree with me that the book contains different coloured pages representing copies for the occupier and copies to be maintained in the book? 
         
         
        A. That's right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And do you agree that the one given to Ms Wisudo was green, does that ring a bell? 
         
         
        A. I couldn't recall offhand at this time, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. To your knowledge Ms Wisudo had exited her own premises some hours before? 
         
         
        A. That's correct, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And do you recall Ms Wisudo being accompanied by another woman when you were at the front door? 
         
         
        A. I believe there was another person there, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And were they all dressed in traditional burkas? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall. I believe Ms Wisudo may have been. I don't know if the other person was. 
         
         
         
        Q. I want to suggest to you that neither Ms Wisudo or any other woman who appeared to be occupying those premises read the exhibit form that was offered to them? 
         
         
        A. They appeared to go through the document and look through it. 
         
         
         
        Q. Can I just show you a copy of the exhibit of what is called the property seizure exhibit form in handwriting. (Document shown.) Do you recognise that as the copy of what it was allegedly shown to Ms Wisudo? 
         
         
        A. It appears so. 
         
         
         
        Q. You yourself have not signed it, although your name appears as case officer? 
         
         
        A. No, I haven't signed that, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. And there appears to be under the heading of ""Occupant"", Ms Wisudo has signed it, as has Mr Wright? 
         
         
        A. Yes, that appears so. 
         
         
         
        Q. On the bottom of every page? 
         
         
        A. Yes, that's right. 
         
         
         
        Q. Could you describe - was Mr Wright there when Ms Wisudo was given a copy and asked to sign? 
         
         
        A. Yes, he was. 
         
         
         
        Q. So I just may have misunderstood, was Mr Telfer there? 
         
         
        A. No, I believe Mr Telfer remained with the exhibits at the vehicle. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did Mr Wright - would you describe him as having grey hair? 
         
         
        A. I couldn't recall. 
         
         
         
        Q. But both of you were together when Ms Wisudo and the other woman were given the - or one of them was given the exhibit form? 
         
         
        A. That's right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. One of the items seized by the police was the set of keys for the house itself, if you go to item 43? 
         
         
        A. It only indicates a set of keys. I can't say whether they were the keys for the house or not. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you have the keys for the house? 
         
         
        A. No, I don't recall, from there. 
         
         
         
        Q. You see, this was a raid in which you were the team leader? 
         
         
        A. That's right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And I take it that the occupants were disturbed apparently in their sleep? 
         
         
        A. It would appear so, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you make any arrangements as team leader to give the keys back to the remaining occupant Ms Wisudo? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall any arrangements that were made in that regard. 
         
         
         
        Q. I want to suggest to you that either you or Mr Wright dangled the keys in front of Ms Wisudo and said if she didn't sign the property seizure form she wouldn't get the house keys? 
         
         
        A. That's not correct. 
         
         
         
        Q. You don't recall any house keys being given? 
         
         
        A. That's what I am saying. I don't believe we had any keys, aside from the keys mentioned here. I don't recall having any keys to the premises. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you go into the premises? 
         
         
        A. Which premises? 
         
         
         
        Q. The premises where you got the form signed? 
         
         
        A. I don't believe I did. I don't recall going in, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. All this signing and handing over was all done at the front door? 
         
         
        A. I believe so, yes.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    68 Detective Inspector McDonald was unable to recall whether Ms Wisudo had been given the opportunity to come out and check the forms as against the seized material in the motor vehicle where officer Telfer was seated.  
     
      
    69 The submissions made by Mr Waterstreet do not precisely identify the consequences of the resolution of this dispute in the evidence. I must assume that its only significance is to point to alleged inappropriate behaviour by police officers in their conduct following the completion of the search. For that reason, it is probably unnecessary to try to resolve definitively the dispute, as it is not a critical one in the overall evaluation of the present application. In any event, endeavouring to resolve a dispute in the absence of the two principal witnesses is by no means an easy task. I will, however, venture to a number of observations. 
     
      
    70 With all due respect to Ms Hutchinson, I thought her evidence was more than somewhat contrived. She appeared to want to make a number of points critical of the police. They were, first, that the ""dangling"" of the keys was a ploy to get the documents signed. Why, one might ask, would the police need to engage in a ploy of this kind? The search had been thoroughly and carefully carried out. All the items seized were carefully itemised. It is true that the form was the wrong form, in that it was a New South Wales form rather than a Federal one, but nothing turns on that.  
     
      
    71 Secondly, Ms Hutchinson was keen to introduce into the evidence (although it was ultimately unsuccessful) complaints her daughter had made about the way her husband had been treated by the police. Thirdly, she was keen to paint her daughter and grandchild as severely traumatised by the whole event. Fourthly, she was at pains to emphasise that neither she nor her daughter saw the search warrant, or were given a copy of the search warrant, although this had very little, if anything, to do with the disputed factual situation involved in her evidence. It was a non-responsive answer, in any event, and could not be given any weight. Rather, I thought Ms Hutchison who is clearly a very intelligent woman, was “picking up” on some of the legal points and trying to improve them. 
     
      
    72 Overall, I thought Ms Hutchison presented as a strident supporter of her son-in-law's rights which she believed had been infringed, as had those of her daughter. Loyalty of this kind is, of course, understandable, but it can often lead, as I think it did in this case, to an element of exaggeration. For example, Ms Hutchinson volunteered that the copy document that they had been given was “illegible”. She maintained ""it couldn't be read"". I took this to be a reference to Ms Hutchinson's ability to read the document when she later attempted to do so, wearing her glasses. By any test, however, the property seizure form in evidence is very carefully written out and is, by any standards, easy to read. On the assumption that Ms Hutchinson's “volunteered” comment about the illegibility of the document referred to the inability of both her daughter and herself to read it once the police had gone, it is simply impossible to accept. If she were saying that it was illegible and couldn't be read for that reason immediately it was handed over, this is quite at odds with her evidence that she didn't have her glasses on, and her daughter did not have her contact lenses inserted, at the time the document was handed over.  
     
      
    73 I have not had the advantage of seeing or hearing Inspector Wright give evidence. His statement, however, was in evidence by consent. It paints a very different picture concerning the events at Ms Hutchinson’s home. But I would find it difficult to accept that the independent officer, whose task it was to ensure the propriety of the search, would have acted in the way described by Ms Hutchinson. But, be that as it may, I simply regard her evidence as quite exaggerated, lacking in credibility and, overall, unreliable. These observations are, of course, limited to the very narrow issue involving Ms Hutchinson's evidence in relation to the present voir dire application. They are not meant to be generally critical or dismissive of her, as indeed they could not be, given the limited nature of the dispute. I do not accept, however, that there was any inappropriate behaviour in relation to Ms Wisudo’s signing of the forms at 9am on 8 November 2005. 
     
      
    74 It is now necessary to turn to the events at Surry Hills Police Station where the accused had been taken for his interview. 
     
      
    75 Khaled Cheikho arrived at the police station at about 5.18am. He was entered into custody by Detective Malcolm. There was a delay, however, before the start of the interview. This was due to the number of persons in custody and the limited number of interview rooms. Further, the police were waiting for the arrival of forensic officers to attend and undertake forensic procedures in relation to Khaled Cheikho. To enable compliance with the time constraints of the custody procedures, Detective Malcolm then applied for an extension warrant for Khaled Cheikho's detention. As a result, an extension was granted by Magistrate Albu for a further two hours.  
     
      
    76 Shortly after 9 o'clock that day, Detectives Gawel and Malcolm took Khaled Cheikho to an interview room. Earlier, the accused had been offered an opportunity to speak to Magistrate Albu about the proposed extension. When the phone was handed to him, he said to the magistrate ""I don't want to talk to you"".  
     
      
    77 An interview then took place, following which an independent officer queried the accused as to the propriety of the police conduct during the interview. The full text of the interview is transcribed and is part of the attachment to Detective Malcolm's statement (part of Exhibit “A”). Both a video tape and transcription of the interview are available. A caution was administered by Detective Malcolm. It may be convenient if I set out the text of a number of the questions and summary: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q17. Before I ask you any questions, I am obliged to tell you I intend to ask you further questions in relation to this matter, but before I do, I must caution you that you do not have to say or do anything unless you wish to do so, as anything you do say or do will be recorded and may be later used in evidence. Do you clearly understand the caution I have just given you? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        ... 
         
         
         
        Q20. All right. I must inform you of the following rights. You may communicate with or attempt to communicate with a friend or relative to inform that person of your whereabouts. Do you understand that? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q21. And since your time in custody, have you contacted anyone? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q22. From your family? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q23. And informed them where you are? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q24. Do you wish to communicate with a friend or relative? 
         
         
        A. No. Later. Or you can't any more? 
         
         
         
        Q25. You may communicate with or attempt to communicate with a legal practitioner of your choice and arrange or attempt to arrange for a legal practitioner of your choice to be present during the questioning. Do you understand? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q26. Do you wish to communicate with a legal practitioner? 
         
         
        A. No.  
         
         
         
        Q27. Do you agree, Mr Cheikho, that you have already spoken to a legal practitioner since you have been placed in police custody? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q28. Are you an Australian citizen? 
         
         
        A. No more comments.""  
         
         
        
       
      
    78 From this point on, the accused, as he was entitled to do, refused to comment, participate or answer any questions.  
     
      
    79 Other evidence placed before me confirmed that Khaled Cheikho had been allowed to make a number of telephone calls, and spoke to his wife and his mother. He also spoke to his legal representative, Adam Houda.  
     
      
    80 About 10.37am on 8 November 2005 Khaled Cheikho was escorted from the interview room to another room where a forensic procedure was conducted. A short time later the accused was returned to the Charge Room of the Sydney Police Centre where he was charged under s 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act and then returned to custody.  
     
      
    81 Two days later, in the afternoon of 10 November 2005, Detective Gawel had a conversation with Federal Agent Morley. This conversation related to extension warrants for the examination of the computers seized during the search warrants on 8 November 2005. About 3.20pm that day as a result of that conversation, Detective Gawel attended the Downing Centre Local Court together with a number of federal agents. There he made an application before Mr Peebles, an authorised justice, for an ""extension of time to examine or process a thing"" pursuant to s 3K(3B) of the Crimes Act 1914 for the computers that were in the possession of the New South Wales Police Force. These included four computer hard drives (Khaled Cheikho), a Toshiba laptop computer (Baladjam), a laptop and two hard drives (Elomar), a computer and tower (Jamal), two hard drives (Sharrouf) and a hard drive tower (Touma). These ""applications"" were granted by Mr Peebles at approximately 3.30pm on 10 November 2005. In each case the authority purported to extend time to examine or process the computers in the schedule for a period of 72 hours. So far as Khaled Cheikho's four hard drives were concerned, the application covered each of those.  
     
      
    82 Federal Agent Byron Morley provided a statement. He confirmed that it was he who made an appointment with the Downing Centre Local Court for the purposes of making an application for an extension pursuant to s 3K(3B) of the Crimes Act 1914. He was unable to recall the time he made this appointment. The statement continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. About 12.15 on 10 November 2005, I telephoned Mr Adam Houda. I then stated to Mr Houda words to the effect that the AFP would be attending the Downing Centre Local Court to make an application to obtain an extension of time for the examination of all computers seized during the search warrants conducted on 8 November 2005. In reply, Mr Houda stated words to the effect that he had not received sufficient notice of the application to enable him to attend and consequently he would not be attending.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    83 Mr Waterstreet cross-examined Federal Agent Morley about the events of 10 November 2005. As might be expected, Federal Agent Morley's recollection was hazy as to the details of the day. He was unable to recall, for example, if he personally spoke to Mr Peebles. He did not tell Mr Houda, however, the identity of the magistrate at the Local Court who would be dealing with the application and he did not tell him the time when the application would be made. He agreed he had not served on Mr Houda any application in written form as to the extension of the time. He agreed that he had not been a constable assisting in the search warrant process involving Khaled Cheikho. He believed there was an accompanying affidavit with the application for extensions of time, although he did not believe that he had mentioned the affidavit to Mr Houda when he spoke to him on 10 November 2005. He did not serve either the application or the affidavit on Mr Houda, and he was unaware whether anyone else in the AFP had done so.  
     
      
    84 Federal Agent Morley said that it was his understanding that he sought to extend the time for examination of the removed hard drives in order to ascertain whether there was evidential material on those hard drives. He understood that they were in the possession of either the AFP or the New South Wales Police, but he was not sure exactly where they were. His sole duty really was simply to make the application and to ring Mr Houda. He was aware that, in order to obtain an extension of time, he was under an obligation to inform the magistrate that further time was needed and the reasons why. Further, he understood that it was his task to inform the magistrate that he had told either the person whose houses were searched, the occupier, or his representative that an application was to be made. He could not, however, recall any conversations he had with Mr Peebles and accordingly was unable to recall whether he had told the magistrate that Mr Houda had said that the notification gave him “too little time”.  
     
      
    85 Exhibit 3 on the voir dire was the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Gawel. This was a copy of the affidavit he swore on 10 November 2005 supporting the application for an extension of time in which to examine the four computer hard drives. He described himself as acting ""on behalf of the executing officer under a search warrant issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 in respect of the premises at Unit C/63 Taylor Street, Lakemba, New South Wales."" He said in paragraph 3: 
     
      
       
        
        “The things described above (the four hard drives) were moved from the premises specified above on 8 November 2005 pursuant to the power under s 3K(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
          
        1914 
         to move a thing to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant.” 
        
       
      
    86 The affidavit continued to give a number of grounds on which it was said to be reasonable that an extension of time should be granted. The reasons essentially were the time necessary to examine the data on a modern computer hard drive, and the fact that some of the data “may need to be translated from the Arabic language into the English language”.  
     
      
    87 Exhibit 2 was a written form of application for an extension of time in the name of Federal Agent Morley. It did not relate to the subject hard drives, but was tendered as an example of the type and form of application involved.  
     
      
    88 Detective Gawel was examined in relation to the application for extension. It appears that he had made a number of affidavits for presentation before Mr Peebles. These related to all of the computers, hard drives and computer towers in the possession of the police as a consequence of the search. He said that he swore them on behalf of New South Wales Police for the computers that were in New South Wales Police possession at the time. Although he had attended the search warrant process at Khaled Cheikho's premises, his role really had been in relation to the arrest and subsequent interviewing of Khaled Cheikho after he had been taken into custody.  
     
      
    89 Inspector Paul McDonald was also cross-examined in relation to the extension of time application. The relevant passages appear at transcript 2309, lines 3 to 55: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And the product of the search was set out in the form that exhibit officer Telfer hand wrote? 
         
         
        A. That's right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And that was all - all that product was taken to Bankstown, was it not? 
         
         
        A. Yes, it was. 
         
         
         
        Q. And it remained written into the exhibit book at Bankstown? 
         
         
        A. I believe so, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Two days later you became aware that some of the removed or seized product needed to be inspected to see if it was evidential material? 
         
         
        A. No, I had limited involvement in the investigation following the execution of the warrant. 
         
         
         
        Q. So you-- 
         
         
        A. As I recall. 
         
         
         
        Q. --so you didn't authorise anyone to make an application for extension, did you? 
         
         
        A. Not that I recall, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. I suggest to you that the only person who can make an application for an extension is the executing officer, namely you. Were you aware of that? 
         
         
        A. No, I wasn't. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you become aware even in recent times that someone else had made an application for extension to inspect product removed from Mr Cheikho's premises? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
         
        Q. You don't know one way or the other? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
         
        Q. Are you aware from the documents served on Mr Cheikho that the rights of an occupier are set out on that piece of paper replicating the Crimes Act section 3H, 3K, 3L and 3L(a). They are all set out there? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. As far as you are concerned as at that night, everything that was done by officers executing the warrant for which you were team leader was done pursuant to the Crimes Act, pursuant to these sections? 
         
         
        A. I believe so, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And if someone made an application for extension, you knew nothing about it? 
         
         
        A. No, I don't recall being made aware of any application.” 
        
       
      
    90 And then later at page 2310, lines 45 to 2311 line 47: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now on 3K, that enables equipment to be used to examine or process things, according to the heading. Do you see that? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And 3L allows electronic equipment to be used at the premises? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q. It may include electronic equipment already at the premises belonging perhaps to the occupier? 
         
         
        A. I'm not aware whether that's covered or not. 
         
         
         
        Q. Can I ask you, did you bring any electronic equipment with you in order to look at any data that was kept in the premises? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall bringing any, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. You agree with me that a number of items, according to that exhibit list, were seized that included hard drives? 
         
         
        A. I would have to check, but quite possibly, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. I don't think it's a matter of controversy. I just ask you to accept that the property list shows at least four computers/hard drives-- 
         
         
        A. If it's recorded on the list. 
         
         
         
        Q. --removed. And a number of CDs? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. You would have seen that after this list was completed? 
         
         
        A. I'm sorry?  
         
         
         
        Q. You would have seen this list after it was completed? 
         
         
        A. During and after. 
         
         
         
        Q. And you would see that as it was being compiled and you are aware that those items had been listed and then removed to Bankstown? 
         
         
        A. That's right, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And they included the four, if the list reveals four computer hard drives, you'd accept that? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Now I take it as your understanding none of the computer hard drives were looked at at the premises? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall them being looked at there, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. So while they were at Bankstown, do I understand that you wiped your hands of it, as it were, once they were secured and written into the exhibit book at Bankstown? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. So you did not tell Mr Cheikho or any representative of him that they were at Bankstown? 
         
         
        A. If I can refer to my statement. I don't recall if I informed Miss Wisudo that the items were going to be taken to Bankstown.” 
         
         
         
        Q. And finally, there is an extensive line of questioning between transcript 2312 line 1 to 2315 line 4: 
         
         
        “A. I don't believe so, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. And so she was not informed where the product was taken, as far as you are aware? 
         
         
        A. Well, I can't recall if she was or wasn't. 
         
         
         
        Q. And you never took any further step to inform Mr Cheikho or anyone on his behalf where the product was? 
         
         
        A. I didn't, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. You were aware that at least a hard drive was available to be kept for only 72 hours in order to enable an inspection? 
         
         
        A. Referring to this document, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. 3A? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        Q. Insofar as you were the executing officer, you accept that it was your duty under 3, subs (3), 'The executing officer must, if it is practical to do so, inform the occupier of the place and time at which the examination and processing will be carried out'. Do you see, that 3A(a)? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. But you didn't do it? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
         
        Q. And you see 3B over the page, 'The executing officer', that's you, 'may apply to an issuing officer for an extension', but I think you have already dealt with that. You didn't do that? 
         
         
        A. No, I didn't. 
         
         
         
        Q. And again 3C, 'The executing officer must give notice to the occupier to be heard'. Do you understand that? You didn't do that? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
         
        Q. And I just take you over the page. I ask you to assume that someone made an application for an extension? 
         
         
        A. I'm unaware if that was-- 
         
         
         
        Q. I just ask you to assume that. And you agree that paragraph, subparagraph 9 of section 3L suggests that: 'The provisions of the division relating to the issue of a warrant apply with such modifications as are necessary to the issuing of an extension', do you see that? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And I take it one follows the other, that if you weren't aware of the extension and the time and place where that inspection pursuant to the extension took place, you didn't tell the occupier, Mr Cheikho or anyone on his behalf, when it was inspected? 
         
         
        A. No, I didn't. 
         
         
         
        Q. Or where it was? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
         
        Q. I show you a document purporting to be an affidavit by Mr Gawel. He apparently made an application. He said he made it on your behalf. You didn't instruct him to do it? Just have a look. (Document shown.) 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
         
        WATERSTREET 
         
         
         
        Q. You see, it says he was constable assisting, and on behalf of the executing officer he has to apply for an extension? 
         
         
        A. Yep. 
         
         
         
        Q. He appears to have done that of his own volition? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall speaking to Detective Gawel in relation to this, no. 
         
         
         
        WATERSTREET: 
         I don't know if that was tendered. 
         
         
         
        BELLEW: 
         It wasn't.  
         
         
         
        EXHIBIT #3 affidavit IN support of application for extension of time TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION on the application 
         
         
         
        WATERSTREET 
         
         
         
        Q. In addition to the four hard drives/computers seized, there were a number of VHSs and CDs seized on the exhibit list? 
         
         
        A. Yes, I believe so. 
         
         
         
        Q Did you turn your mind to whether those CDs or VHSs themselves had to be inspected to see whether they themselves had any evidential material on them? 
         
         
         I don't recall anything along those lines, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. I understand that you, as far as the officer in charge was concerned using the New South Wales property seizure records, that what you really did was not turn your mind to the Federal Act s 3K and 3L but instructed your officers to seize material in the way that New South Wales officers seize it? 
         
         
        A. I am unsure of what you actually mean. 
         
         
         
        Q. You see, you accept that hard drives could be taken away if they haven't been inspected on the premises for the purpose of inspecting? 
         
         
        A. Under the auspices of the warrant, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. And under the auspices of the warrants, they, in order to be retained by police, they needed to be inspected to see if they had any evidential material on them? 
         
         
        A. I believe so, yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Do I understand that you, as the warrant holder, understood that your officers were acting pursuant to the procedures under 3K and 3L? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you tell them that not only hard drives and computers needed to be removed for inspection but CDs or VHSs needed to be inspected? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall telling them that, no. 
         
         
         
        Q. Did you turn your mind to it? 
         
         
        A. I don't recall that, no.” 
        
       
       
      The ""Statement"" made by Khaled Cheikho 
       
      
    91 Mr Waterstreet had labelled the statement made by his client shortly after his arrest as “a rant”. I prefer to describe it simply as a statement made by the accused 
     
      
    92 The first point argued was that the statement is not relevant to any fact in issue in the trial. Section 55 of the Evidence Act contains a broadly expressed definition of ""relevance"":  
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    93 One of the cardinal provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 is s 56. In Odgers Uniform Evidence Law 5th Edition at page 114 it is described as “the key provision regarding the admissibility of evidence” in Chapter 3. The section provides: - 
     
      
       
        
        “56(1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    94 As is recognised and stated by the High Court in Smith v The Queen [2001] 206 CLR 650 at 653, the first question to be asked when an issue of the present kind arises is whether the evidence is relevant. Although questions of relevance may raise “nice questions of judgment”, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is either relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. The simple fact is that irrelevant evidence may not be received. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. 
     
      
    95 In determining relevance in a criminal trial, it is important, and indeed fundamental to identify the ultimate issues. These will be ordinarily expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged in the light of the defence, if known. Section 55 of the Evidence Act, as I have said, states that evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. Behind these ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue (Smith at 654; Papakosmos v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 307; 312 and 321-322.96 For present purposes, the facts in issue have been identified by the Crown in the following way: The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused entered into the agreement alleged by the Crown with one or more other persons (physical element); that the accused did so intentionally (fault element); and that the accused, and at least one other party to the agreement, must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement (the intention required by s 11.5(b) of the Criminal Code Act 1995). Further, the accused, or at least one other party to the agreement, must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. (Section 11.5(c) of Criminal Code Act 1995). 
     
      
    97 The material sought to be adduced by the Crown is, in my view, material which, if it were accepted, could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fault elements and the statutory intention I have identified. Section 55 of the Evidence Act is very broadly stated. It is plainly designed to capture as relevant evidence that, logically and reasonably, has the capacity to bear upon the assessment that the jury, properly instructed, will have to make in the light of the issues at trial. At the outset, it may be said that this capacity plainly appears to exist, even by way of first impression. This is so when one examines the nature of the statement and the nature of the Crown case. I have in earlier decisions set out the broad nature of the Crown case. (See R v Baladjam [No 7] at page 2). As I say, even a preliminary reading of the general nature of the Crown’s case would suggest that Khaled Cheikho’s statement is evidence that could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the physical and fault elements I have identified. 
     
      
    98 From the analysis above, it will be seen that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Khaled Cheikho intentionally had entered into the agreement alleged by the Crown. Secondly, Khaled Cheikho and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement. Thirdly, the agreement must be of the kind asserted by the Crown in the indictment, that is an agreement to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. ""A terrorist act"" is defined in s 100.1 of the Criminal Code Act. It comprehends an action or threat of action made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. It must also be an action or threat made with the intention of coercing the government of the Commonwealth, State, territory, et cetera, or made with the intention of intimidating the public or a section of the public. If the agreement entered into by Khaled Cheikho does not relate to acts or threats of that kind, then it is not an agreement to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Consequently, the Crown must address not only the actual intentions of Khaled Cheikho in relation to his actions, but also whether the acts contemplated as the end point of the alleged agreement have the characteristics represented by each of the intentions referred to in s 100.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.  
     
      
    99 All this is a complicated and, no doubt, a rather long-winded way of showing that the statement made by Khaled Cheikho on 8 November 2005 is plainly relevant and therefore admissible under s 56 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    100 Mr Lange's written submissions valiantly sought to whitewash the statement so as to rob it of its natural obvious meaning. Of course, its meaning, whether it constitutes an admission, and whether it carries weight and the like is ultimately a question for the jury. The statement, however, is clearly capable of being read as a number of propositions each of which give considerable insight into the state of mind of the accused relevant to the essential ingredients of the charge against him.  
     
      
    101 First, the statement, if accepted, postulates that the speaker has little respect for the Prime Minister of Australia, and hence the Australian government and its laws. Secondly, it postulates that, despite his arrest in the early hours of the morning, the speaker is not put in fear by the lawful invasion of his home because of the protection of his deity, “the destroyer of infidels”. Thirdly, it is capable of being read as a description of the Islamic God as the annihilator of tyrants and infidels, including the Australian government and its representatives. Fourthly, it postulates a hatred and detestation of Australian democracy and the system of government that underlines Australia (""Who do you worship, Howard...your democracy full of hypocrisy?"") Fifthly, it postulates that some form of Islamic law will ultimately prevail in Australia (""Islam is going to rule this land""). The language is redolent of the medieval crusades, and hearkens back to the battle in ancient times between Christianity and Islam. Sixthly, it postulates that some version of Islamic law promises that the Muslims will eventually rule in Australia, and that the “infidels” will be put down.  
     
      
    102 Clearly these statements by Khaled Cheikho are relevant, not only as bearing on his own state of mind and intentions, but they are also capable of providing considerable insight into the nature of any of the actions he has carried out, including any overt acts alleged pursuant to the agreement. They are also relevant to rebut any defence that he might raise to suggest that he is no more than an adherent of a moderate Islamic cause that is opposed to the unfair treatment of Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere. It is capable, for example, of throwing light on his possession of extremist and fundamentalist material. It is relevant, in that sense, not only as going directly to the essential ingredients of the offence, but also to rebut any proposition that he is simply an Islamic scholar interested in genuine debate about the value of democracy and, by comparison, other forms of government worldwide. It is relevant as demonstrating an attitude to jihad that embraces actual violence, as opposed to merely resolution of the inner soul and spirit, or of conflicts by peaceful means.  
     
      
    103 Mr Lange made two points. First, he said it was no tenet of Sharia law that it looked to the destruction of the kind stated by Khaled Cheikho. That is not to the point. It may well be that his attitude is a perversion of Islam, a perversion of Sharia law, but it is one that is well recognised as being capable of representing a modern hallmark of terrorist ideology. Second, Mr Lange pointed to the fact that the application of Sharia law has been openly and genuinely countenanced in the United Kingdom. Once again, this is hardly to the point. The statement of Khaled Cheikho (or ""the rant"" as his own counsel called it) is no theological discussion. More accurately, I should say that whether it is a theological discussion will be a matter for the jury, but it is certainly capable of being regarded as something much more sinister and unappealing than that.  
     
      
    104 I am satisfied for these reasons that the evidence is relevant, it is highly probative and is consequently admissible. It is certainly prejudicial in the sense that it may dispose the jury to find that the Crown has, together with other evidence, proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. That of course is not the unfair prejudice that is the concern of s 137 of the Evidence Act. For reasons I will give a little later in this decision, I do not consider that ss 135, 137 or 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 require the exclusion of the statement.  
     
      
    105 I turn then to consider s 84 of the Evidence Act. This was considered by me recently in R v Baladjam [No 44]. That decision related to an application on behalf of Omar Jamal. The principles necessary for the Court to determine whether a piece of evidence is made inadmissible by virtue of s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 are set out in that judgment between paragraphs 11 and 16. I will set them out again in this decision.  
     
      
       
      Evidence Act s 84 
       
      
    106 Section 84 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Exclusion of admissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct, whether towards the person who made the admission or towards another person; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a threat of conduct of that kind. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) only applies if the party against whom evidence of the admission is adduced has raised in the proceeding an issue about whether the admission or its making were so influenced.” 
        
       
      
    107 An ""admission"" is defined in the dictionary. It includes a representation which is ""adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceedings"". Accordingly, s 84 is not limited to confessions alone, but is concerned with any statement made by an accused which may be used by the prosecution to the accused's detriment, and can include a lie told by the accused and a statement which might otherwise be regarded as exculpatory (R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; 105 A Crim R 27; R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426; 104 A Crim R 306).  
     
      
    108 Section 84 replicates in part the common law concept that a confession must be voluntary before it can be admitted. Section 84, however, goes further and requires the Court to be satisfied as well that the admission is not influenced by the conduct set out in the section.  
     
      
    109 The thinking behind the proposal on which the provision is based is set out at ALRC 26 volume 1 para 765, page 436: 
     
      
       
        
        “Techniques which are perceived as particularly likely to substantially impair the mental freedom of a suspect may be prohibited, and any evidence produced as a result of them excluded. If interrogators engage in acts of violence, threats of violence, torture or inhuman, degrading or oppressive conduct, then an admission made subsequent to such conduct may be untrue, regardless of the characteristics of the suspect being interrogated.” 
        
       
      
    110 Where the issue is raised, the onus falls upon the Crown to prove the admissibility of the admission. The standard of proof is upon the balance of probabilities (s 142 (1) Evidence Act 1995). Consequently, the Crown must prove to the requisite standard that the conduct referred to in the section, if it occurred, did not influence the making of the admission. In R v Ye Zhang (2000) NSWSC 1099 Simpson J (at 44) observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “...section 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason or a single event or incident or instance of conduct provoking the confession; there may be a number of factors working together, that, combined, cause the admission to be made. If oppressive conduct on the part of police is one of those factors (or, more accurately, if the Crown has failed to negative such conduct as one of those factors) then the evidence is inadmissible.” 
        
       
      
    111 Simpson J's remarks were approved by Hoeben J (with whom Sully and Bell JJ agreed) in Higgins v Regina (2007) NSWCCA 56. At (26) Hoeben J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that s 84 does not require the isolation of a single reason or a single incident of conduct provoking the confession. There may be a number of factors working together ( 
        R v Zhang 
        ...). I also accept that there is no definition of 'oppressive' in the Act and that the concept should not be limited to physical or threatened physical conduct but can encompass mental and psychological pressure. That said, I am firmly of the view that nothing in the bank interview, either on its own or in combination, amounted to 'oppressive conduct' as envisaged by s 84.” 
        
       
      
    112 I will, for the purpose of this decision, accept that the statement made by Khaled Cheikho is capable of being an admission within the meaning of that expression in the Evidence Act 1995. This is a situation where it might clearly be said that the facts intended to be asserted by Khaled Cheikho in the representation are facts directly relevant to essential ingredients in the offence contained in the indictment. Such a situation must result in the representation not only being ""adverse to the interests of the party"", but one which is capable of being caught by s 59, but excepted nonetheless by s 81 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    113 Messrs Waterstreet and Lange submitted that the oppressive conduct centred upon the circumstances of the ""raid"" on the house, the timing of it and the fact that Khaled Cheikho would have been affronted by the situation involving his wife and child. It was exacerbated by his being held outside in the rain, in pain, not told of his rights and being manhandled in front of his wife and child, as outlined in the submissions. In addition, he was not told that he could contact a solicitor or family friend at the time he was arrested and handcuffed.  
     
      
    114 I have given careful consideration to the submissions made by Messrs Waterstreet and Lange on behalf of Khaled Cheikho in relation to the s 84 matter. I must say that the accused's submissions seem to me to be based on an entirely different script from that which I have examined. I accept, of course, that sudden intrusion of a significant number of police officers in the early hours of the morning would provoke distress in any citizen. So too would the fact of arrest. None of these things, of themselves, could be said to be oppressive conduct within the meaning of the section of the Evidence Act. Indeed, I would suggest that a fair reading of the transcript, and a careful examination of the video, demonstrates that, overall, the police handled a difficult situation with considerable tact and courtesy.  
     
      
    115 The accused was handcuffed but this, as I have said, was entirely a matter of discretion for the arresting officers. The accused's behaviour was abusive, offensive and aggressive. It justified, retrospectively, the decision to handcuff the accused. I accept that the handcuffs, when they were initially put on, were tight and uncomfortable. Almost immediately this complaint was made, the handcuffs were loosened. The accused said, after this loosening, that they were even tighter than they had been. Detective Gawel said that he examined the handcuffs and concluded that they were not too tight. He did not believe that the accused was telling the truth when he complained on the second occasion about the handcuffs. I accept this evidence.  
     
      
    116 Later, but not too much later, the handcuffs were changed once again. This time they were applied in such a way that the accused's hands were in front of him rather than behind him. By that time, the accused appeared to have calmed down and was, for a time, less abusive. With the cuffs in this position, the accused was able to move his hands relatively freely and to adjust his glasses as he needed to. He was able to take his glasses off and to wipe his mouth with his hands. While he was handcuffed behind his back, these movements would not have been possible, but I do not consider that his being handcuffed behind his back for a time constituted oppressive conduct. Apart from the first few minutes following the arrest and handcuffing, there were no further complaints by the accused about discomfort related to the handcuffs.  
     
      
    117 Very shortly after his arrest Khaled Cheikho said he could not see with the glasses he was wearing. He said ""let me take my glasses off, I've got to have lenses"". I am not entirely sure whether, as Mr Waterstreet submitted, this meant that the accused was unable to read with his glasses on. It may be that he had reading glasses on and wanted lenses so he could see long distances. It is by no means clear. The complaint did not appear to re-emerge again and I think little significance overall can be placed on the fact that he was not allowed into the house to get his contact lenses. As I say, there was no further complaint about this, even though a number of hours passed. He made no complaint about it when the warrant was read to him and when he was provided with a copy of the warrant. It is true that the accused was kept outside of the premises and that, after a time, it was raining very heavily. So far as I can see, the police kept him out of the rain. The rain was an uncomfortable feature of the evening that would have inflicted itself upon everybody who was involved in the search, including the police officers. I did not see any evidence to suggest that the accused's well-being was not taken into account so far as the inclement weather was concerned.  
     
      
    118 I reject any suggestion that there is any evidence that the accused was ""manhandled"", as the written submission states. Again, it is true that the accused's wife and child were taken away, but this was clearly for their benefit and well-being. I do not accept that anything the police did was unreasonable so far as the family members were concerned. The accused's attempts to stop the police talking to his wife and child were unwarranted.  
     
      
    119 The written submissions suggest that the accused was under extreme stress and physical restraint. It was submitted that he was significantly distressed at the sight of his wife and child being kept from him, not allowed to join him, and eventually leaving the premises. It was said that he was attempting to speak to his wife and child immediately before the impugned statement. This is true, but there is nothing in the translations from Arabic to English that supports the argument that the statement was made as a consequence of, or influenced by, oppressive conduct. The statement he made to the police was expressed very deliberately. The remarks might properly be described as a deliberate, calculated and carefully expressed opinion of a state of mind, an intention, a mindset of hostility to the government of Australia and non-Muslims generally. They were not in fact a ""rant"" or some type of hysterical outburst. They were, as I said, a carefully expressed statement of deeply felt beliefs. That, in any event, is the impression the video of those statements made on my mind.  
     
      
    120 I should make it clear that nothing I have said about my reaction to the statements or to their possible meaning is meant to imply that I think that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. My concern at the moment is strictly limited to the conversation, its relevance and its admissibility. The accused remains completely entitled to the presumption of innocence and will remain so, so far as I am concerned, throughout the trial.  
     
      
    121 The next submission on behalf of the accused asserts that the police breached the provisions of s 23G of the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th). This section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        23G Right to communicate with friend, relative and legal practitioner 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect, an investigating official must, before starting to question the person, inform the person that he or she may: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a friend or relative to inform that person of his or her whereabouts; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of the person's choice and arrange, or attempt to arrange, for a legal practitioner of the person's choice to be present during the questioning; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and the investigating official must defer the questioning for a reasonable time to allow the person to make, or attempt to make, the communication and, if the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present, to allow the legal practitioner to attend the questioning. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect and wishes to communicate with a friend, relative or legal practitioner, the investigating official must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) as soon as practicable, give the person reasonable facilities to enable the person to do so; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in the case of a communication with a legal practitioner allow the legal practitioner or a clerk of the legal practitioner to communicate with the person in circumstances in which, as far as practicable, the communication will not be overheard. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect and arranges for a legal practitioner to be present during the questioning, the investigating official must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) allow the person to consult with the legal practitioner in private and provide reasonable facilities for that consultation; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) allow the legal practitioner to be present during the questioning and to give advice to the person, but only while the legal practitioner does not unreasonably interfere with the questioning.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    122 It is common background that the accused was cautioned at least twice, and perhaps three times, before the ""statement"" was made by him. The complaint, however, is that Detective Gawel did not, at the time of giving these cautions, inform the accused of his rights to communicate with a friend or legal practitioner. In addition, the police did not defer the commencement of questioning until that communication was undertaken. Much was made in the submissions that Detective Gawel appeared to believe he was operating under New South Wales Police practice and was unaware of the terms of s 23G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. He was also unaware, so it seems, of his obligation under s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914.  
     
      
    123 The Crown response to this argument is essentially that the obligation imposed by s 23G required the relevant entitlements to be provided to the accused, but only before Detective Gawel began to question him. Strictly speaking, I think this argument is correct. In the context of the section, the expression ""questioning"" should be construed as a reference to questioning the accused ""in order to investigate his involvement in the commission of a Commonwealth offence"" (see s 23B(6) of the Crimes Act). 
     
      
    124 The evidence of Detective Gawel, which I accept, establishes quite clearly that at no stage did Gawel ever commence to question the accused in that sense. The situation at the house may be well contrasted with the later situation at the police station. There the police did commence to question the accused within the meaning of s 23B(6) and, prior to so doing, the provisions of s 23G were complied with in full (this appears from the transcript of the interview with the accused and also from the statement of Ryan Malcolm in Exhibit “A”). I do not accept the submission that it was ""imperative"" under s 23G to inform the accused of his entitlements under that section at the time of administering the caution. Of course, Detective Gawel may have complied with s 23G at the time of administering the cautions, if he chose so to do. In my opinion, however, it was not imperative to do so, and indeed it made a lot more sense that the section was complied with at the time the police were in a position and ready to conduct the formal interview.  
     
      
    125 Mr Waterstreet relied on a number of authorities to support his argument relating to s 23G of the Crimes Act. The first of these was R v Pinkstone. This was a decision of a single judge (White J) in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The decision is dated 10 March 1997 and is, as I understand it, unreported. In that decision, White J held that the evidence of what was said by the accused to the police during the execution of a search warrant at his house and office, prior to the formal records of interview, was inadmissible. This was because of the failure to comply with s 23G at the time the questioning occurred. The facts in Pinkstone's case are very different from those involved in the present situation. There, the accused had been arrested and, during the search warrant process, the accused was plainly interrogated about the alleged offence. It is perfectly clear that his Honour was correct in determining that the section had been breached.  
     
      
    126 By contrast, Detective Gawel was at pains not to question Khaled Cheikho either at the time of the arrest or while he was at the premises. Detective Gawel, as did Inspector McDonald, endeavoured to explain to the accused what was happening but, in my opinion, no questioning, in the relevant sense, occurred.  
     
      
    127 It is true that Detective Gawel made two brief ""comments"" during the ""statement"" made by Khaled Cheikho. For example, he repeated the words ""Sharia law"" on one occasion. This was not, however, questioning in the relevant sense, as the words had been used by the accused himself before Detective Gawel spoke.  
     
      
    128 Towards the conclusion of the statement the accused said (concerning Mr Howard) ""Tell him Abu Mosayed is going to come and chop him up"". It is true that Detective Gawel said, ""Who, sorry?"" And the accused repeated the name ""Abu Mosayed"". Once again I do not consider that the question asked by Detective Gawel constituted questioning in the relevant sense. It must be conceded that he asked the accused to repeat what he had said, but that was the limit of the question he asked.  
     
      
    129 Mr Waterstreet made reference to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia. This was the decision in Markovina v The Queen (1996) 93 A Crim R 149 at 172. There the Court (Malcolm CJ, Walsh and Wallwork JJ) had said (referring to s 23G and a similar provision in the Victorian legislation): 
     
      
       
        
        “There the purpose is, in part, the protection of the individual from unfair or oppressive treatment while held in custody and, in part, the advancement of the efficient administration of criminal justice, both by minimising the possibility of a miscarriage of justice through the fabrication of police evidence, confessional statements and reducing the amount of time spent in courts in resolving disputes about whether such alleged statements had in fact been made or made voluntarily."" 
        
       
      
    130 Two points may be made. First, I am satisfied that there was no unfair or oppressive treatment while Khaled Cheikho was held in custody. Secondly, the ""failure"" (if it be a failure) to inform him of his rights under s 23G until he was actually questioned at the police station did not, in the circumstances of this matter, constitute a matter of oppression. This is so because, firstly, the police were at pains not to question him prior to his being taken to the police station. Secondly, the fact that the s 23G entitlement was not drawn to the accused’s attention until he was at the police station did not influence, in any way, the making of the statement. 
     
      
    131 As I have said earlier, the statement by Khaled Cheikho was entirely voluntary. It did not occur in the context of police questioning (R v Su & Ors (1997) 1 VR 1 at pages 37 and 38), again a case where the accused had been interviewed by authorities without being told his rights and without being cautioned. In that case the Court (Winneke P, Hayne JA and Southwell AJA) said at 38-39: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 23V of the  
        Crimes Act 
         makes a confession or admission by a suspect being interviewed by an investigating official inadmissible in evidence against the person unless the requirements of that section are met. There is no equivalent provision made in Part 1C for the case in which there is a failure to give the caution required by s 23F or a failure to inform a person under arrest of the rights given by s 23G. It follows, in our view, that not every failure to comply with section 23F or s 23G will necessarily mean that any subsequent interview must be excluded. No doubt the failure to comply with some other of those requirements will be a very important matter to consider in deciding whether a confession or admission obtained in breach of the provisions should be admitted in evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        It may well be right to say that, 'as a general rule', or 'ordinarily' the confession or admission will be rejected if there has been a failure to comply with s 23F or 23G. But that will be so only if the Court considering the matter concludes that, taking account of all the circumstances, the tendering of the statement would be unfair to the accused. As we say, that will depend upon all the circumstances in which the statement was made. In our view, by his statements in  
        Pollard 
         (1992) 176 CLR 177, McHugh J was not intending to establish some new rule of law governing the admissibility of statements obtained in contravention of provisions like s 46(4)(c) of the Victorian Act or section 23F and 23G of the Commonwealth Act. Rather, he was doing no more than pointing to the likely consequences of a failure to comply with such provisions when a Court came to apply the well recognised discretion to reject statements obtained unfairly.” 
        
       
      
    132 Once again, I repeat that, in the present matter, the police did not interview Khaled Cheikho, nor did they question him in the relevant sense, until afterwards, at the police station, they informed him of his entitlements and cautioned him once again. Failure to tell him of those entitlements at the house prior to the search warrant process had been undertaken, did not, in my view, mean that there had been a failure to comply with s 23G prior to Khaled Cheikho voluntarily making the statement he did. 
     
      
    133 The next matter relied on by the accused as bearing upon the possibility of oppressive conduct influencing his statement was a suggested failure by the officer in charge of the search to comply with the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914. Reliance upon this alleged failure is principally raised under the heading of the s 138 argument that I will come to shortly. It is, however, relied on by the accused in relation to the application under s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995. It will be convenient, for that reason, to set out the provisions of s 3P at this point in the decision. The section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “ 
        Occupier entitled to be present during search 
        
       
       
        
        3P(1) If a warrant in relation to premises is being executed and the occupier of the premises or another person who apparently represents the occupier is present at the premises, the person is, subject to Part IC, entitled to observe the search being conducted. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The right to observe the search being conducted ceases if the person impedes the search. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) This section does not prevent two or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time.” 
        
       
      
    134 The factual situation, it will be recalled, is that the accused was present outside the house until about 4.50am, when he left under escort to be taken to the police station. Between the time of his arrest (at approximately 2.30am) and the time he was taken away to the police station, the search proper had not commenced. The warrant permitted the executing officer or a constable assisting to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes. The forensic examination of the premises preceded the search proper. By that expression, I mean the endeavour to search the premises for evidential material as specified in the warrant and the seizure of “things of that kind” found at the premises. The search proper, as I have called it, did not commence until about 6 minutes past 5. It will also be recalled that the first area searched was the garage area, and the search of this area continued until shortly after 6am. The search proper of the house commenced shortly after that time, with the first house seizures being made at around 6.20am 
     
      
    135 The statement made by Khaled Cheikho, which is sought to be excluded, was made long before the commencement of any search for evidential material, either in the garage or at the house. The statement was made quite shortly after the arrest and handcuffing of the accused, not long after his wife and child had been brought out of the house into the external area near the porch and the garage. 
     
      
    136 As my later analysis will show, I have very considerable doubts as to whether there was a breach by the police of the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act, so far as the accused himself was concerned. A separate part of this decision will examine why this is so and provide reasons for this concession. But, even if I be wrong, in that regard, it is quite clear that the alleged “failure” to allow the accused into the house shortly after Officers Thompson, Rooney and Jones entered the premises to commence the establishment of the forensic procedures did not classify, and could not have been classified, as oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995. Secondly, the alleged failure, in my opinion, could not conceivably have influenced the making of the statement which is in issue in this decision.  
     
      
    137 First, the police were entitled to establish a proper basis for the carrying out of legitimate forensic procedures within the house. The warrant expressly enabled the searching officers to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes. Such a process was permitted by s 3F(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). 
     
      
    138 Secondly, it was plainly necessary, prior to taking the swabs for forensic purposes, to ensure that no other police officers, or other persons, were inside the premises before the swabs were taken. 
     
      
    139 Thirdly, the procedure required the decontamination of police officers involved in the taking of the swabs prior to the commencement of the search proper. The presence of a contaminated person in the house after the procedure was implemented would have had the capacity to undermine the integrity of the process. 
     
      
    140 Fourthly, the passage of some time would be inevitably necessary for the preliminary testing of the swabs. It could reasonably be anticipated that the search proper would not commence until the preliminary examination of the swabs had been made and returned. 
     
      
    141 Finally, it was necessary that the premises be sealed and kept intact until these forensic procedures had been completed. In short, for all these reasons, the fact that neither the accused, nor any other potentially contaminated person was allowed into the premises for a period of time prior to the search, was appropriate, understandable and not prohibited by any section of the legislation. The accused may well have had legitimate cause for complaint if these procedures had not been scrupulously followed. 
     
      
    142 Against the background of these considerations, it can be safely said that the accused was removed from the vicinity of the premises well before the commencement of the search proper. On the assumption (which I do not accept) that Khaled Cheikho's arrest and removal from the premises to the police station contravened a right he possessed under s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), it is clear that, in a practical sense, the entitlement had not arisen at the time he was taken away. Moreover, he was not aware of any such alleged right. Nor, from a number of his remarks, was he interested in the procedures to be undertaken pursuant to the warrant. It is clear that his “statement” was made long before he was taken to the police station and, indeed, quite shortly after his original arrest. 
     
      
    143 It is simply impossible to say that any asserted breach of his rights under s 3P had a bearing on his making of the impugned statement. As I have said, the statement was a calculated and carefully phrased opinion of a state of mind indicating, as at that time, a mind-set of hostility to the Government of Australia, to non-Muslims and to the authorities who were responsible for his arrest and the proposed search of his home and car. The alleged failure to allow him to be present in the premises during the search had absolutely nothing to do with his decision to make the statement recorded in Exhibit “A”. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Exclusion of statement on other bases 
       
      
    144 I shall now turn to consider the possible exclusion of the statement under ss 135, 137 and 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    145 Section 135 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        135 General discretion to exclude evidence 
        
       
       
        
        The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a part, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    146 Section 137 is in the following terms:

        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
        
       
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    147 ""Probative value"" is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    148 Section 137 requires a balancing by the trial judge of the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. If that balancing process results in a finding that the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the Court is constrained to refuse to admit the evidence. No element of discretion applies. 
     
      
    149 The section requires the Court to consider first, the probative value of the evidence. Secondly, the Court must examine the probative value of the evidence relative to its prejudicial effect to the extent that it could or would be unfair. (See R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101; Papakosmos v R (1999) 196 CLR 297; R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; R v E M (2003) NSWCCA 374; R v Yates (2002) NSWCCA 520 at (252)). 
     
      
    150 In R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 199 (116), Wood CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed) pointed out that the prejudice to the defendant of which each of ss 135 and 137 speak is not the simple fact that the evidence may advance the Crown case or weaken the defence case. Rather, it means damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example, by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves. There must be more than a hypothetical risk of it being unfairly prejudicial in this way - the risk must be a real one: R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 at 324.  
     
      
    151 Mr Waterstreet argued that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. So far as the latter section is concerned, I have rejected the argument that the statement did not have probative value. Indeed, as I have found, the statement is not only relevant, but it is highly probative. It is certainly prejudicial in the sense that it may dispose the jury to find the Crown has, together with other evidence, proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. That, of course, is not the unfair prejudice that is the concern of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. The statement will hardly endear Khaled Cheikho to the jury, but that is not because the statement is unfairly prejudicial. Its prejudicial content arises directly out of, and is at the same level as, its probative value. I am satisfied that the evidence is not unfairly prejudicial, and that its probative value is not outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice to the accused. 
     
      
       
      Section 90 of the Evidence Act 
       
      
    152 The final matter affecting the statement relates to s 90 of the Evidence Act. I am not satisfied that this section has any application to the present matter. Section 90 confers a residual discretion, but the occasion for its use in relation to the present issue has simply not been established. The section has been described as a ""final or safety net provision"" that has operation only after the application of the more specific provisions of the Act (EM v R (2007) 239 ALR 204; (2007) ACS 46 at 109 per Gummow and Hayne JJ). I see no scope whatsoever for s 90 to be called in aid. The circumstances sought to be relied upon by the written and oral submissions of the accused simply do not raise an issue concerning unfairness to the accused in the use of the statement at trial. No circumstance, or set of circumstances, has been legitimately identified so as to suggest that, if the statement is admitted, the accused will not receive a fair trial. No circumstance, or set of circumstances, has been legitimately identified from which it can be said that the use of the evidence at trial would, in any way, be unfair. In my opinion, for these reasons also, the circumstances sought to be relied on by the accused do not trigger s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      Breaches of Law - Section 138 Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    153 As I indicated at the outset, these arguments fall into two categories. It will be convenient to deal with them separately. The first category of asserted breach is said to have infected the entire search process. The principal matters identified under this category were a failure to allow either Khaled Cheikho or his wife to be present (as occupiers) during the search (s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914); secondly, a failure to show a copy of the warrant to Ms Wisudo (s 3H of the Crimes Act 1914); thirdly, use of the wrong property seizure form; and, finally, a question mark over the service of an occupier's form. Although not put forward as a separate breach of the law, there were also the alleged inappropriate procedures adopted in relation to the signing by Ms Wisudo of the property seizure document. 
     
      
    154 The second category of asserted breach related to the seizure of the four computer hard drives and the CDs taken from the premises (s 3K of the Crimes Act 1914). 
     
      
    155 I shall deal with the first category before moving on to consider the issues relating to the computer hard drives and the CDs. 
     
      
       
      The alleged breach under Section 3P of the Crimes Act 1914 
       
      
    156 I have earlier set out the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914. I will not repeat them here. The accused argued that the first protection afforded to a person whose home has been invaded by law enforcement authorities, on the basis of a search warrant, is the right to observe the execution of the search warrant. It was argued that the ""mere fact"" of arrest does not negate the accused's right to be present. Further, the accused argued that the accused's wife was also denied the right to be present during the execution of the search warrant 
     
      
    157 The Crown took issue with the primary submission made on behalf of the accused. It submitted that, on the facts of the matter, the execution of the search warrant (in terms of the conducting of the search of the house) did not commence until shortly after 5am on 8 November 2005. The Crown argued that the proper construction of s 3P meant that the accused was only entitled to observe the search being conducted if he were present at the time. It could not be argued, for example, that the section should be construed to mean that the accused was entitled to be present in the house during the taking of forensic samples. Such an interpretation would obliterate the utility of that exercise. A “workable” construction of s 3P is that it must be taken to refer to the search of the premises ""for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant"" and the seizure of “things of that kind” found at the premises (s 3F(1)(c) of the Crimes Act).  
     
      
    158 Again, referring to the factual situation, the Crown maintained that the accused was not present during the conduct of the search proper, because he was lawfully under detention at the police station at that time. Ms Wisudo was similarly not present during this part of the search, although she had been invited to participate. The evidence established, the Crown said, that Ms Wisudo had been given the opportunity to be present, but she had declined to do so on the basis of her election to leave at an earlier time with her son. 
     
      
    159 Finally, the Crown pointed to the fact that the accused had stated, in unequivocal terms, that he did not care what the police did in pursuance of the warrant. It was open to find that the accused had consented to the police proceeding with the execution of the warrant, irrespective of whether or not he was present. Consequently, the Crown argued, there was no breach of s 3P and no illegality. 
     
      
    160 Mr Waterstreet was permitted to make some further submissions in reply. These were, as it happened, far lengthier than the original submissions. Counsel argued that the evidence established a clear breach of s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914. He referred to the evidence given by Detective McDonald at transcript 2303 line 40 - 2304 line 3. The passage in the evidence, counsel submitted, showed that D I McDonald was not aware of the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act, although he believed that the occupant was entitled to be present while the premises were searched. Secondly, the officer was unable to recall whether he had given such an opportunity to Khaled Cheikho. He was unable to recall whether Detective Gawel had spoken to the accused in relation to the matter. 
     
      
    161 Counsel also referred to the evidence from Detective Gawel in which he too said that he was not aware of s 3P of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The officer had said that he formed the view that there was a sufficient basis to charge the accused with the offence for which he had been arrested, and he decided to take him back to the Sydney Police Centre to charge him.  
     
      
    162 Mr Waterstreet argued that the mere fact that D S Gawel may have wished to convey the accused to the police station at some point was not a sufficient justification for denying him the important right to ensure the proper conduct of the search. Counsel urged that a strict construction should be given to the section to protect an important right of an occupier, namely the opportunity to observe a search being conducted at his home pursuant to a warrant. 
     
      
    163 I turn now to resolve the issues arising in relation to this particular aspect of the application. Section 3P is by no means an easy section to construe. Its construction would be, and is, difficult, even for trained lawyers, let alone police officers, especially those involved in a massive operation such as the present one. 
     
      
    164 The first thing to observe about s 3P is that it does not confer an absolute right or entitlement. There are two preconditions to its operation. The first is that it has operation only ""if a warrant in relation to premises is being executed"". This is a broad description and, on its face, does not require an interpretation that is any narrower than the normal meaning attributed to the words used. 
     
      
    165 The second pre-condition or limitation is not quite so clear. The right only arises if the occupier (or another person who apparently represents the occupier) “is present at the premises”. The section does not make it entirely clear whether the section is intended to operate when the occupier is present during any part of the execution of the warrant, or present only when the search is being conducted. The right, it will be recalled, is one of being ""entitled to observe the search being conducted"". 
     
      
    166 With some diffidence, I would conclude that the time frame contemplated by the section is, in fact, the period during which the search is actually being conducted. If the occupier is not present during that time, the entitlement does not arise.  
     
      
    167 The first reason favouring this narrower approach arises out of the juxtaposition of the two phrases. It seems to me that the legislature has selected, deliberately, a phrase that is more likely to mean being present during the actual search, rather than present at every aspect of the execution of the warrant. Not every aspect of the execution of the warrant can necessarily be described as the “search being conducted"". Had the legislature wished to emphasise the broader approach, the phrase appearing in s 3P(1) could have ended with the words ""observed the warrant being executed"". As I have said, the legislature appears to have deliberately determined that it would not, at the conclusion of the paragraph, repeat the opening words of the section, but rather has chosen a more narrow and precise phrase, namely ""to observe the search being conducted"". The language chosen fits more readily the construction I favour. 
     
      
    168 The second reason supporting this narrower interpretation is that it sits more easily with the provisions of subs (3). That subsection contemplates the ""search"" of ""two or more areas of the premises"" ""at the same time"". It suggests that the section is concerned with an entitlement to observe the actual search of the premises, as distinct from an allied or preliminary procedure, such as the taking of samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes. In other words, the entitlement arising under s 3P is principally focused upon the actual search for evidential material, or for other things found at the premises and their subsequent seizure.  
     
      
    169 The working and operation of subs (2) of s 3P also support this interpretation. This subsection is not, however, without its own difficulties. It appears to be a ""self-executing"" section. It operates where an occupier ""impedes the search"", rather than where a police officer believes that a person is or may be impeding “the search”. The section is, however, quite peremptory. The right to observe the search simply comes to an end if the occupier or his representative impedes the search. Once again, the subsection focuses on the actual search. 
     
      
    170 If, in the present case, Khaled Cheikho had insisted on being allowed to enter the house during the setting up or carrying out of the forensic procedures, it would be incontestable that such an intrusion may have impeded the forensic process. That being so, the presence of the accused in the house would have automatically brought the right ""to observe the search"" to an end. This situation would have meant that he would not have been entitled to observe the search proper when it later commenced, had he still been at the premises. Such a conclusion appears to be unsatisfactory, but this is one of the problems the section, as a whole, raises.  
     
      
    171 If I am correct in relation to the narrower interpretation of the phrase ""entitled to observe the search being conducted"", it would follow that the accused was not present at the premises at 6am when the search was being conducted. Nor was Ms Wisudo present at that time. In those circumstances, this interpretation of the section would justify a finding that there was no breach of s 3P. 
     
      
    172 If I be wrong, however, in relation to the interpretation I favour, there is a third, and important, limitation imposed on the entitlement. This is that the existence of the entitlement is expressly made “subject to Part IC” of the Crimes Act 1914. (“The person is, subject to Part 1C, entitled to observe the search being conducted”). Part 1C of the legislation is concerned with the ""investigation of Commonwealth offences"". The introduction includes an outline of Part IC. It states: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Outline of this Part 
        
       
       
        
        23 (1) This Part: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) provides for the detention of people arrested for Commonwealth offences (see Division 2); and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) imposes obligations on investigating officials in relation to 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) people arrested for Commonwealth offences; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) certain other people who are being investigated for Commonwealth offences; (see Division 3). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) To avoid doubt, this Part does not confer power to arrest any person.  
        
       
       
        
        (3) To avoid doubt, only a person arrested for a Commonwealth offence may be detained under this Part.” 
        
       
      
    173 Although the Part does impose obligations on investigating officials in relation to people arrested for Commonwealth offences, it also provides for the detention of such persons, and generally, the investigation of serious offences. It is this aspect of detention and investigation which, in my view, has especially to be borne in mind when examining the meaning of the phrase ""subject to Part IC"" where it appears in s 3P of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    174 For example, s 23CA provides for the period of detention where a person has been arrested for a terrorism offence. The period, in general, is for four hours after the arrest, unless the period is extended under s 23DA. The purpose of the detention is to enable the investigation of whether the person has committed the offence, or another terrorism offence that an investigating official reasonably suspects the person to have committed. Subsection (8) allows certain times to be disregarded in ascertaining the duration of the detention period. Many of the circumstances identified in subs (8) involve periods of time that may be so disregarded. Many of the circumstances assume that the detention of the arrested person will take place at a police station. 
     
      
    175 An extension of the investigation period where a person has been arrested for a terrorism offence is obtained, as I have said, under s 23DA. Where such an application is granted, the period of detention is extended to enable the preservation, or, the obtaining of evidence, or the completion of the investigation into the offence, or into another terrorism offence. 
     
      
    176 There is no need for me to set out in any detail the many obligations imposed on investigating officials in relation to persons who have been arrested and detained. They include, however, the obligation to caution persons under arrest (s 23F); the obligation to inform an arrested person before questioning of his or her right to communicate with a legal practitioner and to arrange for a legal practitioner to be present during the questioning (s 23G). There are many other obligations imposed as well. A person who is under arrest must, of course, be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity, and must not be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (s 23Q). 
     
      
    177 In my opinion, however, the words ""subject to Part IC"", where appearing in s 3P, are not referring principally to the numerous categories of obligations imposed on officials, although they no doubt have a part to play in the construction of the section. Rather, they are especially referring to the fact of arrest and detention, and the imposition such a situation may have on a person's continuing ability to remain at premises the subject of a search warrant, so as to observe the search being conducted. 
     
      
    178 In general terms, s 3P is concerned to confer a right on an occupier of premises, or another person who apparently represents the occupier of those premises. The right exists only while the occupier (or other person) is present at the premises and in a position to take up his or her entitlement to observe the search being conducted. The purpose of the words (‘subject to Part 1C”) in the section is to draw a distinction between a mere occupier, and one who has been arrested and, importantly, detained under Part IC. An occupier, who would otherwise be entitled to observe the search would not be entitled to do so if the circumstances related to his arrest and detention required the entitlement to take second place to the proper needs of the detention process. 
     
      
    179 Mr Waterstreet argued that, if such an interpretation were adopted, the entitlement under s 3P would become an ""ephemeral right"". I do not agree. The section confers an important right on occupiers. Those rights may have to come to an end where the dictates of arrest and detention require it. A person under arrest and in detention is not in the same position as an occupier who is at liberty. The section recognises this distinction and allows for it. The right to observe the search being conducted could not be described as ephemeral, for example, even though it will cease if the occupier or his representative impedes the search. Further, the right will not come into existence at all if the occupier happens not to be present at the premises, either when the search warrant is being executed, or, more narrowly, when the search is being conducted. 
     
      
    180 I accept that the entitlement conferred by s 3P is an important one, but it is not, as I have said at the outset, an unlimited one, and it is one that may not come into operation at all, or will cease to have effect in the various circumstances contemplated by the language of the section. 
     
      
    181 I turn to consider what happened in the present matter. First, I accept that the section was engaged. There can be no doubt that the arrival of the police officers at 2.30am on 8 November 2005 heralded and then involved the execution of the subject search warrant. Further, I accept that, at the time of his arrest, Khaled Cheikho might properly have been regarded as the occupier of the premises the subject of the warrant. 
     
      
    182 The actual search of the premises, however, did not take place until after 6am on 8 November 2005. That was the earliest time when the actual search of the premises commenced. Prior to that time, as the police officers told the accused, the intention was to conduct a forensic procedure within the premises before the search commenced. The forensic procedures involved taking a number of swabs from the interior of the premises. Once those swabs had been taken, the premises were to be sealed. This was to prevent anybody going into the premises until the swabs could be examined. Once the examination of the swabs had taken place, the police intended to undertake a proper search of the premises and vehicle. 
     
      
    183 Four police officers entered the premises some time shortly before 2.55am. Those persons had been swabbed prior to entering the premises. No police officer other than those persons had been inside the premises. 
     
      
    184 The forensic testing group comprised three police officers, Thompson, Rooney and Jones, who were introduced to the accused. Their task, it was stated, was to conduct the forensic procedures. There was no video taping in the premises during the forensic procedure because of concerns about contamination. 
     
      
    185 As it happened the forensic procedures took an inordinate time. As the hours passed it became apparent that there was no certainty as to when they would conclude. This resulted in a situation where the accused was placed in an increasingly uncomfortable position, as were the police, especially Detective Sergeant Gawel, whose task it was, ultimately, to interrogate the accused. The police believed that they were entitled to keep the accused outside the premises during the period of time involving the forensic procedures. I am not prepared to find that they were in error in this belief. I am not prepared to find that keeping the accused immediately outside the premises while the forensic procedures were carried out was a breach of s 3P of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    186 This meant that the accused (and indeed the police officers) were exposed to the vagaries of the night and the impact of the elements for a period of about two and a half hours before a decision was finally made that the accused should be taken to the Police Centre.  
     
      
    187 It is quite apparent that, when the decision was made, Detective Sergeant Gawel had no real basis upon which he could reliably estimate how long it would be before the search proper could commence. As it turned out, the house and garage were not in fact ready for the commencement of the search proper until after 6am - over an hour after the accused left the area to go to the police station.  
     
      
    188 It is clear that D S Gawel's decision to take the accused to the police station was based on a number of matters. All of them, however, related to matters that arose out of his arrest and detention. First, there were the matters that related to his physical condition. He was, to a degree, exposed to the elements, and he had expressed a wish to go to the toilet. The accused also expressed a wish to be able to pray. For appropriate reasons, he could not be taken into the house for either of these purposes. 
     
      
    189 In addition, Detective Gawel was concerned that, even allowing for down time, the statutory period for detention and investigation was fast running out. Moreover, he did not know when the search would be able to commence. Against the background of all of these matters, the decision was made to take the accused to the Police Centre, so that his detention could continue in more appropriate circumstances, and where the interrogation could more properly take place. I infer that Detective Sergeant Gawel was particularly concerned about the running out of the detention period. 
     
      
    190 Mr Waterstreet sought to deride the reasoning behind D S Gawel's decision. Counsel pointed out that the accused was not, in fact, brought into an interview room for interrogation until 9am on 8 November 2005, even though he had been taken from the premises shortly before 5am. DS Gawel explained, however, that when he arrived at the police station, there was a considerable backlog and no interview room was available. Although a very large scale police operation was involved, I accept that this was something that he could not have anticipated while he was out at the Lakemba premises. 
     
      
    191 In short, I accept that there were a number of matters which led to Detective Gawel's legitimate decision to remove the accused from the Lakemba premises and to take him to the police station. These matters of concern, some of which focused on the accused's position as a detained person, and others which focused on Detective Gawel's difficulties as the officer responsible for the interrogation of the accused, were soundly based and warranted the decision to remove the accused to the police station.  
     
      
    192 Mr Waterstreet put to D S Gawel that he could have applied for an extension of time while he was at the house. The police officer ridiculed this suggestion, and rightly so, in my opinion. It was a totally impracticable suggestion, given the conditions and the overall circumstances.  
     
      
    193 For all these reasons, I accept that the accused's entitlement under s 3P properly took second place to these other considerations arising out of the fact of his arrest and detention. 
     
      
    194 Mr Waterstreet made much of the fact that neither D S Gawel or D I McDonald really knew anything of the provisions of s 3P of the Crimes Act. That is, I accept, a legitimate criticism. The officers candidly admitted that they were unaware of the provisions of the section.  
     
      
    195 This criticism of the police officers may, perhaps, be tempered to some degree by a consideration of two matters. First, this was a massive operation involving a huge number of officers of both State and Federal origin. Despite the briefings that took place, it is hardly surprising that State officers were unfamiliar with Federal law. I do not suggest this is a satisfactory situation, but it is, as I say, hardly a matter of surprise. Secondly, s 3P is, as this decision shows, a section that allows for a range of different interpretations. It is not an easy section to construe.  
     
      
    196 Be that as it may, I am satisfied that s 3P is not dependent for its operation on the police forming a belief or an opinion about whether the detention situation of a suspect requires the entitlement to come to an end. The section does not require an intermediate decision to be made before the entitlement comes to an end. It does require, however, intermediate action that is based upon the fact of arrest and detention, but otherwise the section operates according to its own terms. For this reason, the fact that neither Gawel nor McDonald were familiar with the terms of s 3P, in the circumstances of this particular matter, had, as it turned out, no adverse consequences for the situation which developed on 8 November 2005. 
     
      
    197 As a consequence of all the foregoing, I am satisfied that there was no breach of s 3P of the Crimes Act 1914 arising out of the fact that the accused was taken away and not present when the search was conducted after 6am. Equally, I am satisfied there was no breach involved in the fact that the accused was not permitted into the premises while the forensic procedure was being conducted, that is prior to his being removed to the police station. 
     
      
    198 I turn then to consider the situation of Ms Wisudo. I accept, firstly, that the section is expressed in the alternative. It contemplates that the entitlement to observe the search will reside either in the occupier of the premises, or in another person who apparently represents the occupier. The various limitations to which I have referred, of course, still have the capacity to operate where it is the alternative person's entitlement being considered. But was Ms Wisudo an alternative occupier for the purposes of the section? Certainly, the police treated Khaled Cheikho as the occupier for the purpose of serving a copy of the warrant on him. He was read the details of the warrant. Later, however, she was treated as the occupier for the purposes of signing the property seizure form. That was reasonable, of course, in that by 9am, the accused was at the police station in detention and subject to interrogation. Strictly speaking, however, the entitlement of Khaled Cheikho, as occupier, having ceased, (because of the circumstances involved in his arrest and detention situation), it may not have been the intention of the legislature that the entitlement would “switch” to another person, namely, in this case, Ms Wisudo. The position was made the more complicated, in the present matter, by the fact that Ms Wisudo had left the premises an hour before the accused was escorted away to the police station. 
     
      
    199 Ms Wisudo was not, of course, a person who had been arrested or detained, so that part of the section had no operation. She was present, however, during part of the time the forensic procedures were being undertaken. She too was not allowed to enter the premises during those procedures. For the reasons already stated, I do not consider that this amounted to a breach of s 3P.  
     
      
    200 Although s 3P is concerned with an alternative situation, it was, in my opinion, appropriate, even if not strictly necessary, that Ms Wisudo be treated as the occupier or the representative of the occupier for the purposes of s 3P. I say it was appropriate because it may be inferred that the police officers became aware of the fact that it would be likely that, as the morning wore on, it would be necessary to take Khaled Cheikho to the police station for investigative purposes. 
     
      
    201 In that situation, while it may not have been strictly necessary to do so, it was fair and appropriate that she was given the opportunity by D I McDonald to observe the search if she wanted to be there at the time when it was likely to commence. However, it is clear that the time of commencement was by no means certain, and that, in any event, Ms Wisudo wished to go to her mother's home in Lakemba and to take her child there. 
     
      
    202 As I say, it was fair and appropriate that she was given the opportunity to observe the search, but it is quite clear she declined to take up this opportunity, as she was perfectly entitled to do. A person cannot be forced to observe a search of premises as the occupier's representative if they do not wish to undertake that task. It was Ms Wisudo's choice to stay or to leave, and she made a clear choice. 
     
      
    203 In these circumstances, I do not consider that anything done or omitted to be done in connection with Ms Wisudo resulted in a breach of s 3P.  
     
      
    204 Finally, Mr Waterstreet submitted that D I McDonald had abrogated his responsibilities and that both police officers deliberately disregarded their obligations. I do not accept either of these submissions. D S Gawel was a part of the search team but his task focused more on the arrest, detention and interviewing of Khaled Cheikho. Those were his particular concerns. When Detective Gawel made the decision that the accused should be taken to the police station in all the circumstances I have outlined, no responsibility then fell upon D I McDonald to insist that the accused remain at the premises for the purposes of observing the search. The statute did not require that this be done. In any event, neither officer was, in any detailed sense, aware of the requirements of s 3P. Those actions and decisions could not, in any sense, be described as “deliberate disregard” of the statute. 
     
      
    205 Similarly, for the reasons I have outlined, the decision of Detective Gawel to take the accused to the police station effectively brought to an end the potential right the accused had to observe the search being conducted. It was a decision properly made on legitimate grounds. 
     
      
    206 In the event that I be wrong in my construction of s 3P, I will later in this decision consider the exercise of the discretion made available under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Breach of section 3H of the Crimes Act 1914 
       
      
    207 Counsel for Khaled Cheikho have argued that there was a failure to provide the accused's wife with a copy of the search warrant. This failure, it was argued, constituted a breach of s 3H(1) Crimes Act 1914: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a warrant in relation to premises is being executed and the occupier of the premises or another person who apparently represents the occupier is present at the premises, the executing officer or a constable assisting must make available to that person a copy of the warrant.” 
        
       
      
    208 The written submissions on behalf of the accused placed reliance upon the remarks of the full Federal Court in Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Oke (2007) 159 FCR 441, 449 at (39) per Branson, Lindgren and Besanko JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “The  
        Crimes Act 
         discloses an intention that non-compliance with s 3H(1) renders unlawful the execution of the warrant.” 
        
       
      
    209 Other authorities have made it clear that provisions such as s 3H of the Crimes Act 1914 make it mandatory for the executing officer to make available a copy of any search warrant to the occupier of the premises. Such provisions reflect the desire to achieve an appropriate balance between a person's right of privacy and a need to facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law (Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69, 111 per McHugh J).  
     
      
    210 The Crown, in response, has submitted that a copy of the search warrant was given to the accused at the very outset of the process. Mr Waterstreet, however, submitted that the Crown could not rely upon the service of the search warrant upon the accused himself. It was necessary that a copy of it be served on his wife as well. This was because the purpose underlying the provision in s 3H was to permit an occupier or his agent to ensure that the search warrant was being executed within its terms. It was argued that this purpose would be undermined were the police permitted to give a search warrant to an accused, and then remove him from the premises because of his detention situation. The argument proceeded on the basis that it would be then necessary to serve a second copy of the warrant on the remaining occupier or agent.  
     
      
    211 In his final reply submissions, Mr Waterstreet argued that the accused's wife was present when the police first attended the accused's home. Counsel submitted that Ms Wisudo remained at the home for a period of some three hours before she decided to leave. During this time, forensic officers were conducting an examination of the accused's home. It could not be contended that this process was other than part of the process permitted under the search warrant. Her presence there, during this period, required that she be served with a copy of the document. Finally, Mr Waterstreet argued that, had the authorities given the accused's wife a copy of the warrant, it was unlikely that she would have elected, as she did later, to leave the premises and go to her mother's home.  
     
      
    212 The resolution of this question may be dealt with quite briefly. The facts show, with absolute clarity, that the accused himself was served with a copy of the search warrant. In addition, the warrant was read to him, in circumstances where the reading of its contents would have been heard by Ms Wisudo. The transcript of the video of the search process shows DI McDonald stating; after the warrant had been read out: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences to which this warrant relates are those specified above in the third condition and you actually have a copy of the warrant which dictates your rights as an occupier...there you go. I'm handing you a copy of the warrant. That's your copy.” 
        
       
      
    213 The events surrounding this conversation can be clearly seen on the video footage.  
     
      
    214 In my opinion, the proper interpretation of s 3H of the Crimes Act is that it requires the executing officer (or a constable assisting) to make available to the occupier, if he is present, a copy of the warrant. It does not require that a copy, or copies, be made available to other people who may be present and who may later have assumed, or might be taken to have assumed, the role of a representative for the occupier. For example, if the occupier, having been given a copy of the warrant, elects to absent himself from the premises before the search is carried out, there does not appear to me to be an obligation on the police to serve another occupant, who has decided to stay behind for any purpose, including one who has decided to witness the search. The section does not create an obligation to serve any person other than the occupier, if he is present. There is no obligation to serve multiple copies on all people who may be present at the premises. Service on a person who “apparently represents the occupier” is only required where that person is present, and the occupier himself has not been served. In the present case, the occupier was properly and legitimately removed before the search proper commenced. But he had been given a copy of the warrant at the commencement of the execution process. It was up to him to give that document to his wife if he wished, or to do with it as he determined. There was no obligation on the police to do anything further to satisfy the section. 
     
      
    215 In any event, Ms Wisudo made her election to leave the premises well before the accused was removed to go to the police station. He remained at the premises for approximately an hour after his wife left to go to her mother's home. Consequently, Ms Wisudo was not present at the time the accused left the premises, nor was she present at the time the search proper commenced. Even if I be wrong in my construction of the section, these particular circumstances must mean that no breach of s 3H occurred.  
     
      
    216 Insofar as Mr Waterstreet's argument submitted that Ms Wisudo remained at the home for some three hours before she decided to leave, this is not borne out by the evidence. It is simply incorrect. She left the premises shortly before 4am. As I have said, the accused was still there at that time. As he had been given a copy of the warrant, why would there a need for her to be given a copy of the warrant at the time she made her election not to stay? She was given the opportunity to stay if she wished, but she declined to do so.  
     
      
    217 I have, for the purpose of this argument, made the assumption that the evidence establishes that Ms Wisudo was not given a copy of the warrant. In fact, there is considerable doubt whether the accused has satisfactorily demonstrated this to be so. The onus is on the party seeking exclusion of the evidence to establish that it was illegally obtained. Ms Wisudo did not give evidence to suggest that she had not been given a copy of the warrant. Ms Rabiah Hutchinson asserted that neither she nor her daughter had been given a copy of the warrant, but, for reasons outlined earlier, I can give no weight to her evidence on that point. 
     
      
    218 The overall impact of the cross-examination of D I McDonald and D S Gawel may be summarised as indicating that neither of those officers could recall Ms Wisudo having been given a copy of the warrant, but that does not prove that she did not have a copy of the document.  
     
      
    219 In dealing with this point, however, I have been content to assume that Ms Wisudo may not have been served with a copy of the warrant. As I said earlier, the inference that she was not served, although not a strong one, is open. I have preferred, in these circumstances, to deal with the argument on its merits, rather than on the basis of an evidentiary failure by the accused to prove the factual matter asserted to have given rise to the suggested illegality. In the event that I am wrong on the construction point, or wrong in relation to my view, the particular circumstances had on the operation of the section, I will, at a later point in this decision, consider the availability of the s 138 discretion to admit the evidence said to be affected by the breach of s 3H 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    220 The only other two matters falling into the first category may also be disposed of briefly. The property seizure form was, it is conceded, the wrong form. Nothing, however, turns on that fact. In any event, the warrant had been executed at that stage, so that it could not be said that the material sought to be excluded was obtained as a result of the impropriety, if it be that, in using the wrong form.  
     
      
    221 Mr Waterstreet's final written submission acknowledged that the copy warrant given to the accused contained a document entitled ""Rights of the occupier"". That being so, there is no separate point available in relation to the material served on the accused. 
     
      
    222 Finally, there was the ""incident"" at the doorway of Ms Hutchinson's home. The factual findings I have made earlier in relation to that matter demonstrate that I accept the police evidence in that regard. I reject the evidence of Miss Hutchinson. I have found that there was no impropriety involved in the process related to the signing of the property seizure form.  
     
      
       
      Breach of s 3K of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       
      
    223 I turn now to consider the final matter, namely, the position of those items sought to be excluded under the second category. The accused's argument focused on the taking of the four hard drives, the CDs and DVDs.  
     
      
    224 As I understand it, Mr Lange provided the first written reply submission which clarified and settled the basis on which this argument was ultimately made. The clarification required the accused to obtain leave to amend the notice of motion so as to include the evidence obtained from the hard drives within the relief sought in accordance with paragraph 7 of the original notice of motion. No objection was taken to the amendment of the motion in this way.  
     
      
    225 Mr Lange argued that the evidence established that the executing officer did not inform the accused or any representative, or other occupier, of the address of the place and the time at which the examination of the hard drives would be carried out. This was in breach of s 3K(3)(a). Furthermore, at no stage, whether before or after the purported application for an extension of the time in which to conduct the examination (at least in the case of the hard drives), did the executing officer permit the accused, his representative or any other occupier to be present during the examination of the items. This was a breach of s 3K(3)(b).  
     
      
    226 In respect of the hard drives, there was also a failure to comply as well with the requirements of s 3K(3C). It was alleged that adequate notice of the extension application was not given to Mr Houda, the legal representative for a number of the accused, including Khaled Cheikho. Further, the entire application for the grant of an extension of time relating to the examination of the hard drives was flawed. It was not made by the executing officer but by D S Gawel. This constituted, it was argued, a significant breach of the overall requirements of s 3K.  
     
      
    227 In relation to the CDs and DVDs, they were simply taken from the premises. No extension was ever applied for, let alone obtained. No notice was given to the effect that the items would be retained beyond the period permissible pursuant to s 3K(3A) and there was also a breach of s 3K(3B) in that regard. No applications were made and granted under s 3K(3)(a) and (b). It may be helpful, before setting out the Crown response, to detail the provisions of s 3K: - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        CRIMES ACT 1914 - SECT 3K 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The executing officer or constable assisting may bring to the warrant premises any equipment reasonably necessary for the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) A thing found at the premises may be moved to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) both of the following apply:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) it is significantly more practicable to do so having regard to the timeliness and cost of examining or processing the thing at another place and the availability of expert assistance;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the thing contains or constitutes evidential material; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the occupier of the premises consents in writing.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) If a thing is moved to another place for the purpose of examination or processing under subsection (2), the executing officer must, if it is practicable to do so: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) inform the occupier of the address of the place and the time at which the examination or processing will be carried out; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) allow the occupier or his or her representative to be present during the examination or processing.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3A) The thing may be moved to another place for examination or processing for no longer than 72 hours.  
        
       
       
        
        (3B) An executing officer may apply to an issuing officer for one or more extensions of that time if the executing officer believes on reasonable grounds that the thing cannot be examined or processed within 72 hours or that time as previously extended.  
        
       
       
        
        (3C) The executing officer must give notice of the application to the occupier of the premises, and the occupier is entitled to be heard in relation to the application.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) The executing officer or a constable assisting may operate equipment already at the warrant premises to carry out the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant if the executing officer or constable believes on reasonable grounds that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the equipment is suitable for the examination or processing; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the examination or processing can be carried out without damage to the equipment or the thing."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    228 The Crown accepted that the hard drives had been removed by the police for examination pursuant to s 3K(2) of the Crimes Act 1914. It argued, however, that the accused had failed to satisfy the Court that there was a causal connection between any illegality and the obtaining of the evidence sought to be excluded. In other words, the Crown argued that the police had ""obtained"" the evidence lawfully when the hard drives were removed from the accused's premises. If there were any failure to comply with the legislation, that occurred after the police ""obtained"" the evidence.  
     
      
    229 In relation to the alleged breach relating to the four hard drives arising from the dual requirements of s 3K(3), the Crown pointed out that the statutory obligations only arise ""if it is practicable to do so"". The Crown argued that the accused had not discharged the onus to make out any illegality so far as this subsection was concerned.  
     
      
    230 In relation to subs 3K(3B) - that is the requirement that the executing officer may apply for an extension of time - the Crown concedes that there was a technical breach in that Detective Gawel was not the executing officer as required by the subsection. The Crown submitted that the breach was not a serious one.  
     
      
    231 In relation to the alleged breach concerning s 3K(3C), the Crown argued that this section was complied with “in substance”. Once again, the Crown submitted that the giving of notice by Federal Agent Morley to Mr Houda substantially satisfied the section and that, to the extent there was any breach, it was not a serious one.  
     
      
    232 I turn then to the Crown submissions relating to the DVDs and CD-Roms. The Crown posed a number of possible scenarios as to the way the evidence as to the taking of these items might be viewed. Essentially, the Crown submitted that the police had seized these items lawfully on the basis that they fell precisely within the terms of the search warrant, and thus there was no illegality. The Crown suggested, alternatively, there was a possibility that these items had been lawfully moved under s 3K(2) but that there may have been a failure, after they were taken, to obtain an extension for their examination. The Crown conceded, however, that this possibility was the least likely scenario, having regard to the evidence. Finally, the Crown allowed for the possibility that the police seizure of these items may have been done without the requisite determination that they fell within the terms of the search warrant. If that was so, it was conceded that there would have been an unlawful seizure.  
     
      
    233 The Crown submitted that, in relation to both the hard drives and the other items, an appropriate exercise of the discretion available under s 138 of the Evidence Act would satisfy the Court that, in all the circumstances, the desirability of admitting the evidence at trial far outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence that had been obtained in the way in which it had been obtained. The Crown made detailed submissions about a number of the matters required to be considered under s 138(3) of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    234 In their reply submissions, Messrs Waterstreet and Lange took issue with each of these matters.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
       
      (a) - The hard drives 
       
      
    235 As a consequence of an agreement between the parties, further facts in relation to the examination of the hard drives have come to light. These were reflected in the final written submissions filed on 15 and 17 September 2008. The further facts, and appropriate inferences from them, may be summarised as follows: - 
     
      
       
      (i) There were four hard drives taken from the premises. They appear in the property seizure record as items 13, 20, 26 and 29 (the first two were taken from the computer room, the last two from bedrooms). The hard drives were each “examined” by officers from the State Electronic Evidence Branch on 11 November 2005, that is within the authorised extension period and during the life of the warrant. 
       
       
      (ii) No evidential material was found on items 26 and 29. There was, however, evidential material which had been deleted, revealed on item 13. It related to bomb making and jihad. Item 20 revealed evidential material, being the Word document “virtues of martyrdom”. 
       
       
      (iii) I infer that the evidential material, having been revealed upon examination, was thereupon seized in terms of the warrant. It plainly satisfied the concept of evidential material in terms of the three warrant conditions. The seizure occurred during the authorised extension period and during the life of the warrant. 
       
       
      (iv) The process of examination took place at Bass Hill Police Station in the presence of D S Liddiard. 
       
       
      (v) Neither the accused nor his lawyers were present at the examination, nor were they invited to attend the examination.  
       
       
      (vi) The material taken from the hard drives is now in the possession of the accused’s legal representatives as part of the “commonalities” evidence, that is evidence the Crown will assert at trial was, as a matter of inference, shared between the accused. The duplication of the material and the fact that the accused’s possession of the material, would be relied on at trial was revealed in the original brief of evidence given to the accused’s solicitors prior to committal. 
       
       
      (vii) The accused has retained an expert to advise on any technical issues relating to the contents of the two hard drives that revealed evidential material. 
       
       
      (viii) Neither the accused, nor his lawyers, at any time have made an application for declaratory or other relief arising out of any issue connected with the irregular or illegal taking of the hard drives from the accused’s home on 8 November 2005. No action to recover the four hard drives was ever taken. 
       
      
    236 In my opinion, the facts as stated in the earlier parts of this decision, together with the further agreed facts, show that there were a number of breaches or failures to comply with the strict requirements of s 3K of the Crimes Act 1914. First, I find that the four hard drives were not “seized” at the premises but were simply removed for the purposes of examination to see whether they contained evidential material. Secondly, although they were examined within the confines of the extension period granted by Mr Peebles, the occupier was not notified of the place and the time at which the examination would be carried out. Thirdly, because this notification did not occur, it cannot be said that either the occupier or his or her representative was allowed to be present during the examination. I do not suggest that there was any positive decision made to refuse to allow , for example, Mr Houda to be present during the examination. Rather, I find that the possibility of his attendance, or that of anyone else, was simply overlooked through inadvertence.  
     
      
    237 I am conscious of the argument relied upon by the Crown that the obligation to give notice only arises “if it is practicable to do so”. I cannot see, however, on the facts of this matter that any officer formed the view that it would be impracticable to give notice. Rather, as I say, the process appears to have been simply overlooked through inadvertence. There would have been no difficulty involved in notifying the accused himself of the time and place at which the examination was to be carried out, even if the authorities were not prepared to allow him to attend personally. The accused may possibly have notified Mr Houda, and asked him to be present during the examination. Certainly, the evidence of Federal Agent Morley shows that Mr Houda was known to be the accused’s representative at the time the examination occurred. 
     
      
    238 I accept the Crown submission that these particular breaches were committed in the context of a complex investigation and in a situation where the statutory provisions were themselves complex. The overall operation on the morning of 8 November 2005 would have involved many police officers, some of them Federal and some State. It is clear that such briefings as occurred did not advert sufficiently to the terms of the legislation, and this is but one instance of inadvertence during the operation leading to unsatisfactory compliance with statutory obligations. 
     
      
    239 I find also that there was a breach of s 3K(3)(B) in that the application for extension of time was not made by the executing officer. I regard this as something in the nature of a technical breach. There were, as I have said, a multitude of police officers involved in this massive operation. It appears that, on occasions, delegations were made without the knowledge or direct acquiescence of the delegating officer. It is clear that a direction must have been given by a senior officer or officers–in-charge of the overall coordination, and it was in those circumstances that the application for extension of time was made by D S Gawel and not by D I McDonald. Detective Gawel actually attended before Mr Peebles and obtained a number of extensions of time, including the one related to Khaled Cheikho’s hard drives. Federal Agent Morley had made the appointment for the application to be made. The additional task was given to him to contact the solicitor for Khaled Cheikho, Adam Houda. Federal Agent Morley had nothing to do with the search process itself in relation to Khaled Cheikho, but had been delegated the particular task that I have identified. Mr Houda told him that he (Houda), had not received sufficient notice of the application to enable him to attend, and consequently, he would not be attending. Mr Houda did not, in fact, attend although there is uncertainty as to whether he had been told when the application was likely to be dealt with. I rather gather that he was not so told. It probably makes little difference, in one sense, because Mr Houda’s peremptory indication that he would not be attending, in a practical sense, obviated the need for any further discussion with him on the point. Mr Houda did not give evidence about the conversation or his own circumstances. I imagine he was very busy on the morning of 8 November 2005, but no reason has been advanced as to why he could not have sent an employee or representative to the extension application, had it been a matter of real concern to him. 
     
      
    240 I am prepared to find that there was some compliance with the provisions of s 3K(3)(C) but I would not necessarily agree with the Crown that it was “substantial compliance”. Once again I do not consider that this was a deliberate or calculated breach of the accused’s rights or the entitlements of Mr Houda. Mr Houda’s response really put paid to the prospect of any more formal notification being given to him. Criticism was made of Federal Agent Morley on the basis that he did not tell Mr Peebles of his approach to Mr Houda and the response. However, Federal Agent Morley was simply unable to recall whether he had informed the magistrate of the conversation with Mr Houda. I am not prepared to find that the magistrate was deliberately, or even inadvertently, mislead in any way. 
     
      
    241 In the upshot, there are three definite breaches, and one partial breach, of these provisions of the legislation. It will be necessary to return to these matters in the context of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      (b) - DVD’s and CD-Roms 
       
      
    242 From my reading of the statements of the seizing officers (to which I have made reference earlier in this decision), the transcript of the search warrant and the video itself, I conclude that, overall, the police treated these items seized as evidential material falling directly within the terms of the warrant. Items of this kind were directly mentioned in the warrant (see annexure to this decision). Although the extensive briefing sessions involving the police prior to the search failed to adequately instruct all police officers as to the complexity of the Commonwealth legislation, I am prepared to infer that the significance of CD’s, DVD’s and computers in relation to the offences in the warrant would have been well understood by the searching officers. The transcript of the search shows that there were many instances where particular items seized were identified as having a connection with terrorism. Some, on their face, certainly did. Others, I infer, were presumed to have been so connected. It is to be inferred that this was the view taken by the seizing officers in relation to the majority of the CD’s and DVD’s. 
     
      
    243 Much has been made in the written submissions of a statement made by Inspector McDonald at transcript 23 of the search warrant process. There, after locating items in a bag, some of which clearly appeared to fall within the terms of the warrant, Inspector McDonald is quoted as saying: - 
     
      
       
        
        “What we’ll do is just seize the whole bag and let the analyst go through the whole thing”. 
        
       
      
    244 This is at variance with other statements made by Inspector McDonald, and statements by other seizing officers during the search, where a more precise appreciation of a reasonable belief for it being suspected that items seized would afford evidence as to the commission of the relevant offence or offences appears. Overall, the impression I gained from all of the material to which I have made reference is that the searching officers, as well as Inspector McDonald, were putting their minds directly to the requirements of the warrant before deciding whether to make a seizure. This extended to the DVD’s and CD-Roms seized. It is true that several of the disks seized had titles on them that indicated they were children’s disks, but this is not to say that the officers did not consider that the items may have been falsely labelled or, at least, not accurately labelled. It needs to be borne in mind that the onus falls fairly and squarely on the accused here to demonstrate that, in the case of the DVD’s and CD-Roms, the authorities failed to comply with the requirements of the warrant itself. I am not satisfied that that onus has been discharged. There is a degree of difference between the situation arising where an application is made under s 138 of the New South Wales Evidence Act to exclude evidence on the basis of impropriety or illegality, and the situation arising in a judicial review application or other proceedings of an administrative nature. Even in the latter situation, an onus still falls on the applicant in a situation where a valid search warrant is in existence (Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819; Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301; [2001] 1111 FCR 175 at (235) per Hely J). Here, however, it is necessary for the accused to demonstrate that ss 3K(3)(a) and (b) were breached. It almost must also demonstrate that ss 3K(3)(B) and 3(C) were breached. In order to do this, it must show that the DVD’s and CD-Roms were moved to another place for examination or processing, rather than seized. This, the accused has failed to demonstrate. 
     
      
    245 In any event, as I have said, the evidence satisfied me that the seizing officers appear to have held a qualified or preliminary opinion as to the probative effect of documents seized, and thus fulfilled their obligation of acting reasonably in all the circumstances of the case. There is no necessary inconsistency between seizing documents in circumstances where the executing officer has the belief that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the material will afford evidence of the commission of an offence the subject of a warrant, and that same officer (or some other officer) later coming to a conclusion, on more detailed consideration of the material that it does not, in truth, have that effect. (Harts Australia Limited & Ors v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2002] 117 FCR 358 at (24) per Drummond J). Although Drummond J was reversed on appeal (Hart v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392, these general propositions were not called into question. Indeed, in the latter case the Court (French, Sackville & R D Nicholson JJ) observed at (68): - 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding these general considerations, effect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred. The need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed was acknowledged by the learned primary Judge, who referred in that connection to  
        Dunesky v Commonwealth 
         (1996) 89 A Crim R 372, at 382-383, per Lockhart J. See also

        Crowley v Murphy  
        [1981] FCA 31

          ""From the standpoint of principle it seems to me that the law must strive to reconcile two highly important interests which are liable to come into conflict - (a) the interest of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasions of his liberties by the authorities, and (b) the interests of the State to secure that evidence bearing upon the commission of crime and necessary to enable justice to be done shall not be withheld from Courts of law on any merely formal or technical ground. Neither of these objects can be insisted upon to the uttermost. The protection of the citizen is primarily protection for the innocent citizen against unwarranted, wrongful and perhaps high-handed interference, and the common sanction is an action of damages. The protection is not intended as a protection for the guilty citizen against the efforts of the public prosecutor to vindicate the law. On the other hand the interest of the State cannot be magnified to the point of causing all the 
            
          safeguards for the protection of the citizen to vanish, and of offering a positive inducement to the authorities to proceed by irregular methods.""

These remarks relate more to attacks upon the scope of warrants and action under them than to the construction of the statutes authorising the issue of such warrants. They nevertheless expose adequately the policy issues and legislative purposes which should inform construction. In particular, there is no requirement that the Court approach that task armed with a  
        prima facie  
        hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers. Privacy is but one of the interests to be taken into account in construing legislation authorising the exercise of such power.”

    246 I have found that a number of breaches occurred during the search process. I have also rejected the occurrence of other alleged breaches. Lest I be wrong in this latter regard, I will include a number of those in the s 138 exercise. I shall, first, catalogue the breaches. Secondly, I will identify the relevant “breaches” I have rejected.

      Breaches relating to the hard drives 
       
       
      (a) Breach of s 3K(3)(a) - failure to notify the occupier of the place and time at which the examination would be carried out. 
       
       
      (b) Breach of s 3K(3)(b) - failure to allow the occupier or his representative to be present during the examination. 
       
       
      (c)  
      Breaches of ss 3KP(3)(B) and (3)(C) 
       
      
    · Failure to make the application for extension in the name of the executing officer 
     
      
    · Failure to require the executing officer to form and hold the belief that the examination could not be processed within the 72 hours originally permitted by the legislation 
     
      
    · Failure by executing officer to give notice of the extension application to the occupier 
     
      
    · Failure, at least in part, by Federal Agent Morley to give adequate notice to Mr Houda 
     
      
       
      (ii)  
      Breaches alleged (but rejected) affecting all items seized during the search 
       
       
      (a) Breach of s 3H - Failure to give Ms Wisudo a copy of the search warrant.

        Discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence  
         
         
         
        (1) Evidence that was obtained:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or

        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
         
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence; and  
           
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; and

          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention; and

          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; and  
           
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    248 The Court of Criminal Appeal has itself considered the operation of s 138 of the Evidence Act in recent times. In R v Camilleri [2007] 68 NSWLR 720 (McClellan CJ at CL, Bell and Howie JJ) reinforced the views expressed by Howie J in R v EM [2003] NSWCCA 374, to the effect that s 138 is concerned with balancing public interests. McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said at 727 (31): - 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental concern of the section is to ensure that, if the law has been breached, or some other impropriety has been involved in obtaining evidence, this is balanced against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The competing interests are obedience to the law in the gathering of evidence and enforcement of the law in respect of offenders. In R v EM (at 74), Howie J said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The discretion under s 138 is similar to that which was described in R v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159 as the public policy discretion at common law. Of course, there is a significant difference between the discretion under s 138 and that at common law: the section requires that the Crown persuade the Court to admit evidence that was improperly or unlawfully obtained. But just as at common law, the public policy discretion was distinct and separate from the unfairness discretion, so the discretion to admit evidence under s 138 is a distinct and separate discretion from that arising under s 90. The two discretions may overlap but they are not synonymous. Section 138 is not, in its terms at least, concerned with the Court ensuring a fair trial for the accused. Certainly that is not a paramount consideration when exercising the discretion. The discretion exercised under s 138(1) seeks to balance two competing public interests, neither of which directly involves securing a fair trial for the accused.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    249 Considering the matters stipulated in s 138(3), McClellan CJ at CL said at (35): 
     
      
       
        
        “This case is to be distinguished from a situation where evidence is obtained by police in knowing breach of the law or, where they may be reckless as to whether or not it has been lawfully obtained. Where the breach of the law is innocent, and the alleged offence serious there must be powerful countervailing considerations before the evidence should be rejected. The fact that the evidence is of high probative value will weigh in favour of its admission.”",2008-09-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: After the jury was empanelled but before the Crown Prosecutor opened her case to the jury, Mr Thomas, counsel for the accused, applied for leave to cross-examine the complainant and other prosecution witnesses concerning the sexual reputation and sexual activity of the complainant and one N.2 The Crown case is that at about 4am on 1 January 2007 the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent. There are two counts in the indictment and they relate to an act of digital penetration followed some time later by an act of penile vaginal/penetration. Both incidents are said to have occurred in a recessed, cave like area of a cliff at Avalon Beach. The accused and the complainant, with other people, had earlier been at a New Year's Eve party at a house near that beach.3 It is common ground, as it appears in the statement of the complainant, that a short time before midnight at that party the complainant engaged in sexual activity with N. There is also a suggestion in the statement of the witness C of sexual activity involving the complainant and N on some earlier occasion. There is no mention of this in the statement of the complainant or anyone else. The source of C's knowledge is not disclosed in her statement. What she says is this:  
     
      
      ""At that stage (that is, early afternoon of 1 January 2007) I didn't know that N and the complainant had been at a party the night before and had sex but I knew they had hooked up in the past. By hooked up I mean they've (sic) haven't had sex before but done other sexual things"". 
      
    4 Such evidence is rendered inadmissible by s.293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Mr Thomas argues, however, that it comes within one or more of the exceptions within that section. The first question, however, is whether the evidence is relevant. Could it, either directly or indirectly, rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the trial? (s.55 Evidence Act 1995).5 Mr Thomas put it that such evidence was relevant in two ways. First, it may provide an alternative explanation for certain injuries sustained by the complainant. When she was examined by a doctor at Royal North Shore Hospital on the evening of 1 January 2007 she was found to have a bruise on the medial aspect of her left anterior thigh measuring approximately 1 centimetre in diameter. On genital examination there were mild but significant abrasions noted on both inner thighs. The fossa navicularis was noted to be tender on examination.6 When I asked Mr Thomas what the defence case was he told me that the accused conceded that the sexual activity alleged by the Crown did occur. More specifically, the accused will concede the act of digital penetration but on his account there is a difference as to the degree of such penetration. He will concede there was the act of penile/vaginal penetration but will claim it was not forced and against the complainant's will.7 The Crown then informed me that it will not be contending that the injuries noted on the medical examination of the complainant are consistent only with non-consensual sexual activity. That is, the Crown accepts that the injuries are equally consistent with having been caused by consensual activity.8 Having regard to these positions taken by the parties, I fail to see that evidence of the complainant having engaged in sexual activity with N some hours earlier in the night could have any bearing on providing an alternative explanation for the existence of the injuries. Indeed, there is simply no need for providing such an alternative explanation. Accordingly, I do not see the evidence as being relevant. Even if it was, and assuming that the matter could be brought within one of the exceptions in s.293, I am not of the view that the probative value of the evidence, if used for the purpose Mr Thomas seeks, outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant may experience as a result of admitting the evidence. 9 The second way in which Mr Thomas said the evidence was relevant concerns the fact that the complainant had contact with N, both in person and by telephone, on a number of occasions in the aftermath and during the day following whatever happened between her and the accused at the beach that New Year's day morning. In none of this contact did she make any complaint about having been sexually assaulted by the accused. Mr Thomas argued that if the jury were aware that the complainant was so close to N that she had been a sexual partner with him, both earlier in the night and, perhaps, on some prior occasion, or occasions, then they could take her failure to complain to him as reflecting adversely upon her credibility.10 Perhaps that renders the evidence relevant. However, I think it very much depends upon what explanation the complainant provides, if asked, for why she did not complain to N. On the one hand, if she said something along the lines of not complaining to N because he was not a person she was very close to, then the evidence might have more relevance than if she said she was very close to him but for some reason could not complain to him. In the material placed before me there is nothing to indicate what she might say, except that in paragraph 39 of her statement of 28 April 2007 she said she had a brief telephone conversation with N a short time after the incident but did not tell him what had happened. She said ""I was going to when he asked me if everything was all right but G was just chatting in my ear"". I suspect the complainant has more to say as to why she did not complain to N than just that. It may be that this issue may have to be revisited once her evidence on this topic has been given.11 Assuming for present purposes that the evidence is relevant, in order to be admissible it must come within one of the exceptions in s293. Mr Thomas has contended that the evidence falls within a number of the exceptions in sub-s (4) as well as within sub-s (6).12 He first contends that the evidence of the sexual activity with N forms ""part of a connected set of circumstances in which the prescribed sexual offence was committed"". That is the exception in s293(4)(a). In my view the only relevant connection between the two circumstances is that they occurred on the same night. It is more a matter of coincidence than relevant connection. As for any prior sexual activity between the complainant and N, there is not even that.13 Mr Thomas argued that there was also the exception in s293(4)(b) that the evidence ""relates to the relationship between the accused and the complainant"". In my view the sexual activity between N and the complainant can in no way be seen to relate to that relationship, if two people who happen to be at the same party, not having met before, can be said to have a relationship at all.14 Next it was contended that the exception in s293(4)(c) was made out. In view of what I have said earlier about the equivocal nature of the injuries, I do not accept this. Moreover paragraph (c) does not apply in any event because this is not a case in which the accused ""does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged"".15 Finally in relation to sub-s (4) it was contended that,  
     
      
      ""the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy (or possible pregnancy) in the complainant.""  
      
    16 This is the exception in paragraph (e), although it is to be noted that Mr Thomas has added the words “or possible pregnancy”. However, it is clear from the complainant's statement that her allegation of being sexually assaulted by the accused preceded her friend suggesting she go to a chemist and obtain a ""morning after"" pill. There is no basis in the evidence that has been placed before me to characterise this as a case where the complainant discovered she was (or might be) pregnant and then made an allegation that the accused had sexually assaulted her.17 Mr Thomas sought to come within this exception by submitting that at the time the complainant took her friend’s advice and obtained a “morning after” pill there had been no allegation made of the act of digital penetration by the accused. So, there was a realisation of the possibility of pregnancy that preceded the allegation of digital penetration.18 In my view that is a rather tortured and artificial view of the provision. Clearly it is designed to make an exception in the case of a woman who realises or discovers she is pregnant and then makes an allegation that a man has committed the act causing such pregnancy against her will. I cannot see how an act of digital penetration can be brought within the terms of this exception.19 So much for s294(4). Mr Thomas also submitted that the sexual activity earlier in the night, and sexual activity of some nature on a prior occasion, or on prior occasions, with N is disclosed or implied in the prosecution case and it ""might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused if the complainant and other prosecution witnesses could not be cross-examined in relation to that disclosure or implication"". This is the exception in s293(6). The problem with this is that whilst police have included such material in witness statements, the Crown Prosecutor informed me that it forms no part of the prosecution case here at trial. Accordingly, in the prosecution case to be presented to the jury there will be no such disclosure or implication. Section 293(6) does not, therefore, apply.20 These are my reasons for holding that the evidence is inadmissible and such cross-examination as proposed should not be permitted.

   JUDGMENT1. On 5 September 2008 I sentenced Mr Hughes in respect of two offences. By an oversight my attention was not drawn to an additional matter that Mr Hughes was charged with. He was charged with, without reasonable excuse having in his custody an offensive implement, namely a small black replica handgun in a public place. That is an offence under s 11B(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 and carries a maximum of two years imprisonment. 2. I have been asked to deal with that offence under s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as a related offence. Both the prosecution and the defence suggest that a custodial sentence would be appropriate, backdated to the commencement of the other sentences, namely 21 July 2007. That is the course I propose to adopt.3. Accordingly, I sentence you Mr Hughes to seven months imprisonment in respect of the offence of having in your custody the offensive implement. That sentence is to commence on 21 July 2007 and expire on 20 February 2008. I do not set a non-parole period because the sentence has expired and also because the sentence is concurrent with an existing custodial sentence or an existing non-parole period. [just mark the certificate, I think you said, “SC”.

We have to deal with these charges which were hanging around, or that particular charge, but you have now served the sentence so far as that is concerned. Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: It expired February 20 this year. You have now served the sentence. Is there anything else?MUDDER: No, your Honour.BUCKMAN: No, your Honour.

   SENTENCE1. Comax-Pharma Pty Ltd (Comax) pleaded guilty to two charges that it manufactured therapeutic goods knowing that those goods were counterfeit, because they contained false representations about the identity of the goods, contrary to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, (the Act), section 42E. It also asked me to take into account a further charge that it breached a condition of a licence under that Act by failing to ensure that the person, nominated by it as having control of quality control measures in respect of the goods, maintained that control.2. The maximum penalty for each of the two charges in the indictment is $220,000 for individuals, but because the offender is a corporation, the maximum pecuniary penalty is five times that sum, $1.1 million.3. A number of other persons have been charged in relation to this offence, as accessories. Each has now pleaded guilty, having earlier defended the charges, and they will be sentenced later. They are Dr Shahid, Dr Adil, and Mr Jobanputra. Dr Shahid was the quality control manager of the offender, Dr Adil was the quality assurance manager, and Mr Jobanputra, the production manager. In theory, the production and quality control operations of the offender were supposed to be separate, according to the code of good practice for the pharmaceutical industry, but, in fact, Dr Adil was answerable to Dr Shahid, and Dr Shahid appeared to be answerable to Mr Jobanputra. There was a director of the offender, Mr Sohn, but I am told from the Bar table that he knew nothing of these offences until they had been reported. It is the responsibility of the directors and officers of a corporation that they ensure that the corporation obeys the law, and it is that failure on the directors’ part that gives rise to the charge on the s 16BA Form.4. At the time the charges were laid, the company appeared to be functioning, but it subsequently went into administration, and is now in liquidation. A committal hearing was held and the offender and the three individuals defended the charge against them. A solicitor represented the liquidator on the sentencing hearing. The company has stopped trading, and the three other persons charged are no longer employed by it.5. At relevant times Comax held a licence under the Act to manufacture goods of specified classes, including those in respect of which these charges were brought. The Act (s 3) gives an extended definition to the term 'manufacture', and it includes any part of the process of bringing the goods to their final state including labeling, testing or releasing for supply the goods or any component or ingredient of them. Therapeutic goods are counterfeit, and therefore manufactured in breach of the Act, s 42E, if false representations are made about them in documents or records relating to the goods or their manufacture. These charges concerned internally generated records and laboratory test results in respect of two particular therapeutic goods, which Comax manufactured on a contract basis for companies, which held the registration for those goods.6. The two products in question are batch 9993 of AB Isobone, which is indicated for temporary pain relief for rheumatism and symptomatic relief of rheumatism and osteoarthritis, and batch 10121 of Lior Red Grape Seed, indicated for use to assist with maintenance or improvement of general well-being and to help maintain a healthy immune system. This product was also released by Comax as a finished product using a registered export alias, Hi-Life Red Grape Seed, batch number 10128.7. Comax adopted, for both these batches, the TGA laboratories guideline for assessing the results of microbial tests on non-sterile pharmaceuticals. These guidelines provided test limits for products containing raw materials of vegetable or animal origin. These limits included specified amounts of yeast, mould, enterobacteria, E coli and salmonella. E coli and salmonella are both a risk to human health, E coli if it can be detected in 1 g of the product, and salmonella if it can be detected in 10 g of the product. The limits are expressed in terms of not more than (NMT) 100 colony forming units (cfu) per gram. The standards allow a certain tolerance.8. Comax had its own specifications. This was, in each case, 100 cfu/g without the tolerance allowed by the TGA standard. The test limit for both the batches in question was exceeded. The failed tests for both batches indicated that neither E coli nor salmonella had been detected, but there was a risk that this was a ‘false negative’ because where there is a reading of between 100 and 500 cfu/g, the presence of E coli and salmonella among other enterobacteria can be masked. When the reading is above 500 cfu/g, the masking effect risk is much greater. In fact, as part of the investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (‘TGA’), further tests were undertaken on both batches, and those tests did not detect levels of enterobacteria in excess of the guidelines.9. Comax contracted out its laboratory testing to a licensed laboratory, AMS Laboratories Pty Ltd. The results produced by that laboratory have never been invalidated and it has not been suggested that the laboratory had any knowledge of the substitution.Offence in relation to AB Isobone10. The test procedures and records in this case were falsified in the following way. When Comax found that the microbial test results for the batches were fail results, it submitted for retesting samples purportedly from the same batch of each product, but which were, in fact, not samples from those batches at all. In the case of AB Isobone, the sample submitted was from a prior batch of the same product. In the case of the grape seed, the sample was from a batch of a different grape seed product made for a different customer. The retesting of both batches produced a pass result.11. In my view, the obtaining of a fail result was not, in itself, serious. The serious element of the offences was the deliberate submission for retesting of samples drawn from a different bulk of the product from that which Comax intended to supply.12. Comax also produced an internal interim certificate of analysis which falsely stated that batch 9993 of AB Isobone had passed microbial testing, when the only existing test result at that time was a fail result. This is also a serious element of the offence.13. Late in January 2005, a Dr Ahmed, a microbiologist employed by Comax, reported the matter to the TGA. There was also another ‘whistleblower’. Dr Ahmed supplied copies of key documents and gave them to the TGA. This led to the execution of search warrants and obtaining of further witness statements.14. The manufacture of batch 9993 of AB Isobone took place on 15 December 2004 and the test commenced the following day. Dr Ahmed was instructed to undertake unofficial microbial testing, and he obtained a fail result. It took several days. About 20 December 2004, Dr Ahmed reported the results to Mr Jobanputra, who said that the result must be wrong. The batch was intended to be exported and there was pressure to complete the delivery. A sample from the batch was sent to AMS Laboratories Pty Ltd on 17 December, before Dr Ahmed had any results.15. On 21 December 2004, Dr Adil signed an internal ‘interim report certificate of analysis’ which included the following entry: "" Enterobacteria Not more than 100 cfu/g"". By that time, the internal testing by Comax revealed an enterobacteria count of 390 cfu/g. On 24 December, at about 3 in the afternoon, the laboratory faxed a certificate to Comax stating that the sample had failed to meet the specifications because the enterobacteria count was too high.16. The next working day was 29 December. Mr Jobanputra came to the general office area where Dr Adil and Dr Shahid worked. Dr Ahmed was also present. Dr Adil and Dr Ahmed both said that the results were outside the specification. Mr Jobanputra was sitting at Dr Shahid's desk. He wrote on a small yellow post-it note ""send old batch to get and get new test result"" and attached the note to the certificate. Dr Ahmed asked Dr Adil about this message and specifically asked if Comax was going to swap the samples. Dr Adil replied, ""Yes, they do it that way.""17. The same day Dr Adil prepared and signed the final internal certificate of analysis which falsely represented that batch 9993 of AB Isobone had no more than 100 cfu/g of enterobacteriaceae, and therefore had passed testing. Dr Ahmed was told to countersign the certificate, but gave evidence at the committal that he did not realise that he was signing a false certificate until later. Dr Adil said that he was told to sign the fake certificate by Mr Jobanputra, to enable the product to be released. He said that he, Dr Adil, knew that this was not correct and questioned Mr Jobanputra. Mr Jobanputra told Dr Adil that he would accept responsibility. Mr Jobanputra apparently was very angry with Dr Adil, who felt intimidated.18. The false certificate was sent to the customer, who required a certificate of analysis.19. On 4 January 2005, Dr Adil signed a check list of ‘release for supply bulk of batch 9993 of AB Isobone’ which falsely stated that quality control tests had been taken and passed. At the time Dr Adil knew that the only test result was a fail result.20. On the same day, the second purported sample of batch 9993 of AB Isobone was sent to the laboratory for retesting. In fact, this sample was taken from batch 9903. The Crown case is that Dr Shahid organised this at the direction of Mr Jobanputra. On 10 January 2005, the laboratory faxed to Comax a new certificate of sample indicating that the sample had passed. It was false because the sample was, in fact, from a different batch. The batch was exported to Vietnam, but subsequently repatriated and returned to Comax. No part of it reached any consumer.Offence in relation to Red Grape Seed21. Genesis MFG Australia Pty Ltd was the sponsor for Lior Red Grape Seed. On 16 November 2004, it placed an order initially for 200,000 capsules with a delivery date before 20 January 2005. This was subsequently increased to 300,000 capsules on or before 17 January 2005. The capsules for batch 10121 were made by Comax on 11 January. On the same day a sample was sent to the laboratory for microbial testing. On 17 January, the laboratory faxed a certificate indicating that the sample had failed to meet specifications because the enterobacteriaceae count was too high (220 cfu/g). The next day a second purported sample for batch 10121 was sent to the laboratory. In fact, this sample came from batch 9981 of Homart grape seed. This happened because a junior employee of Comax, Mr Choudhari, was instructed to obtain samples from batch 9981 and change the label to show batch 10121. The dispatch record produced for Comax falsely represented that the sample was from batch 10121. On 24 January, the laboratory faxed a new certificate of analysis to Comax, indicating that the sample had met the specifications and passed. This certificate was false because the sample was from a different batch.22. This product was never finally packaged in the intended form because, when it became aware of what had happened, the customer cancelled the order. Some of it was repackaged under Comax's own label, but was never sold.The seriousness of the offence23. Offences of this nature are particularly serious because of the potential risk to human life and health. The statutory regime for the control and manufacture of therapeutic goods is strict because, if stringent requirements are not complied with, there is a risk that the products will be unsafe. I emphasise that, in this case, there is no evidence that any product manufactured by Comax actually caused a risk of harm to anyone. However, unless the requirements for testing and marketing of therapeutic products are enforced strictly, there is a danger to health generally.24. The falsification of the testing process in respect of both products was carried out because Comax and its senior officers, particularly Mr Jobanputra, were anxious that the customers should receive the products on time. They appeared to act with reckless disregard of the potential risk, for example, of the presence of salmonella or E coli organisms in the capsules. If the deceitful activities had resulted in death or injury to a consumer, the company and its officers might well be facing more serious charges. The only possible motive for Comax to commit the offences was that it would lead to profitable trade.The appropriate penalty25. In the circumstances, in the case of an individual offender, it is possible, indeed likely, that the only appropriate penalty would be a sentence of full-time custody. The offence is so serious that the penalty must be substantial.26. The persons responsible for these offences, Mr Jobanputra, Dr Adil and Dr Shahid, were senior officers of the company. 27. Because the company is in liquidation, what, in respect of individuals, is referred to as ‘personal deterrence’ is not relevant here. 28. What is important is the message these sentences send to the community, and in particular to the therapeutic goods industry. General deterrence is important, both for corporations who might otherwise be tempted to commit similar offences, and to the employees and officers of such corporations, who must be aware that their careers, and indeed their very employment, will be at risk if such conduct is allowed to continue unpunished. The financial penalties may reasonably be such as would force corporations out of business, in sufficiently serious cases. The message should be that every director, officer and employee of a business engaged in the production of therapeutic goods, should be vigilant to ensure that offences are not committed. In this case, the offences were detected before any possible harm could have ensued, because of the vigilance of a diligent employee.29. The statutory regime established by the Therapeutic Goods Act depends very largely on self-regulation. That means that every business in this industry is required to put aside the profit motive, if profitability might conflict with the requirements of the regime. This is not an undue interference with the operations of the market, or with the obligations of directors and officers of a corporation, because Parliament has determined, in the interest of public safety, to establish a regime of self-regulation which requires a great deal of commercial self-control. That policy overrides the obligations to make profits, and must be enforced by severe punishment of those who do not exercise the necessary measure of commercial self-restraint.30. The Crimes Act 1914, s 16A, provides a checklist, which is less applicable in the case of corporate offenders than it is in the case of individuals, but I have considered each of the relevant matters specified in that section. Neither Comax, nor any of the individual officers concerned, has any previous convictions.31. In this case, there appeared to be an attitude within Comax that it was acceptable to falsify test results, and to issue false certificates in respect of therapeutic goods. In respect of both the products giving rise to these charges, the unlawful activities were undertaken by senior officers of the company, acting deliberately if not for profit, by inference from their own desire to be seen in a favourable corporate light. The ignorance of the director is absolutely no excuse. It was his responsibility to be vigilant to ensure compliance with the law. The two offences were discovered due to the prompt action of a ‘whistleblower’. This suggests that there was a culture of non-compliance with the regulatory regime which, if it had not been stopped, might well have resulted in further offences. That does not suggest that I should do anything other than impose a penalty for those offences of which the offender is guilty.32. The plea of guilty was entered at, or shortly before, the date fixed for trial of both the offender and of the individuals who have been charged. However, there was a contested committal hearing, so any discount for the plea of guilty will be less than if it had been entered at the earliest opportunity, because the Crown has been relieved, only partly, of the need to prepare a complicated case. I propose to reduce the fines that I will impose by 10% to represent a discount for the value of the plea of guilty, in reducing the need for a long and costly trial.33. I have been provided with some remarks on the sentencing of other persons charged with offences under the same statutory provision.34. Of those, only the remarks of his Honour Judge Charteris SC in Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd (12 December 2005) really provide me with any guidance. In that case, a company was convicted of a much larger number of offences and also of some offences under State law. In that case, the company had actually manufactured and sold therapeutic products to members of the public, some of whom had suffered illness as a result. There was, undoubtedly, within the company, a culture of non-compliance with the regulatory regime. However, I regard the fines as imposed by his Honour as being reduced substantially because of the principles of totality, in view of the overall number of offences. The principle of totality applies here because there are two offences, but, because there are only two offences, the effect of the principle is to effect a smaller reduction in the individual fines for each offence. I accept his Honour's starting point of a fine of $500,000 as being appropriate in general terms. In my view, the offences committed by Comax are not as serious as those committed by the offender in the Pan case, because no harm was actually caused. The culture of non-compliance had not developed in Comax to the same degree as it had in Pan. Nevertheless, there was a reckless disregard for the law, and for community safety at the highest levels of management, and a preparedness on the part of senior managers to disregard safety and the law, in the pursuit of profit. 35. In other respects, I respectfully adopt and apply what Judge Charteris said in the Pan case.36. It was submitted before me, as it was before Judge Charteris, that the interests of unsecured creditors must be considered. That is undoubtedly true, but, in my view, the public interest in sending a message to the industry and the community must outweigh the interests of any particular creditors.37. The offender, having pleaded guilty, is convicted.38. In this case, I have had regard to the principle of totality. On the first count, taking into account the offence on the form tendered in accordance with the Crimes Act section 16BA, but for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a fine of $300,000. That will be reduced to $270,000. On the second count, making a similar discount, there will be a fine of $252,000. The total fine will therefore be $522,000.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J:  
     
      
      Conviction and sentence: 
       
      The appellant, Nekzad Irani, was arraigned on four counts of supplying a prohibited drug, namely cocaine. The trial before Williams DCJ commenced on 19 February 2007. A jury was empanelled on 26 February 2007. On 14 March 2007 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to each count.  
       
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced on 7 June 2007. The sentences imposed were: 
     
      
      Count 1  
      – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of term of 1 year commencing 4 January 2007. 
       
       
      Count 2 
       – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of term of 1 year commencing 4 January 2007. 
       
       
      Count 3 
       – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 1½ years commencing 4 July 2007. 
       
       
      Count 4 
       – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 1½ years commencing 4 July 2007. 
       
       
      The effective overall term was a non-parole period of 3½ years with a balance of term of 1½ years. 
       
       
      Ground of Appeal 
       
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his convictions. The single ground of appeal relied upon was: 
     
      
      The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Detective Robinson in relation to voice identification of the accused. 
       
       
      Crown case 
       
      
    5 It was the Crown case that the appellant was involved in four separate supplies of cocaine to an undercover informant. The purchases occurred at a nightclub called “Lady Jane’s” where the appellant worked. Before each purchase, police gave the informant the necessary funds and a listening device. The transactions were recorded. After each supply the informant gave police the cocaine he had just purchased. The Crown case consisted of the informant’s direct evidence of the transactions, together with the recordings of the purchases. That evidence was corroborated by the police evidence of providing the money and receiving the cocaine almost immediately after each purchase.  
     
      
    6 By way of further corroboration, the Crown relied upon the evidence of Detective Robinson. Detective Robinson prepared the transcripts from the listening device recordings obtained by the informant. There were 29 recordings in all, 9 involving the appellant.  
     
      
    7 The evidence of Detective Robinson was that he had spent about two months listening to the recordings, playing and replaying them to prepare accurate transcripts of the relevant portions of the recordings. He also spent about four days replaying the recordings to the informant for him to confirm the accuracy of the transcripts. On a number of occasions the only persons talking and present at the time of a recorded conversation were the informant and the person Detective Robinson identified as the appellant. 
     
      
    8 Detective Robinson gave evidence that as a result of that lengthy process, he had become very familiar with the voices on the tapes, including the voice of the appellant. When the appellant and his co-offender, Justin Stokes, presented themselves at Surry Hills Police Station, Detective Robinson said he immediately identified their voices. He recognised the appellant’s voice as the voice of the person “Nick” on the tapes. The appellant said little upon his arrival at the police station. Subsequently a forensic procedure was carried out in relation to the appellant during the course of which the appellant spoke and was overheard by Detective Robinson. The forensic procedure and the appellant’s conversation were video recorded and became exhibit A1 at the trial. 
     
      
    9 The voices on the recordings were distinctive. The informant had a heavy Scottish accent, Mr Stokes spoke with a lisp and Mr Vincent had a softly spoken voice. The voice which Detective Robinson attributed to the appellant he described as “being that of an adult, a man in his twenties, of predominantly Australian accent but with overtones perhaps of another accent” which he described as “either Arabic or Middle Eastern”. 
     
      
       
      Case for the appellant 
       
      
    10 The main issue at trial was whether the informant lied in naming the appellant as one of the people involved. The informant had been granted an indemnity in respect of some serious offences in return for his participation in this operation. It was accepted that the drugs had been supplied by the principal, Tony Vincent, and therefore, to that extent, the informant’s evidence was accurate, but his allegations against the appellant were said to be deliberately false. The defence case was that the informant had a motive to ensure that this operation resulted in as many charges as possible and for that reason he had falsely named the appellant as the person referred to as “Nick” on the recordings. 
     
      
    11 The possibility of mistaken identification did not arise in relation to the informant’s evidence because the informant had known the appellant for over two years before the transactions and his evidence was direct evidence of the transactions involving the appellant. The issue was fabrication, rather than identification, as between the appellant and the informant. The appellant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    12 The appellant objected to the admissibility of the evidence of Detective Robinson and relied upon s 137 of the Evidence Act. His Honour received evidence on the voir dire and in a judgment handed down on 22 February 2007, found that s 137 did not operate to exclude the evidence. His Honour noted that in order to obviate any unfairness, it would be necessary for a clear warning to be given to the jury as to what use they could make of that evidence. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s submissions 
       
      
    13 On the appeal, the basis for the appellant’s challenge to the admission of the evidence of Detective Robinson was that his Honour had failed to properly apply s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “137 In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
       
      The term “probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act: 
       
       
        
        “Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the assistance of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant submitted that his Honour failed to carry out the balancing process required by s 137 in that he failed to properly assess the “probative value” of the evidence of Detective Robinson and balance it against the danger of unfair prejudice (R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [19] – [20]). Had his Honour done so, it was submitted, he would have assessed the probative value of the evidence of Detective Robinson as slight. It was accepted by the appellant that the evidence of Detective Robinson was relevant and in accordance with the authorities, Detective Robinson was correctly characterised as an “ad hoc” expert. 
     
      
    15 Although his Honour only referred to the balancing exercise between probative value and unfair prejudice on the last page of his judgment, it is clear from the substance of the judgment that his Honour directed most of his attention to an assessment of the probative value of the evidence of Detective Robinson. That was why his Honour referred to the decisions of R v Leung and Wong (1999) 47 NSWLR 405, R v Camilleri (2001) 127 A Crim R 290 and R v Li (2003) 140 A Crim R 288. What his Honour sought to do was to compare the probative value of the voice recognition evidence admitted in those cases with the evidence of Detective Robinson. It would have been better for his Honour to make clear that this was what he was doing. Nevertheless, it is obvious that a balancing process did take place. 
     
      
    16 The appellant submitted that had his Honour approached the question of “probative value” correctly, he would have found that the evidence of Detective Robinson was “tainted” by the way in which he reached the conclusion that the appellant was the person “Nick” speaking on the tapes. The court was directed to the fact that Detective Robinson had the statements of the informant before him when he was listening to the tapes and subsequently over four days played the tapes in the presence of the informant to clarify the accuracy of his transcription. It was submitted that this had the effect of Detective Robinson being impermissibly influenced by the evidence of the informant and not really using his own judgment. 
     
      
    17 It was submitted that there was a further problem with the evidence. Detective Robinson was part of the investigation team which effected the arrest of the appellant. The identification of the appellant’s voice when he was arrested at the police station and when the forensic procedure was being carried out, was therefore analogous to a witness making a dock identification at a trial. The submission was that when the appellant was at the police station Detective Robinson’s apparent recognition of his voice was merely confirmation of the impression he had already formed based on what he had been told by the informant.  
     
      
    18 The difficulty with that submission is that the analogy with a dock identification is not made out. The submission fails to have regard to the concession that Detective Robinson was an ad hoc expert. After months of replaying the recordings he had gained substantial expertise in being able to identify the individual voices. That expertise enabled him (if he was accepted) to say when he heard the appellant’s voice at the police station that this was one of the voices which he had heard on the recordings, ie the voice which he attributed to “Nick”. Accordingly this evidence had real probative force despite the fact that in gaining that expertise he may have been influenced by the statements of the informant. 
     
      
    19 As was pointed out in the Crown submissions, in voice identification cases of this kind the ad hoc expert is rarely asked to do a “blind” comparison. There is inevitably a strong suggestion that at least one of the voices the ad hoc expert has been asked to listened to, will be the voice with which the expert is familiar. 
     
      
    20 In Leung and Wong although Simpson J identified deficiencies in the way in which the comparison of voices was undertaken, she found that the interpreter’s evidence that the two voices were the same as the two voices he had heard in the recorded conversations, was correctly admitted. Leung and Wong made it clear that the evaluation of those deficiencies and the weight to be given to the evidence of identity was a matter for the jury, subject to the appropriate warnings being given by the trial judge. 
     
      
    21 An analysis of other voice identification cases supports that conclusion. In R v Camilleri the police officer heard the accused’s voice during the execution of a search warrant. Later on the same day the officer also conducted an ERISP when the accused refused to answer any questions. On the basis of the familiarity with the accused’s voice acquired that day he purported to identify the accused’s voice on some listening device recordings. The fact that the police officer had such limited familiarity with the voice and the fact that he was told in advance that it was the accused’ voice on the tapes which he was asked to identify, did not mean that the evidence should not have been admitted. 
     
      
    22 In R v Riscuta and Niga [2003] NSWCCA 6 the interpreter heard the accused’s voice during 15-20 minutes of an interview in English in 1993 and more than 18 months later in 1994 on some listening device recordings in Romanian. In 2001, seven years later, the interpreter spontaneously “remembered” that the voice on the 1994 tapes was the same voice as that in the 1993 interview. This Court held that the evidence was admissible and that s 137 did not require its exclusion. The court stressed that appropriate directions were required to highlight the special caution needed in assessing such evidence. 
     
      
    23 In R v Li the interpreter listened to five audiotapes “for many hours over many days” where the language spoken was principally Cantonese. One year later he heard part of an ERISP and identified the accused on the ERISP as one of the voices on the tapes he had heard one year earlier. This evidence was held to have been correctly admitted. The argument that the identification was “tainted” based on Simpson J’s comments in Leung and Wong, because the interpreter was comparing only one voice and must have known that the person on the ERISP was a suspect, was rejected. 
     
      
    24 In R v Madigan [2005] NSWCCA 170 two police officers, who prepared transcripts of audio surveillance recordings, purported to identify the accused’s voice. One officer said he spent about 50 hours listening to the recordings and identified the accused’s voice based on his memory of the accused’s voice from having known him some years earlier and encountering him on a couple of occasions since. The second officer said she had spent about a week listening to the recordings and identified the accused’s voice when she spoke to him for 2-3 minutes while he was fingerprinted and during an ERISP interview in which he said very little. This evidence was held to be admissible. The limited opportunity to compare the voices and other reservations about this evidence went to the weight of the evidence. It was held that appropriate directions were given to assist the jury assess the weight of the evidence. 
     
      
    25 The submission also fails to have regard to the way in which this Court has interpreted the words “probative value” as used in s 137. Cases such as R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 66, R v Rahme [2004] NSWCCA 233 and R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 have given a restrictive interpretation to the words. As Spigelman CJ said in Shamouil: 
     
      
       
        
        “[60] The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.  
        
       
       
        
        [61] In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word  
        could 
         in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …”. The focus on  
        capability 
         draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to that which a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has “probative value”, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty … 
        
       
       
        
        [64] To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in a different, but not irrelevant, context in  
        Doney v The Queen 
         (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible “basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function”. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s 137.” 
        
       
      
    26 It was common ground that the warnings given by his Honour in relation to the evidence of Detective Robinson were strong and comprehensive and no complaint is made in relation to them. It follows that I am not persuaded that the s 137 balancing exercise miscarried because his Honour failed to have due regard to the “tainted” nature of the evidence of Detective Robinson when assessing its probative value. 
     
      
    27 His Honour’s assessment of the probative value of that evidence was challenged in another respect. This challenge relied upon the decision in Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650. While accepting that the evidence of Detective Robinson was relevant, it was submitted that this evidence had little probative value because exactly the same exercise could and should have been carried out by the jury. In that regard, the following comment by his Honour in his judgment on the voir dire was criticised: 
     
      
       
        
        “A jury is not expected to play amateur detective by spending many unproductive hours and maybe days listening to tapes to sort out what is being said and by whom. Indeed if a jury has no opportunity at being able to compare an accused’s voice with what they hear on the tape the problem is amplified. In the present case there is no ERISP in respect of any of the alleged offenders, and it would be fair to say that a jury would have great difficulty in picking up what was said by anyone, in some instances without listening to the tapes a number of times.” 
        
       
      
    28 The submission is not made out. The analogy with Smith is not valid. The police officers in Smith were in no better position than the jury in identifying the accused as being the person depicted in the bank photographs. In this case Detective Robinson had spent two months repetitively playing and listening to the recordings in order to gain his ad hoc expertise. That placed him in a different position to the jury in that he had an expertise which they lacked. 
     
      
    29 The observation by his Honour which is criticised did no more than make that very point. His Honour was not indicating that the jury should not or could not compare the voice of the appellant, as disclosed by the videotape of the forensic procedure, with the voice on the intercept tapes. All his Honour was doing was pointing out that Detective Robinson had been able to do that which the jury would not be able to do, ie spend 2 months familiarising themselves with the voices on the intercept tapes.  
     
      
    30 The appellant also submitted that the s 137 balancing exercise had miscarried because his Honour had placed undue weight on the decision in Leung and Wong. It was submitted that the facts of that case were significantly different in that some of the tapes contained conversations in Cantonese which the jury would not have had expertise to interpret for themselves. In that case the interpreter, Mr Fung, was able to carry out an identification process which the jury could not. 
     
      
    31 This submission is not made out. His Honour appreciated that the factual scenario was different where a foreign language was involved (judgment 7.5). His Honour’s reliance on this case was not so much for its factual similarity but because of the statements of principle set out therein which his Honour quoted in his judgment. The statement of principle in R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 40 at 49 was quoted by his Honour. This extract, which was endorsed by the High Court in Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 was applied in Leung and Wong. It seems particularly apt for this case and his Honour was entitled to rely upon and apply it: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the tape is reasonably short and clearly audible there can normally be no justification for allowing a transcript as well as playing the tape. But there will be cases in which the aid of an expert is reasonably necessary. For example, there may be the use of a foreign language. Or deficiencies in the recording may make it necessary to play tapes more than once to enable a better understanding, yet the sheer length of the tapes may mean that inordinate time would be taken by replaying them to the jury. In such cases, while there should normally be at least one playing to the jury, the evidence of an expert should be admissible as an aid to the jury. He may be a temporary expert in the sense that by repeated listening to the tapes he has qualified himself ad hoc. And we see no compelling reason why this evidence should not take the form of production of a transcript which can be admitted as an exhibit.” 
        
       
      
    32 No complaint appears to be made in relation to his Honour’s analysis of the “unfair prejudice” likely to arise if the evidence of Detective Robinson was admitted. The danger was that the evidence had the appearance of independent corroboration by an expert of the evidence of the informant. His Honour was well aware of that danger but concluded that it could be reduced if not eliminated by clear directions to the jury. In those circumstances, his Honour was entitled to conclude that the probative value of the evidence of Detective Robinson was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Accordingly, no error has been made out in his Honour’s application of s 137 of the Evidence Act to this evidence. 
     
      
    33 I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    34 HARRISON J: I agree with Hoeben J and with the order he proposes.

      Offences and sentence 
       
      On 4 December 2007 the applicant was sentenced by Christie DCJ in respect of the following offences. Before his Honour the applicant adhered to a plea of guilty entered at the Liverpool Local Court on 23 May 2007. 
       
       
      Count 1 
       – Between 24–26 December 2006 breaking and entering the Camden Golf Club and stealing $28,140 contrary to s 112 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years). 
       
       
      Count 2 
       – Between 24–26 December 2006 maliciously damaging an automatic teller machine contrary to s 195(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years). 
       
       
      Count 3 - 
       Between 24-26 December 2006 maliciously damaging a video surveillance camera contrary to s 195(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years). 
       
       
      An offence of maliciously damaging a “Chubb” brand safe contrary to s 195(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 was taken into account on a Form 1 when the applicant was sentenced in respect of count 1. 
       
      
    4 His Honour imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 –  
      Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 5 January 2007 and expiring 4 January 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 4 January 2013. 
       
       
      Count 2 
       – A fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year commencing 5 January 2007 and expiring 4 January 2008. 
       
       
      Count 3 
       – A fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year commencing 5 January 2007 and expiring 4 January 2008. 
       
      
    5 The effect of those sentences was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 2 years. It should be noted that at the time of sentencing the applicant had served a balance of parole from a previous sentence from 5 January 2007 to 30 May 2007. He had also served a 4 month sentence for goods in custody, which was backdated to 12 December 2006 and which expired on 11 April 2007. 
     
      
       
      Background to offences 
       
      
    6 On 21 and 22 December 2006 the applicant attended the Camden Golf Club. He signed the guest register under a false name. It was accepted that these attendances were made to investigate the premises for the purpose of the subsequent break and enter. 
     
      
    7 On the evening of 24 December 2006 after the club had closed, the applicant entered. He was wearing a Batman mask and was carrying a sledge hammer. He attempted to destroy a security camera using the sledge hammer. The applicant placed a white square sticker over a sensor monitor to prevent any movement being detected while he was walking inside the club. After attempting to destroy the surveillance camera, the applicant opened an ATM using what appeared to be a jemmy bar and damaged the ATM in the course of doing so. The applicant took from that machine $9,750 in cash. 
     
      
    8 The applicant then entered the rear storeroom area of the club, behind the main bar, where he forced open a steel secure cabinet and obtained keys for the nearby floor safe and locks to the adjoining storerooms. It was accepted that the applicant must have had some knowledge of where he would find those keys. 
     
      
    9 The applicant opened a storeroom using the keys before opening a small floor safe with the keys. He took a further amount of $18,390 in cash from the small floor safe. 
     
      
    10 The applicant went to another storeroom where he attempted to gain entry to a large 1.5 metre high floor safe. The applicant used what appeared to be an angle grinder to cut through the door of the safe near the combination mechanism. He failed to gain entry to the safe, but caused considerable damage to the mechanism.  
     
      
    11 The applicant left the club via a window in the female toilet and attempted to disguise the manner in which he had left the premises. 
     
      
    12 On the morning of 3 January 2007 the police attended the applicant’s residence and executed a search warrant. They seized a number of significant items, including a sledge hammer and a number of white square labels, similar to those used to cover the sensor monitors inside the club. Angle grinder discs were found in the garage of the premises. 
     
      
    13 While the police were exercising the search warrant, the applicant drove into the car-park, noticed the police and then drove from the scene at high speed. He was driving a silver Ford Falcon, which it was subsequently discovered, had been purchased after 24 December 2006 for $18,265 paid in cash, largely with $50 notes. 
     
      
    14 When the applicant attended the Gladesville Police Station on 5 January 2007 pursuant to bail conditions in relation to another matter, he was arrested in respect of these matters. The applicant has been in custody since 5 January 2007.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He told his Honour that the silver Ford Falcon had been purchased by his cousin and that it had not been purchased from the proceeds of these offences. His Honour did not accept that evidence. 
     
      
    16 His Honour found that the applicant had entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and that he was entitled to a discount of 25 percent because of the utilitarian value of that plea and because of the contrition and remorse which it reflected. 
     
      
    17 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences his Honour took into account that they had been committed while the applicant was on parole and while he was on bail. His Honour had regard to the fact that quite detailed planning was involved in the offences. There had been preliminary visits to the premises, the applicant took with him all the equipment which he needed and the way in which the offences were committed indicated that he had gained considerable knowledge about the premises. 
     
      
    18 His Honour remarked on the applicant’s bad criminal record for a person so young (dob 18.5.76). The applicant had served sentences of imprisonment for break and enter, and similar offences, since 1992. Some of those sentences had been significant including a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years imposed on 20 May 2003. 
     
      
    19 Because of this poor criminal record which included so many break enter and steal offences his Honour was of the opinion that specific deterrence would have to play a big part in the applicant’s sentence. His Honour also had regard to general deterrence. He was, however, prepared to temper the application of those principles by taking into account that there had been some delay in the applicant being sentenced and the offences had not involved violence. 
     
      
    20 His Honour then went on to make the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now maximum penalties of course are reserved for offences the worst in their category or are reserved for repetitive offenders. This offence is not the worst in its category but quite frankly in my view it is way past the half way mark in terms of objective seriousness. … Maximum penalties are of course reserved also for repetitive offenders. This man must now be in that category.” (ROS 7-8) 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour considered the applicant’s subjective case. He noted that a psychological report had been tendered which referred to the applicant having alcohol and drug addiction problems. The report indicated that the applicant had a young child and a supportive partner. Nevertheless, his Honour concluded that despite these favourable subjective features, the seriousness of the offence was such that a custodial sentence was unavoidable. 
     
      
    22 In assessing the appropriate sentence, his Honour sought to follow the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield and Ors (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. In that regard his Honour noted the list of factors in Ponfield which enhanced the seriousness of an offence of this kind (Ponfield, Grove J at [48]). Of those factors his Honour specifically referred to the fact that the offences were committed whilst the applicant was at conditional liberty on bail and on parole, the fact of the professional planning, organisation and execution, the applicant’s prior record of like offences and the fact that the offence was accompanied by vandalism. His Honour took into account the value of the stolen property, being in excess of $28,000. 
     
      
    23 Having reviewed those factors, his Honour concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I take a much more serious view of this case than does the representative of the defendant in terms of the likely outcome, in terms of non-parole period and overall sentence. I would commence having regard to the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years. I am of the view that this offence in objective seriousness is significantly past the halfway mark and also I am of the view that the man is now a repetitive offender. I propose to commence my calculations at 8 years imprisonment”. (ROS 11) 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour found special circumstances because of the applicant’s express desire to rehabilitate himself and because significant supervision would be required after his release to parole, if that rehabilitation were to be successful. As indicated, his Honour backdated the commencement of the sentences which he imposed to 5 January 2007, when the applicant was taken into custody. Accordingly, the sentences for counts 2 and 3, the balance of parole custody and the sentence for goods in custody were wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed in respect of count 1. His Honour made no mention of the fact that count 1 took into account the malicious damage Form 1 offence. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      Ground of Appeal A - The total sentence imposed by his Honour is manifestly excessive. 
       
      Ground of Appeal D - His Honour wrongly considered that the applicant’s prior criminal history aggravated the offences for which he stood to be sentenced. 
       
      
    25 It is convenient to consider these two grounds of appeal together since there is a considerable overlap between them. 
     
      
    26 The applicant submitted that the non-parole period of 4 years was at the very top of the range of sentences imposed for offences contrary to s 112(1) when one took into account the Judicial Commission statistics. The applicant submitted that even if it were correct to characterise the offence as “in objective seriousness significantly past the halfway mark” (a concession which the applicant did not make) this would still not justify a non-parole period as high as that imposed by his Honour. This was because there were offences contrary to s 112(1) which were considerably more serious and heavy sentences such as this should only be applied to that category of offence. 
     
      
    27 Implicit in the submission is the proposition that the top of the range sentences, as disclosed by the Judicial Commission statistics should represent the top of the range for sentences in respect of s 112(1) offences. If that were so there would be no point in having a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. This point was forcefully made by Rothman J in Robertson v R [2007] NSW CCA 270: 
     
      
       
        
        “36 While the provision of statistical information on sentencing patterns may be useful in discerning the range of sentences that have thus far been imposed for a particular offence, this Court has often stated that they must be used with care. The major guideposts, imposed by the statute, are the maximum sentence, any standard non-parole period and the general principles of sentencing as espoused, particularly, in relation to the particular offences for which sentence is being imposed. The use of statistics as a measure of the appropriateness of the sentence has the effect of creating a self-fulfilling range of sentences, which may bear little relationship to the maximum sentence imposed by the legislature.” 
        
       
      
    28 As Ponfield recognised, the facts and circumstances giving rise to offences contrary to s 112(1) are so varied that it was not appropriate in that case to fix any kind of start point for sentencing purposes. All that the court could do was to identify factors which should be taken into account by sentencing judges when determining the objective seriousness of the particular offence or offences before them. 
     
      
    29 While the use of statistics can assist in the sentencing process, they are least likely to be useful where the circumstances of the individual instances of the offence vary greatly. Section 112(1) offences fall squarely within that category. What is clear is that such statistics should not be allowed to constrain the proper application of sentencing principles by judges carrying out the sentencing process. Statistics provided little assistance in this case and do not provide a proper basis for challenging the sentence. 
     
      
    30 The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed by his Honour was excessive because his Honour had wrongly applied Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. The applicant submitted that his Honour had inappropriately taken into account the applicant’s criminal record as a matter relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. The court’s attention was drawn to the statements in the remarks on sentence that the applicant was a repeat offender and that this meant that a more severe penalty should be imposed. This approach, it was submitted, revealed error and had caused his Honour to impose a sentence which was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    31 His Honour’s references to ‘repeat offender’ were unfortunate and invite the criticism which has been made. It is not clear, however, that his Honour did in fact use the applicant’s criminal record in an impermissible way. 
     
      
    32 The question of the correct application of Veen (No 2) was fully examined in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. The court there recognised that there is some tension between the various statements of principle on this question by the High Court. The classic statement of principle from Veen (No 2) is at 477-478: 
     
      
       
        
        “The antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell  
         (1970) AC 642, at p 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.” 
        
       
      
    33 The passage from Ottewell specifically referred to in Veen (No 2) reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judges have always (and I think rightly) felt themselves entitled to deal with a persistent offender by increasing the sentence they would have passed if he were not. This is not to punish the offender again for his past crimes. Nor is it always primarily for the protection of the public. It may simply be because in the judge’s view the sentences passed for previous offences have proved to be an insufficient deterrent and that the effect of a longer sentence must be tried, perhaps in the offender’s own interests. Or, it may be that repetition has itself increased the gravity of the offence. Eventually, in some cases, a stage is reached where it becomes clear that progressively increasing sentences are not a deterrent; and the protection of the public against a persistent offender then comes to the forefront of the considerations which the judge must take into account.” 
        
       
      
    34 In the later case of Baumer v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57-58 the court said: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “We have already referred to his Honour's observation that ""the literally appalling record"" of the applicant increased the seriousness of the offence. If this means no more than that such a record would make it difficult to view the circumstances of the offence or of the offender with any degree of leniency then, of course, such a remark would be understandable and unobjectionable. It would clearly be wrong if, because of the record, his Honour was intending to increase the sentence beyond what he considered to be an appropriate sentence for the instant offence.” 
        
       
      
    35 Spigelman CJ sought to reconcile that tension in McNaughton as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “24 Notwithstanding the views expressed by some judges, I interpret the joint judgments in both  
        Veen No 2  
        and in  
        Baumer  
        as establishing that the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions. In this respect I agree with the reasoning of Howie J in  
        Wickham,  
        which I had left open in  
        R v Berg  
        [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [40]. 
        
       
       
        
        25 The Crown submissions to this Court put forward a cogent case for accepting that prior convictions are relevant to the mens rea element of an offence and are particularly significant in the assessment of the moral culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence for which s/he stands to be sentenced. Nevertheless, such considerations can be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of punishment for the particular offence and for determining where in the spectrum of seriousness of offences of this character, the facts of the case lie. (See  
        R v Way  
        (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [85]-[99] and especially at [90]-[93].) However, on the authority of  
        Veen No 2  
        and  
        Baumer,  
        it is not open to this Court to adopt the approach submitted by the Crown so as to use prior convictions to determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        26 There is a difficulty with the reference in  
        Veen No 2 
         to prior convictions ‘illuminating’ the offender’s “moral culpability”. Nevertheless, as Howie J stated in  
        Wickham,  
        the majority judgment in  
        Veen No 2  
        recognised that prior convictions are pertinent to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie. I refer specifically to the reference to an “attitude of disobedience of the law” and to the increased weight to be given to “retribution”, “deterrence” (relevantly personal deterrence) and “the protection of society”.” 
        
       
      
    36 In the light of the analysis of the authorities carried out in McNaughton, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in his use of the applicant’s criminal record. It is clear from the remarks on sentence that when determining that the s 112(1) offence was beyond midrange, and in taking as his start point a head sentence of 8 years, his Honour was taking into account the specific circumstances of this offence and the aggravating features specifically identified in Ponfield. These were the substantial amount of money stolen, the detailed planning, preparation and execution associated with the offence and that the applicant was at liberty on bail and on parole. It was these considerations which determined the upper boundary of the sentencing range available to his Honour, ie 8 years. It was then open to his Honour within that upper boundary to use the applicant’s prior criminal record, with its implications as to retribution, deterrence and the protection of society to determine the final sentence, in particular the non-parole period. 
     
      
    37 Within the constraints imposed by McNaughton it was clear from the applicant’s criminal record that this further serious break, enter and steal offence merited more serious punishment than if the offence were looked at in isolation. The serious objective features of this offence, together with the applicant’s criminal record, required that a significant sentence be imposed.  
     
      
    38 It follows that I am not persuaded that in the circumstances of this case his Honour erred in his use of the appellant’s criminal record of that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. On the contrary, the concurrency of the sentences for the malicious damage counts and the backdating of the commencement date of the sentence to include the balance of parole and the sentence for goods in custody substantially favoured the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal B – His Honour failed to properly apply the provisions of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and impermissibly arrived at a non-parole period by a process of simple arithmetic deduction 
       
      
    39 The applicant submitted that his Honour had arbitrarily selected a figure of 8 years as the start point for his reasoning process leading to the formulation of the sentence finally imposed. The applicant submitted that having chosen this start point, his Honour then followed a simple mechanical process by reducing the figure by 25 percent for the plea of guilty, making an adjustment for special circumstances and then determining the non-parole period. The applicant submitted that this was contrary to s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and was contrary to the guidance provided by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [39]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Following the decision of this Court in Wong it cannot now be doubted that sentencing courts may not add and subtract item by item from some apparently subliminally derived figure, passages of time in order to fix the time which an offender must serve in prison. That is not to say that in a simple case, in which, for example, the circumstances of the crime have to be weighed against one or a small number of other important matters, indulgence in arithmetical deduction by the sentencing judges should be absolutely forbidden.” 
        
       
      
    40 There is nothing in his Honour’s approach which is contrary to the guidance provided in Markarian. His Honour took as an important guidepost the maximum penalty for this offence. Such an approach was fully endorsed in Markarian [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick. …” 
        
       
      
    41 In choosing as his start point a term of 8 years, his Honour was doing no more than engaging in the process of “instinctive synthesis” recommended in Markarian. The reason why his Honour chose that start point was because in the exercise of his discretion, his Honour had assessed the objective seriousness of this offence as being beyond the midrange. The only arithmetical calculation engaged in by his Honour was the application of a discount for the plea of guilty, a process also approved in Markarian. 
     
      
    42 Insofar as the application of s 44 is concerned, that section does not mandate a particular sequence of reasoning. This was made clear by Simpson J in R v Misiepo [2005] NSWCCA 405 at [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “When he ultimately sentenced the respondent, his Honour did so in accordance with the current version of s 44. However, when he earlier stated his view of what the sentence should have been absent the plea of guilty he specified this as a sentence of 6 years and 4 months imprisonment, presumably, a reference to the total term of the sentence he had in mind. The Crown has made some criticism of him for this, suggesting that he applied the early version of s 44 by setting the head sentence first. Given that the sentence as imposed was correctly done, in accordance with the current s 44, I do not think this criticism can be sustained. Further, there is nothing in the current version of s 44 that demands that the reasoning process follows a particular sequence. Provided a judge complies with the requirements of the section it is not necessary that his or her thought processes commence with the non-parole period …” 
        
       
      
    43 A similar observation was made by Hulme J in R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218 at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding the temptation, provided by the terms of s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , to think that his Honour’s approach of fixing a non-parole period and then independently fixing the balance of the term is the correct approach, in fact it is not. That was decided in  
        R v Moffitt 
         (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 134 in respect of earlier legislation but in  
        R v Way 
         the Court indicated that  
        R v Moffitt 
         should be followed in relation to the current wording of s 44.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Tidona v Regina 
       [2005] NSWCCA 410 at [39] – [42]. 
       
      
    44 This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal C – His Honour wrongly took into account, in sentencing for the s 112(1) offence, as aggravating circumstances, the offences under s 195(1)(a) 
       
      
    45 The applicant submitted that his Honour’s statement when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence that “his offence was accompanied by vandalism” meant that his Honour was taking into account matters for which the applicant had been separately charged, ie damage to the security camera, damage to the ATM and damage to the door of the safe. The applicant submitted that by taking those matters into account in that way, his Honour had erred in that he was doubly punishing the applicant for one or more of the offences of malicious damage. 
     
      
    46 It is not clear from the way in which his Honour has expressed himself what matter his Honour was referring to when he made this comment. As the Crown pointed out, there was another instance of damage which was not the subject of a separate charge in that the applicant had forced open a steel secure cabinet to gain access to some keys. That having been said, the unqualified way in which his Honour expressed himself suggests that there is substance in the applicant’s complaint. 
     
      
    47 In order to understand what effect, if any, that consideration had on the sentence ultimately imposed it is necessary to place the comment in context. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do note that his offence was accompanied by vandalism, although I think I am entitled to say that it is not of its worst kind. I have seen plenty worse and I could make the same remark in relation to the value of the property stolen.” 
        
       
      
    48 It is clear that if his Honour did impermissibly take these matters into account, he did not give not them particularly great weight. It is also not without significance that the concurrency of the malicious damage sentences meant that in a practical sense the applicant received no extra punishment for them. 
     
      
    49 As has been said on a number of occasions, for this Court to quash a sentence and impose a lesser one it is not sufficient for the applicant to establish error. It is necessary that this Court be satisfied that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed” – subs 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] and [99-100]. Accordingly, although his Honour erred in referring to vandalism in the way in which he did, I am not persuaded that some lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    50 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
      (2) The appeal be dismissed.

       REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: [KR] and [PR] (the brothers) plead guilty to the charge that they on 2 January 2006 did unlawfully kill Robin Nassour. This is a crime of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    3 [PR] asks that an offence of common assault included on a Form 1 be taken into account upon his sentence. At his request I will do so.  
     
      
    4 Michael Ibrahim had also pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Robin Nassour. Proceedings on sentence which concerned the brothers and Michael Ibrahim were heard together and all of the offenders were to be sentenced on 21 April 2008. [KR] was then represented by Mr Dunn QC and [PR] by Mr Ainsworth of counsel. Michael Ibrahim was represented by Mr Richter QC. 
     
      
    5 An application was made on behalf of the brothers on 16 April 2008 to vacate their date for sentence. The ground of the application was the provision of assistance by them to police. The Crown joined in the application and the date for sentence so far as the brothers were concerned was vacated. Further evidence and submissions confined to the issue of assistance were heard on 11 June, 8 July and 12 August 2008. During these proceedings, the brothers were represented by Mr Ainsworth.  
     
      
    6 On 21 April 2008 Michael Ibrahim was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months which commenced on 16 September 2006 and expires on 15 March 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years 10 months which commences on 16 March 2013 and expires on 15 January 2016. 7 During the proceedings on sentence statements of facts agreed between the Crown, Michael Ibrahim and the brothers were tendered by consent and marked as exhibits. The agreed facts are in identical terms for each of the offenders save for some minor amendments to paragraph one of exhibit B which were requested by Michael Ibrahim.  
     
      
    The Agreed Facts 8 Agreed facts for the brothers are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On the evening of 31 December 2005 or the early hours of 1 January 2006 the deceased Robin Nassour (born 24 July 1971, aged 34) and his brother George Nassour (date of birth 26 February 1969, aged 36) and two friends attended the UN Nightclub (formerly known as DCM Nightclub) at 33 Oxford Street, Sydney. The co-accused Michael IBRAHIM was at the time working as a doorman at the nightclub. His brother John operated the nightclub. The accused presently before the Court are brothers. […] On the night in question, Michael IBRAHIM refused entry to the nightclub to the two friends of the NASSOUR brothers. Robin NASSOUR waited downstairs for a short time with the two friends while George Nassour tried to get them into the nightclub. He was unsuccessful and Robin NASSOUR left with their two friends and went elsewhere. George NASSOUR left and returned later to the nightclub without Robin and the two friends. On returning to the nightclub an acquaintance of George NASSOUR named Ali pestered him to get him (Ali) into the club for nothing, saying he had no money. George told him he was unable to do so, but told Ali to pretend his hand had already been stamped. Michael IBRAHIM overheard this and became angry with George NASSOUR, telling him to get upstairs. George only remained for a short time at the nightclub before leaving. He remained outside for a period of time. At one stage, Robin NASSOUR drove past the club and made a rude gesture with his finger in the direction of George, who was outside the club. Michael IBRAHIM thought that gesture was intended for him.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. In the early hours of 2 January 2006, George NASSOUR, Robin NASSOUR and another friend went to McDonalds at Kings Cross. The accused [PR] (date of birth 16 January 1984, aged 22) and the co-accused [KR] (date of birth 27 July 1980, aged 25) were across the road and beckoned George NASSOUR across. [PR] demanded that he call Robin NASSOUR across the road. He then punched George NASSOUR in the head. This incident is the subject of the offence of assault to be taken into account on the sentence of [PR]. George, his brother and their friend immediately left the area.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. At about 8.20pm on 2 January 2006, George NASSOUR received a phone call from a co-offender Faouzi ABOU –JIBAL (date of birth 10 January 1977, aged 29) asking George and Robin NASSOUR to attend the Meriton Apartments situated at 3 The Promenade, Chiswick, in an attempt to settle the dispute now perceived to exist between the NASSOUR brothers and Michael IBRAHIM. (Faouzi ABOU – JIBAL has since died). George and Robin NASSOUR both attended the complex at about 9.20pm on 2 January 2006, picking up ABOU-JIBAL in their car near the entrance to the complex, where ABOU-JIBAL lived and where he was having a party attended by about twenty people including the three co-accused (IBRAHIM and the two brothers). ABOU-JIBAL took the NASSOUR brothers to the basement car park of the building in a lift. 
        
       
      
    4. As the three men left the lift, Robin NASSOUR led the way  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          followed closely behind by Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL, with George NASSOUR following closely behind him. The three men started walking up the ramp in the car park. As that occurred the co-accused [PR], [KR] and Michael IBRAHIM walked towards the point where the top of the ramp meets a flat area between ramps. George NASSOUR became upset on seeing the three accused and started calling out words to the effect that this was a set up. At around this time, Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL produced a knife that he had previously kept concealed on his person and stabbed George NASSOUR to his upper rear right leg. He then went to stab George NASSOUR a second time, but George NASSOUR managed to pull him away. The knife was described by George NASSOUR as a fancy knife with a silver handle and shiny blade about thirty centimetres in length. A knife matching this description was subsequently recovered from the Bay near the Meriton apartment complex by police divers. Occupants of the units had seen a man throwing something into the water shortly after the events the subject of the present manslaughter charges. A former fiancée of ABOU-JIBAL, by the name of Shayda BASTANI RAD has identified this knife as one she bought him from the internet site Ebay and gave to him on 22nd or 23rd December 2005. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        5. Immediately after he was stabbed, George NASSOUR saw the accused [KR], [PR] and Michael IBRAHIM surrounding Robin NASSOUR, who was still standing up at this point. George NASSOUR then ran away down the ramp, but returned to see all four men around Robin NASSOUR punching and kicking him. Robin NASSOUR was lying on the ground at this stage. During this attack, George NASSOUR believes he saw something silver being held by one of the accused, which was subsequently thrown at him. He believes this object was a knife. However police subsequently recovered the silver casing of a mobile telephone on the stairway in the area where George NASSOUR had been standing. Subsequent expert fingerprint examination located a palm print belonging to the accused Michael IBRAHIM on this phone casing. The deceased was found to have suffered blunt force injuries to his head consistent with being hit with an object such as a mobile telephone during the attack on him. During the attack on the deceased Robin NASSOUR, he was stabbed by Faouzi ABOU – JIBAL in the left thigh. This stab wound damaged the deceased’s left femoral artery and vein causing loss of blood which led to his death anywhere up to fifteen minutes after the injury was inflicted. There is no evidence of precisely when this fatal stab wound was inflicted during the course of the attack. The deceased also suffered a stab wound to his left shoulder, being a slash type injury. It measured approximately 75mm (3 inches) in length. Again, there is no evidence of precisely when and how this wound was inflicted during the attack.  
        
       
      
    6. The deceased suffered other blunt force injuries during the  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          attack upon him. These included lacerations to the head and above his left eye. He also suffered abrasions to his forehead, above his right eyebrow, at the tip of his left elbow, on his right arm and bruising to his left wrist and right legs (sic). These abrasions and bruises are consistent with being inflicted by kicks and punches. The blunt force injuries are consistent with being inflicted by a hard object such as a mobile phone or handle of a knife.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        7. The accused stand to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise. They were parties to a joint criminal enterprise with Michael IBRAHIM and Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL to unlawfully assault Robin NASSOUR in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. They first became aware of the knife at, or immediately after, the time ABOU-JIBAL stabbed George NASSOUR. At this time they foresaw the possibility that Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL might use the knife again to stab Robin NASSOUR and to cause him some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm.  
        
       
      
    9 I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the offenders. As the facts are the same for all of the offenders and it is agreed that each is equally culpable in terms of his role, the findings I make as to the commission of the offence and its objective seriousness will be the same as those made in respect of the offender Michael Ibrahim. 10 Paragraph 7 of the agreed facts discloses that the offenders stand to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise. Counsel for the offenders contended that the offence of manslaughter to which their clients have entered pleas of guilty is at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. 11 The offenders’ offending did not involve an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased or reckless indifference to human life. There is no suggestion that any of the offenders stabbed the deceased. It was their intention that they and Faouzi Abou-Jibal (Abou-Jibal) would assault Robin Nassour in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. None of the offenders was armed with a weapon. However, each of the offenders had become aware of the knife in Abou-Jibal’s possession at, or immediately after, the time Abou-Jibal stabbed George Nassour to his upper rear right leg and then went to stab him again. The knife was described by George Nassour as having a silver handle and shiny blade about 30 centimetres in length.  
     
      
    12 The offenders were then aware that Abou-Jibal would participate with them in the assault upon the deceased whilst he was armed with this knife. Furthermore they foresaw the possibility that Abou-Jibal might use the knife again to cause the deceased some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. They did not desist but with this knowledge each of them participated in a brutal and cowardly attack upon the deceased. This carries with it, in my opinion, a very significant degree of criminality. It is not in these circumstances a mitigating factor as Mr Dunn submitted that the offenders were unarmed and the blow that was struck by Abou-Jibal was to a “non-vital” part of the body of George Nassour. 13 The offenders surrounded the deceased. They with Abou-Jibal punched and kicked him whilst he lay on the ground. The blunt force injuries, lacerations, abrasions and bruising suffered by the deceased make evident the violence to which he was subjected. As a consequence of being confronted by four attackers, the deceased was in the position that he could not defend himself against being stabbed with a knife. The deceased was stabbed twice by Abou-Jibal. It was the stab wound to the left thigh which damaged the left femoral artery and vein causing loss of blood which led to his death.14 The Crown invited me to find that an aggravating factor was that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”: s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (Crimes (SP) Act). Whilst the offenders did not plan the use of a knife, the Crown contended that the unlawful and dangerous act was pre-planned involving as it did Abou-Jibal taking the deceased and his brother to a car park area away from witnesses where the offenders were waiting. Counsel for each of the offenders submitted that the Court ought not be satisfied that this aggravating factor exists in this case. Each argued that the assault upon the deceased was spontaneous.  
     
      
    15 Mr Richter submitted in particular that there is no sufficient evidence of the formation of an intent to assault anyone prior to George Nassour kicking up a fuss in a situation in which there was a meeting to resolve a perceived conflict. He said so far as the deceased was concerned “we know that he kept walking up to the ramp whilst George is calling out because the assault takes place at the top of the ramp and Robin is walking up there. Now, as to why or how, perhaps he had Dutch courage; I know not, we know not”. Mr Richter referred to a cocktail of some drugs in the blood of the deceased “that might give some Dutch courage at the time of his death”. (POS 18/1/08 p 54 L1-17). He argued that the proposition that his client was there to receive an apology could not be rejected.  
     
      
    16 There is no evidence that the offender Ibrahim was in the car park to receive an apology. It is an agreed fact that Abou-Jibal had asked the Nassour brothers to attend the Meriton Apartments to attempt to settle the dispute perceived to exist between them and Ibrahim. There is no evidence that the deceased continued to walk towards the offenders after his brother had been stabbed. Furthermore, there is no evidence from which it may be inferred that the deceased did anything to provoke the attack upon him by the offenders. There is no evidence in the proceedings on sentence that there was a cocktail of drugs in the blood of the deceased nor is there evidence of the affect that drugs might have had upon him. In any event the suggestion that the deceased provoked the attack upon him by the offenders after his brother was stabbed is plainly implausible.  
     
      
    17 The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders had agreed with Abou-Jibal that he would bring the Nassour brothers into the basement car park where Robin Nassour would be unlawfully assaulted in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. The Crown must exclude as a reasonable possibility that the assault by them upon the deceased was spontaneous. The only rational inference to be drawn from the combination of the taking of the Nassour brothers to the basement car park, the three offenders walking towards the point where the top of the ramp meets a flat area between the two ramps, George Nassour’s upset on seeing the offenders, the failure by the offenders to desist after they became aware of the knife, the lack of provocation by the deceased, the immediacy of the offenders surrounding the deceased after George Nassour had been stabbed and the violent attack with Abou-Jibal upon the deceased which then followed is that it had been previously agreed that Robin Nassour was to be unlawfully assaulted and it was part of the plan to assault him that he was to be brought down into the basement car park. It is not a reasonable possibility that the agreement to unlawfully assault Robin Nassour was spontaneously formed after George Nassour was stabbed by Abou-Jibal.  
     
      
    18 The agreement to assault the deceased in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm was pre-planned. The agreement to continue to participate in the assault upon the deceased although Abou-Jibal was armed with a knife was not. It was spontaneously formed after the offenders became aware of the knife at, or immediately after, the time Abou-Jibal stabbed George Nassour. At this time they foresaw the possibility that Abou-Jibal might use the knife again to stab the deceased and to cause him some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 the importance of making findings under s 21A in accordance with the words of the provision was stressed. Although the assault was pre-planned, I am not satisfied that the offence of manslaughter was part of a planned criminal activity in the sense envisaged in s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (SP) Act. However, the fact that it had been previously agreed that the deceased was to be assaulted in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm and as part of the plan to assault him he was brought down into the basement car park increases the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    19 I do not agree with the contention that the offenders’ offending is at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. In my opinion, these are objectively serious offences of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. It is an agreed fact that each of the offenders is equally culpable in the terms of his role in the offence. 20 The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v MacDonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise as in all offences of manslaughter is that the life of Robin Nassour aged 34 years has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 
     
      
    21 Various cases imposing sentences for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act were cited by counsel during submissions. It was contended by counsel for the offenders that the closest comparable case is R v Taiseni & Ors [2007] NSWSC 1090. With that contention I disagree. One of the distinguishing features of the present case is that the offenders participated in the assault upon the deceased in circumstances where they knew that Abou-Jibal was armed with a knife which he might use again to cause the deceased some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. To participate in a joint act of violence in these circumstances carries with it, as I have said, a very significant degree of criminality.  
     
      
    22 In Regina v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 Hall J analysed sentences which had been more recently imposed for manslaughter. His Honour’s consideration included offences of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Hall J recognised [at 191] there is no obvious trend or range discernible in terms of any particular sub-set of manslaughter offences. However, his Honour’s review and the cases cited by counsel have been of assistance in determining the appropriate sentences. Each case depends on its own facts. 23 I turn to the subjective cases of the brothers.  
     
      
       
      [KR]  
       
      
    24 [KR] was born in Sydney on 27 July 1980 and was 25 years old at the time of the offence. As the offender’s evidence during the proceedings on sentence was confined to the conditions in which he and his brother are serving their custody, his subjective circumstances are taken from the history in the pre-sentence report dated 30 November 2007, the letter from the sister of [KR] and [PR] (exhibit MT 4), and a chronology (exhibit ST 10). 
     
      
    25 The offender was educated at Merrylands High School which he left in 1996 when he was at the end of year 10. He worked for a kitchen cabinet maker until 1998 when he returned to school in an attempt to gain further education. He left school half way through the year and then variously worked as a labourer, tiler, mechanic and concretor.  
     
      
    26 [His sister] explains in her letter that the offender left school very early so that he could work and help their mother support the family. Their father had a very bad gambling habit which left nothing for the family. He was very abusive and focussed his abuse on her brothers especially if he had lost all his money gambling on horses. The family, she states, grew up struggling to have the simple things that most people take for granted. 
     
      
    27 Marco Battaglia, the author of the pre-sentence report, describes the offender as reporting a consistent work history until a motorcycle accident in September 2003. The offender purchased a home in February 2003 which he presently owns subject to a mortgage. From the exhibited medical reports, it appears that the offender suffered in the accident a complex facture of the right leg, head, shoulder and back injuries. His continuing disabilities resulting from the accident are detailed in the report of Dr C Costa (exhibit ST 3). The principal disability is a loss of function of the right leg. It was not suggested by Mr Dunn that the offender’s health is a factor tending to mitigate punishment and enlivens the principles in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587: see also R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395. It was submitted that the offender’s physical condition is part of his general overall history: POS 30/11/07 T5 L55-58. The report from Dr Virginia Noel (Exhibit H) discloses that the offender has not complained of any symptoms relating to his injuries from the motorbike accident whilst in recent custody. Should he wish an orthopaedic review will be arranged for him. It is evident that the offender’s disabilities can be adequately managed by the prison medical staff and that imprisonment will not be a greater burden for him by reason of his physical condition.  
     
      
    28 I take into account the injuries and disabilities which the offender sustained in the accident and accept that he has been a hard worker. I accept that the offender’s personal circumstances as a child were difficult. I also accept that the offender would have had, as mentioned in the letters from the offender’s fiancée, and [his sister], work available to him in the concreting industry upon release. As a consequence of the risk to his safety and to that of his family that his assistance with the authorities entails, it will not be possible for him to take up that employment upon release.  
     
      
    29 A mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence is that “the offender has shown remorse for the offence….in any other manner”: s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (SP) Act. The amendments made to s 21A(3)(i) by the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 do not apply as the pleas of guilty in the present proceedings were accepted before 1 January 2008 and have not been withdrawn. 30 By his plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions and the plea is an indication of his remorse and contrition. The Crown case of manslaughter against each of the offenders was, however, very strong. His plea of guilty, in my opinion, was a recognition of the inevitable. The strength of the Crown case, I emphasise, is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse: see R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12].  
     
      
    31 [His fiancée] in her letter refers to the offender’s sorrow for what has happened and his great remorse for the deceased’s family. [His sister] recounts that her brothers have expressed to her “deep regret and remorse for their actions”. Mr Battaglia writes that the offender “expressed remorse, he did not attempt to minimise the gravity of his participation and stated that he wanted to avoid further traumatisation of the victim’s family, his family and himself that he accepts responsibility for his actions.”  Having considered the statements attributed to the offender by his fiancée, his sister and in the pre-sentence report and the nature and extent of his assistance to police, I am satisfied that he is remorseful for his offending.32 The offender’s criminal history, relevantly, reveals an offence of intimidating a police officer for which he was convicted and fined in the Local Court in August 2001 and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was convicted and sentenced in the District Court on 4 December 2005 to the “rising of the Court”. The sentencing Judge’s reasons for the imposition of such a sentence which is normally regarded as lenient have not been provided. Although the offender’s criminal record discloses these offences, his record is not such that it disentitles him to considerations of leniency. His record of previous convictions is not a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    33 It is evident from the pre-sentence report that there are no issues concerning alcohol or illicit substance abuse or the mental health of the offender. I note Mr Battaglia’s reference to the two institutional misconduct charges which have been established. He recommends that the offender be assessed for entry into the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Programme. 
     
      
    34 Mr Dunn submitted that the offender has good prospects for rehabilitation. In assessing the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, it was of concern that the present offence was committed within a short time of the District Court sentence. Furthermore, it appears from the pre-sentence report, the custodial records and the chronology that the offender was in custody from January 2004 until May 2005 being bail refused for the “Malouf” offences which were subsequently dropped. It was also a matter of concern that the present offence was committed about eight months after his release. I have, however, considered the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance to police and the change that assistance will necessarily bring to his life. He will no longer be associated with the Nomads Outlaw Motor Cycle Club and has a strong incentive not to involve himself in the criminal community. I am of the opinion that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    35 I conclude on the probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g) Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
       
      [PR] 
       
      
    36 [PR] was born in Sydney on 16 January 1984 and was 21 years old at the time of the offence. His subjective circumstances are taken from the history (exhibit MT 1) provided to Mr Tim Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist, the letter previously mentioned from [his sister] (exhibit MT 4) and a pre-sentence report dated 30 November 2007. The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    37 The offender was educated at Merrylands High School which he left during year 9, shortly after his parents separated, to get a job in order to help support his mother. He worked at Parramar Kitchens, a kitchen cabinet making company, shortly after he left school.  
     
      
    38 He described to Mr Watson-Munro a poor relationship with his father alleging that he was subjected to considerable physical and psychological violence during the course of his parents’ marriage which is supported by the letter from [his sister]. He has a very positive relationship with his mother.  
     
      
    39 Enquiries from Penny Pickup, the author of the pre-sentence report, to the offender’s previous employer revealed that the offender was “intelligent, hard working, punctual and willing to learn”. There are no issues to be addressed with alcohol or illicit substance abuse.  
     
      
    40 Anthony Rizk for whom the offender worked for two years refers to the offender in most complimentary terms as does Khoder Sabra. Mr Sabra is prepared to offer the offender a position with his company upon his release. 
     
      
    41 The offender has never married but does have a young son who was born whilst he was in custody. He expressed the hope to Mr Watson-Munro to be able to have some involvement in the child’s life in due course. 
     
      
    42 Mr Watson-Munro recounts that the offender stated that he has problems with a heart valve. The offender told the psychologist that arising from this he had suffered episodes of tachycardia from about the age of 16 years. It was not suggested by Mr Ainsworth that the offender’s health is a factor tending to mitigate punishment and enlivens the principles in R v Smith (supra): see R v Badanjak (supra) nor is it suggested that the offender’s health has made the serving of his sentence different to any other offender: POS 27/2/08 p 8 L45-47.  
     
      
    43 Dr Virginia Noel states that at the time of reception into custody on 2 March 2006, the offender mentioned during the clinical assessment “heart valve regurgitation” as a health problem, but said he was not having treatment. He has not complained of any symptoms relating to heart trouble to clinical health staff nor has he requested a medical review. If he wishes to have a medical review, a cardiology review will be arranged. It is plain that the prison medical staff can adequately manage the offender’s health problems and that imprisonment will not be a greater burden for him by reason of his health.  
     
      
    44 The offender described to Mr Watson-Munro long standing symptoms of depression and anxiety which date back to his formative years. Mr Watson-Munro notes a serious medical condition which has caused the offender substantial anxiety and apprehension over the years. The psychologist opines that it would appear that the offender was suffering a broad spectrum of symptoms diagnosed as an adjustment disorder. There has been significant escalation, Mr Watson-Munro relates, in the offender’s symptomatology since the offence and it is apparent that “he remains highly anxious, depressed and hypervigilent” with very low self- esteem. 
     
      
    45 Ms Pickup states that the offender apparently threatened to commit suicide when his brother and Michael Ibrahim were removed from Parklea Correctional Centre.  
     
      
    46 I take into account the psychologist’s assessment of an adjustment disorder. It was not submitted [nor do I find] that the offender’s adjustment disorder impacted upon the sentence to be imposed in any of the four ways identified in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. I accept that the offender was a hard worker and his personal circumstances as a child were difficult. He had, I accept, employment available to him upon release. As a consequence of the risk to his safety and to that of his family that his assistance with the authorities entails, it will not be possible for him to take up that employment upon release. 47 As I have stated at [29] a mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence is that “the offender has shown remorse for the offence……in any other manner”: s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (SP) Act. Like [KR], the offender has by his plea of guilty accepted responsibility for his actions and the plea is an indication of his remorse and contrition. The Crown case of manslaughter against each of the offenders was, however, very strong. His plea of guilty, in my opinion, was a recognition of the inevitable. 
     
      
    48 [his sister], as mentioned at [31] wrote of her brothers’ regret and remorse for their actions. Mr Watson-Munro states that the offender: ”is experiencing significant remorse in relation to this event…” (exhibit MT 1 p4) and “described chronic sleeplessness with him tending to ruminate about what occurred with what appears to be genuine remorse arising from the fact that he was a close friend of the deceased”: (exhibit MT 1 p5) It is accepted that the psychologist was mistaken when he referred to the offender being a close friend of the deceased. Ms Pickup refers to the offender stating that “he pleaded guilty to manslaughter to minimise the trauma to the victims and his own family”.  
     
      
    49 The offender was 21 years old when he committed the offence. I give weight to the fact that he was a young man at the time. This is not, however, a case where it is said that the offender’s immaturity contributed to the role that he played in the crime. The offender accepts that he is equally culpable with the other offenders. His acceptance of equal responsibility, although the youngest of the offenders, enhances the genuineness of his remorse. I take into account the statements attributed to the offender by his sister, the psychologist and in the pre-sentence report as demonstrating remorse for his offending. I have also considered the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance to police. I am satisfied that he is remorseful for his offending. 
     
      
    50 The offender’s criminal history discloses that he has one prior offence of intimidating a police officer for which he was convicted and fined in the Local Court in October 2003. I take into account as a mitigating factor that the offender does not have a significant criminal record: s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
    51 The absence of a significant criminal record is, however, diminished to a limited extent by the offence on the Form 1 which was an act of violence, the offender punching George Nassour in the head: see Regina v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229.  
     
      
    52 I note Ms Pickup’s reference in the pre-sentence report to the two institutional misconduct charges which have been established. She assesses the offender as suitable for a medium level of intervention by the Probation and Parole service. 
     
      
    53 It appears from the offender’s custodial records that he was in custody from January 2004 until May 2005 being bail refused on charges which were subsequently dropped. In assessing his prospects of rehabilitation it was a matter of concern that the present offence was committed about eight months after his release. Mr Watson-Munro, however, states that the offender “has some positive aspirations for the future in the context of his strong desire to re-enter the workforce in order to assist his family” (exhibit MT 1 p 5). The psychologist opines that the offender is “…highly vulnerable to potentially adverse peer group dynamics…” ( exhibit MT 1 p 4). Having considered the nature and the extent of the offender’s assistance to police and the changes that assistance will necessarily bring to his life, the offender like his brother, has, in my opinion, good prospects of rehabilitation. He will no longer be associated with the Nomads Outlaw Motor Cycle Club and has a strong incentive not to involve himself in the criminal community.  
     
      
    54 I conclude on the probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g) Crimes (SP) Act. The pleas of guilty and assistance  
     
      
    55 On Friday 5 October 2007 [KR] and [PR] entered pleas of guilty to an indictment specifying a single count of manslaughter. They had been arraigned with Michael Ibrahim before Bell J on 4 May 2007 when they had pleaded not guilty to a count of murder and a count of malicious wounding of George Nassour with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. [PR] had also pleaded not guilty to a charge that he assaulted George Nassour on or about 1 January 2006. This count is now included on the Form 1. The Court was informed by Ms Crown on 5 October 2007 that a no-bill was to be entered in respect to the brothers in relation to the count of malicious wounding. 
     
      
    56 The offenders’ trial on the counts upon which they had been arraigned before Bell J had been listed to commence on Monday 2 October 2007. A jury panel, however, was not required to enable preliminary matters to be raised. Ms Crown on that day apprised the Court of ongoing discussions with counsel for the offenders which resulted in the plea to manslaughter by the brothers on 5 October 2007. During sentencing submissions Ms Crown explained that there had been discussions with counsel for the brothers “probably a month, possibly two months before the trial in which there were clear offers made on behalf of the to plead”: POS 18/1/08 p 45 L 27-32. 
     
      
    57 There is conflicting evidence from Mr Galloway, the solicitor who then acted for the brothers, on the one hand and Ms Dobbs, a solicitor with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who was then involved in this case, on the other as to whether an offer was made on behalf of the brothers to plead guilty to manslaughter at the time of the committal proceedings. Shortly stated, it was Mr Galloway’s evidence that he had a clear recollection of having a conversation with Ms Dobbs in her office at Burwood on the day of the committal in which he informed her he had instructions to put an offer of manslaughter. Ms Dobbs response was that she believed “they had a strong case for murder; that she would not recommend it”: POS 30/11/07 p 17 L 52-54. Mr Galloway then formed the view that he was wasting his time pressing it any further. Ms Dobbs recalled, however, that Mr Galloway approached her and indicated “that his clients, [PR] and [KR] might be prepared to plead to manslaughter and did I think that the Crown would accept such a plea” to which she believed she said “not at this stage”. She believed she told him it was a matter for the Supreme Court arraignments prosecutor: POS 18/1/08 p 5 L 25-40. If a formal offer had been made to her, Ms Dobbs said, she would have briefed the Supreme Court arraignment Crown prosecutor with it which she did not do because she did not “regard it as a firm offer”: POS 18/1/08 p 9 L 22. 
     
      
    58 Neither solicitor made, it seems, a file note of the conversations. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that a firm offer was made to plead guilty to manslaughter. It is surprising, to my mind, that if the brothers’ solicitor had firm instructions, a plea of guilty to manslaughter was neither articulated before the Magistrate at the time of committal nor upon arraignment before Bell J. Furthermore, it is surprising that such an offer was not confirmed in writing to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or to the Supreme Court arraignments prosecutor. I prefer and accept the evidence of Ms Dobbs.  
     
      
    59 It might have been, however, that if some interest had been exhibited by Ms Dobbs about the possibility of the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter that a formal offer might have been made before the discussions between Ms Crown and counsel for the brothers commenced. A complicating factor in the negotiations between the Crown and counsel was the second count which was ultimately no-billed. I take these matters into account as a matter of fairness in assessing the utilitarian value of the pleas. The trial was estimated to take some four weeks. 
     
      
    60 It must be stated that these pleas were not entered at the first available opportunity and the discount for the utilitarian effect of the pleas is not to be assessed at the top of the range of 10 to 25 per cent: see R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The utilitarian effect of the pleas is more than that of the plea entered by Michael Ibrahim as they were entered at an earlier stage. I do not propose to identify a discrete discount for the pleas of guilty as a single combined discount will be given for the pleas and assistance to authorities. 61 Section 23(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act permits a court to impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to …any other offence. A lesser penalty imposed under s 23(1) must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced: s 23(3) Crimes (SP) Act. Section 23(3) reflects the bottom line in relation to a discount for assistance to authorities beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set: SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19 per Howie J at [4].  
     
      
    62 The evidence of assistance is in the confidential affidavits and other evidence which is subject to orders which preserve the confidentiality of that material. The necessity for confidentiality requires that I do not provide in these sentencing remarks the details of the assistance. Nevertheless some summary must be given. 
     
      
    63 The assistance which has been provided by each brother concerns matters of a most serious nature which are unrelated to the present offence. Letters of assistance address those matters in s 23(2)(a-j) of the Crimes (SP) Act to which the Court is to have regard in deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes. The content of the letters of assistance is verified as being reliable by appropriate affidavits. Evidence was also given by Detective Sergeant Chambers and Senior Constable O’Donohue during the proceedings on sentence. Senior Constable O’Donohue’s evidence on 12 August 2008 concerned ongoing assistance. I act upon the letters of assistance and the evidence of the police officers given before me in assessing the significance of the offenders’ assistance. Moreover, in one of those matters each of the offenders has entered into a written undertaking to give active co-operation, including the giving of truthful and frank evidence. The value of the assistance provided in the other matters has not been similarly enhanced as each of the offenders has declined to enter into a written undertaking due to concern for their own safety and that of members of their family. I am satisfied that the information that has been given is considered by the authorities to be reliable and that the offenders have provided a high level of assistance to the police in the investigation of the matters which are referred to in the confidential material.  
     
      
    64 As to the timelines of the assistance, I take into account that police were contacted on the offenders’ behalf in December 2007. It was then indicated that they were prepared to provide assistance. They have been in custody since 3 March 2006 for the present offence.  
     
      
    65 Following upon the offers to provide assistance, each offender has been detained in protection and because of this there has been added hardship associated with the circumstances of their detention. I have no doubt, on the evidence, that they will remain in protection during the whole of their sentences and the conditions of their detention will be more difficult than for other prisoners in the general prison population. As a result of the assistance provided and undertaken to be given, there is a real risk of injury to each of the offenders and to members of their family. They will all be at risk of injury for an indefinite period of time. It appears likely that upon release, they will be placed on witness protection.  
     
      
    66 The Crown submitted that the assistance was of a high order even before the undertaking to provide future assistance was given. A combined discount, the Crown contended, above 50 per cent would not be appropriate as the discount for the plea would not amount to 25 per cent. The component for future assistance would only be the Crown submitted a small proportion of the percentage of the overall assistance.  
     
      
    67 During submissions, Mr Ainsworth at one time suggested that 50 per cent was in effect the ceiling for a combined discount for a plea of guilty and assistance. With respect, the Court of Criminal Appeal has recognised that there will be cases in which a combined discount of more than 50 per cent is called for, although those cases will be comparatively rare: see R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; SZ v Regina. Mr Ainsworth also made reference to consideration of an additional discount for the information supplied to police in accordance with the principles in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. The information disclosed in the present case is of a different character to that in Ellis where voluntary disclosure was made by the offender of his involvement in armed robberies of which the police had no knowledge. An added discount, in my opinion, is not warranted in the present case in accordance with the principles in Ellis.  
     
      
    68 I assess for each offender a combined discount for the plea and assistance of 50 per cent of which 10 per cent is specified for the future assistance each has undertaken to give in accordance with the written undertaking. I do not regard the promise of future assistance as being insignificant. Each offender must realise that if he defaults in giving the assistance he has undertaken to give, he will face the prospect of a readily calculable increase in the sentence that is to be imposed today.  
     
      
    69 Victim impact statements of Amelia Nassour, the deceased’s mother, Lilian Nassour and Paula Nassour, the deceased’s sisters, and George Nassour were read to the Court. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offenders’ sentences: R v Previtera (1997) 97 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    70 It is agreed that [KR] and [PR] have been in custody for the present offence since 3 March 2006. Accordingly, the date of commencement of their sentences will be 3 March 2006. 
     
      
    71 It is necessary to consider the principle of parity of sentence: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. The undiscounted starting point of Michael Ibrahim’s sentence was 11 years. His different subjective case required a starting point which was higher than the starting points of the sentences to be imposed on the brothers.  
     
      
    72 The objective seriousness of the offence on the Form 1 is not such that there should be, in my opinion, a significant increase in the length of the sentence to be otherwise imposed on [PR] for the offence of manslaughter. 
     
      
    73 Whilst there are differences in the subjective cases of [KR] and [PR], I conclude on balance that the starting point for their sentences should be the same. The appropriate undiscounted starting point is 10 years 4 months. The sentences are reduced by 50 per cent to 5 years 2 months.  
     
      
    74 Counsel for [KR] and [PR] contended that special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory ratio should be found due to the time the brothers spent in custody for offences which were not proceeded with. I referred to these matters at [34] and [53]. Counsel were unable to cite any authority where special circumstances have been considered to be present in similar circumstances. The general principle is that, save in exceptional circumstances, a period which a person has spent in custody in respect of an unrelated offence, should not be taken into account: Huntington v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 196. The present is not an exceptional case and I do not find special circumstances by reason of the time spent in custody for the offences which were not proceeded with.  
     
      
    75 Considerations of parity require that regard be had to the actual time that Michael Ibrahim must spend in custody for the offence: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. After special circumstances were found, a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months was imposed.  
     
      
    76 It must, however, be borne in mind that special circumstances are not to be found for the same reasons that the sentence was reduced for assistance to police as to do so would amount to double counting: SZ v Regina at [11]. The ultimate constraint upon the discretion to find special circumstances is that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson (2000) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [13]. 
     
      
    77 I find special circumstances being that the offenders’ rehabilitation upon release will be assisted by a longer period under supervision and a slight adjustment has been made to the statutory ratio to reflect that finding. Any greater adjustment would result in a non-parole period which does not appropriately reflect the gravity of the offence. Whilst it might be difficult for the brothers to be supervised by Probation and Parole if they go on witness protection upon release, it seems to me that they should not be deprived of a finding of special circumstances which otherwise would have been made but for their assistance to police. 78 [KR] for the manslaughter of Robin Nassour I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months which is to commence on 3 March 2006 and is to expire on 2 October 2009. I set a balance of term of 1 year 7 months which is to commence on 3 October 2009 and is to expire on 2 May 2011.  
     
      
    79 The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 2 October 2009. 
     
      
    80 [PR] for the manslaughter of Robin Nassour I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months which is to commence on 3 March 2006 and is to expire on 2 October 2009. I set a balance of term of 1 year 7 months which is to commence on 3 October 2009 and is to expire on 2 May 2011.  
     
      
    81 The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 2 October 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal in respect of the sentence imposed upon the respondent, Josh Carroll, for manslaughter. The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the unlawful killing of Luigi Criniti. The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    2 The respondent was sentenced in the District Court where a non-parole period of 18 months and a further term of 18 months imprisonment was imposed. The sentencing judge ordered that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge expressed her factual findings in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[A]bout 1pm on Sunday 20 May [2007] the offender, his elder brother Dave, and a friend, Geoff Bowman, attended the Gladstone Hotel, Marrickville, where they had lunch, consumed alcohol, and watched the football. Whilst they were there they socialised with Alicia Kitchener and Amanda Kelly. At the same time the victim, who was 51 years old, and his friend 55 year old Serbastia Nerandis, were playing poker machines. 
        
       
       
        
        Shortly before the 10pm closing time Alicia Kitchener had a conversation with the victim and Mr Nerandis. Ms Kitchener convinced the victim to collect the $700 he had won on the poker machines before he lost any more than the $300 he had already lost. The victim handed Ms Kitchener $50 to buy a round of drinks for her group of friends, which included the offender. Ms Kitchener took the money but as the bar was closed she attempted to return the $50 to the victim, he would not take it, and suggested she try the bottle shop. She kept the money and returned to her group. 
        
       
       
        
        A short time later the offender left the hotel with his brother, Mr Bowman, Ms Kitchener and Ms Kelly. The group agreed to walk to the offender’s home and continue drinking. They walked a short distance along Marrickville Rd, Marrickville, toward the offender’s home. 
        
       
       
        
        About the same time the victim walked out of the hotel. He called out to Ms Kitchener, ‘Hey give me my $50.’ He then approached the group and said to Ms Kitchener, ‘Where’s the $50?’ Ms Kitchener said to Dave Carroll, ‘I’ve got the $50, I can give it back to him.’ Dave Carroll said, ‘No, no, no, fuck it.’ Mr Bowman said to the victim, ‘What’s your problem? Fuck off and go home.’ 
        
       
       
        
        At this time the victim was standing in front of Ms Kitchener and Dave Carroll. It is alleged that Dave Carroll pushed the victim causing him to take one step backwards. After being pushed the victim said, ‘I’ll get a gun and shoot youse all.’ He was also heard to say, ‘I’m going to kill your whole family’ by a young man who worked in a restaurant close by. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender, who had been about 15 metres in front of the group before the victim approached Ms Kitchener, brushed past Ms Kitchener and his brother and said, ‘You want to talk about guns’ and head-butted the victim in the face. The victim immediately fell backwards onto Marrickville Rd where the back of his head hit the roadway with force. Mr Nerandis and a female shopkeeper went to his aid. The offender told his brother to ring an ambulance and he did so. The offender and his friends then returned home. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bowman asked the offender, ‘What happened?’ The offender replied, ‘I head-butted him.’ 
        
       
       
        
        When Mr Casey of the ambulance service arrived he noticed the victim had swelling to the front of his lips, a haematoma, and abrasions to his occipital region. He also noticed that he was heavily intoxicated. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where his condition deteriorated. He died on 30 May 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        A post mortem was conducted at Glebe Morgue. It revealed that he had suffered a cut inside his top lip, bruising around his nose, a fracture to the back of his skull, bleeding on the brain, and a sub-dural haemorrhage. 
        
       
       
        
        On 21 May 2007, the day after the incident, the offender told his father what had happened. His father advised him to make himself available to the police. The offender then instructed his solicitor to inform police that he would attend the police station if required in relation to the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        On 7 June arrangements were made for the offender to attend Newtown police station with his lawyer. He decline to participate in an interview, and declined to participate in an identification parade. He consented to a forensic procedure, which included having his photograph taken. 
        
       
       
        
        It appears that the victim did have a licence to shoot a rifle. It also appears that he would sometimes get angry over things when he was drinking and would make verbal threats. Those who knew him well knew he would never carry out those threats.” 
        
       
      
    4 The sentencing judge’s account of the facts contains one error which may have significance. Although the respondent had been about 15 metres in front of the group he had returned to them. He was about 1 metre from Mr Criniti when he brushed passed his brother to deliver the head butt. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    5 The sentencing judge carefully considered the subjective circumstances of the respondent. Her Honour made a number of findings favourable to him which were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is very much a case where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the offender. At the time of these events he was 20 years old. He had successfully negotiated high school where in his final year he had been a prefect, and had received both the Principal’s Award, and the Community Spirit Award. He had never been a problem to his parents and was, according to his mother, always helpful and good humoured. He was in his second year of a plumbing apprenticeship and was a highly valued employee. He was the captain of his rugby league team and was renowned for stepping in to calm situations on the field before they got out of hand. In his 17 year playing career he had never been sent to the sin bin or sent off. He had certainly never been in trouble with the criminal law. 
        
       
       
        
        In the light of all the material before me about this young man what occurred on the night of 20 May 2007 is inexplicable. He is unable to explain it. What is clear is that the events of that night have touched him deeply and irrevocably. He is no longer the carefree young man he was. He lives each day conscious that he has taken a human life. He suspended his apprenticeship as he felt it was unfair to his employer to keep working as he was too distressed, anxious and depressed to do the job properly. He stopped playing football as he felt emotionally unable to face people. 
        
       
       
        
        He has been diagnosed as suffering clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety. He is troubled by thoughts of worthlessness, hopelessness, and personal failure. He has almost entirely ceased using alcohol. And yet to keep himself busy he sought and obtained labouring work which requires less concentration than his apprenticeship, and he has sought to deal with his emotional distress by undergoing treatment with Professor Stephen Woods, clinical psychologist, as he feels that confronting his sense of guilt and remorse, though painful, would benefit him. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that this young man genuinely understands the enormity of what he has done, and the suffering he has caused. I am also satisfied that he will live with what he has done for the rest of his life.” 
        
       
      
    6 The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate. Three reasons are advanced: 
     
      
       
      1. Her Honour erred in finding that the youth of the respondent and the need to foster his rehabilitation reduced the need for retribution and general deterrence. 
       
       
      2. Her Honour gave too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and failed to appreciate the objective seriousness of the offence. 
       
       
      3. Her Honour erred in finding that there were exceptional circumstances such that a sentence of periodic detention would reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment. 
       
      
    7 The sentencing judge recognised that when sentencing the respondent there was a need to ensure that the sentence imposed adequately reflected retribution and general deterrence. However, her Honour was of the opinion that the youth of the respondent, together with the excellent prospects of his rehabilitation did not require the sentence to reflect, to any degree, considerations of personal deterrence or the protection of society.  
     
      
    8 I have recently had occasion in this Court to consider the circumstances of a young man of seventeen years of age who, with a single violent act, caused the death of another. In KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 I summarised the principles relevant to the sentencing of such an offender. I said (at [22]-[26]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. These principles were considered in  
        R v GDP  
        (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA),  
        R v E (a child)  
        (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and  
        R v Adamson  
        (2002) 132 A Crim R 511; [2002] NSWCCA 349 at [30].  
         
         
        The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age. ( 
        R v Hearne  
        (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25]). The weight to be given to the fact of the offender’s youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence ( 
        Hearne  
        at [24]). Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult. ( 
        Hearne  
        at [25];  
        MS2 v The Queen  
        (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397 at [61]). 
         
         
        Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In  
        R v Pham & Ly  
        (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135): 
         
         
          
          “It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate.  
          In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes 
          , particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of  
          Williscroft  
          (1975) VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment ie coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.” 
          
         
         
        The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity (

        R v Voss  
        [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in “adult behaviour” ( 
        Voss  
        at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence ( 
        Adamson  
        at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 
         
         
        The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ( 
        R v Hoang  
        [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A ‘child-offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ( 
        R v Bus,  
        unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995;  
        R v Voss  
        [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth ( 
        Hearne  
        at [27])” 
        
       
      
    9 The offender in KT was sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. Although I would have reduced that sentence it was confirmed by the majority of the court. In the course of my reasons I gave consideration to a number of cases where an offender had been sentenced for manslaughter in the circumstances similar to KT. I also drew upon the monograph of the Judicial Commission – Monograph 23 (2006), Sentenced Homicides in NSW 1994-2001 which indicated that the median sentence for manslaughter was 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for juvenile offenders. For adult offenders the median sentence is 7 years imprisonment with a 4 years 6 months non-parole period. I concluded my discussion of the appropriate sentence for a manslaughter committed by young persons with the following remarks (at [41]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… However, there is considerable force in the view that, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders, the decisions of the courts for this type of offence have provided a range of penalty which fails to adequately reflect the need for general deterrence and retribution. The recent experience of this Court indicates that the range of penalties imposed on young offenders who commit random acts of violence resulting in death may not have been sufficient to deter others from similar irresponsible criminal behaviour. In my opinion although the circumstances of an individual offence and offender must always be considered, this Court should in future accept that more significant penalties may be required when sentencing offenders for this type of offence.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the present case the Crown accepted that in the case of youth general deterrence, public denunciation and retribution usually play a subordinate role to considerations of rehabilitation: R v AEM Snr & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97]-[98]; IE v R [2008] NSWCCA 70; KT. However, the Crown also emphasised that the courts have recognised that when a young person conducts him or herself as an adult and commits a serious crime that general principle must be put aside so that general deterrence and retribution are given appropriate significance: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[12]; R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135. 
     
      
    11 The respondent was not a young person to whom the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 applied. He was 20 years of age and had been in employment since leaving school. He was in the second year of a plumbing apprenticeship when the offence was committed. The Crown submitted that young men affected by alcohol who congregate in or near licensed premises are particularly prone to become involved in violence, often with serious and sometimes catastrophic consequences. For this reason it was submitted that when in such circumstances violence results in the loss of another’s life, the sentence imposed must be sufficient to deter other young men from similar conduct. 
     
      
    12 The Crown accepted that in the present case her Honour was correct to recognise the need to foster the respondent’s rehabilitation. However, it was submitted that her Honour gave excessive weight to this matter and inappropriately confined the significance of considerations of general deterrence and retribution. It was submitted that these considerations required a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    13 The Crown acknowledged, as her Honour accepted, that there was only one blow inflicted by the respondent and no weapon was used. However, it was submitted that a head butt is a vicious way of striking someone in the face, particularly when it is delivered by a 20 year old man to a person in their fifties who is significantly affected by alcohol. The Crown emphasised that although her Honour was in error in finding that the respondent had rushed a distance of fifteen metres before inflicting the head butt, the respondent had been some distance ahead of the group when he turned around and returned and then delivered a seemingly spontaneous and brutal attack upon the deceased. Although an ambulance was called the respondent left the injured man lying in the roadway. The Crown submitted that her Honour erred when assessing the respondent’s criminality as falling towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    14 The Crown emphasised that although her Honour determined that the sentence could be served by way of periodic detention because in her opinion there were exceptional circumstances, she did not specify those exceptional circumstances. Presumably she had in mind the respondent’s remorse and demonstrated potential for rehabilitation, which she had earlier discussed. Although the Crown accepted that these matters required consideration, it was submitted that there was nothing exceptional about the circumstances of the offence itself. This was yet another occasion when a violent act was committed by a young man significantly affected by alcohol which ended in the tragic death of another.  
     
      
    15 The Crown submitted that her Honour had failed to recognise that powerful subjective features must remain subsidiary to the need to ensure that an appropriate punishment is provided for the particular offence (see The Queen v Dodd  (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594). The Crown further emphasised that a sentence to be served by periodic detention has a strong degree of leniency built into it, R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67; Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154. 
     
      
    16 The respondent emphasised the principles relevant to a Crown appeal. They have been stated on many occasions and I need not repeat them in detail (see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]). The court has a discretion not to interfere even when error is found (Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321) and should only exercise its jurisdiction to intervene in rare cases. Everett v R (1994) 181 CLR 295; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561. The respondent emphasised that a Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle for the governance and guidance of courts having a duty of sentencing convicted persons (Griffiths v The Queen (1997) 137 CLR 293 at 310). However, the respondent also accepted that the court will intervene to avoid manifest inadequacy or any inconsistency in sentencing where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the particular case: Everett at 299. 
     
      
    17 The respondent submitted that there was considerable significance in the Crown’s concession that the respondent acted in response to the deceased’s provocative act in threatening to get a gun and kill the “whole family”. It was further submitted that because there were no blows, punches or kicks but a single head butt, the respondent could not have anticipated that the deceased would fall down and die. For these reasons it was submitted that her Honour’s finding that the offence was at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness was appropriate. Because of the significant positive aspects of the respondent’s subjective case and his prospects of rehabilitation it was submitted that no error had occurred which required the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    18 Notwithstanding the respondent’s careful submissions I have come to the conclusion that the sentence imposed was so far from that appropriate for the offence that this Court must intervene. Both the length of the sentence and the amelioration of its impact by providing that it be served by periodic detention contributed to a sentence which was manifestly inadequate. Although her Honour found that the deceased made a threat to get a gun, this was an idle boast which could not have justified a violent response from the respondent. Mr Criniti was apparently intoxicated and there was no suggestion that the respondent was under any immediate threat. Perhaps a dismissive word in response to Mr Criniti was justified but not a violent and aggressive act with, on any view, potentially serious physical consequences. Although a head butt delivered to another’s face may not be expected to lead to death, severe injury was clearly foreseeable and death at least a possibility.  
     
      
    19 In my judgment the offence was serious and I am satisfied that it could not justify her Honour’s description as falling towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. The initial dispute was between the deceased and other members of the respondent’s group. It was borne of the deceased’s desire to retrieve his fifty dollars and the entirely unjustified decision not to return it to him. The respondent without adequate justification intruded into that dispute and delivered a head butt to the victim’s face, as a consequence of which he fell and died.  
     
      
    20 There is no doubt that the subjective circumstances of the respondent are significant. However, I am satisfied they deflected the sentencing judge from the appropriate course. In a unanimous judgment this Court said in Dodd: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Jordan CJ pointed out in  
        Geddes 
         at 556, making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as  
        Veen (No 2) 
         (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472; 33 A Crim R 230 at 234 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary: see, for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in  
        Todd 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in  
        Mill 
         (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64; 26 A Crim R 468. Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case:  
        Rushby 
         [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. We consider that to have happened here. In our view the requirement of a reasonable proportionality with the circumstances of the crime called for a significant full-time custodial sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        We should make it clear that we do not suggest that it could never be proper to order that a sentence for the crime of manslaughter be served by way of periodic detention. There may well be cases of manslaughter where that is an appropriate order. It enables the offender to remain in employment and also minimises disruption to family life. We do not disregard the fact that even part-time custody is a substantial punishment. However in the present case we consider the penalty to be so inadequate as to call for intervention by this Court.”  
        
       
      
    21 Indiscriminate acts of violence of the type committed by the respondent which lead to the death of another deserve severe punishment. It will be a rare case where the appropriate punishment for a manslaughter committed in these circumstances does not involve a term of full time custody. This was not such a rare case. The community has a justifiable concern about the level of violence associated with young people and alcohol in our community. Where that violence results in a death of another the community rightly expects the courts to impose a sentence which not only provides appropriate punishment but which will unequivocally send a message that violence is unacceptable.  
     
      
    22 Although I am satisfied that a sentence of full time custody is required, I would not disturb the finding of special circumstances. The discount which her Honour provided for the plea of guilty was appropriate. 
     
      
    23 In my view, the term of imprisonment which her Honour imposed was below the appropriate range for this offence. However, because this is a Crown appeal I do not propose that the starting date for the term of the sentence or the non-parole period should be disturbed. The consequences overall will be that the respondent will serve less than eighteen months in fulltime custody. In my opinion the appropriate orders are: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period to be served by way of full time custody of 18 months to date from 2 May 2008 and expire on 1 November 2009 with a balance of term of 18 months to commence on 2 November 2009 and expire on 1 May 2011. The respondent shall be released to parole on 1 November 2009 on the usual conditions. 
       
      
    24 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I regret to say that I disagree. In my opinion the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed. My conclusion does not depend upon the well-known proposition that Crown appeals ought to be a rarity: Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561; R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. I state at the outset that, in my opinion, this was. a proper case for the Crown to seek to challenge the outcome of this sentencing procedure. Nevertheless, my firm view is that the challenge ought not to succeed. 
     
      
    25 It is appropriate also to make some acknowledgements. The offence of which the respondent admitted his guilt is one of the most serious known to the criminal law. Its consequences were devastating: the death of a human being. Obviously, that circumstance must be given considerable, even great, weight. I do not overlook it. I acknowledge also that, although the respondent was only 20 years of age, he did not fit easily into the category of ""young offender"" such as to attract additional leniency of the kind recognised in, for example, R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112; R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 such as to demand or even justify any major amelioration of the sentence for that reason. 
     
      
    26 Notwithstanding that, the respondent's relative youth was a significant factor to be taken into account. 
     
      
    27 The objective circumstances of the offence have been fully set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, drawn from the Remarks on Sentence of the sentencing judge. It is not necessary to restate them. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    28 In my opinion the respondent presented an exceptional subjective case. This was summarised by the sentencing judge in a few short paragraphs. (By that I do not mean any criticism of the sentencing judge - her observations were an accurate summary of the extensive material that had been put before her.) Those paragraphs, extracted in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, are inadequate to explain why I take the view I do. I therefore propose to make more extensive reference to the detail of the subjective case that was presented. 
     
      
    29 The respondent's mother, Ms Sandra Carroll, provided a statement, and gave oral evidence. Even allowing for a mother's natural bias, the statement revealed a history, on the part of the respondent, from a very young age, of community service. One example will suffice. As a primary school child the respondent took on the care of another child who suffered from muscular dystrophy - to an extent and a level that warranted recognition. Ms Carroll, in her statement and in her oral evidence, painted a picture of the respondent as a young man who had, since childhood, exhibited significant leadership qualities, particularly in community sporting activities. That picture was confirmed as accurate in a large number of written testimonials and statements that were in evidence. 
     
      
    30 Ms Carroll also said that, since the date of the offence, she had noticed a change in the respondent; he had become withdrawn and had lost his sense of humour. That understates the position as revealed in other evidence. 
     
      
    31 The respondent himself gave evidence, principally by reading from a prepared statement. Inter alia, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Since [the offence] my life has changed dramatically as I am deeply ashamed of my actions that has caused much hurt to the victim's family and my own. I cannot seem to find the words by actions to show how sorry I am for taking this person away from his family. Upon finding out that the victim had passed away, I was devastated to know that my actions had taken a human life which had just as much right to live on this earth as I do. ... everyday that goes past I wish I could trade places with the victim so that his family wouldn't have to go through this terrible suffering. ... before this tragedy occurred I was employed as a third year plumbing apprentice which I chose to suspend as I could not concentrate on my job and it was unfair to my employer. I also lost motivation to play rugby league which I have played and loved since I was 3 years old. My immediate future is so uncertain and it is so hard to find enjoyment and satisfaction from anything I do. I find it tough to see a future at all as I cannot control mine and what is happening at this time. ..."" 
        
       
      
    32 There was considerably more, but this is enough to convey the flavour of the respondent's evidence. He was cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor, but nothing he said was the subject of challenge. 
     
      
    33 As the respondent said, on leaving school he commenced a plumbing apprenticeship. At the time of the offence (May 2007) he was within fourteen months of its completion. He was achieving excellent results in the TAFE component of his course. Following his arrest and charge, he initiated the suspension of his apprenticeship because of his inability to focus upon his work, although his employer said that he would be welcome to return when his circumstances permit him to give his full attention to his work. 
     
      
    34 He has also ceased most of his former recreational activities and has almost entirely ceased the consumption of alcohol. 
     
      
    35 A report of a psychological assessment conducted in February 2008 by Professor Stephen Woods showed that the respondent suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, with co-morbid Major Depressive Disorder, to a severe degree, without psychotic features, resulting from the events that give rise to the charge of manslaughter. Professor Woods described the respondent's emotional state as ""obviously depressed and agitated""; he was observed to be physically ill prior to the consultation. His depression was described as clinically severe. 
     
      
    36 Professor Woods also made one alarming observation, that was not in any way challenged. He (correctly and realistically) assumed that the respondent was at risk of being sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment. He said that if that occurred, the realistic potential for him to receive the necessary treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder and associated depressive disorder was ""minimal""; he therefore noted a risk of self harm. He recommended treatment for the respondent in the event that he was not sentenced to full-time custody. 
     
      
    37 In a second report, dated April 2008, Professor Woods said that the respondent had contacted him for treatment, which he agreed to provide.' Professor Woods noted that the risk of self harm had (at the time of writing the report) lessened, but he considered that the respondent still required ""further and specialist"" treatment, which was not, Professor Woods understood, available in a correctional centre. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing considerations 
       
      
    38 There are no absolutes in sentencing law but it is a very unusual case of manslaughter that does not call for a sentence of full-time custody. Having said that, however, it is apposite to recall that it has long been recognised that manslaughter is a crime which may be committed in circumstances of such variety as to give to rise to sentences of equal variety: see, for example, R v Schelberger, unreported, NSWCCA, 2 June 1988, per Yeldham, Grove and McInerney JJ; R v Elliott, unreported, NSWCCA, 14 February 1991, per Hunt, Campbell and Newman JJ. 
     
      
    39 A fundamental aspect of the sentencing exercise is the correct identification and recognition of the objective gravity of the offence. There are two components to the assessment of that objective gravity: an examination of the precise acts (or, in. some cases, omissions) of the offender; and the consequences of those acts. There are many cases (of which this is an example) in which the consequences are out of all proportion to the act constituting the offence. Here, the respondent, acting impulsively, in the context of consumption of alcohol, a sudden but escalating dispute, and a threat of serious violence on the part of the victim, spontaneously engaged in what McClellan CJ at CL describes as an act of violence. True it was, as his Honour says, an act of violence that foreseeably, potentially could have led to injury to the victim; I have more difficulty with the proposition that “severe injury” was clearly foreseeable, and death foreseeable as ""at least a possibility"". This, perhaps, represents my first point of departure from the reasoning of the Chief Judge. In my opinion the proper characterisation of the respondent's conduct was of an alcohol-fuelled, foolish, possibly thuggish, spontaneous (and immature, even childish) act. He behaved impetuously, plainly without thinking, in the face of a threat from Mr Criniti. This is not to blame the victim, it is to recognise the circumstance in which the respondent acted. He could not have been expected to foresee that Mr Criniti would fall to the ground and strike his head in such a way as to cause serious injury; far less could he have been expected to foresee death. This is not a case where the use of a weapon, such as a knife, or a blunt instrument, or even kicking, dictates a conclusion that fatal consequences were foreseeable. 
     
      
    40 Nevertheless, that was the consequence of his act, which was undoubtedly unlawful, and it is the consequence for which he must pay the price. But it is relevant to recall that the consequence was indeed out of all proportion to his act. After all, the converse holds good. It is not at all uncommon for it to be remarked, by sentencing judges or by this Court, that an offender is fortunate not to be facing a more serious charge. That is merely another way of saying that, in such a case, the objective gravity of the conduct resulted in consequences less dire than they may have been: or that, proportionally, the conduct was more serious than the consequences it yielded, in that the consequences were (fortunately) disproportionate to the conduct. 
     
      
       
      Rehabilitation 
       
      
    41 S 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act”) sets out the aggravating factors and mitigating factors that a sentencing court is obliged to take into account in the sentencing exercise. One of the mitigating factors is that ""the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation ..."" Some attention was paid to this factor by the sentencing judge, and has been by McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    42 I have concluded that this is not a case in which the concept of rehabilitation has any role to play. The Macquarie Dictionary (I have the 19'85 revised edition) defines ""rehabilitate"" as: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. to restore to a good condition, esp. in a medical sense, of persons; regenerate, or alter to an improved form. 2. to educate for resumption of normal activities, as a person handicapped by accident or disease. 3. to re-establish in good repute or accepted respectability, as a person or the character, name, etc., after disrepute. 4. to restore formally to a former capacity or standing, or to rank, rights, or privileges lost or forfeited."" 
        
       
       
        
        ""Rehabilitation"" is give two corresponding meanings. 
        
       
      
    43 None of these, in my opinion, is precisely apt to convey the notion of ""rehabilitation"" as it is commonly used in sentencing law and proceedings. In that context the notion of ""rehabilitation"" usually carries with it, at least implicitly, the notion that the offender has been. involved in, or is at risk of, significant criminality. It imports rescue or recovery from a lifestyle of which crime and criminality are a part. 
     
      
    44 That is not the case here. The respondent has, apart from this single momentary aberration, no criminal history, and there is not the slightest indication that he ever would become associated with a criminal lifestyle. There is no criminal association from which he needs to be or could be rescued. That is why I have set out, in some detail, the subjective matters that were before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    45 That, of course, is not to say that the respondent is not entitled to the benefit of his prior favourable history; it is to focus upon the proper recognition that should be given to that, which is more than merely giving rise to a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation. His prior history stands to his credit as a balance against his single criminal act. 
     
      
       
      Consistency in sentencing 
       
      
    46 In recent times this Court has moved towards establishing, as a core goal of the sentencing process, consistency. I accept that consistency in sentencing has much to recommend it and is, in general, highly desirable. It has, for example, the potential to circumvent resentments and feelings of injustice on the part of offenders who commit similar crimes but are not treated equally. The availability of computer-aided statistics has made it possible to facilitate the move towards consistency. The same motivation has produced (in NSW) guideline sentences, which had their origin in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, followed by statutory authorisation in Pt 3 Div 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    47 Consistency, however, is not an overriding goal; in each case, it is the selection of the correct sentence to fit the offence and the offender that is the overriding goal. Consistency must yield to the essential-justice of each case. So much, I think, emerges from the decision of the High Court in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584. 
     
      
    48 It is pertinent, at this point, to return to a decision that was once frequently cited in this Court: R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394. There King CJ (in the Court of Criminal Appeal, South Australia), said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges. There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge's sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case. There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender's life might lead to reform. The proper role for prosecution appeals, in my view, is to enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime, to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crime to be corrected, and occasionally to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience."" 
        
       
      
    49 Osenkowski was once an overused and overworked case that, because of its overuse and overwork, had almost worn out its welcome in this Court. That it is overused and overworked does not mean that it has no further work to do, or has no further relevance. Indeed, it was cited with approval by Gleeson CJ in Wong and Leung (at [8]). 
     
      
    50 Occasionally - very occasionally - there is presented a case to which Osenkowski has particular application. This is one such case.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    51 I recognise that, in most cases if not all, a favourable subjective case cannot be allowed to overpower the objective gravity of the crime under consideration. A clear-eyed approach has to be taken to the proper balancing of the two competing considerations. In this case the balancing process persuades me that the sentencing judge was not in error in the approach that she took. The, most significant aspect, to my mind, is the analysis of the proportion between what the respondent actually did, and its dire consequences. One further circumstance that I have not mentioned, which is of some (although limited) significance is that the respondent, with his father's assistance, contacted police and volunteered to attend for interview. This circumstance cannot be accorded too much weight: there was not the slightest doubt that the respondent would be identified as the perpetrator, and would be arrested and charged. However, it is some evidence of his willingness to accept responsibility for his conduct. 
     
      
    52 Further, I am conscious of the alarming opinion expressed by Professor Woods, and his evidence that the treatment that the respondent requires will almost certainly not be available to him in a prison setting; and the potentially dire consequences of that. 
     
      
    53 In the whole of the circumstances of this case, I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    54 I emphasise that this is not a decision based on the discretion which remains in the court, even where error is shown, to dismiss a Crown appeal. That discretion must be exercised upon a principled basis, and, if McClellan CJ at CL is right in finding that the sentencing judge was in error, there were no discretionary circumstances that would deflect this Court from performing its duty. My view is based upon a conclusion that the sentencing judge was not in error. 
     
      
    55 HISLOP J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

   JUDGMENTIntroduction1. Scott Cole claims damages from DIB Group as a result of injuries he suffered on 30 June 2005, when he stepped on a pit cover at the Goulburn Mobil Depot, which DIB occupied. His foot slipped into the pit and he suffered a serious and complex fracture of the left ankle, as well as further complications.2. He also sued Gilbarco Australia Pty Limited, but there was no evidence that it was liable, and there will be a verdict in its favour. Mobil Oil (Australia) Limited was also sued, but those proceedings were discontinued.3. DIB raised as a defence the provisions of the Workers Compensation Act, s 151Z, because, at the time, Mr Cole was employed by Finemore’s Transport, and DIB says the employer was in breach of its non-delegable duty to provide a safe system of work. It also raised contributory negligence.4. The accident happened about 6.40 a.m. I infer that, given the date of 30 June, the light (if any) would have been very faint dawn, although there was evidence that some areas of the depot were lit, Mr Cole says this area was not well lit and it was hard for him to see. He had arrived with a load of fuel in the tanker he was employed to drive. In order to discharge the fuel, he was required to walk from the tanker to the static fuel tank and open a series of valves. When unloading was complete, he had to walk back and close the valves, and this is what he was doing when he fell. Occupier’s liability5. The pit appears from the photos in evidence to be about 60-80 cm square. The evidence was that it was only about 20-30 cm deep. It is surrounded by rectangular pieces of wood, which were a centimetre or two above the ground, and the lid, at the time, was solid metal. According to Ms Skelly, who was then the Occupational Health and Safety supervisor at Finemore’s, when she visited the site shortly after Mr Cole fell, she found that the lid was supposed to rest firmly on a concrete rim within the pit, but that the concrete corners of the rim had been chipped away to make the lid easier to remove. This made it unstable when weight was placed on the corner.6. Ms Skelly, and Mr Byrd, her counterpart employed by DIB, produced a report on Mr Cole’s accident, recommending that the pit and its cover be changed to prevent future accidents of the same type, and this was done, but not immediately. The changes appear in photographs taken later. They could, if necessary, constitute an admission that the pit cover was dangerous. 7. I am satisfied that the pit, with the chipped edges, was a hidden trap, and that any person who saw the pit cover in place would not know that it was unstable. I also find that a solid metal plate, flush with the ground surface, would, to a reasonable person, appear to be safe to tread on.8. Ms Skelly gave evidence, without objection, that Mr Byrd told her that he had fallen himself, when he put his weight on the corner of the pit cover. This is evidence that DIB had actual knowledge that the pit cover, as it was on 30 June 2005, was not reasonably safe. This constitutes a breach of the duty of the occupier to those who, like Mr Cole, were lawfully on its premises.Contributory negligence9. DIB contends that, in putting his foot on the pit cover, Mr Cole failed to take reasonable care for his own safety, or was guilty of contributory negligence, within the scope of the Civil Liability Act, s 5R. It advances this contention, either, because it says Mr Cole failed to keep a proper lookout, or because he chose a route that was unnecessarily risky. 10. I have already alluded to the time of this accident, a time when the dawn light was, at best, dim. In any event, although the pit had a wooden border, there was absolutely nothing to indicate that it was not safe for a person to place weight on the pit cover. There was certainly nothing to lead to the inference that risk of the pit cover sliding from its mounting and causing injury was an obvious risk. Nor was there anything to suggest that the route that Mr Cole in fact followed was in any way unreasonable.11. I therefore find that there was no contributory negligence as expressed in s 5R.Responsibility of the employer12. DIB has raised the non-delegable duty of the employer. The employer was not represented, but it is inescapable that an employer has a duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe place and safe system of work. Ms Skelly gave evidence of what Finemore’s had done. They provided an induction for their drivers. The trainer visited various sites, including the Goulburn depot, and was required to report any obvious risks.13. DIB argues that because the pit cover was in fact unsafe, Finemore’s had a duty to prevent the risk of a collapse by warning its employee drivers to avoid walking over the pit cover. It also says that Finemore’s was in breach of its duty by failing to inspect the Goulburn site. 14. The non-delegable duty of the employer is to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work. The duty is onerous, even stringent, but it is not absolute. It is different in nature from the duty of an occupier. It would not, I find, have been reasonable for Finemore’s to have lifted the pit cover to see that the corners had been chipped away. Even if there had been a site inspection, it was beyond any reasonable expectation that the defect in the concrete, that caused the pit cover to be unstable, would have been discovered on inspection. The defendant could not establish that there was any causal relationship between any breach of duty by Finemore’s and Mr Cole’s injury.15. DIB relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pollard v Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineeering Pty Ltd  [2008] NSWCA 99, especially at [33] - [36]. I find that that decision, which concerned the position where the employer is a labour hire business, who sends its employees to work on the premises of someone else, does not apply here, because, as I indicated, even if Finemore’s had inspected the site in a reasonable way, the chipped concrete would not have been obvious to a reasonable person.16. Because of the reasoning I have expressed in relation to contributory negligence, I could not find that it would have been reasonable for Finemore’s to instruct its drivers to walk other than on the path followed by Mr Cole.17. I find that the employer was not in breach of any duty owed to the employee, and that therefore s 151Z has no application.Damages18. Mr Cole is now 40. He was 38 at the time of this accident. He left school after completing his School Certificate, and obtained a position as an apprentice motor mechanic. He had a motor cycle accident, which left him with no permanent impairment, but when he was fit to return to work, there was no position for him. He then obtained work as a storemen and packer, and then as a truck driver. From 1990 until June 2000 he drove trucks. In 2000 he suffered a back injury when he was injured by a roller door. He returned to work after 8 months, but then suffered a further similar injury. He returned to light duties, and ultimately settled a claim for compensation in respect of his back injury. He stopped working as a driver and trained as a security guard. After he completed a security course in Wollongong, he worked briefly as a security guard in Goulburn. He then found a position as driver of a concrete agitator truck and, from 2003, as a tanker driver, first with Lewington’s, and when that business was taken over by Finemore’s, with Finemore’s. The work was driving tankers from Sydney to Goulburn and then to various service stations serviced from Goulburn. Mr Cole says he continues to suffer some back pain, but can still work.19. The work as a tanker driver did require Mr Cole to climb into the cab of the prime mover, and on occasions to climb on to the top of the tanker, to check hatches. However, unlike his previous truck driving work, he did not have to load or unload cargoes manually, tie down loads, or move steel fences on the flat-top trailer. He does have to use his left foot to operate the clutch on an assembly that has an 18- or 20-speed gearbox.20. Before he started work with Lewington’s Mr Cole fell from the back of a utility and fractured his right ankle. He was not at work at the time. 21. After he trod on the metal pit cover and his foot went into the pit, an ambulance was called and Mr Cole was taken to Goulburn base Hospital. A surgeon, Mr Lyttle, performed an open reduction of the left ankle. He fitted a plaster cast. Mr Cole had this for some weeks and was on crutches. The ankle is permanently scarred, and Mr Cole still suffers swelling and pain in this ankle. Mr Cole was off work for 8 months, but then returned to work.22. In 2003, after the injury to his right ankle, Mr Cole suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Dr Koutts at Westmead Hospital treated him with Warfarin.23. In July 2005, after the incident leading to this claim, there was a recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. 24. After he had returned to work with Finemores for about 4 months, Mr Cole suffered retroperitoneal haemorrhage, and was taken off Warfarin. He was in hospital for about a week, and off work for 2 months. He returned to work.25. Mr Cole said he suffered soreness and swelling in his left ankle when he was driving for Finemore’s. In May 2008 he accepted an offer of a job driving fuel tankers for Coote’s Transport, This job involved shorter hours (about 10 hours per week less) and slightly lower pay (on average about $210 per week less) but Mr Cole took the job because he suffered less pain. He continues to work in this position.Non-economic loss26. Mr Cole spent two periods in hospital as a result of the injuries he suffered in this accident. He underwent surgery on his ankle, and consequently he suffered the deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. His left ankle is permanently scarred. He has constant soreness and swelling in his left ankle, becoming acute after long periods of driving and at the end of each 5-day week.  
    27. At present, Mr Cole can carry out the work of a fuel tanker driver without undue pain or discomfort. His case is that the condition of his ankle will, more probably than not, deteriorate and prevent him from working in this capacity until he is 65. Dr Conrad, a medico legal expert, believes that his working life is likely to be five to ten years shorter than would otherwise have been the case. The defendants' medico legal experts, while conceding the seriousness of his injury, do not agree. Dr Donaldson considers that it is possible that Mr Cole may, in future, suffer from arthritis or some other complication (including necrosis), but, while it is most likely that the onset of that condition would occur within two years of the injury, the possibility cannot be totally excluded. On this basis, while I do not accept Dr Conrad's view that Mr Cole's working life will be significantly reduced, I cannot discount the possibility of some reduction. This possibility should be reflected both in the damages for non-economic loss, because of the concern it will cause to Mr Cole, and in damages for loss of earning capacity.  
    28. In the circumstances, I consider that Mr Cole’s situation places him as 33% of a most extreme case and I will award damages for non-economic loss accordingly. The amount, in accordance with the Civil Liability Act s 16, is $146,000.Future economic loss.29. Although in his evidence, Mr Cole indicated that he was currently earning roughly the same amount with Coote's as he was with Finemore's’, the tax returns and group certificates in evidence indicate that he is, in fact, earning about $210 per week less. I am satisfied that Mr Cole changed jobs so that he would enjoy reduced hours and suffer less pain and swelling in his right ankle. I am not satisfied that it was necessary for him to sacrifice $200 per week. 
    30. In the circumstances, it seems to me, that it is appropriate to compensate Mr Cole for loss of future earning capacity by awarding him a ""buffer"", which will reflect both a slight reduction in earnings, and the possibility that his working life will be reduced. To make a specific calculation, based on a dollar amount and percentage likelihoods would not, in my view, be a proper approach to take here, because the evidence gives rise to possibilities that are not capable of precise calculation. These include the effect of pre-existing conditions on Mr Cole’s ability to work, and the possibility that the injury to the left ankle will reduce his working life. I propose to award a buffer of $120,000.Other economic loss31. Past out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $8,951.32. Mr Cole claims future out-of-pocket expenses, but there is no evidence to support this claim so none will be awarded.33. Past wage loss is agreed at 34 weeks @ $130 per week ($31,620) and 21 weeks at the difference between the earnings at Finemore's and the earnings at Coote's (($213 per week) ($4473). The total is $36,093. Superannuation on this amount is $3970.23. The Fox v Wood component is agreed at $3704.34. There will be a verdict for the plaintiff for $318,719.23.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: In October 1999 LB, who was then eighteen years of age formed a relationship with the offender, Joseph Anthony Timbery. They started to live together at (an address not to be published) where other members of Mr Timbery’s family also lived from time to time. 2 It was not long before the relationship became one characterised by regular violence on the part of the offender. He is now to be sentenced for eleven serious acts of violence, some of which left LB with significant and permanent scars.3 The first offence was committed on 16 April 2000. 4 The complainant and the offender were having a few drinks and ended up in an argument. During the argument the offender came at the complainant with an iron bar hitting her across the forehead with it. She went to the Prince of Wales Hospital where the injury was treated by doctors. Stitches and butterfly straps were put on her forehead. LB has a scar above her left eye as a result. 5 This is an offence of malicious wounding for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment.6 Count 2 occurred on the same day as count 1, after the complainant returned from hospital. LB went to bed and pretended that she was going to sleep. The offender began kissing her before pulling her pants down and inserting a VO5 mousse bottle into her vagina. She jumped out of bed and the offender left. 7 This is an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years imprisonment.8 Count 4 occurred in May 2000. On this occasion the complainant and the offender were drinking in the lounge room at (an address not to be published). Again, they got into an argument and this time the offender came at the complainant with a wooden chisel. The sort used to carve wood. The offender started to stab her on her shoulders, arms and upper body with that chisel. He was also, at the same time, stabbing her with a metal dinner fork. Then got out a little wooden baseball bat and started hitting LB on the vagina. LB was screaming. The offender pinned her down on the ground, took her pants off and then put his penis into her vagina. After he had finished she passed out and when she woke up in the lounge room her vagina was very sore. Photographs of the complainant were tendered at the trial and some marks caused by the chisel were easily identifiable. 9 This is an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, for which the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment.10 Count 5 occurred on 18 May. The complainant and the offender were drinking when the offender bashed her with a baseball bat. She was trying to block his assault with her arm and was back-pedalling as she did so. She said he “chucked” her on the bed in the front room, hitting her and told her to take her clothes off. After that he put his penis into her vagina. The Complainant was screaming as this occurred and in response the offender just told her to “shut up” saying he could do whatever he wanted because she was “his woman”. 11 This is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment.12 Count 6 occurred straight after count 5. After the offender had penetrated LB’s vagina with his penis he turned her on to her stomach and told her to put her knees up under her belly and as he was using the baseball bat on her back he put his penis into her anus. 13 This is yet another offence of sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is once more twenty years imprisonment.14 Count 7 occurred on 25 June 2000. The complainant was at the offender’s sister’s house. She and the offender had an argument so she went out of the house and he chased her to the front of the building where he began choking her. He dragged her to a block of flats next door, where he pinned her up against the wall and punched her all over her face. She had blood coming from her mouth and head. After this she noticed that her jaw was painful and she was taken to the hospital. She went back the following day and discovered that her jaw was broken. 15 This is an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment.16 Count 8 occurred on 21 August 2000. The complainant and the offender were at (an address not to be published). They might have been drinking when they got into an argument and the offender hit her with the same iron bar that he had hit her with before. This time he hit her in the left eye and told her to get into the caravan. Once in there he told her to get on to the bed where he pulled her pants down and performed oral sex on her by licking her vagina. Once more this is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment.17 Count 9 also occurred on 21 August 2000 after the offender had licked LB’s vagina, which was count 8, he jumped up, pulled his pants down and said “suck me cock”. As a result of him having already hit her with the iron bar, and still having the iron bar in his possession, she did what he asked. This is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment.18 Count 10 occurred straight after count 9. The offender told LB to take her clothes off because he wanted sex. She said “Fuck off, I don’t want you near me”, to which he replied “Shut-up you mole, and I can do whatever I want”. After that he raped her putting his penis into her vagina. 19 This is another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment.20 Count 11 occurred on 29 September 2000. The complainant was getting ready to go to a birthday party. She walked into the lounge room as she was about to leave when the offender told her that she was not going anywhere. The offender had a ceramic plate which he broke on the corner of the lounge and used one part of it to slice LB’s left thigh, after which he said “You won’t be walking nowhere now”.  LB was taken to the hospital, but lied about her injury telling doctors that she had fallen off a cliff. She has been left with a significant scar on her leg as a result of his incident. 21 This is another offence of malicious wounding for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment.22 Count 12 occurred on Christmas Day, 2000. The complainant was at (an address not to be published), with the offender having a few drinks when the offender came at her with a hammer and began hitting her. He dragged her inside the house and they ended up in the front bedroom. Once there he told the complainant to get on the bed but when she refused his demand that she ""jerk him” he said he was going to “bash her worse”. So he pulled out the little baseball bat, which he had used before, and a golf club. He began hitting her all over her body with those things. He put an orange extension cord around her throat before putting his penis into her vagina at the same time as choking her with the extension cord and hitting her with the hammer. 23 This is yet another offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment.24 The brutal depravity of these offences needs no emphasis from me. The descriptions of the offences speak for themselves. 25 This is not the first time the offender was convicted of these offences. He stood trial earlier but a re-trial was necessary because of errors identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the conduct of the first trial. I mention this circumstance only to explain why it is that the offender is to be sentenced today for matters which occurred many years ago. 26 The offender is now thirty years of age but was only twenty three at the time of these offences. He is the fourth of five children who came from a supportive environment. There is no suggestion that the family in which he was raised experienced problems with either alcohol or domestic violence. 27 Despite this upbringing the offender has a terrible criminal history with many offences of violence upon it. The first of those violent offences resulted in the offender being sentenced to imprisonment for five years to be served in a detention centre. The circumstances of that offence are set out in the remarks on sentence of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Timbery unreported, CCA 1 April 1996. The offender and his brother-in-law set upon an off duty police officer, beating him with wooden sticks, knocking him to the ground and punching him and kicking him into unconsciousness before stealing his credit cards, $15 and a watch and then running away. When he was sentenced for that matter he asked that two other offences involving assault be taken into account. One of those was another robbery in which a victim’s leg was broken. 28 Later he was convicted of malicious wounding. Then there was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which occurred in disturbingly similar circumstances to the offences for which I must sentence him. The offender and the victim of this offence had been in a relationship for five months but despite the victim wishing to end the relationship, the offender appears to have remained affected by overwhelming feelings of jealousy and a desire to inflict violence. When he met up with this victim he asked her where she was going and when she replied that she was going to basketball he said “No, you’re going to Redfern to get fucked by someone”. He then grabbed her by the hair, dragging her along the street, saying “If I can’t have you, no cunt can”. He punched her to the mouth causing her to fall to the ground before taking her to his sister’s address, pushing her into a bedroom and punching her in the face several more times. 29 The offender has numerous other convictions on his criminal history. It has been a characteristic of sentences imposed upon him that the offender has breached every order of a court involving supervision of the Probation and Parole Service by re-offending. Indeed all of these offences, represent breaches of two forms of conditional liberty, a s 558 bond and perhaps more importantly, parole. He had only just been released to parole when he began the relationship with LB and it was only a comparatively short time after that when he commenced committing these seriously violent offences against her.30 The offender drinks enormously. Indeed at the time of these offences he had apparently consumed a case of beer and a four litre cask of wine at a sitting. This level of consumption would usually be on a daily basis. On top of that he used illegal drugs as well. 31 A report by Dr Christopher Lennings was tendered on behalf of the offender. He also gave evidence when the Crown indicated that she wished to cross-examine him. I will have more to say about that report later but will note at this stage an apparent difference between Dr Lennings’ findings and those others who have been called upon to make an assessment of the offender. Dr Lennings concluded on the basis of IQ testing that Mr Timbery is a person who is functioning only at the very bottom end of Australian society and is having a great deal of difficulty in being able to manage accordingly. Dr Lennings places his IQ at the top end of the mentally retarded region or better than only the bottom two per cent of the population. 32 These findings are difficult to reconcile with earlier reports. An earlier pre-sentence report describes the offender as  
     
      
      “an articulate young man which would appear to belie the lack of formal education and certain level of illiteracy”.  
      
    33 And a report from the Department of Corrective Services, Forensic Psychology Services, describes him in these terms, “Mr Timbery impressed as a bright young man”. 34 The possibility is of course that the offender, experienced as he is in the criminal justice system, has simply not done his best when tested by Dr Lennings. I did not see in his report any suggestion that he had administered tests designed to establish whether the offender might have been feigning, but I have not found it necessary to resolve this issue. Even if the conclusions of Dr Lennings are to be preferred this is not a case where the offender’s moral culpability is in any way reduced by a low IQ. Dr Lennings was of the view that the offender, because of his low IQ, would not have had the mental resources to address issues in a way which a more intelligent person might. But it takes very little intelligence at all to understand that the offences committed by the offender were seriously wrong, indeed cruel. These offences were motivated by a desire to control, abuse and humiliate the victim. Despite the offender’s low IQ he got precisely what he wanted. The victim was subjugated to his will, even to the extent of declining many opportunities to complain to the authorities about the terrible things the offender was doing to her.35 No-one really seems to hold out much hope for the offender’s long term rehabilitation. Dr Lennings assesses the probability that he will commit further offences of sexual violence as moderately high and said in evidence that the risk of the offender committing a further violent offence is high. 36 This, combined with an examination of the offender’s history and a consideration of the nature of his wrong doing in the present case satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that it is almost inevitable that the offender will commit further serious offences once released from custody.37 It is of course legitimate for a sentencing judge to take into account the need to protect the community when imposing a sentence upon an offender. What is not permitted is a sentence which is extended beyond that which would otherwise be appropriate in order to give effect to the desire for preventative detention. 38 I am not going to mince words here. Given the offender’s history of violence and given Dr Lennings’ assessment of the probability of future violence it is my confident prediction that once released from custody the offender will harm someone else through a further offence of violence in a serious way. 39 The two cases of Veen v The Queen (No 1)(1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465 set out quite clearly the proper approach to preventative detention and the circumstances of the offences of Mr Veen demonstrate why it is that preventative detention can and should, in appropriate cases, be an important factor in determining an appropriate sentence. I repeat I will not extend the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon the offender, extension by reason of preventative detention which is impermissible but in exercising my sentencing discretion I will have regard to the protection of society, among other factors of course. 40 The offender suggested his offences were not premeditated. Even if that is the case, it is a matter of very little mitigation in the context of an ongoing series of sexual and physical assaults. There is no suggestion that after each offence the offender was genuinely remorseful and determined to mend his ways. On the contrary the offender having perceived that he got what he wanted each time he violently abused LB seems to have adopted the attitude that when the occasion next arose he would do exactly the same again.41 I have to be careful of course to remember that the offender was a much younger man when he committed these offences than he is now. However he was far from an immature youth when he commences his series of offences against LB. I do not regard his age either then or now as a matter of mitigation.42 Given the number and nature of the offences and the requirement to take into account the protection of society there is a real risk that the sentence I impose upon the offender will be a crushing one. I do not aim to crush the offender but do aim to reflect his overall criminality by an appropriately harsh sentence. 43 The effect of these many crimes on LB has been substantial. She is left with physical scars as well as mental ones from the ongoing physical and mental abuse she received at the hands of the offender. The impact of the offender’s crimes upon LB is a matter which of course I must take into account. However, I should say a number of things about the victim impact statement. There are a number of matters contained within it that I am not allowed to take into account when formulating a sentence to impose upon the offender. These include other acts of criminality of which the offender has not been convicted, the conduct of others, the effect of the trial process and what in effect amounted to submissions on sentence. Of course this is not to ignore the very serious impact of the offender’s wrongdoing but it is to recognise that some consequences for LB are not properly to be taken into account when deciding what sentence to impose upon the offender.44 The offender has apparently been serving his time in custody on protection and is still there now. No longer is it automatically assumed that a prisoner, once on protection, will remain there. Nor is it automatically assumed that those serving their sentences on protection experience harsher conditions of custody than those in the general prison population. There is however a risk the offender will serve a large part, if not all of his sentence on protection and there is also a risk that this will involve harsher conditions than would otherwise be the case. I will take those risks into account.45 The offender has been in custody from the date of his arrest on 19 May 2005. Ordinarily his sentence would commence on that date but since being arrested for these matters he has served a period of imprisonment of six months for an unrelated matter. Accordingly the sentence I will shortly announce commences from 19 November 2005. 46 Not much can really be made of the delay in this case. There is little to suggest that the offender spent the period between the commission of his offences and his arrest worrying about whether he would ultimately be dealt with for his wrongdoing. Nor has the offender been able to demonstrate any rehabilitation since he committed these serious offences. Indeed his failure to admit them suggests that he has not changed much, if at all.47 I record that the offender has previously been sentenced by the late Judge Donovan. He sentenced the offender for all of the offences which I must sentence him, apart from one. It was count 3 on the indictment before me where the jury found the offender not guilty. The overall sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Donovan consists of an effective non parole period of twenty-four years with an effective total term of thirty-three years. This was the subject of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal but the Court sensibly did not deal with that appeal, having decided to quash the offender’s conviction and return him to this Court for a new trial. 48 The relevance of Judge Donovan’s sentence is of course that ordinarily the offender is not to receive a longer sentence simply because he successfully appealed against his conviction. 49 There are no special circumstances in this case apart from the fact that there is some accumulation of sentences. 50 On count 1 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of four years to date from 19 May 2005. 51 On count 2 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of imprisonment of five years to date from 19 May 2006. 52 On count 7 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of five years to date from 19 May 2007. 53 On count 12 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of six years to date from 19 May 2008. 54 On counts 5 and 6 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of twelve years to date from 19 May 2010. 55 These sentences are all fixed terms because there is no utility in setting a non parole period given the other sentences which I will now announce. 56 On counts 8, 9 and 10 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. On each count I set a non parole period of nine years and a head sentence of twelve years to commence on 19 May 2012. 57 On count 4 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of eight years and a head sentence of fourteen years to date from 19 May 2015. 58 Thus the overall term is a sentence of twenty-four years with a non parole period of eighteen years. The non parole period will expire on 18 May 2023 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 59 It is my recommendation that the offender not be granted parole until the offender has successfully completed the CUBIT program or some other similar program.

   JUDGMENT1 The manufacture, both within and without Australia, the supply within Australia, the import into Australia and the export from Australia of therapeutic goods are controlled by the Therapeutic Goods Act administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.2 The manufacturers, places of manufacture and manufacturing processes of therapeutic goods are controlled by the Act. All places of manufacture and manufacturing processes must conform to the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, whether the place of manufacture is within or without Australia. Only therapeutic goods manufactured by approved manufacturers at approved places by approved processes may be supplied within Australia, imported into Australia or exported from Australia.3 All therapeutic goods, whether prescription or non-prescription goods, must be evaluated for quality and safety and, in relation to some prescription goods, efficacy, by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to ensure conformity with the required standard. Only therapeutic goods which conform with the standard are approved for manufacture within, supply within, import into and export from Australia.4 Once a therapeutic good is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration it is registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods in the name of the person or company, called the sponsor, manufacturing, importing or exporting the good.5 A therapeutic good registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is either a “listed” good or a “registered” good. A listed good is a non-prescription good other than an analgesic and a registered good is a prescription good or an analgesic.6 When a therapeutic good is registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods it is registered in the name of its sponsor and given its identifying number. A listed good’s number begins with the prefix “AUST L”and a registered good’s number begins with the prefix “AUST R” and each prefix is followed by five numbers. Accordingly, an identifying number identifies both the sponsor and the good.7 A sponsor, whether a person or a company, wishing to export a therapeutic good from Australia to another country must obtain registration of the good in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.8 Before a sponsor may export a therapeutic good from Australia to another country the sponsor must obtain a Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product, a Certificate of a Listed Product or a Certificate of an Exempt Product in relation to the good from the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Such a Certificate is issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the World Health Organisation Certification Scheme related to the international trade of therapeutic products.9 A Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product is issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for a therapeutic good that is registered in the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods and approved for supply within Australia or such a good approved for export only.10 A Certificate of a Listed Product is issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for a therapeutic good that is registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and approved for supply within Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Administration does not issue such a Certificate for a good approved for export only.11 A Certificate of an Exempt Product is issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for a therapeutic good that is not required to be registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods but is, nonetheless, subject to the Therapeutic Goods Act.12 The various Certificates issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration contain various information about the therapeutic good required by the World Health Organisation Certification Scheme and include a formulation certificate and analysis certificate.13 A formulation certificate details the ingredients and the strength of the ingredients contained in the therapeutic good.14 An analysis certificate, also called an analytical report, details the result of analysis of a sample of the manufactured therapeutic good.15 A therapeutic good approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for “export only” cannot be supplied in Australia but may be exported to a nominated country and such a good is registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods as a listed good.16 Most countries to which an export only therapeutic good manufactured in Australia may be exported, evaluate the good according to its regulatory requirements to approve the importation of the good into the country but some countries, including Vietnam, rely upon the regulatory regime of the exporting country, such as Australia, to ensure that the imported good is safe and of the required quality.17 The Drug Administration of Vietnam, which is part of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, will allow the importation of a therapeutic good from another country, including Australia, if the good is approved for sale and is on the market for sale within the exporting country and is authenticated by a Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product or a Certificate of a Listed Product, otherwise the exporter must apply to the Drug Administration to register the drug as a therapeutic good for supply within Vietnam.18 Gateway Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Limited was registered on 7 June 1989. Gateway Promotions Pty Limited was registered on 14 February 1985. Anthony John Sukari and David John Bokeyan were the directors of both companies. They later became involved with both Pan Laboratories Pty Limited and Pan Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited.19 Gateway Pharmaceuticals and/or Gateway Promotions held a licence issued by the Ministry of Health in Vietnam to import therapeutic goods into Vietnam for supply within Vietnam.20 Gateway Pharmaceuticals and/or Gateway Promotions obtained the therapeutic goods that it exported from Australia into Vietnam from, firstly, Pan Laboratories and, then, Pan Pharmaceuticals.21 In about May 2000 Pan Laboratories acquired the licence held by Gateway Pharmaceuticals and/or Gateway Promotions to import therapeutic goods into Vietnam for supply within Vietnam following the financial failure of the Gateway companies.22 As there had been change from the Gateway company to Pan Laboratories as the exporter of the therapeutic goods, there needed to be an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for the issue of the necessary Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product or Certificate of a Listed Product for each good in the name of Pan Laboratories as the sponsor.23 Pan Laboratories did not apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for the issue to it of the necessary Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product or Certificate of a Listed Product for each therapeutic good being exported by it to Vietnam for supply within Vietnam.24 Pan Pharmaceuticals is the successor of Pan Laboratories. It was listed as a public company on the Australian Stock Exchange in April 2001.25 Before 12 February 2003 Pan Pharmaceuticals was the sponsor of 1660 therapeutic goods approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for manufacture in Australia and registered in the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods as listed goods for export only.26 On 12 February 2003 the Therapeutic Goods Administration received a request from a pharmaceutical company in Australia on behalf of a company in Vietnam as to whether the Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product apparently issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to Pan Pharmaceuticals in relation to a particular therapeutic good was a valid certificate.27 A search of the records of the Export Section of the Therapeutic Goods Administration revealed that the particular Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product was false, as the number appearing on the Certificate related to a different sponsor and a different therapeutic good and the list number following the prefix “AUST L” appearing on the Certificate related to yet another different sponsor and yet another different therapeutic good.28 On 28 April 2003 Pan Pharmaceuticals was notified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration that its licence to manufacture therapeutic goods in Australia was to be suspended for six months.29 On 15 May 2003 a search warrant was executed by investigators of the Therapeutic Goods Administration upon Pan Pharmaceuticals at 10-12 Church Road in Moorebank. The investigators seized numerous documents and electronic data.30 Examination of the documents and electronic data seized by the investigators during the search revealed that Pan Pharmaceuticals exported a number of therapeutic goods to Vietnam to a number of suppliers in Vietnam.31 Between 9 and 18 June 2003 investigators of the Therapeutic Goods Administration examined documents held by the Drug Administration of Vietnam related to therapeutic goods exported to Vietnam by Pan Pharmaceuticals.32 Examination of the documents held by the Drug Administration of Vietnam revealed that seven Certificates of a Pharmaceutical Product and two Certificates of a Listed Product lodged by Pan Pharmaceuticals with applications by it for approval to import therapeutic goods into Vietnam for supply within Vietnam were false.33 Further investigation by the investigators of the Therapeutic Goods Administration revealed the identity of the person who created the false Certificates and how they were created, but I need not recite these investigations.34 Further investigation of the documents in electronic data seized by the investigators during the search on 15 May 2003 revealed that batches of five different therapeutic goods exported by Pan Pharmaceuticals from Australia to Vietnam were counterfeit.35 By s 42E of the Therapeutic Goods Act, a therapeutic good is counterfeit if:  
     
      
      (a) The label or presentation of the good, or;  
       
      (b) any document or record relating to the good or its manufacture, or;  
       
      (c) any advertisement for the good  
       
      
    contains a false representation of:  
     
      
      (a) The identity or name of the good;  
       
      (b) the formation, composition or design specification of the good or of any ingredient or component of it;  
       
      (c) the presence or absence of any ingredient or component of the good; 
       
      (d) the strength or size of the good other than the size of any pack in which the good is contained; 
       
      (e) the strength or size of any ingredient or component of the good;  
       
      (f) the sponsor, source, manufacturer or place of manufacture of the good. 
      
    36 Each particular batch of the particular therapeutic good was counterfeit because a document or record relating to it or its manufacture, or because its label or presentation contained a false representation as to the identity of the particular good or the sponsor of a particular good or as to the strength of an ingredient or component of the particular good.37 Consequently, Pan Pharmaceuticals and a number of individuals were charged with a number of offences related to the use of the seven false Certificates of a Pharmaceutical Product and the two false Certificates of a Listed Product and to the dealing with counterfeit therapeutic goods.38 On 13 June 2008 Pan Pharmaceuticals pleaded guilty to nine charges that it, knowing that a particular document, namely a Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product bearing a particular number for a particular therapeutic good or a Certificate of a Listed Product bearing a particular number for a particular therapeutic good was a false document, used that document to induce another person, namely a representative of the Government of Vietnam, to accept the document as genuine, so as to dishonestly obtain a gain or to dishonestly influence the exercise of a public duty or function, the false document being a Commonwealth document, contrary to s 145.1(5) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. These offences were committed on various dates between 1 October 2001 and 5 July 2002.39 On 3 July 2008 Pan Pharmaceuticals pleaded guilty to thirty-four charges that it intentionally exported a particular good, namely a particular therapeutic good, from Australia knowing that or being reckless as to whether the particular good was counterfeit by reason of the fact that the documents or records relating to the good or its manufacture or its label of presentation contained false representations as to the identity of the particular good (counts 1 to 4, 9 to 12, 21, 22, 39 and 40 of the indictment) or as to the sponsor of the particular good (counts 5 to 8, 13 to 16, 23, 24, 43 and 44 of the indictment) or as to the strength of an ingredient of the particular good (counts 17 to 20, 27, 28, 31, 35 and 36 of the indictment), contrary to s 42E of the Therapeutic Goods Act.40 Also, on 3 July 2008 Pan Pharmaceuticals pleaded guilty to ten charges that it intentionally manufactured a particular good, namely a particular therapeutic good, in Australia knowing that or being reckless as to whether the particular good was counterfeit by reason of the fact that the documents or records relating to the good or its manufacture or its label or presentation contained false representations as to the identity of the particular good (counts 37 and 38 of the indictment) or as to the sponsor of the particular good (counts 41 and 42 of the indictment) or as to the strength of an ingredient or component of the particular good (counts 25, 26, 29, 30, 33 and 34 of the indictment), contrary to s 4E of the Therapeutics Goods Act. These offences and the thirty-four offences referred to above were committed between 18 November 2002 and 31 December 2002. 41 The penalty for an offence contrary to s 145.1(5) of the Criminal Code Act is, for a natural person, imprisonment for a maximum of ten years or a fine of a maximum of $660,000 or both and, for a company, a fine of a maximum of $3.3 million.42 The penalty for an offence contrary to s 42E of the Therapeutic Goods Act is, for a natural person, imprisonment for a maximum of five years or a fine of a maximum of $55,000 or both and, for a company, a fine of a maximum of $275,000.43 There cannot be any doubt that the offences committed by Pan Pharmaceuticals are very serious offences. The statutory regime for the manufacture of therapeutic goods in Australia is strict because, if the requirements were not met, there is a real and significant risk that the goods will not be safe and will cause harm to users of them. The World Health Organisation Certification Scheme for the international trade of therapeutic goods was designed and is intended to ensure that therapeutic goods exported from one country into another country, particularly when the importing country accepts approvals given by the exporting country, are safe and not likely to cause harm to users of them.44 The offences of knowingly using a false document were deliberate and intentional offences committed by the largest manufacturer of therapeutic goods in Australia and were designed to avoid the regulatory regime for the manufacture of therapeutic goods in Australia and for the importation of those goods into Vietnam for the sale of those goods within Vietnam.45 The offences of dealing in counterfeit therapeutic goods were deliberate and intentional offences as, in some cases, the strength of a declared active ingredient was not tested and, in some other cases, the testing of a declared active ingredient was manipulated to produce the desired result and were designed to avoid the regulatory regime.46 One serious consequence of the conduct of Pan Pharmaceuticals is that it undermined Australia’s standing in the world insofar as the international trade of therapeutical goods is concerned. The basis of the World Health Organisation Certification Scheme in relation to therapeutic goods was that one country, if it did not undertake its own evaluation of a therapeutic good which a person or company wished to import into it, could rely upon a certificate issued by another country. Pan Pharmaceuticals’ knowing use of false certificates to export therapeutic goods, particularly counterfeit therapeutic goods, from Australia into Vietnam for supply within Vietnam undermined Australia’s standing in the world as an exporter of safe therapeutic goods.47 As the offences committed by Pan Pharmaceuticals are offences contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth, I must sentence it for each offence in accordance with Pt 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, particularly s 16A(2) of that Part.48 I consider that the offences show that Pan Pharmaceuticals engaged in a course of conduct involving a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character.49 I accept that Pan Pharmaceuticals is entitled to have its guilty pleas to the various offences taken into account in the determination of an appropriate penalty for each offence. I understand that, by letter dated 6 June 2008, it notified the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions of its intention to plead guilty to the charges. The guilty pleas show its willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I intend to discount the penalties that I will impose upon Pan Pharmaceuticals by twenty per cent on account of its guilty pleas. 50 I understand that Pan Pharmaceuticals has been dealt with for other offences committed by it. I do not know whether those offences are similar to or different from the subject offences. However, whatever were those offences, Pan Pharmaceuticals cannot claim that it is a good corporate citizen or that it is entitled to have its good corporate character taken into account in its favour.51 I must take deterrence into account. As Pan Pharmaceuticals does not now exist, it having been placed in liquidation, I need not concern myself with specific deterrence. However, I must consider general deterrence. It is something that cannot be ignored or undervalued. Companies and those who control them must be warned that deliberate and intentional flouting of Australia’s regulatory regimes, whether for the manufacture of therapeutic goods or otherwise, will not be tolerated or condoned and will, following conviction after detection, be sanctioned by imprisonment in the cases of natural persons or significant fines in the cases of companies.52 What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offences and the offender, is an appropriate penalty to impose upon the offender for each of the offences?53 I say that, had I been determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon a natural person, the only appropriate sentence for each offence would have been imprisonment to be served on a full time basis.54 I note that some natural persons have been charged with a number of offences arising from the investigation of the subject offences by investigators of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and that, of those people, two of them, Ms Nhung Mai and Ms Melissah Chew, have pleaded guilty to some offences and have been dealt with.55 Dealing, firstly, with the offences of knowingly using a false document, I have determined that the appropriate starting point is a fine of $1,000,000 for each offence, which amount I reduce by twenty per cent, that is by $200,000, on account of the guilty plea, to $800,000.56 Dealing, now, with the offences of dealing with counterfeit therapeutic goods, I have determined that the appropriate starting point is a fine of $175,000 for each offence, which I reduce by twenty per cent, that is by $35,000, to $140,000.57 As to totality, I consider, bearing in mind that the sum of the various fines is $13,360,000, that, to reflect Pan Pharmaceuticals’ criminality to the fifty-three offences to which it has pleaded guilty, the total overall fine should be $10,000,000. 58 Accordingly, Pan Pharmaceuticals is convicted of each of the fifty-three offences to which it has pleaded guilty and it is fined as follows: (1) For each offence of knowingly using a false document, a fine of $500,000. (2) For each offence of dealing with counterfeit therapeutic goods, a fine of $125,000.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his Honour's reasons. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: This is an application by Huy Bao Huynh for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Solomon in the District Court on 3 April 2008. The Applicant pleaded guilty to supplying a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, contrary to ss.25 and 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for that crime is imprisonment for 15 years.  
     
      
    3 In addition, his Honour dealt with a number of related summary offences pursuant to s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These were nine counts of dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to s.193C Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each of these offences is a fine of 50 penalty units or imprisonment for two years, or both.  
     
      
    4 With respect to the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months to commence on 28 November 2006 and to expire on 27 May 2009 with a balance of term of one year and six months to expire on 27 November 2010. With respect to each of the nine offences under s.193C Crimes Act 1900, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months to commence on 28 May 2009 and to expire on 27 February 2010 with a balance of term of three months to expire on 27 May 2010. The sentences for the s.193C offences were made entirely concurrent as between themselves but with that group of sentences being cumulative upon the sentence for the supply prohibited drug offence. 
     
      
    5 The total effective sentence of imprisonment for all offences was imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of three years and three months to date from 28 November 2006.  
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
       
      Supply Prohibited Drug 
       
      
    6 As a result of enquiries carried out by police and the New South Wales Crime Commission, on 18 August 2006, a search warrant was executed at the Applicant’s home unit in Ultimo. The Applicant was not present at the time. During the search, officers located a set of electronic scales in the lounge room. In a drawer in the kitchen area, officers found six small resealable plastic bags containing a crystalline substance. When analysed, four of these bags were found to contain methylamphetamine weighing 1.02 grams with a purity of between 81.5% and 82.5%. One bag contained a mixture of methylamphetamine and cocaine weighing 0.17 grams. The other bag contained a substance in which no drug was detected. 
     
      
    7 In the laundry of the unit, in a plastic bag covered with numerous empty plastic bags, police located two knotted plastic bags. The contents of one weighed 14.4 grams and the other 12.7 grams. When analysed, the contents were found to be methylamphetamine with a purity of 81.5%. 
     
      
    8 On the floor of the bedroom, officers located a package in the pocket of a pair of jeans. The contents of this package weighed 1.3 grams and was analysed to be methylamphetamine with a purity of 82%. 
     
      
    9 The total of methylamphetamine located was 29.42 grams plus the mixture of methylamphetamine and cocaine weighing 0.17 grams. An officer experienced in drug investigation estimated the street value of this quantity of methylamphetamine to be in the range of $11,768.00 and $14,710.00. The Applicant maintained that he had this prohibited drug both for his own use and to supply to friends. 
     
      
       
      The Proceeds of Crime Offences 
       
      
    10 Section 193C was enacted in 2005 as part of a new series of offences contained in Division 1A of Part 4 (ss.193A-193G) of the Crimes Act 1900 relating to money laundering. The offence is committed where a person deals with property that is property that there are reasonable grounds to suspect is proceeds of crime. Section 193A contains a broad definition of the term “deal with” and defines “proceeds of crime” as meaning “any property that is substantially derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of a serious offence”. The term “serious offence” is also defined in s.193A. In proceeding as he did in the District Court, it may be taken that the Applicant admitted the essential elements of the s.193C offences as if by way of plea of guilty: Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 510-511. 
     
      
    11 The facts of the nine s.193C offences were as follows. In each case, it was reasonably suspected that the sum of money involved was the proceeds of crime. 
     
      
    12 During the search of the Applicant’s unit, documents were located evidencing the purchase by the Applicant of a 2006 Mercedes sedan. Enquiries revealed that this was purchased for $300,000.00. During an interview, the Applicant informed police that, with the exception of a three-month traineeship, he had not been in formal employment or in receipt of benefits, for a period of five to six years.  
     
      
    13 During a period between 28 April 2006 and 4 August 2006, the Applicant deposited $1,147,276.81 into a Commonwealth Bank account held in his father’s name.  
     
      
    14 During a period between 1 May 2006 and 10 August 2006, the Applicant deposited the sum of $995,000.00 into a BT Margin Loan account in his father’s name.  
     
      
    15 During a period between 9.00 am on 3 August 2006 and 5.00 pm on 5 August 2006, the Applicant deposited the sum of $291,798.76 into a Westpac Bank account in his father’s name.  
     
      
    16 During a period between 24 April 2006 and 29 June 2006, the Applicant deposited $105,932.63 into a Commonwealth Bank account held in his father’s name.  
     
      
    17 During a period between 26 June 2006 and 5 July 2006, the Applicant deposited $110,000.00 into a Commonwealth Bank account held in the name of his father and Yvonne Huynh.  
     
      
    18 During a period between 2 August 2006 and 4 August 2006, the Applicant deposited $110,247.89 into an ANZ Bank account held in his father’s name.  
     
      
    19 During a period between 24 April 2006 and 20 July 2006, the Applicant deposited $366,000.00 into a Westpac Bank account held in his father’s name.  
     
      
    20 On 18 May 2006, the Applicant purchased a Lexus motor vehicle for the sum of $79,000.00.  
     
      
    21 Accordingly, the Applicant pleaded guilty to dealing with property, in a total sum of $3,505,256.09, reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, between April and August 2006. 
     
      
    22 The Applicant was arrested on 28 November 2006 and has been in custody continuously since that time. 
     
      
    23 As the s.193C offences arose from substantially the same circumstances as the drug supply count, they were dealt with as related charges under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In sentencing for related offences, the District Court has the same functions, and is subject to the same restrictions and procedures, as a Local Court: s.168(3). Accordingly, the limitation on imposition of sentences of imprisonment in the Local Court under s.58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applied to the s.193C offences. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    24 The Applicant was born in 1976. He was 29 years old at the time of the offences and 31 years old at the time of sentence. He is a single man and has no dependants. 
     
      
    25 The Applicant was born in Vietnam and came to Australia when he was about six years old. 
     
      
    26 He has a significant criminal history. This history includes offences of armed robbery in company and conspiracy to commit armed robbery which was dealt with in the Children’s Court in 1993 by way of control order. In 1995, he was fined and placed on a good behaviour bond for possession of a prohibited drug and goods in custody.  
     
      
    27 On 14 November 1996, he was sentenced in the Sydney District Court, for supplying a prohibited drug, to imprisonment by way of periodic detention for three years to commence on 22 November 1996. On 17 June 1998, he was sentenced in the Melbourne County Court for offences under s.233B Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of attempted possession of a prohibited import (heroin) and possession of a prohibited import (heroin) to a term of five years’ imprisonment with an order that he be released at the expiration of four years on entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour. An appeal against these sentences was dismissed by the Victorian Court of Appeal on 29 April 1999.  
     
      
    28 On 19 July 2001, the Applicant was sentenced in the Sydney District Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a term of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 10 months. On the same day, he was sentenced to imprisonment for failing to appear and an order was made cancelling the sentence of periodic detention imposed in the Sydney District Court on 14 November 1996 for the supply drug offence, with a sentence of full-time imprisonment being fixed in its place. 
     
      
    29 Thus, an examination of the Applicant’s criminal history reveals two prior convictions for serious offences of drug supply and possession of prohibited imports, with the latter offence apparently being committed in Victoria whilst the Applicant was subject to a term of imprisonment by way of periodic detention for the former offence in this State. 
     
      
    30 The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    31 A letter from the Applicant was tendered on sentence together with a report of Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, dated 21 February 2008. In addition, the Applicant’s sister, Kathy Huynh, gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. She indicated that there was family support for the Applicant. 
     
      
    32 Mr Watson-Munro observed that the Applicant had a “variable work history although it does not appear that he has been employed for a number of years”. The Applicant told Mr Watson-Munro that his last employment was as a trainee photocopy technician which lasted for three months about six years ago. He had also done some intermittent work to assist a friend to market mobile phones.  
     
      
    33 According to Mr Watson-Munro, the Applicant stated he had been a chronic gambler for a number of years and that this, in part, accounted for the large quantities of money which had been located by the authorities. He told Mr Watson-Munro that he would gamble on a daily basis, which involved attending Star City Casino and bets on horses and dogs. 
     
      
    34 The Applicant told Mr Watson-Munro that he had not used drugs during the time he had been in prison since November 2006. 
     
      
       
      Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    35 The learned sentencing Judge found that the supply prohibited drug offence was “below the mid range of objective seriousness for the offence”. His Honour accepted the Applicant’s claim that he had the prohibited drug both for his own use and to supply to his friends. His Honour accepted that he had been a user of methylamphetamine and had been so for a period of time.  
     
      
    36 His Honour made no findings with respect to the nine proceeds of crime offences beyond observing that they were “serious offences”.  
     
      
    37 His Honour accepted that the Applicant pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and allowed a discount “in the vicinity of 20%” for his pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    38 Reference was made to the Applicant’s difficult background in Vietnam and then in Australia, and the Applicant’s history of abuse of alcohol and stimulant drugs. His Honour noted that Mr Watson-Munro had expressed the opinion that the Applicant had long-standing symptoms of depression and anxiety. His Honour noted the Applicant’s prior criminal history and observed that he had not been dealt with for any drug offence since 2001. His Honour concluded that the Applicant had “reasonable prospects of rehabilitation”. The submission that the Applicant was at “a watershed in his life” was accepted.  
     
      
    39 Having announced the sentence on the supply prohibited drug matter, his Honour said “I find special circumstances”, but did not provide reasons for that finding.  
     
      
    40 Thereafter, his Honour imposed sentences for the nine s.193C offences. Having done so, his Honour stated again “I find special circumstances” without expanding upon that statement. 
     
      
    41 In the course of his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing Judge observed that, in sentencing the Applicant for the drug supply offence and the nine s.193C offences, he had regard to “principles contained in R v Pearce including the principle of totality” (ROS4). In sentencing the Applicant in respect of the nine s.193C offences, his Honour observed again that he had “regard to the totality principle” (ROS6).  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    42 By Notice of Appeal filed 18 July 2008, the Applicant advances the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. In determining that the sentences for the proceeds of crime matters should be served consecutively to the sentence for the drugs matter, his Honour did not have regard to his finding of special circumstances. 
       
       
      2. In determining the sentences for the proceeds of crime matters, his Honour did not have regard to his finding of special circumstances. 
       
       
      3. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Submissions of Applicant 
       
      
    43 In support of Grounds 1 and 2, Mr Lange, counsel for the Applicant, observed: 
     
      
       
      (a) that the sentence for the drug supply offence involved a total term of four years with a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years, with the non-parole period being 62.5% of the full term; 
       
       
      (b) in relation to the s.193C offences, that a total term of 12 months with a non-parole period of nine months was imposed, being a ratio of 75%; 
       
       
      (c) that a total sentence of imprisonment was imposed for all offences of four years with a non-parole period of three years and three months, with the non-parole period being 81.25% of the full term. 
       
      
    44 Mr Lange submits that, although the sentencing Judge found special circumstances with respect to both groups of sentences, the finding was only reflected with respect to the drug supply sentence (62.5%) and not the s.193C sentences (75%). Further, he submits that the overall sentence involved a non-parole period that was 81.25% of the total term of imprisonment. He contends that it is apparent, from his Honour’s remarks on sentence, that he intended to fix an effective non-parole period that was less than 75% of the total term. Reliance was placed upon R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43 at [14]-[18] and R v Nightingale [2005] NSWCCA 147 at [45]-[47]. For these reasons, he submits that error has been demonstrated in the manner alleged in Grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    45 In support of Ground 3, Mr Lange submits that the sentence for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug was manifestly excessive. Although acknowledging that the Applicant was entitled to less leniency because of his previous convictions for drug-related offences, he contends that a number of findings were made in the Applicant’s favour which assisted the Applicant on this ground of appeal. In particular, he points to the finding that the offence was “below the mid range of objective seriousness” and the finding that the Applicant possessed the drugs for personal use and for social supply. 
     
      
    46 Mr Lange submits that a review of what were said to be similar cases demonstrated that the sentence imposed fell outside the range of that ordinarily viewed as proportionate, pointing in this respect, in particular, to R v Vera [2008] NSWCCA 33. Although acknowledging that a review of previous cases cannot, by itself, lead to the conclusion that a particular sentence is manifestly excessive, Mr Lange submits that an examination of these cases supports his contention with respect to this sentence. 
     
      
    47 Mr Lange contends that, since the sentence for the drug supply matter is manifestly excessive and the s.193C sentences were ordered to be served consecutively to that sentence, then the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and that this Court should intervene.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Submissions 
       
      
    48 The Crown submits that error should not be found in the way in which the sentencing Judge structured the sentence. It was open to the sentencing Judge to impose a higher than statutory proportion if he saw fit: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 719 [70]. Further, his Honour followed proper sentencing principles demonstrated by his overriding consideration of the question of totality.  
     
      
    49 The Crown submits that the Judge had adjusted the ratio for the supply offence, and that the Applicant had been afforded the benefit of complete concurrency as between the nine proceeds of crime offences, and partial accumulation of the head sentences for those offences with the head sentence for the supply offence. The Crown submits that had the overall ratio been any less, this would have meant that the sentences imposed for each count would be manifestly inadequate. The sentencing Judge was required to ensure that the non-parole period did not fall below the minimum acceptable period: R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264.  
     
      
    50 The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge did not indicate why he made a finding of special circumstances in his remarks on sentence. If rehabilitation was the basis of such a finding, the Crown submits that this factor had been double counted as it had been taken into account, along with the other subjective factors, in mitigation: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. 
     
      
    51 If some error was found in the implementation of the finding of special circumstances, the Crown submits that the non-parole period must reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including its objective gravity, and the need for general deterrence. Accordingly, this Court ought not intervene. 
     
      
    52 With respect to Ground 3, the Crown submits that the sentence for the drug supply offence was not manifestly excessive. Reference was made to the available maximum penalty (15 years’ imprisonment), the quantity, value and purity of the drug found and the presence of drug paraphernalia, including scales and plastic bags, all located in the premises of the Applicant who had not been in gainful employment for several years, and who had a record of convictions for serious drug supply offences. 
     
      
    53 The Crown contends that the finding that the Applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation was generous in the circumstances of this case, as was the fixing of entirely concurrent sentences for the s.193C offences: R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at 486 [13]. 
     
      
    54 The Crown submits that the Applicant has not demonstrated a basis for intervention by this Court and that no lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    55 The question for this Court is whether error has been demonstrated and, if so, whether a positive opinion ought be formed that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: R v Simpson at 720-721 [79].  
     
      
    56 With respect to Grounds 1 and 2, it is the case that an element of uncertainty arises in this case concerning “special circumstances” for two reasons: 
     
      
       
      (a) the sentencing Judge’s statement, on two occasions, that special circumstances were found; 
       
       
      (b) his Honour’s failure to comply with the statutory and common law obligation to record reasons for a finding of special circumstances in accordance with s.44(2)  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ;  
      R v McDonald 
       (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 October 1998). 
       
      
    57 Insofar as it may be divined from the remarks on sentence, the foundation for a finding of special circumstances appears to lie in his Honour’s conclusion that the Applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. If this be the basis for the finding, however, there is force in the Crown submission that double counting operated in favour of the Applicant. In my view, it is clear that his Honour took into account his assessment of prospects of rehabilitation in mitigation of penalty: s.21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    58 It is correct that the non-parole period component represents 81.25% of the total sentence imposed. I am not persuaded, however, that error has been demonstrated in the sense that the sentences imposed did not accord with his Honour’s intention. His Honour applied the principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality before reaching the final sentence imposed. I do not uphold Grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    59 However, even if error was established in that the sentences actually imposed did not accord with his Honour’s intention (a finding which I do not make), the question which remains is whether a total non-parole period of less than three years and three months ought be fixed. 
     
      
    60 It is appropriate, at this point, to move to Ground 3. It must be observed that some generous findings were made in favour of the Applicant. The Applicant has a history of significant drug supply for which he has served two separate terms of imprisonment. Including the present offence, he had committed three serious drug supply offences before reaching the age of 30 years. The facts of the present drug supply offence do not sit comfortably with a finding that he possessed the drugs for his own use and for social supply only. It might be thought that a social supplier is unlikely to possess the paraphernalia of the supplier for gain, including scales and plastic bags. The Applicant had not been in employment for some years. Further, the s.193C offences, which are related offences, do not assist the Applicant. 
     
      
    61 I do not consider that the Applicant’s reliance upon other sentencing decisions establishes a range of sentences which assists an argument that the present sentence is manifestly excessive. The practice of approaching sentencing appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor supported by authority: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]-[49]. The Applicant’s reliance on R v Vera exemplifies why the Court takes this approach. That case was a Crown appeal involving a significantly different offence (with no drug paraphernalia such as scales and bags) and an offender without a background comparable to this Applicant. 
     
      
    62 The Applicant stood for sentence for an offence of drug supply. He possessed, for the purpose of supply, a significant quantity of drugs. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 15 years. He had a history of drug supply and had served terms of imprisonment in that respect. In the circumstances of this case, it has not been demonstrated that the sentence imposed for the drug supply offence lay outside the proper range of sentence applicable to the offence and the offender. 
     
      
    63 The Applicant’s criminal history for offences of drug supply was such that the principles in R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 were capable of operating adversely to him on sentence. The Applicant was fortunate with respect to certain findings made and the sentence ultimately imposed. 
     
      
    64 When both groups of sentences are viewed together, a similar conclusion can be reached. The learned sentencing Judge said very little concerning the s.193C offences. These were very serious examples of this class of offence, with the Applicant having dealt criminally with a sum exceeding $3,500,000.00 over a few months in 2006. The Applicant had not been in paid employment for a number of years, yet was involved in a number of very substantial financial transactions which constituted crimes under s.193C. The Applicant was most fortunate to be dealt with by way of entirely concurrent sentences for these offences.65 In my view, a non-parole period of three years and three months represents the minimum period that the Applicant should spend in prison having regard to all the elements of punishment, including the objective seriousness of his crimes, deterrence, denunciation, protection of the community and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances: R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at 440-441 [33]-[34]. 
     
      
    66 I am not persuaded that any error has been demonstrated in the sentencing process in this case. However, if error had been demonstrated with respect to “special circumstances”, I would readily conclude that no lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson at 720-721 [79]-[80]. 
     
      
       
       
      Observations Concerning Related Offences 
       
      
    67 Before concluding this judgment, I wish to make some observations concerning the course taken in these proceedings before the District Court. Nine serious summary offences under s.193C were dealt with as related summary offences pursuant to s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The jurisdictional foundation for this course is the requirement, revealed in the definition of “related offence” in s.165(1), that the related offences arose from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the first indictable offence (supply prohibited drug) had arisen.  
     
      
    68 The provisions for dealing with certain summary offences as “back up offences” or “related offences” are frequently engaged when a clearly related or back-up offence exists. Typical examples of these include a charge of negligent driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm under s.42(1) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 where the first indictable offence is one of dangerous driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm under s.52A Crimes Act 1900, and an offence of goods in custody (usually money) under s.527C Crimes Act 1900 where the first indictable offence is one of supplying a prohibited drug.  
     
      
    69 In the present case, nine offences under s.193C were dealt with as related offences to the first indictable offence of supplying a prohibited drug. Despite the operation of the statutory trigger which permits offences to be dealt with as related offences, it was argued for the Applicant in the District Court, and again in this Court, that there was no relationship between the offence of supplying a prohibited drug and the nine related offences of dealing with property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The learned sentencing Judge made no finding on this issue at all in his remarks on sentence. Indeed, as I have noted, his Honour said virtually nothing concerning these offences. Counsel sought to take this Court to exchanges in the transcript between counsel and the sentencing Judge to throw light on this issue. With respect, given the seriousness of the s.193C offences and the very large sums of money being dealt with by a long-term unemployed person, findings of fact ought to have been made by the learned sentencing Judge with respect to these crimes. It is not appropriate to resort to interchanges between the Bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain his Honour’s views: R v Thompson (2005) 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475 [32]. 
     
      
    70 There is a strong argument that the s.193C offences were of such seriousness in themselves that they ought not to have been dealt with as related offences in the District Court. This view is reinforced by a debate that appears to have occurred in the District Court concerning the operation of s.58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which places a limitation on consecutive sentences imposed by Local Courts. Because the learned sentencing Judge was exercising the sentencing powers of a District Court judge for the drug supply offence and the sentencing powers of a Magistrate for the related offences, arguments were advanced concerning the outer limits of sentence which could be imposed on the Applicant for all offences. Once again, his Honour did not advert to s.58, or the legal issues arising from its construction and application, in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    71 Section 58 was enacted in its present form in 2003. Earlier provisions governing this area, such as s.444 Crimes Act 1900, had experienced a chequered history: R v Clayton (1997) 42 NSWLR 268. According to the Second Reading Speech for the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2003 (Legislative Council, 20 November 2003), the new s.58 was intended to increase the length of accumulated sentences which a Local Court Magistrate could impose to five years, and to remove the restriction on the number of sentences that can be accumulated. The former s.58 was considered to have prevented Magistrates from imposing effective sentences on offenders for discrete offences in the Local Court. The former s.58 prohibited a Local Court from imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a person who was serving two or more consecutive sentences of imprisonment or who was serving a sentence that, together with the proposed sentence, would exceed a total of three years.  
     
      
    72 This Court did not hear submissions concerning the proper construction of s.58 and, as observed, the learned sentencing Judge did not advert to this issue at all in his remarks on sentence. In these circumstances, it is not appropriate to expand upon the proper construction and application of the provision. It is sufficient to observe that a number of very serious summary offences were dealt with by way of wholly concurrent sentences of imprisonment of 12 months with a nine-month non-parole period, an outcome which is extraordinarily favourable to the Applicant in the circumstances of the case. There is, however, no Crown appeal brought with respect to sentence and it is not appropriate to comment further upon this aspect of the case. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    73 I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    74 PRICE J: I agree with Johnson J.

   JUDGMENT1 Geoffrey Leonard appears today for sentence on two separate matters. The first is an offence of possessing child pornography. Mr Leonard pleaded guilty to this offence when his matter was listed for trial on an earlier occasion. He is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea. 2 He also appears for sentence for an offence of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to make available child abuse material. He did not plead guilty to this offence but was found guilty by a jury yesterday. Unusually, in fact perhaps uniquely, the jury returned that verdict in Mr Leonard’s absence. The circumstances in which the verdict was returned in his absence were set out in a judgment I delivered yesterday. It is not yet available in written form, but when it becomes available I will ensure that a copy is sent to Mr Leonard. He did not hear what I had to say yesterday because he had been taken from the court premises in an ambulance.3 I attempted today to have replayed to Mr Leonard what occurred when the jury returned. Mr Leonard indicated some ambivalence as to whether he needed to hear it, but I wanted to ensure that what happened in Mr Leonard’s absence was made known to him. Unfortunately, for reasons I do not understand, but presumably they are technica, what was played over the court sound system was indecipherable. Whether it is possible to remedy that on a later date is something I do not know. If possible I will ensure that a copy of what occurred in Mr Leonard’s absence, that is a sound recording of what occurred in Mr Leonard’s absence, is also provided to him at a later date.4 It is a matter of concern that whatever technology exists in the Downing Centre to record court proceedings does not allow for easy and decipherable replay of those court proceedings. At least they did not on this occasion.5 I turn now to matters more relevant to the sentences to be imposed on the offender. 6 Mr Leonard was the operator of a website. He put his name to that website. It contained a large amount of material, much of which was directed to advancing a proposition regarding child sexual assault laws that all right thinking people would find abhorrent. It is Mr Leonard’s firmly, and I have to say apparently genuinely, held view, that there should be no age of consent, that it should not be an offence to have consensual sexual activity with a person of any age whatsoever. In his writings Mr Leonard advances the proposition that because families teach their children such things as how to cross the road, they should also be able to teach their children about sexual matters, to the extent of engaging in masturbation with them. As I say these views are abhorrent to all right thinking members of the community. Mr Leonard advanced those views in his website. He is not to be sentenced for any offence relating to those views because thinking those things and saying them is not a criminal offence, at least not one that Mr Leonard has been charged with.7 In the course of his writings on the website Mr Leonard discussed his earlier convictions for child sexual assault. He had pleaded guilty on an earlier occasion to a number of counts of sexual intercourse with children between the ages of ten and sixteen. In the course of those earlier proceedings Mr Leonard was supplied with the police statements made by the two children, who I will call X and Y. One was thirteen, one was sixteen. Mr Leonard published those statements, twice, on his internet website. In accordance with a non-publication order made by an earlier Judge he deleted reference to the boys’ names and anything which might tend to identify them. However, the description of the events that Mr Leonard pleaded guilty to remained on the website.8 The charge of making available child abuse material related to his reproduction of the statements made by X and Y. The Crown said that that material described physical abuse of X and Y in a manner, that reasonable people would regard as being in all the circumstances offensive. The Crown also said that the offender was reckless, as that term is defined under the Commonwealth Criminal Code as to that circumstance.9 The jury, by its verdict, has agreed with the Crown’s submissions. It appears that the jury deeply considered issues such as freedom of speech, and the right to express views which may not be agreeable to others, in returning their verdict.10 In his defence at trial, Mr Leonard relied on a circumstance that the material was not pornographic or erotic, and simply consisted of legal documents prepared for his earlier prosecution, although, as the verdict makes clear that did not prevent the matters being child abuse material, or offensive. The nature of the material is very relevant to the sentence I should impose upon the offender for that offence. I have to say that I suspect that the publication of material of this type is a far cry from what was perhaps envisaged when the fairly recent offence was introduced into the Criminal Code. Nevertheless, it is a serious criminal offence, but as the material is not erotic and I do not regard it as pornographic, I consider that this is far from the most serious example of an offence of its type. 11 The other matter for which Mr Leonard is to be sentenced is much more serious. When police were investigating Mr Leonard’s website they seized his computer and a hard drive. Forensic investigations of the computer and hard drive revealed that Mr Leonard had, at an earlier time, been in possession of a number of child pornographic images. The forensic investigations revealed that those images had been deleted but they nevertheless remained on the offender’s computer.12 The Crown does not allege that the offender was in possession of that material as at the date police seized his computer. The Crown allegation to which the offender has pleaded guilty relates to an earlier time, that is a time when the material had not been deleted from his computer. Those unfamiliar with the workings of a computer might be confused by the use of the word “deleted”. A recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal - the name of which escapes me at the moment - sets out how material can be deleted from a computer, yet still remain on it. Mr Leonard is not being sentenced for possessing the child pornographic material at any time after he deleted it. His offence relates to a time when it was freely accessible to him on the computer. The images vary in their quality. Some are appropriately described as relatively mild examples of child pornography, if there can really be such a thing. But the sort of thing I am talking about there are images of boys, who are clothed. It is clear that the offender obtained these for a sexual purpose, but their production has caused much less harm to the boys involved than many other types of child pornography. Unfortunately for the offender and for the boys involved in those other types, the offender did have many other examples of much more graphic and much more serious child pornography.13 Before turning to those, I should mention also that some of the examples of child pornography were pencil sketches or caricatures of naked male children. They were not photographs. Part of the reason that possessing child pornography is such a serious offence is that the demand for child pornography encourages those to produce it, and in producing child pornography the children involved are harmed. That may not be the case if these pencil sketches or caricatures were not produced by the drawing of a particular child but were mere products of a perverted imagination.14 Let me turn to the more serious examples of child pornography for which the offender is to be sentenced. There are a number of images depicting naked male children masturbating. Some of these are children by themselves, and some show mutual masturbation. Other photographs are of sexual acts between young boys. There are six images, when I say images, I mean photographs, depicting oral sex between male children. Some of the other photographs are of children who are masturbating with ejaculate on their bodies. There are two images of a naked adult male - I emphasize adult - masturbating himself a the same time as he masturbates a naked pre-pubescent male child, the child apparently being between the ages of eight and eleven. There are nineteen images of naked male children performing anal sex on other naked male children. There are two hundred and seventy six images depicting naked male children apparently between seven and thirteen years, in erotic or sexual poses. Many of those images are focused on the genitals of the young boys involved. A number show a series of images where the boys are firstly clothed, and then as each image progresses, the boy is shown to have taken an item of clothing off until he is fully naked. 15 It is perhaps not necessary to go into any detail as to the evil which child pornography is. Many decisions, including a recent one of my own which obtained some publicity, set out why it is that the community response to those who possess child pornography is as it is. Let me, for the offender’s benefit however, briefly reiterate a number of fundamental propositions. As I mentioned before, those who possess child pornography encourage its production. The production of child pornography harms the children involved in its production. That is a fact which I am convinced the offender does not accept. He is simply unable to appreciate the proposition that children are harmed by underage sexual activity, particularly underage sexual activity with adults. Children are entitled to be protected from sexual predators, such as those who would produce child pornography for profit, or for dissemination without profit amongst people of a similar mind to the offender. There is no suggestion here that the offender disseminated the material, and that is a fact that the offender relies on in mitigation. It is not a matter of mitigation that the offender did not commit a more serious offence. When looking at the images one cannot help but be struck at how young some of these boys are. Boys of that age are not effectively exercising any consent as to whether they do what the producers of child pornography would have them do. They are preyed upon by those who would regard them as mere objects for sexual gratification.16 As I mentioned before the offender has a prior history involving sexual assault matters. He is not a man of good character. He has demonstrated no remorse for his conduct. His prospects for rehabilitation are either zero, or close to it. There is one particular circumstance, however, on which the offender is entitled to rely, and that is this; as I mentioned before the offender had deleted the photographs by the time police came around. Nor does this appear to have been in response to a threat of police investigation. The offender told the Judge, before whom he pleaded guilty to the child pornography offence that as soon as he became aware that he was breaching 98 of the Crimes Act he did a spring cleaning, as a result of which he had deleted the material. The offender’s statements on that occasion do not take account of the images where very young boys are involved. It is not a case that the offender genuinely thinks that he may have inadvertently committed an offence by downloading images and thus once he realised the stringency of the law thought it better to delete them. The offender can have been under no misapprehension at all, especially as regards the photographs involving the very young boys, that by downloading and thus possessing the images, he was committing a serious, and grossly serious criminal offence. Nevertheless, as I say, the offender is entitled to take advantage of the circumstance that he voluntarily deleted those images. It is not a case the he kept possession of them, but voluntarily ceased this aspect of his illegal activities. 17 The offender is now seventy four years of age. He has suffered some health problems of recent times. Material made available to the court which the offender tendered before me today reveals that he has a small myocardial infarction in May this year. He was unable, according to medical evidence presented to the court on an earlier occasion, to attend court for two months.18 He was taken away by ambulance from the court premises yesterday, as I mentioned earlier. He does not appear to be a fit and healthy seventy four year old, by any means. This will mean that his time in custody will be quite hard to him. There is a risk that he will serve that sentence on protection as well, given the nature of his offences. There is a risk also that that time in custody will involve conditions which are harsher than those in the general prison population. I will take the offender’s health into account as a matter which tends to mitigate the punishment upon him, for the reason that it will involve a greater burden on the offender than would otherwise be the case.19 The offence of possessing child pornography is clearly the more serious offence and one which involves a need to punish the offender to a significant degree. It did result in a belated plea of guilty after the offender realised that he was not being prosecuted for possessing the images at the time the police arrested him, but for an earlier time.20 There are no special circumstances in this case. The offender, as I said, has no prospects of rehabilitation. Of course when I say that I do not mean to suggest that he is inevitably going to commit further offences; this experience of being involved in the criminal law, and his age, might be significant impediments to him further committing further offences of this kind. 21 I intend to impose a sentence of imprisonment on the child pornography offence and a concurrent sentence of imprisonment for the Commonwealth offence of using a carriage service to make available child abuse material.22 For the offence of possessing child pornography the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months. It will date from 3 September 2008 and expire on 2 June 2009 on which date the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence for that offence of one year.23 For the Commonwealth offence of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to make available child abuse material I impose a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of six months, to date from 3 September 2008. I order that Mr Leonard is to be released to parole on 2 June 2009.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing a woman who was living a relatively normal, well adjusted and successful life until two matters intervened. One was a serious car accident in 1998, in which she broke her neck and back. The other was not so much an event but a relationship; she started cohabiting with a man who introduced her to serious drug taking. As a result of these two intervening factors, her life went seriously awry. It went so far off track that she is before me now to be sentenced for two offences of supplying drugs. 2. The most significant issue in the sentence proceedings is not whether she should receive a custodial sentence for the offences but what form that custodial sentence should take. The realistic choice is between a sentence of full-time custody and a suspended sentence. First I should give a little more detail about what happened in this case. 3. At about half past 4 in the morning on Tuesday 17 July 2007 police saw a car being driven by the offender Samantha Lendill around Mona Vale. They stopped the car and their suspicions were aroused. They searched the car and found in her handbag half a tablet of a drug commonly known as ecstasy and a further eight small resealable plastic bags containing methylamphetamine. Also in the bag were more small resealable plastic bags, a small set of digital scales and about $800 in cash. Also in the handbag was a black leather fold out wallet, which contained some of the money that I have already referred to and contained some of the methylamphetamine I have already referred to. Ms Lendill said that the wallet was not hers. They also found a small knife. 4. Ms Lendill was arrested. She confessed to having six resealable plastic bags of methylamphetamine - also known as ice - for her own use. She made the same confession regarding the ecstasy tablet. She said that about $600 of the money which was found in the wallet and a rock of drugs which appeared to be ice was not hers. She was charged with two offences. One was supplying the prohibited drug methylamphetamine and the other was supplying the prohibited drug cocaine. 5. Both of those charges were based on the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which provide that if a certain amount of a prohibited drug is in the possession of a person then it is deemed to be in their possession for the purposes of supply. Ms Lendill pleaded not guilty to both charges and was tried before me and a jury. The jury convicted her of both offences on 1 July 2008. She had not been in custody until then but made no application for bail on 1 July 2008, so that she has been in custody for a little over two months. 6. Mr Fernandez who appears for Ms Lendill, both in the trial and the sentence proceedings, called her to give evidence in her sentence proceedings. She confirmed the history contained in exhibit 1, which is a detailed psychological report dated 22 August 2008 prepared by Michelle Player. That history includes the car accident which I referred to. Before then she had been married and separated. The separation does not appear to have been particularly traumatic and she had, as I said, a successful life travelling and in various kinds of employment. She has a daughter aged seventeen and a son aged fifteen, both from her marriage. The car accident was, as I have said, a very serious one. After the car accident she commenced smoking some cannabis to help her relax and sleep. 7. When her marriage ended she moved from Western Australia, where she had been living with her husband, back to Sydney where she came from. She met and formed a relationship with a man named David. I do not propose to refer to his surname in these remarks because some serious allegations are made about him and he is not here to be heard on them. Ms Lendill said that David introduced her to more serious drug taking, including methylamphetamine. She took the drug to become part of the group with which they mixed. She had not used methylamphetamine up until that relationship. She became addicted and the amount that she used increased. 8. As the relationship progressed she found that David was violent and abusive. When she finally separated from him he used to stalk her. She moved in to her parents’ place and lived in a granny flat. The stalking and the violence continued even after the relationship had finished. She was so concerned about her own safety and the safety of her children that she continued her use of methylamphetamine in order to stay alert in case he turned up where she lived. I have little hesitation in concluding that the other reason that she continued to use it was that she was addicted to it. 9. Her drug use ceased when she went into custody on 1 July this year. She did a course on domestic violence in custody and joined Narcotics Anonymous. It has been difficult for her to maintain consistency because of her bail refused status and movements within the prison system. She is keen to get help with her drug and domestic violence issues. She wants to resume life as a responsible mother to her children. She feels more empowered to deal with her issues as a result of the courses which she has done since she has been in custody. As I said, she has not used drugs since she has been in custody and urinalysis confirms that. 10. A pre-sentence report has also been prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. It confirms the relative stability of her personal background. Her parents live in Sydney and are very supportive of her. They are prepared to offer her accommodation and employment when she leaves prison. The report noted her regret and shame for her involvement in the offence but it noted that she showed little insight into her offending behaviour, denying that most drugs were for supply. This is perhaps understandable given the position she took at the trial. She also reported depression and anxiety. 11. The report expressed the opinion, which I accept, that Ms Lendill, who is now forty-two, engaged in her offending behaviour “precipitated by her poor association choices and compounded by her illicit drug use.” It is evidence, the report says, that she would have the benefit of strong family support, reinforcing an attitude towards living a normal drug free and law abiding life. The Service would assist her with any supervision required. The report did add a cautious note that “whether or not she is able to maintain her abstinence in view of her current situation is questionable.” 12. The psychologist Ms Player expressed the opinion that Ms Lendill is capable of responding to interventions that would reduce her risk of recidivism. It notes an overall history of good levels of psychosocial functioning. It noted an apparent motivation to engage in drug related therapy. The report recommends drug counselling, as well as therapy and support for her unresolved situation with her ex-partner David. It suggested psychological intervention to deal with adjustment problems and mood disturbance. It concluded that a “period of further incarceration is likely to adversely affect Ms Lendill and her two children, for whom she has been the primary caregiver for all of their life.” It thought that a community-based supervision order would help her reducing her risk of recidivism and increase her response to appropriate treatment. 13. I have read the material pointing to the nature of the short course which she did in prison and I have read an affidavit by Mrs Lendill, Ms Lendill’s mother. That affidavit confirms the damaging relationship which she had with David. It confirms that she and her husband will support their daughter. 14. Ms Lendill has a short criminal record, which includes a couple of driving offences and an offence of possessing a prohibited drug committed earlier this year. 15. The prosecution has been represented by Ms Walker at the trial and Ms Summerfield in the sentence proceedings. The prosecution submits that the amount of the drugs located indicate that the offence falls below the middle range of objective seriousness. 16. Mr Ferndandez submits that I should make certain factual findings regarding the drugs found in his client’s possession. The total amount of the methylamphetamine was over six grams, just over twice the trafficable amount. Mr Fernandez argues that I should find that about two and a half grams of that were for his client’s personal use and that about four grams was for the purpose of supply. He acknowledges that the cocaine, consistent with the verdict of the jury, was in Ms Lendill’s possession for the purposes of supply. 17. From the way the case was put to the jury by Ms Walker, the conviction could be based on an acceptance that all of the methylamphetamine - that is over six grams - was in her possession for the purposes of supply or that either of the smaller amounts was in her possession for the purposes of supply. As I said, Mr Fernandez argues that I should find that it was just the larger amount which was in her possession for the purpose of supply. He said the other amount comprised various quantities, some of which were minute. This was consistent he said with it being used personally. 18. Given that I need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the whole amount was in her possession for the purpose of supply, Mr Fernandez’ argument raises a doubt in my mind. I think it likely that the smaller amount was in Ms Lendill’s possession for the purpose of supply. The traces of the drug could be explained by providing them to a purchaser who had their own container but the other explanation is also available and I cannot in my opinion be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the smaller amount was in her possession for the purpose of supply. I therefore find for the purpose of sentencing of Ms Lendill that she had in her possession for the purpose of supply 3.99 grams of methylamphetamine as well as the cocaine. 19. Mr Fernandez further invited me to find that his client’s dealing in drugs was in order to support her own habit. The prosecution does not contend otherwise. The evidence supports that conclusion and I make that finding. 20. Hence the weight of the methylamphetamine is just under a gram more than the trafficable quantity. The cocaine, which was contained in two bags, weighed some .36 of a gram. There was no evidence of any sophisticated planning or organisation. The evidence was consistent with Ms Lendill being a drug dependent drug user who sold drugs to support her own habit. I also accept Mr Fernandez’ submission, supported by Ms Summerfield, that it is not a discrete aggravating feature of this case that the offences involved are in disregard of public safety. 21. The authorities are clear that sentences for supplying drugs should normally attract a full time custodial sentence where it can be found that the offender engaged in repeated offences so that their activities can be described as trafficking. Such a full time custodial sentence need not be imposed if there are exceptional circumstances. Mr Fernandez argues that this is a case which does not fall within the category of cases that should attract a full time custodial sentence. He says that there is no evidence of repeated transactions, nor any evidence of any sophisticated commercial transactions.22. I regard this is a case where, given the authorities, there is no alternative to a sentence of imprisonment. However, as I indicated earlier, the real question is what form that sentence should take. 23. First, I should indicate that given the two offences in this case, I regard an overall sentence of imprisonment of two years as appropriate. 24. However, I have decided to make an order under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to suspend that sentence. 25. I have decided to make that order for the following reasons. First, the amount of both drugs involved places the offences comfortably within the low range of objective seriousness. As I said, the more serious amount being methylamphetamine was just a gram above the trafficable quantity. These offences are indeed at the bottom of the range, in my opinion. In that regard, I accept Mr Fernandez’ submission. 26. Secondly, this is a case I think where the rehabilitation of the offender looms large. That of itself would not normally be sufficient to take a case out of the category of drug trafficking offences which should attract a custodial sentence which is full time, but I regard this case as exceptional. As I said at the outset, Ms Lendill’s life has been marked by two significant circumstances which have really pushed it in the wrong direction. Up until the car accident and the relationship with David, she was living a normal, well adjusted, fruitful and balanced life. The car accident prompted or increased her use of cannabis. The relationship with David introduced her to a far more serious and addictive drug. 27. Her prospects of rehabilitation are not outstanding, but I find that they are reasonably good. I think that a suspended sentence is in order in this case because it will provide Ms Lendill, now forty two, with an opportunity before it is too late to set right the consequences of those two events in her life. It also means that if she breaks the bond that will attach to the suspended sentence, then she knows that she will go to gaol full time. 28. A third factor which I take into account in suspending the sentence is the fact that Ms Lendill has already served just over two months in custody, bail refused. I notice from MFI 4, the sentencing statistics, that some sixteen percent of offenders sentenced for supplying amphetamines received sentences with a non parole period or fixed term of six months or less. 29. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine, I sentence you to two years imprisonment. I make an order under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 suspending the whole of that sentence for the whole of the period and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for two years.30. The conditions of that good behaviour bond are these. You are to accept the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service. You are to notify the court of any change in your residential address by prepaid post. You are to appear before the court at any time, if called upon to do so. You are to accept the reasonable recommendations and directions of an officer of the Probation and Parole Service concerning any courses or processes to be engaged in by you, connected with drug dependency issues, mental health or domestic violence, or psychological issues. You are to report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service on or before 4 o’clock next Friday, 12 September 2008 at Manly or Dee Why, we are going to find out. I add to the reasonable directions that you should accept from the probation officer, any directions concerning random urinalysis. 31. For the other offence of supplying cocaine, I sentence you to imprisonment for one year to be concurrent with the other sentence and I also suspend that sentence under s 12 and it is subject to the same conditions. 32. The probation office that you are to report to before close of business next Friday is at Dee Why. HIS HONOUR: Have a seat for a moment Ms Lendill. I will explain things to you in a moment. First Ms Summerfield and Mr Fernandez, I think there are some other offences that I need to deal with, one way or another, are there not?SUMMERFIELD: There are your Honour, there are related offences of goods in custody, custody of knife in a public place, I could hand up a separate document if your Honour wishes.HIS HONOUR: Yes.SUMMERFIELD: With a s 166 certificate containing those charges.FERNANDEZ: I’ve seen that document your Honour.SUMMERFIELD: I can indicate that the maximum penalty for goods in custody is five penalty units or six months imprisonment, or both.HIS HONOUR: What do I do with - goods in custody or custody of a knife, what section--SUMMERFIELD: You’re required to sentence her in relation to those two offences, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You have just told me, but just repeat it, the goods in custody carries--SUMMERFIELD: Five penalty units and/or six months imprisonment, and the custody of knife in a public place carries five penalty units or $550.HIS HONOUR: So a penalty unit is $110?SUMMERFIELD: That's correct, yes.33. I deal with the related offences under s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as follows. For the goods in custody, I fine Ms Lendill $200 and for the custody of the knife I fine her $200. The document certificate pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act s 166 will be MFI #5.HIS HONOUR: Ms Summerfield, are there any other matters that I need to attend to before explaining the sentence to Ms Lendill?SUMMERFIELD: Only an order to destroy the drugs your Honour and also to forfeit the goods in custody money to the State.HIS HONOUR: And the drug destruction order is under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, I think, 39P.34. I order that the drugs in this case be destroyed pursuant to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. HIS HONOUR: Is the order for forfeit of the goods in custody under the same Act?SUMMERFIELD: I’m not quite sure your Honour.35. I order that the goods in custody, being the cash, be forfeited.FERNANDEZ: Your Honour, just on the goods in custody, your Honour made a factual finding in relation to drugs.HIS HONOUR: Yes.FERNANDEZ: And there were two amounts of cash.HIS HONOUR: Yes.FERNANDEZ: Would your Honour make an order of forfeiture of $585?36. Yes, the forfeiture of $585.HIS HONOUR: Ms Summerfield, anything else I need to attend to?SUMMERFIELD: There’s not, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Fernandez?FERNANDEZ: No there isn’t your Honour.37. Ms Lendill, I have to explain this to you. You have been given a prison sentence. I have sentenced you to two years, do you understand that? You have got two years. I have accepted Mr Fernandez’ submission and I have suspended that sentence, so you are going to have to go into the registry this afternoon and sign various documents, and your sentence is suspended for two years. The conditions which attach to that, and as you can tell, they are designed to help you with your rehabilitation, to get you back on track. That is up to you, it is up to you. You have got to be of good behaviour, you have got to do as you are told as far as the Probation Office is concerned, and that will include urinalysis to keep you on track. If you breach any of the conditions, you come back before me, and it is very difficult to avoid full time gaol, I want you to understand that. With a normal bond, say the bond, a normal bond, you may or may not go to gaol, but with a suspended sentence bond, they’re different, it’s really hard to stay out of gaol. If you do not tow the line, if you come back with positive drug use and you do not cooperate, chances are you will be back before me, and I will have to send you back inside, and I do not want to do that obviously, and nor do you, and nor do your children. It is up to you now. As you can tell, I have taken into account your age, the stage that you are at with your life, and the fact that those two factors in your life have really thrown it off course, but it is now up to you. Good luck.

   JUDGMENT1. On 21 July 2007 Steven Ray Hughes instilled terror into a taxi driver by kidnapping him in his own taxi and robbing him. As a result he was charged with two very serious offences. One was robbery in company, carrying a maximum of twenty years imprisonment and the other was specially aggravated detain for advantage, carrying a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment. 
    2. Mr Hughes pleaded not guilty to both charges but was convicted by a jury of both offences. It is my task now to sentence Mr Hughes.  
    3. First I need to say a little more about what was involved in these offences. Mr Syed Rahman had been a taxi driver for eight or ten years. He picked up some men at about 1.30 in the morning on Saturday 21 July 2007. He drove them from Petersham to Five Dock. When they got to Five Dock Mr Rahman was attacked by some men including Mr Hughes. He was punched five or six times to his head and arms, his wallet was taken and money demanded of him accompanied by threats of killing him. He felt something jabbed into his right side which he believed was a small handgun. In fact it was a spud gun which I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, was held by Mr Hughes. Mr Rahman was forced into the back of the taxi and one of the men started the taxi up and drove it. Mr Rahman’s neck was squeezed until he had difficulty breathing. At that stage he saw what was being held and it appeared to him, understandably, to be a small black handgun. It was pushed into the side of Mr Rahman’s head. 
    4. There were three or four men in the car. They began searching his clothes and ripping his pants. Mr Rahman heard things like “Finish him off”. This caused Mr Rahman to believe that he was going to be killed.  
    5. His watch and mobile phone were stolen. At the same time the man behind the wheel drove the taxi at high speed around the streets mounting footpaths and gutters. Mr Rahman broke down and pleaded for his life. His pleas were ignored to the extent that he was still detained and the car sped on its way. Mr Rahman pointed out that he had a wife and child at home. Discussion continued amongst the men about whether they would kill Mr Rahman. Eventually they forced him from the car. Mr Rahman genuinely believed that he would be killed during the episode.  
    6. Eventually, after he was released, Mr Rahman returned to his taxi and drove it to some police who happened to be nearby attending an accident. Mr Hughes was arrested a short time later and when being searched police found a small black spud gun and the phone and watch belonging to Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman suffered a laceration above his right eye and swelling and bruising around his eye and face. 
    7. I now need to make some assessment of just how serious these crimes are. I take into account, in assessing the seriousness of both crimes, the following factors which the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 says are aggravating features of a crime. These are the factors. Insofar as the robbery is concerned it involved actual and threatened violence. I do not take that into account for the detention charge because the charge itself involves, as a component, the infliction of actual bodily harm. Both offences involve the use of a weapon. Insofar as the detention charge offence is concerned it was committed in company. I find that the offences involve gratuitous cruelty in the threats that were made to Mr Rahman’s life. The emotional harm and loss was substantial. I will refer to that in due course by reference to the victim impact statement. The offence of detention was committed without regard for the public safety by the manner of driving of the taxi. The victim is regarded, by Parliament, as a particularly vulnerable person being a taxi driver.  
    8. Because certain aggravating factors were put to me on behalf of the prosecution, which I do not accept, I should record the items which I do not accept as aggravating features under s 21A. The offences were committed for financial gain. That is an element of both offences. There appears to be some degree of planning. I regard the offences as opportunistic rather than planned. There was a grave risk of death in the manner of driving. I do not find that to be objectively the case although I take it into account so far as the impact on the victim is concerned because of his state of mind. 
    9. Two other factors are relevant as aggravating features of the offending behaviour. The first is that these crimes were committed by Mr Hughes when he was on parole. In other words he had been released into the community instead of serving a sentence which had been imposed upon him. That release was to assist him to further his rehabilitation, at least that was one of the purposes. Mr Hughes abused that opportunity and the freedom which had been extended to him by committing these very serious crimes.  
    10. The second factor which needs to be taken into account is Mr Hughes’ criminal record. It is very bad. It points to a need, in sentencing Mr Hughes, for me to take into account both specific and general deterrence as important factors. The record discloses that Mr Hughes in now 22, having been born on 2 January 1986. After some relatively minor offences as a juvenile he commenced committing more serious offences as an adult. He has received a number of prison sentences for crimes such as common assault, assaulting an officer in the execution of duty and an offence of aggravated commission of a serious indictable offence in a dwelling. For that last crime he was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was released on parole on 3 February 2006. His parole period does not expire until 3 February 2009 and it was during that parole period that he committed these offences. 
    11. It is important in this case to note the circumstances of some of his previous crimes. One of them, committed on 21 August 2002, involved a taxi driver. It was less serious than the present crimes. Mr Hughes approached a taxi driver, demanded his money and then hit him. Such a crime emphasises the importance, in sentencing Mr Hughes, of protecting people in the community, such as taxi drivers, who are especially vulnerable to these kinds of offences.  
    12. Another crime committed on 7 August 2000 involved Mr Hughes and another person assaulting a young man in the street and demanding money.  
    13. The most serious offence on his record was committed on 4 February 2005, that is the offence that he received the four year gaol sentence for. Mr Hughes and another man broke into a block of units in Bondi. The only occupant was a 13 year old boy. Mr Hughes and the other man ransacked the boy’s room and demanded to be shown where everything was. They ransacked other rooms. The boy was hit on the back of the head at one stage. Before leaving, the boy’s hands were tied behind his back and he was gagged. The men stole computers and alcohol and other items from the house and were arrested shortly afterwards. 
    14. I find that the robbery offence I am sentencing Mr Hughes for was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this kind of offence. Insofar as the detention offence is concerned I need to refer to some factors which have been said by the authorities to be relevant to these kinds of crimes. In Regina v Collett (Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 June 1979, unreported) Roden J listed a number of factors which are relevant to this kind of offence. The length of time of detention is an important factor. In this case the length of time was relatively short. A second factor is the extent to which fear or terror is instilled in the victim and how the victim is treated. As I have said Mr Rahman was understandably terrified by the experience and was physically and emotionally abused by his captors. The third matter is the purpose of the detention. In this case it was the not unusual purpose of obtaining money. A fourth factor is whether there are persons, other persons who are involved from whom a ransom may be sought and that is not a relevant factor here. 
    15. Because of the aggravating factors which I have referred to and taking into account the matters I have just referred to from Collett I regard this offence as also being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I regard the offence as being well within that range. 
    16. There is sadly little that can be said in Mr Hughes’ favour so far as his personal attributes are concerned. A presentence report, which became exhibit SB, records an abusive upbringing. It is described in the report as an alcohol fuelled abusive upbringing with his father being particularly violent towards him. Mr Hughes was born in New Zealand and came to Australia aged 12. He is close to his mother and two brothers. He left school aged 16 after year 9. He had a disruptive school life because he would be regularly suspended. He has had short-term jobs, the longest being as a labourer for six months. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. The report says that despite having undertaken alcohol and other drug counselling and relapse prevention programs whilst previously under supervision, Mr Hughes maintained that they had not helped very much and that he really needed full-time residential rehabilitation to address issues of alcoholism and drug abuse. The report makes that recommendation and I agree with it. The report makes a number of other recommendations which I will take into account in my own recommendations to the Parole Authority. As the report says Mr Hughes has had a lifestyle pattern of “periods of incarceration, followed by relatively brief periods of parole which are eventually breached through reoffending, leading in turn to further incarceration.” Attempts to break the cycle have had limited success. 
    17. He is unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order. Neither of those is, in any event, an appropriate penalty. 
    18. Given the seriousness of these crimes and the need to emphasise, as I say, personal and general deterrence, I am satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in a case such as this. 
    19. The prison sentence needs to be a long one because of the seriousness of the crimes and the need for me to take into account, as Mr Moberley who appeared as Crown Prosecutor has submitted, the protection of the community and deterrence. Mr Moberley submitted that Mr Hughes’ rehabilitation prospects should have little or no role to play in sentencing Mr Hughes.  
    20. Mr Buckman, who appears for Mr Hughes, takes exception to that submission. I regard rehabilitation as having some role to play in sentencing Mr Hughes. That is because he is still a young man aged twenty-two who clearly has a problem with alcohol and drugs, he has not completed his secondary education and there would clearly appear to be an anger management problem.  
    21. Mr Moberley submits that there should be some partial accumulation of the sentences. I propose to impose sentences which will be completely concurrent. The reason for that is that these two offences occurred at the same time and involve the same circumstances with the same victim. 
    22. In theory there is a case for the sentence commencing on 4 February 2009, that is when the parole period expires for the previous sentence that was imposed on Mr Hughes. That parole has been revoked as a result of these offences. Since 21 July 2007 Mr Hughes has been in custody. Between that date and 9 August 2007 he was in custody, bail refused, for these offences and since 9 August 2007 has been in custody as a result of the revocation of the previous parole. I propose to backdate this sentence to 21 July 2007. That is one of the concessions which I find it appropriate to make in favour of Mr Hughes’ rehabilitation because of his age. Stand up Mr Hughes. 
    23. For the crime of specially aggravated detention for advantage, contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, I set a non-parole period of six years to date from 21 July 2007 and to expire on 20 July 2013. The balance of the term will be three years from 21 July 2013 to 20 July 2016. 
    24. For the robbery in company against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 I set a non-parole period of five years from 21 July 2007 until 20 July 2012. The balance of the term will be two years from 21 July 2012 until 20 July 2014. 
    25. The earliest day on which it appears, on the information available to me, that Mr Hughes will become entitled to be released from custody is 20 July 2013. 
    26. When Mr Hughes’ eligibility for parole is being considered by the Parole Authority I recommend that particular attention be given to strategies to address his drug and alcohol abuse with particular reference to the possibility of intensive full-time residential rehabilitation. 
    27. Now Mr Hughes the effect of all that is you have got nine years. The minimum term that you have to serve is six years. I backdated it to the date that you were arrested for this offence on 21 July 2007 and the six years expires on 20 July 2013. You are then eligible to be considered for parole. You understand that, you have had it happen before. The sentence is too long for me to direct parole so on 20 July 2013 the Parole Authority will consider you for parole. Have a seat. I will just add this to remarks on sentence.  
    28. In fixing the head sentence for the offence of specially aggravated detain for advantage, because of the seriousness of that crime and the maximum sentence for it, I would regard an appropriate head sentence as one of twelve years but because of Mr Hughes’ youth and some, though limited, prospects of rehabilitation I reduce that to nine years. I have adjusted the proportion between the non-parole period and the parole period to take into account the special circumstance that Mr Hughes will need longer than the standard period on parole in order to address his personal problems.Now Mr Modder, Mr Buckman are there any matters which I have not referred to or corrections that need to be made?BUCKMAN: No not that I can see your Honour.MODDER: Not from the Crown your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Did you want to see your client before he’s taken down?BUCKMAN: No I can see him downstairs your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Hughes can be taken down.

      JUDGMENT (Application under s 38 – see p 432 of transcript) 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: An application is made under s 37 of the Evidence Act for the Crown to cross-examine its witness Mr Spratt. The basis of the application is the existence of prior statements which are said to be inconsistent with testimony which he gave on Thursday last. The significant extract is that it was then said that instructions to vary what has come to be called “the list” originated with Mr Kamha and they had been delivered via Mr Bolden. It is the Crown’s contention that the mention of Mr Bolden is something which is inconsistent with prior statements made by the witness at the Royal Commission.  
     
      
    2 An extract of his evidence at p 5350 shows that in response to a question about whether he told you who instructed him to do it - he being Mr Shorter - the witness replied, “I'm not certain on this but I think the immediate instruction came from Mr Kamha. Again, in a statement taken for the purpose of these proceedings, he is asked about the conversation with Mr Shorter. When he, Mr Spratt, asked who told him to make the reductions, and Mr Shorter is said to have responded that he: 
     
      
       
        
        “[G]ot a call from Ashraf on Friday and he told me there was a list on the way and some case estimates which needed to be reduced straight away”.  
        
       
      
      
       
      That reference to “Ashraf” is to Mr Kamha, and there is no reference to Mr Bolden. 
       
      
    3 There is a note concerning some interview with Mr Spratt in which the interviewer noted that Mr Spratt had said something to the effect that it was better than possible that Tony produced the list; Tony may be taken to be a reference to Mr Bolden. Nevertheless, this is obviously mere speculation and is inconsistent with his assertion that he had been told by Mr Shorter that the instructions were delivered by Mr Bolden. 
     
      
    4 In those circumstances, in relation to this matter leave is granted.

     EX TEMPORE Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 PRICE J: The applicant, Robert Walter Neal, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed in the District Court on 3 August 2007 for the offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    2 The offence being contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period has not been prescribed for this offence.  
     
      
    3 Pleas of guilty had been entered by the applicant in the Local Court to three charges which he adhered to in the District Court. The first charge was that he on 31 August 2006 at Ettalong Beach assaulted and occasioned actual bodily harm to Ms Amara Roberts contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 The second charge was that he on 31 August 2006 at Ettalong Beach, broke and entered the dwelling house of David Roberts and therein committed a serious indictable offence, namely that he assaulted David Roberts and occasioned actual bodily harm to him. It is the sentence imposed for this offence which is the subject of the present appeal. 
     
      
    5 The third charge was that on 27 September 2006 at Ettalong Beach the applicant sent a letter and other documents intending to persuade Ms Roberts, who was then a person to be called as a witness in judicial proceedings, to withhold true evidence contrary to s 323 of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 An offence contrary to s 562ZG(1) of the Crimes Act, namely a contravention of an apprehended violence order made in favour of Ms Roberts, was included on a Form 1.  
     
      
    7 The Judge sentenced the applicant as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        On charge 1 (taking into account the offence on the Form 1) to imprisonment for a term of 2 years 3 months consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months commencing on 31 August 2006 and expiring on 30 April 2008 with a balance of term of 7 months commencing on 1 May 2008 and expiring on 30 November 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        On charge 2 to imprisonment for a term of 4 years 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months commencing on 1 March 2007 and expiring on 30 June 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year 2 months commencing on 1 July 2010 and expiring on 31 August 2011.  
        
       
       
        
        On charge 3 to imprisonment for a term of 2 years 3 months consisting of a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 1 June 2010 and expiring on 28 February 2011 with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months commencing on 1 March 2011 and expiring on 31 August 2012.  
        
       
      
    8 As a result of partial accumulation, the total effective sentence was 6 years commencing on 31 August 2006 and expiring on 31 August 2012 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 31 August 2006 and expiring on 28 February 2011.  
     
      
    9 The Judge had allowed a 25 per cent utilitarian discount for the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    10 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence for charge 2 was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    11 An agreed statement of facts was tendered during the proceedings on sentence which the Judge summarised as follows (ROS at [16]): 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 1am on 31 August 2006 the offender arrived at the home at where he lived with Ms Roberts and their two children. He was affected by the intoxicating liquor that he had consumed. An argument between Ms Roberts and the offender developed. After abusing her, the offender attacked her, putting her on the ground and placing his hands around her throat. Ms Roberts struggled against the offender’s hold and scratched his face. The offender released his hold on Ms Roberts’ throat but put his arm across her chest pinning her to the floor. The family dog intervened and, when the offender punched at the dog, he released his hold on Ms Roberts and she was able to stand up. Ms Roberts went into the kitchen and used the telephone to ring triple 0. When the offender attempted to take the handset from her, Ms Roberts threw the handset at him and ran out from the kitchen to her father’s home, which was at the rear of her home.” 
        
       
      
    12 These were the facts in respect of charge one. His Honour then characterised that offence as falling above the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of its kind.  
     
      
    13 His Honour then continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “After she entered her father’s home Ms Roberts used his telephone to ring triple 0 and they waited for police. After a few minutes, they heard banging on the home’s front door and then the screen door being pulled away from its mountings. The offender entered Mr Robert’s home and attacked him, pulling his hair, punching him and pushing him onto the floor.” 
        
       
      
    14 The statement of facts reveals that Ms Roberts attempted to stand between the applicant and her father in an effort to stop the assault. The applicant then left the home and went out to the front yard when the police arrived. Mr Roberts was a 60 year old man who suffered from a heart condition. He was taken to hospital for observation due to this heart condition. He complained of soreness to the side of his face and was suffering from dizziness. He later noticed the loss of hair from where it had been pulled.  
     
      
    15 These are the facts in respect of charge two which is the charge the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
    16 The Judge characterised the offence as falling below the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of its kind.  
     
      
    17 The Judge summarised the facts of charge 3 by recounting that the applicant sent a letter and accompanying documents to Ms Roberts intending to persuade her to withhold from giving true evidence in the proceedings against him.  
     
      
    18 The applicant was born on 29 April 1973 and was 33 years old at the time of the offending. He had a record of previous convictions including offences relating to violence, breaches of apprehended violence orders, possession and use of prohibited drugs. He had previously served sentences of imprisonment. On 11 February 1999, in the District Court at Queanbeyan, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 months with a minimum term of 6 months and an additional term of 9 months for malicious wounding. At Cooma Local Court on 9 December 1998, he had been sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months for a contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order. On 11 March 2003, in the Cessnock Local Court, for the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm he was placed on a 3 year good behaviour bond which was subject to probation and parole supervision.  
     
      
    19 On 3 June 2005 the applicant was charged with an offence of common assault the victim of the offence being Ms Roberts.  
     
      
    20 On 17 August 2005 for that offence, he was ordered to perform 200 hours community service. An apprehended violence order had been made to protect Ms Roberts which was in force at the time of the offences on 31 August 2006. The applicant was also on bail for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm with which he had been charged on 27 March 2005. On 15 January 2007 he was sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months to date from 31 August 2006. He was also re-sentenced on that day for the charge of assault, the community service order being revoked and sentence of 6 months imprisonment to date from 31 August 2006 being imposed. The sentences imposed by the Judge subsumed these sentences.  
     
      
    21 The applicant gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence. A report from Anna Robilliard, a psychologist, a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report, a letter from the Salvation Army’s Bridge Program and various certificates as to his achievements whilst in custody were tendered. Also tendered was a letter written by the applicant to the Judge.  
     
      
    22 The applicant does not suggest that his Honour’s characterisation of the offence as falling below the middle of the range of seriousness was inappropriate. What is submitted is that the sentence actually imposed in respect of the offence fails to reflect that evaluation and the sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. What was said by Howie J in Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [37]-[39] as to factors relevant to determining the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act was cited. It is contended that although as a general proposition, it may be that offences involving residential premises would be regarded as more serious than those involving other kinds of premises, in the circumstances of the applicant’s case that might be considered to be less relevant given that the premises concerned adjoined each other and the occupants of the respective premises were related to one another. 
     
      
    23 Furthermore, it is argued that the damage to the premises was confined to the screen door and the degree of bodily harm does not indicate a serious instance of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The fact that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm attracts a maximum penalty of five years is said to be relevant, although not a determinative consideration.  
     
      
    24 The undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 6 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    25 At the time of the offences, the applicant was in a de facto relationship with Ms Roberts. They resided together with their two daughters aged two and three in the premises at Ettalong. After being assaulted by the applicant, Ms Roberts had escaped to her father’s home which adjoined the premises in which the applicant and Ms Roberts lived. The applicant had pursued her to the home in which she had sought sanctuary and pulled away the screen door from its mountings. He then entered the home and attacked Ms Robert’s father. As the Judge remarked (ROS at [23]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The first [offence] involved a vicious attack upon a defenceless woman in her own home.  
        The second involved an equally vicious attack upon a defenceless elderly man in his own home 
        ” (italics added). 
        
       
      
    26 Offences for violent attacks in domestic settings, this Court has emphasised, must be treated with real seriousness. Important factors in sentencing a domestic violence offender are specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and protection of the community: see, for example, R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551.  
     
      
    27 There is no good reason, in my opinion, why those principles should not apply to an offender who in pursuit of his domestic partner has broken into her father’s home and then assaulted him. The victim was a 60 year old man with a heart condition. The applicant’s conduct was violent, cowardly and inexcusable. The lack of significant damage to the home or significant actual injury occasioned to the victim, to my mind, does little to diminish the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    28 At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was on bail for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see, for example, Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40]-[42]. 
     
      
    29 The applicant’s criminal history included serious offences involving violence. As the Judge remarked “it is obvious and fair to say that he has learnt nothing whatsoever from his earlier offending and from the penalties imposed upon him for those offences.” Having regard to the applicant’s criminal history, the Judge was entitled to give more weight to considerations of retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. It was important that the applicant clearly understood that he could not continue his violent offending. 
     
      
    30 The maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment was not irrelevant to his Honour’s sentencing task. It is the maximum penalty which has been legislated by Parliament. Whilst the maximum penalty for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of 5 years imprisonment is not an irrelevant consideration, the maximum penalty of 14 years for an offence contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act serves as a yardstick or a basis of comparison between the case before the Court and the worst possible case: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [31]. 
     
      
    31 Judicial Commission sentencing statistics have been included in the written submissions. The assistance provided by these statistics is limited largely because sentencing is an individual exercise. In the present case, it is to be borne in mind as a result of partial accumulation of the sentence for charge one, the effective non-parole period for charge two was significantly less than 3 years 4 months. It was, in fact, 2 years 2 months. 
     
      
    32 It is evident that the Judge gave careful consideration to the subjective case advanced on behalf of the applicant.  
     
      
    33 I do not think that the sentence for the offence of break and commit serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    34 Another issue arose during the appeal. It was pointed out by the Crown that the offence on the Form 1 should have been taken into account on charge two and the Judge did not do so. It is clear that the Judge took the offence on the Form 1 into account in the sentence imposed for charge one when it should have been taken into account on charge two. In view of the orders I propose it is unnecessary to consider this issue.  
     
      
    35 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

    37 JOHNSON J: I agree with Price J.

      2003/6192 R v Russell Clement Wills 
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR VERDICT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Russell Clement Wills, has been tried by me, sitting without a jury, for the murder of Hans Hoch at Surry Hills on or about 16 July 2002. The matter has had a somewhat complicated history, which it is not necessary to recite. It is sufficient to say that he was tried upon the same indictment before Studdert J and a jury in October 2004, was found guilty and was sentenced. However, for reasons which are of no present relevance, that conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered: Wills v R [2007] NSWCCA 160. A retrial commenced before Barr J and a jury in April of this year, but the jury had to be discharged before the evidence was completed.  
     
      
    2 So it is that the matter is now before me, the accused having elected for trial without a jury and the Crown prosecutor having consented to that course. The accused has been represented by Mr Paish of counsel. By agreement, I have received the transcript of the evidence of all the Crown witnesses, given in one or other of the two previous trials. I have also heard brief additional oral evidence from a forensic biologist, Ms Sharon Neville, and extensive further oral evidence from a Crown witness, Mark Anthony Skerry. The accused also gave evidence before me, and called a witness in his case.  
     
      
    3 I was a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal which set aside the conviction after the first trial. We rejected a ground of appeal that the verdict was unreasonable, and the fact that I joined in that decision was drawn to the attention of the parties before the present trial. However, neither party asked me to disqualify myself from hearing the matter, and I saw no reason why I should do so. The Court’s rejection of the ground of appeal meant no more than it could not be said that the verdict was not open to the jury on the evidence in the first trial. As I assured the parties at the outset of the present trial, I have put that decision to one side and have set about considering the matter afresh in the light of the evidence before me and the arguments of counsel.  
     
      
    4 Mr Hoch, the deceased, was an elderly and frail man, who lived alone in a Housing Commission flat in Belvoir St, Surry Hills. The accused was sharing a room with another man in a boarding house in Cleveland St, Surry Hills. At the relevant time the accused and the deceased had known each other for about a year. It appears that they had generally been on good terms, and not long before the death of the deceased the accused had stayed overnight at his flat for several days.  
     
      
    5 In the early afternoon of Wednesday, 17 July 2002, the deceased was found dead in his flat. He had been brutally assaulted and died of multiple injuries. A post-mortem examination conducted by Dr Alan Cala found a number of bruises and lacerations to his head and face. His larynx had been fractured. There was extensive bruising, together with abrasions, to his trunk and limbs, and there were a number of rib fractures. Dr Cala concluded that these injuries were the result of blunt force trauma, such as kicking. The deceased was found on the floor of his bedroom, and when police attended the flat later in the afternoon of 17 July they found two saucepans and a frypan in that area. They were bloodstained and it is obvious that they had been used as weapons. Dr Cala saw some of the injuries as consistent with having been caused by them. 
     
      
    6 There is no dispute that whoever inflicted these injuries is guilty of murder or, at least, manslaughter. The inference that the perpetrator intended to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him is readily available. Alternatively, the inference that the killing was the result of an unlawful and dangerous act is irresistible. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest any form of justification for such an attack. The central issue in the case is whether the accused was the perpetrator. The Crown case against him is circumstantial. There is a considerable body of evidence. However, as I have reached the conclusion that the case against the accused has not been made out, it is appropriate that I deal with it succinctly.  
     
      
    7 Dr Cala examined the body of the deceased at the flat at about 8pm on 17 July. From the temperature of the body and the state of rigor mortis which had developed, he concluded that death had occurred somewhere between twelve and thirty hours earlier. He acknowledged the imprecision inherent in such an estimate. He thought it unlikely that the deceased had been dead for less than twelve hours, saying that he thought it had been “substantially more than that”. At the other extreme, he could not exclude a period up to thirty-six hours but described around thirty hours “as a ball park figure”.  
     
      
    8 If one were to accept thirty-six hours as the outer limit, then death could have occurred as early as about 8am the previous day, Tuesday, 16 July. However, in cross-examination, Dr Cala made it clear that twelve to thirty hours was the “most probable” range for the time of death and that, while “theoretically” it may have been longer than thirty hours, that was “really in the realms of possibility”. If thirty hours is the outer limit, death could not have occurred before about 2pm on 16 July. Equally, if death could not have occurred less than twelve hours before Dr Cala’s examination, it could not have been later than about 8am on 17 July. However, as I have said, the doctor was of the view that it would have been “substantially” earlier than that.  
     
      
    9 As will be seen, the range of time of death is important because of evidence about the accused’s movements, particularly on 16 July. It is not suggested that there was any significant lapse of time between the attack and the death. 
     
      
    10 The accused had been staying overnight at the deceased’s flat for several days up to and including Monday, 15 July. He slept on a mattress on the lounge room floor. In the early evening of that Monday, the deceased called police to have him removed. Two police officers arrived at the flat in answer to the call. They observed that the accused appeared not to know why the deceased wanted him to leave. Nor would the deceased say why, even when one of the officers took him to another room where they could speak privately.  
     
      
    11 One of the officers gave evidence that the deceased seemed “a bit agitated”, while the accused was “actually quite nice, helpful”. Nevertheless, having ascertained that the accused was not a party to the lease of the flat and had no right to remain there, the police directed him to leave. Before doing so, he returned a key of the flat to the deceased. He packed some clothes into a black bag, and police escorted him from the flat and out of the building. 
     
      
    12 While the Crown prosecutor could not identify a motive for the accused to attack the deceased, he relied upon this evidence as demonstrating ill feeling between them at the relevant time. In the early afternoon of 16 July, the accused told his roommate at the Cleveland St boarding house, Tapiwa Shumba, that he had had an argument with the deceased and had been thrown out. He did not say what the argument was about. It is the Crown case that some time between the morning of the Tuesday and the morning of the Wednesday the accused returned to the flat, that whatever had been the contention between the two men on the Monday flared up again, and that this led the accused to attack the deceased.  
     
      
    13 Police who attended the flat on the afternoon of 17 July found no sign of forced entry. The door to the flat could be opened from the outside only with a key. Accordingly, the assailant either had a key or, perhaps more likely, was admitted to the flat by the deceased. Although the accused had returned his key, and there had been ill feeling between him and the deceased, he was obviously a person who might have been allowed in. 
     
      
    14 The witness, Mark Skerry, who lived in the same block of units, knew both the deceased and the accused. He gave evidence that he saw the two men at the accused’s flat between about 12.30 and 1pm on Tuesday, 16 July. He said that he spent a short time in the flat with them, before leaving them to return to his own flat. If this is accepted, it is the last occasion on the evidence on which the deceased was seen alive. Moreover, it is proximate in time to the beginning of the period which Dr Cala saw as the most probable range of the time of death.  
     
      
    15 In the flat the police also found the accused’s black bag in which he had packed his clothes on the Monday night. The mattress on which he had been sleeping was still on the lounge room floor. Under the cushion of a lounge in that room the police found a wallet containing cards identifying it as the accused’s. The Crown case is that the accused returned to the flat with his belongings, perhaps expecting that he would be allowed to stay there again. However, in his haste to get away from the flat after attacking the deceased, he forgot to take his bag and wallet with him.  
     
      
    16 The accused’s roommate at the boarding house, Mr Shumba, worked at nights. He gave evidence that between about midday and 1pm on 16 July he was awoken when the accused came into the room. He noticed that the accused seemed to have some difficulty with his left leg and was limping. When he asked him about it, the accused said that he had been hit by a car on the way home. Two other residents of the boarding house gave evidence of seeing the accused limping, although they could not pinpoint the date on which they did. To one of them, Peter Brooks, he gave an explanation for his condition. Mr Brooks’ recollection in evidence of what he said was very unclear, but it was to the effect that he had been pushed against a car while trying to protect a girl. The other resident, Leslie McKenzie asked the accused what had happened to his leg and received the response, “Don’t ask.” 
     
      
    17 The accused was arrested in his room at the boarding house on Thursday, 18 July. The police noticed that his leg was apparently injured. Later that day he was escorted to Sydney Hospital because he was unwell. He was examined by Dr Christopher Gregory, who saw bruising to his left thigh. According to Dr Gregory’s notes, he complained of having felt pain in that thigh “for some days”. However, the notes also recorded that he was “reluctant” to say how the injury had occurred.  
     
      
    18 It is the Crown case that the accused injured his leg in some way during his attack upon the deceased or in the course of fleeing from the scene. This, said the Crown prosecutor, explains his reluctance to tell Mr McKenzie and Dr Gregory about the source of the injury, and such explanation as he did provide to Mr Shumba and Mr Brooks should be rejected.  
     
      
    19 Police took possession of the clothes the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest, which he had not changed for several days. Examination of his track suit pants revealed an area of blood staining on the top left leg near the crotch. On his polo shirt two blood stains were detected on the left sleeve and another at the opening of the collar. Testing of these stains revealed DNA consistent with that of the deceased. There was no challenge to the accuracy of these results, and it is not in dispute that there was blood of the deceased on those parts of the accused’s clothing.  
     
      
    20 Thus, the circumstances upon which the Crown relies to establish its case against the accused are these: 
     
      
       
        
        1) The accused’s removal from the deceased’s flat on Monday, 15 July (taking with him his bag); 
        
       
       
        
        2) The sighting of the accused by Mark Skerry in the deceased’s flat in the early afternoon of Tuesday, 16 July; 
        
       
       
        
        3) The absence of any sign of forced entry into the flat; 
        
       
       
        
        4) The injury to the accused’s leg observed on 16 July; 
        
       
       
        
        5) The accused’s reluctance to tell Mr McKenzie and Dr Gregory how he injured his leg;  
        
       
       
        
        6) The location of the accused’s bag and wallet in the flat by investigating police; 
        
       
       
        
        7) The blood of the deceased on the accused’s track pants and shirt. 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown relies upon the combination of these circumstances to found the inference of the accused’s guilt. However, the Crown prosecutor fairly acknowledged that that inference could not be drawn unless I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the blood on the accused’s clothing was the result of his attack upon the deceased. Of course, that is a matter to be decided in the light of the other circumstances relied upon, and the whole of the evidence.  
     
      
    22 Let me turn, then, to the accused’s evidence. It is sufficient to summarise briefly the effect of that evidence as it touches upon each of the seven circumstances relied on by the Crown.  
     
      
    23 It is necessary to sketch a little background to the events of the evening of Monday, 15 July. The evidence establishes that the deceased held himself out to be a doctor, although it appears that he had no such qualification. Mark Skerry said that he believed that he was so qualified and that, generally, he was a man of some importance and influence. Mr Skerry’s affairs at the time were under the control of the Protective Commission, and he wanted to regain the ability to handle his money himself. He asked the deceased to write a letter to the Commission making representations on his behalf. On a number of occasions he pursued the deceased about this matter, to the extent that the deceased became annoyed with him and did not want him in his flat. 
     
      
    24 According to the accused, Mr Skerry had been banging on the door of the deceased’s flat in the early evening of 15 July, seeking access to speak to the deceased, as he had been over the previous few days. The accused was insistent on answering the door and remonstrating with Mr Skerry, but the deceased did not want him to do so and demanded that he not interfere in the matter. It was this, he said, which led the deceased to order him, the accused, to leave. According to the accused, the deceased was determined not to involve anyone else in his problem with Mr Skerry. This might be seen as consistent with the deceased’s refusal to tell police why he wanted the accused to leave. Equally, it would be consistent with the demeanour of the accused which the police observed, suggesting that he could see no rational reason why the deceased would want him out of the flat. 
     
      
    25 The accused said that, having been required by the police to leave, he felt under pressure do so promptly. He packed his belongings into his bag, but forgot his wallet. This did not pose an immediate problem for him, because he had some cash in his pocket. It was for this reason, on the defence case, that investigating police found the wallet on the Wednesday afternoon. In final address, Mr Paish noted that it was found in a concealed position under the cushion of a lounge, where it might easily have been overlooked by the accused as he left on the Monday night.  
     
      
    26 The accused went on to say that he repaired on foot to his room at the boarding house, where he deposited his bag. He then walked to the Evening Star Hotel in Elizabeth St, Surry Hills, which he frequented regularly. He acknowledged that he was an alcoholic, and that he drank to excess daily. On the way, manoeuvring around a pothole in Cleveland St, he fell over and injured his left hip. It was this fall, he said, which led to his limping in the manner observed by the witnesses to whom I have referred. Put shortly, he said that his reluctance to explain the injury, and the account he gave to Mr Brooks and Mr Shumba, were the result either of his feeling too ill to discuss the matter or his embarrassment at admitting that the fall was, no doubt, the result of his habitual and excessive drinking.  
     
      
    27 He said that the following morning, 16 July, he went back to the deceased’s flat “to see how he was and how things were”. He took his bag with him. He arrived at about 11am, to find that the deceased had a bleeding nose. The deceased would not say how this had happened, but he asked the accused to help him by getting some toilet paper to wipe the blood from his nose. The accused did so, making several trips to the bathroom to obtain the toilet paper. The effect of his evidence was that the deceased kept blowing his nose and that a significant amount of blood came from it. Although the accused did not say as much in evidence, it was this process which Mr Paish relied upon to explain the deceased’s blood on his clothing.  
     
      
    28 The accused said that he was concerned for the deceased and became upset when he refused to explain how his nose came to be bleeding. The implication of his evidence was that he suspected that Mr Skerry had some involvement in the matter. Again, the deceased said that he did not want him interfering in what was happening and asked him to leave. The accused did so but, in his distress, left his bag behind.  
     
      
    29 He walked back to the boarding house, and it was upon his arrival there that Mr Shumba saw him and observed him to be limping. At this point I shall summarise Mr Shumba’s account of what happened. He noted that the accused normally took his bag containing his personal effects with him when he left the room. On this occasion, the accused did not have the bag and he asked Mr Shumba to help him locate it. He seemed uncertain whether he had left it at the Evening Star Hotel, at a park, or at the deceased’s flat. It was in this context that he told Mr Shumba that he had had an argument with the deceased.  
     
      
    30 The two of them set off on foot to the deceased’s block of units, arriving there about half an hour later. There were some police vehicles parked outside the units. The accused said, “Shit, the cops …Hans has called the cops on me.” They went into the block of the units from an entrance on the other side of the building, and the accused spoke to one of the residents whom he knew for a few minutes. They then left and repaired to the boarding house. In the early evening they went together to the Evening Star Hotel, where they remained until about 10.30pm. The accused then walked back towards the boarding house, and Mr Shumba walked to his night time employment at Darlinghurst.  
     
      
    31 The accused gave evidence that, when he saw police in the vicinity of the deceased’s unit block that afternoon, he feared that the deceased had called police to keep him away. He denied that it was because he had done anything wrong. He said that after he and Mr Shumba left the hotel that night, he went back to the boarding house and slept until Mr Shumba arrived home from work at about 8 o’clock the following morning, the Wednesday.  
     
      
    32 It will be seen, then, that the accused has proffered an explanation for most of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown: his being ordered from the deceased’s flat on the Monday, his being seen to be limping on the Tuesday and what he said about it, the finding of his bag and wallet at the deceased’s flat on the Wednesday afternoon, and the presence of the deceased’s blood on his clothing. That there was no sign of forced entry into the flat is, of itself, of little significance. There is no reason to believe that the accused is the only man whom the deceased would have admitted to the flat. Indeed, there was evidence from another resident of the block of units, Fikret Salih, that the deceased had a lot of visitors at his unit during the day and at night time. This may have had something to do with his pretence of being a doctor.  
     
      
    33 The only evidence that the accused was with the deceased in his flat in the early afternoon of 16 July is that of Mark Skerry. Mr Skerry was cross-examined at length, and effectively, in the course of the first trial and again in the trial before me. I need say no more than that I found him a most unreliable witness. I do not say that as a criticism of him personally. He presented as a rather sad figure, with a history of alcohol abuse and mental illness. It is perhaps not surprising that significant inconsistencies were exposed between his evidence in the two trials and his statement to the investigating police.  
     
      
    34 Mr Paish cross-examined Mr Skerry closely about his own movements at relevant times, suggesting that it was he who had perpetrated this attack upon the deceased. It was on that issue that a witness was called in the accused’s case to give evidence about an earlier and unrelated incident of violence inflicted by Mr Skerry upon another man, against a background said to be somewhat similar to his relationship with the deceased. It was entirely legitimate for Mr Paish to explore the possibility that Mr Skerry had assaulted the deceased, so as to raise an hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused. However, it is not necessary to determine this matter to resolve the present case and, certainly, I would make no finding adverse to Mr Skerry about it. 
     
      
    35 It is sufficient to say that I would not act upon Mr Skerry’s evidence that he saw the accused in the company of the deceased in the afternoon of 16 July. Quite apart from the inherent unreliability of Mr Skerry’s evidence, it cannot stand with the evidence of Mr Shumba that the accused was in his company at the boarding house at that same time and the two of them were together for many hours thereafter.  
     
      
    36 As one would expect, the Crown prosecutor mounted a spirited attack upon the accused’s credibility. Without going to the detail of it, he argued that the accused’s account had all the hallmarks of being tailored to accommodate and explain the Crown case. Of course, it is trite law that the accused bears no burden of proving his innocence and that, even if I rejected his evidence in its entirety, the Crown would still bear the burden of establishing his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That said, I can see the force of the Crown prosecutor’s submission and, I must say, I approach the accused’s evidence with considerable reservation.  
     
      
    37 Nevertheless, in one respect his account receives significant support in the Crown case. As I have said, his explanation for the injury to his left leg was a fall on the way to the Evening Star Hotel on the night of 15 July. If that explanation is accepted, the injury could not be attributable in any way to the attack on the deceased. On the most expansive view of the range of time of death expounded by Dr Cala, the attack could not have taken place before about 8 o’clock the following morning. Equally, the accused’s reluctance to explain how the injury came about, whatever the reason for it might have been, could have no significance in the case. Yet, an employee of the hotel, John Egan, observed him to be “limping slightly on his left leg” while he was there. Whether this was during the night of 15 July or the small hours of the following morning is not clear, but it matters not. Mr Egan’s shift ended at 3am on the Tuesday, which was still well before the deceased could have been attacked.  
     
      
    38 The most compelling aspect of the Crown case, undoubtedly, is the finding of the deceased’s blood on the accused’s clothes. If he were the attacker, it is perhaps surprising that more blood was not detected. Cross-examination of Dr Cala explored the question whether kicking the deceased would be likely to have deposited blood on the lower part of the assailant’s trousers, it being noted that no blood was found in that area of the accused’s track suit pants. Read as a whole, I find the doctor’s evidence inconclusive on this point and, broadly speaking, it does not appear that the modest amount of blood found on the accused’s clothing is inconsistent with his having been the attacker.  
     
      
    39 Nevertheless, I have noted the standard of proof which the Crown prosecutor acknowledged he bears on this aspect of the case. As I have said, it is a matter to be assessed in the light of the whole of the evidence. That includes the evidence of Mr Shumba, which has the accused in his company for a very significant part of the period during which, in my view, it is most likely that the deceased was attacked. I am not prepared to reject the accused’s explanation of the blood on his clothes as a reasonable possibility. 
     
      
    40 I am indebted to counsel on both sides for their careful analysis of the evidence in final submissions, to much of which I have not referred. However, it is sufficient to say that, however much suspicion the evidence might engender against the accused, it falls short of proof to the requisite degree. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was he who perpetrated this attack upon the unfortunate deceased. Accordingly, I find the accused not guilty.

     Clint Joseph BRILLEY v Regina 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Blanch J.2 GROVE J: I agree with Blanch J.3 BLANCH J: The appellant stood trial in the District Court in Sydney between 31 July, 2006 and 4 September, 2006. He was tried together with Marco Coffen and was convicted of a charge of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s97(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900, the charge on the indictment. The jury could not agree in respect of the charge against Coffen and he subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory before the fact to armed robbery. The appellant was sentenced on 9 November, 2006 to a non-parole period of 5 years and a total term of 7 years and 6 months. His appeal is against conviction only.The Facts4 The robbery in question was committed on 28 November, 2002 at the warehouse of CTI Logistics in O’Riordan Street, Alexandria in Sydney. Three employees of the company arrived for work shortly after 5.45 a.m. Soon after they arrived three men entered the warehouse disguised in dust masks or balaclavas, sunglasses, cotton gloves, disposable overalls and orange reflective vests. Two were armed with pistols and one with a baseball bat. They arrived at or had at their disposal a recently stolen white Isuzu truck, registration number LGN 500. They maintained contact using walkie-talkies with a fourth man who was outside in a stolen blue or purple Subaru. During the course of the robbery one employee Burt Errington was beaten with a baseball bat which broke. He ran from the warehouse but he was intercepted by the fourth man outside who threatened him with a pistol.5 Matthew Marlow was one of the three employees at the premises when the robbers arrived. He was responsible for opening the premises. He went into the kitchen to make a cup of coffee and there was a man standing there with a pistol. That man was wearing a balaclava, black sunglasses, dark coloured clothes and an orange safety vest. The gun was a “bronzy gold” colour. He described the man as medium to solid build, approximately 175cm tall and with olive coloured skin. He could just see a small portion of skin on the man’s neck. He was wearing white cotton gloves which appeared to be clean. He was threatened with the gun and forced to join his two fellow workmates. The robbers communicated on a two-way radio and were alerted to the fact that another employee was arriving. When he did arrive he was also forced to join the other employees. Marlow was asked to open the gate to the bonded area and he described the first robber he saw as having some type of accent but he could not tell what it was.6 Marlow opened the gate and he saw the white truck LGN 500 pull up outside. One of the robbers got into the yellow Yale forklift which was in the bonded area and drove it to some pallets wrapped in black shrink wrap which contained Samsung mobile phones. He picked up the first pallet with the forklift and took it out to the truck. The forklift kept stalling and the first robber asked Marlow if he was able to drive it. When he said he could he was ordered to do so and he did. The first robber got up on to the side of the forklift and held the pistol to Mr Marlow’s head. Marlow was ordered to load the truck with the black shrink wrap pallets of mobile phones. There was some conversation between himself and the robber. When he had finished loading them, he was told to rejoin his workmates and sit down. Burt Errington was tied up with silver tape and there was other tape which was used to tie up the other employees of the company. The first robber waved a pistol and said “Don’t do anything for five minutes” and then left. Before leaving one of them sprayed the yellow forklift all over with a spray which looked like Glen 20. Marlow attempted to free another employee but could not but managed to get to a phone and dial 000, the emergency number and he reported the hold-up. At about that time another CTI driver Garry Sweeney arrived and he said he arrived shortly after the 6.30 a.m. news and he freed the bound men.7 Somewhere between 6.15 a.m. and 6.50 a.m. three witnesses saw the white Isuzu truck and a blue Subaru pull into Council Lane at Leichhardt. The white truck made a loud noise as it hit an overhanging tree branch causing damage to the nose cone of the truck. The witnesses saw one man driving the truck and three men in the Subaru. One of the men from the Subaru tried to guide the truck down the lane so it could reverse into a side lane leading to the rear of 58 Moore Street. The truck could not be reversed into the side lane and was then reversed out of Council Lane striking tree branches as it went and it was then driven away. About 7.00 a.m. the white truck was found in Taylor Street, Leichhardt. The witness who found it noticed the ignition wires had been pulled out and there was damage to the nose cone and he called the Police. The load of about 3,810 stolen mobile phones was still on the truck when Police arrived. 8 At 10.30 a.m. Police went to the premises at 58 Moore Street and spoke to Michael Keith (also known as Michael Sullivan). The Police noticed a blue Subaru later identified as stolen. It had number plates on it AIE-52A which were stolen number plates and inside the premises the Police found a number plate WYZ-801. Burt Errington thought the number plate on the purple Subaru he saw was WYZ-781. About five minutes after the Police arrived the appellant and Coffen arrived in a silver Subaru registered to Coffen’s mother. They were arrested.9 A Ford motor vehicle belonging to the appellant’s mother was found by the Police parked in the lane that day and the Police took it away for examination. Two witnesses who observed the white truck attempting to negotiate the lane gave evidence that this light brown Ford was parked in Council Lane at that time. One of those witnesses said he normally parked there but could not because of three cars parked in the lane including this Ford.10 Inside the premises at 58 Moore Street, the Police found a baseball bat broken in half on a shelf in the garage and two handguns and three walkie-talkies on a shelf. In the garage next to the blue Subaru they found a black plastic garbage bag containing three pairs of disposable overalls, two orange reflective vests, white cotton gloves, 12 disposable dust masks, two pieces of tape – one grey and the other black, packet labels for disposable overalls, another disposable face mask, sunglasses and labels, a price tag for a balaclava, a packet label for ten dust masks and cotton gloves. Two balaclavas and caps were found in a sports bag. NSW number plates WYZ-801 were found on a shelf. A red Marbig notebook containing three entries: “get and fix car, get disguises for B1, go early so no drawback” was found in the silver Subaru on the floor behind the passenger seat (the book bearing fingerprints of Coffen, Huang and other unidentified prints). Also found were torn pieces of paper which put together showed a sketch of the CTI Logistics floor plan and product descriptions for various mobile phones (bearing fingerprint of Huang), and a forklift that had been hired from Budget Forklifts by Michael Keith the day before the robbery. Items were sent to the Division of Analytical Laboratories and a DNA sample on one of the dust masks was found to match the appellant and DNA on a white glove matched a DNA sample from Coffen. 11 On 17 January, 2003 Matthew Marlow was taken to Redfern Police Station where he was shown four series of 20 photographs in each series. When he watched the third series he asked to see number 14 again. This was a photograph of the appellant taken just after his arrest. When shown the photo again he said “The eyes look familiar. Definitely the red mark.” He was asked why it was familiar and he said “The hold up at work…His eyes look familiar from the first guy I saw that morning…did not get much of a look at him…the first man had a balaclava on…a black balaclava with his eyes showing.” Marlow’s evidence was that he took into account the red mark, the shape of the eyes, the shape of the head, his build and the shape of his neck. In evidence he described the red mark in the eye as a permanent red mark and said “It was like a blood mark in the corner of the eye.”12 The prosecution case significantly involved firstly proving that the premises at 58 Moore Street, Leichhardt were premises from which the robbers operated, secondly proving the appellant was connected with those premises at the relevant time and thirdly the identification of the appellant in the identification procedure.The Grounds of Appeal13 Although not raised as a ground of appeal it was argued before us that the trial miscarried because of the length, lack of clarity and interruptions to the summing up which commenced on Friday, 25 August, 2006 and concluded on Wednesday, 30 August. The trial itself had commenced on 31 July and it had been preceded by a voir dire hearing from 31 October, 2005 to 25 November, 2005. The summing up in fact only proceeded on Friday morning, Monday and Wednesday. The jury went home at lunchtime on Friday and were not in court on Tuesday because one of the jurors was sick.14 The “interruptions” to the summing up were all at scheduled breaks in the trial, at morning tea or lunch or on Friday afternoon or on the Tuesday when one juror was ill. Moreover the “interruptions” were at the instigation of counsel. On the first occasion the counsel for the appellant was seeking a redirection because of the incorrect assertion that the trial judge had placed an onus on the appellant. On the other occasions it was because counsel were seeking more favourable directions.15 The length of the summing up in this case was effectively just over two days and although long, could not be categorised as excessively long in a trial where the evidence had taken four weeks. The “interruptions” did not in my view cause any problem for a jury understanding the directions given. It would be an unfortunate result in the management of jury trials if counsel were able to interrupt the summing up and then rely on those interruptions to maintain the trial miscarried.16 The summing up did instruct the jury as to the relevant legal principles and it did relate the law to the facts of the case. It cannot be said it lacked clarity and in my view this argument put by the appellant fails.Ground 1 “The learned trial judge erred in not excluding DNA evidence relating to the appellant”.17 There can be no doubt that the premises at 58 Moore Street, Leichhardt, were associated with the robbery. The evidence to that effect is overwhelming including a finding of the plan of the premises which were robbed and a finding of a number of distinctive articles including guns and clothing of the same kind used in the robbery. The evidence clearly proves the robbery was planned from those premises and an attempt was made to bring the proceeds of the robbery back to those premises. Any evidence which links the appellant to those premises at the time of the robbery or before or immediately after may therefore be relevant as circumstantial evidence.18 The appellant criticised the directions given by the trial judge as necessarily involving proof by the Crown that the first robber was wearing a dust mask whereas Mr Marlow identified the first robber as wearing a black balaclava. It is submitted the prosecution case was therefore contradictory. In fact what the trial judge directed the jury was that if the jury were to put aside the identification evidence then in order to conclude the appellant was guilty on the other evidence alone, it must be proved that he was present at the robbery and that would involve the finding that the mask was used in the robbery, that it bore his DNA profile and that he came in contact with the mask in the course of the robbery. The prosecution case, however, was not limited to those limited pieces of evidence. The prosecution case relied on all the circumstantial evidence including the identification evidence. The DNA evidence was admissible as a circumstance justifying a finding by the jury that the appellant had contact with that mask being exactly the same kind of mask as worn by one of the robbers at a time prior to the robbery. That was clearly relevant.19 A further criticism was advanced in general terms before this Court about “technical objections” to the DNA evidence and reference was made in passing to submissions by trial counsel on the question of admissibility at the trial. As to general arguments about the fact that only the inner surface of the facemask was analysed, that they were stacked inside one another, that they were sent to the Division of Analytical Laboratories months after the offence, and that the relevant face mask was crumpled, those were matters of fact to be argued before the jury and were appropriate matters for the jury’s determination. As to the passing reference to the objections raised in the trial to the admissibility of the evidence on technical grounds, the trial judge dealt fully with each of those objections. They included an assertion there had been a breach of continuity of the exhibit, the trial judge referred to the evidence of Ms Beilby, that there was no lack of continuity. The tender was also challenged on the basis that the integrity of the exhibit was compromised. The judge considered the evidence of the employees of the Laboratory and accepted their explanation as to any failure to adopt a continuous sequence of numbering. Similarly a submission was made of a compromise in the handling of Exhibit RR tracing the handling by Police officers of particularly No. 20 being the 12 facemasks. The judge accepted the evidence of the Police officers and the Exhibit Book as establishing a chain of continuity. 20 A submission was made at the trial that the judge should exercise a discretion under s137 of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence because it was so compromised that its prejudice outweighed its probative value. The trial judge quite properly rejected that submission. The further submission was made that Inspector McLennan did not enter the items he had received from the DPP in the Exhibit Book at Redfern and secondly, that Detective Henderson failed to fully comply with the recording regulations for exhibits and failed to return the exhibits and record them. The judge accepted some question might arise about the failure of the Police to record items in the book. He noted there was no evidence that the evidence itself was improperly obtained. He rightly concluded that s138 did not apply.Ground 2 “The trial judge erred in not excluding the photo identification evidence of Matthew Marlow”.21 At the trial objection was taken to the tender of this evidence. That objection was based significantly on the fact that the witness had not mentioned a blood spot in the eye of any of the robbers when he made his first statement to the Police. He was cross-examined and said he had tried his best to give a full description of the robbers to the Police and accepted he had not included this feature. The objection was also taken on the basis of the asserted limited opportunity to make a reliable identification bearing in mind the robber was wearing a black balaclava and wraparound sunglasses. The witness could not remember whether the balaclava had one opening for both eyes to look through or two separate openings. The photo identification was done by using a Powerpoint presentation on a computer with four presentations, each containing 20 photographs of men of the approximate age of the robbers. On seeing photograph number 14, which is one of the appellant, the witness said “The eyes look familiar. Definitely the red mark.” He was cross-examined about the dark sunglasses and he said that the glasses slipped down from time to time and he was able to see the eyes of the robber.22 The witness Marlow was in the presence of the robber for a significant period of time. This was the robber who first confronted him and who then asked him to drive the forklift and who was beside him on the forklift and gave him directions as to what to do with it. He had some conversation with the robber about loading the truck. The robbery was committed in daylight and the witness was in a very good position to see the eye of the robber at close quarters. It was a question for the jury as to whether or not his identification of the eye and/or his identification of the appellant was otherwise compromised by his fear.23 There was a further question raised about the Powerpoint presentation because at the relevant time of identifying photo number 14 the equipment malfunctioned and that gave rise to questions as to whether the Police had coached the witness or there was some suspicious circumstance relating to the identification. That was denied by the Police and by the witness and that was also a matter for the jury.24 It was submitted to this Court that the probative value of the evidence was negligible and should have been excluded having regard to the provisions of s137 of the Evidence Act, 1995. In Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at 609 McHugh J said: 
     
      
      “But the weakness of relevant evidence is not a ground for its exclusion. It is only when the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And that evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens a prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.” 
      
    25 In my view the evidence was properly admitted. It was relevant and once admitted it required appropriate directions to the jury and in the subsequent grounds of appeal it is asserted such appropriate directions were not given. The question raised as to the reliability of this evidence was a matter for a jury to assess.26 Before this Court criticism was made of the judge making an assessment of the reliability of the witness in determining the admissibility of the evidence. That is a part of the function that judges may have to perform in considering these questions and there is no validity in those criticisms.Ground 3 “The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury the appellant’s case was that he had not participated in the robbery but that he may have been involved in the planning of it.”27 During the course of the summing up the trial judge did say: 
     
      
      “They say we don’t dispute a robbery occurred. We don’t dispute there were guns. We don’t dispute the goods were taken from the scene of the robbery to 58 Moore Street. We weren’t involved. We did not participate in that robbery, that’s what they say. They don’t say we were not involved in the sense that we didn’t plan it, we didn’t make telephone calls.” 
      
    28 Counsel raised this issue with the trial judge on the basis that the appellant had never raised that issue. The appellant did not give evidence and that issue was never raised on his behalf in cross-examination. As a result the judge further directed the jury when he said: 
     
      
      “Now finally there is one other matter which is somewhat more important and I want you to pay attention to this. I did say, I am informed, that I told you that the accused do not dispute that they were involved in the planning of the robbery. I did say, I am well informed, they did not say to you they did not plan it, they did not say to you they did not plan it. Now I want you to completely ignore that because they have not said anything except that they are not guilty. They have not addressed any planning and you have heard no evidence of any planning and if you came to a conclusion or discussed whether they were involved in the planning you would have no evidence on which to come to that so you would be wrong in law to be going in that direction. What I said was very undisciplined and I take it back and I do not want you to pay any attention to it. Each accused has said nothing except I am not guilty. So there is absolutely no evidence of any planning by either of them. There is no suggestion from any evidence that Coffen or Brilley were involved in the planning and they say they are not guilty as charged.” 
      
    29 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the mistake made by the trial judge was not cured by his further direction and the jury should have been discharged. In R v Yuill (1993) 69 ACrimR 450 at 453 and 454 Kirby ACJ said: 
     
      
      “Courts will assume that jurors properly instructed will accept and conform to the direction of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before them in the Court: see  
      Demirok 
       (1977) 137 CLR 20 at 22. There is an increasing body of judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, views and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled. Judge Herron made observations in this case that such is his conviction and experience. His Honour’s expression of opinion parallels that of many other judges.” 
      
    30 This expression of opinion as to the ability of jurors to accept directions given to them also accords with my experience and it applies not only to cases involving pre-trial publicity but to any matters of significance during the course of the trial. The jury system after all depends on the assumption that jurors do follow the directions they are given. Moreover in this case the jury would be well aware that no suggestion was made during the course of the trial that the appellant might have been involved in the planning but not in the robbery. The judge’s direction would simply have reinforced their own observations.Ground 4 “The trial judge should have discharged the jury and failed to give reasons for not doing so.”31 For the reasons discussed above any error of fact in the summing up was corrected and no basis existed for the judge to discharge the jury.Ground 5 “The trial judge gave erroneous or at least confusing directions regarding the onus of proof.”32 The first complaint is that the judge said to the jury: 
     
      
      “You must examine all the evidence and put it together in a way that either satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that X and Y – Brilley and Coffen – each individually is guilty or in such a way, having put it all together, you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or the other or both is guilty and therefore find them both or one or the other not guilty.” 
      
    33 The submission is made that the use of the phrase “putting it all together” suggests there is a need to have something tangible to support the conclusion particularly the conclusion that the verdict should be not guilty. In my view what the trial judge said amounted to no more than telling them they had to consider all of the evidence. He went on after these remarks to give very clear and strong directions as to the onus of proof and he continued to refer precisely and correctly to the fact that it was for the Crown to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant did not have to prove his innocence. Part way through the summing up counsel for the appellant misquoted the judge as having said “You have to be satisfied they are not guilty” as part of this passage. The judge appears to have accepted that he said that (although he did not) and he then directed the jury again that “The Crown bears the onus and the accused bear no onus so you do not have to be satisfied they are not guilty you understand.”34 The second passage complained of in the summing up is: 
     
      
      “You are presumed to have a really strong community sense of what is right, of what is true, of what is doubtful and you pool that and come up with a just conclusion.” 
      
    35 That statement occurred shortly after the first statement referred to above and immediately before the judge gave very clear and strong directions about the onus of proof. Although this direction is not in the usual terms, it amounted to no more than telling the jury that they should use their accumulated experience and commonsense and no confusion or misdirection resulted from what was said. The submission was made to us that the reaction of counsel to these directions clearly indicated the impact of the continued misdirection. That reaction may well have resulted from the fact that counsel was mistaken as to what the trial judge had said.Ground 6 “The directions given by the learned trial judge on the evidence relating to the finding of DNA matching that of the appellant on exhibits tendered in the prosecution case were erroneous and inadequate.”36 No submissions were made to this Court in support of the contention that these directions were erroneous. The submission made here was that the judge did not adequately assist the jury in its task. Again what that inadequacy is asserted to be was not identified.37 The judge did give directions to the jury about expert evidence generally and he directed the jury about DNA evidence. He also directed the jury about the continuity of the exhibits which had been a matter of contention and he explained the relevance of DNA evidence as part of the circumstantial evidence in this case. I do not believe any further directions were necessary.Ground 7 “The directions given by the learned trial judge on the evidence given by the witness Matthew Marlow and the directions in relation to evidence of identification generally were erroneous and inadequate.”38 The submission was made that because the identification evidence was crucial in the case of the appellant, it was necessary to alert the jury to the general deficiencies of identification evidence and the specific weaknesses in the evidence against the appellant. A broad submission was made here that the summing up did not satisfy these requirements. No specific deficiency is identified. There is no doubt the broad proposal advanced by the appellant is correct; see, for example, Domican v The Queen (1991-1992) 173 CLR 554 and s116 of the Evidence Act, 1995. The judge did direct the jury to consider the identification evidence on its own and to consider both the honesty and reliability of the witness. He directed them that special caution is required because an honest witness may be mistaken. He warned the jury that miscarriages of justice had occurred and that special caution was needed when considering identification evidence. He went on to identify a number of issues which might affect the reliability of identification in this case including the failure by Marlow to mention the red mark on the eye in his first statement to Police, the delay of seven weeks from the robbery to the photo identification, the limited opportunity of Marlow to observe the offender at the scene, the emotionally charged situation of the robbery, the interruption of the video presentation by the Police, the extent of the disguise and the concession by Marlow that he didn’t get much to look at, allegations of bias in relation to Marlow, that Marlow knew people had been arrested at the time of the photo identification and the person identified was a stranger.39 The judge went on to tell the jury if they were not satisfied that the evidence amounted to a positive identification of the appellant but only evidence he resembled the robber, then he explained how that became relevant in the circumstances of the case. In my view the directions given more than adequately alerted the jury to the special need for caution in identification cases and drew their attention to the particular features of this case which required scrutiny.Ground 8 “The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence.”40 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 states that the Court of Criminal Appeal must allow an appeal against conviction if the Court is: 
     
      
      “…of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the grounds that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the Court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. 
      
    The High Court considered the history of this section of the Act in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The majority of the Court in a joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J and Toohey J considered the terms which have been used over the years in setting aside a verdict as unreasonable. These terms include “unjust or unsafe”, “unsafe or unsatisfactory”, or “dangerous or unsafe”, see at page 492. They went on to quote the view of Isaacs J in Hargan v The Queen (1919) 27 CLR 13 at page 23: 
     
      
      “If (the appellant) can show a miscarriage of justice, that is sufficient. That is the greatest innovation made by the Act, and to lose sight of that is to miss the point of the legislative advance.” 
      
    41 They also quoted the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR at page 516 that: 
     
      
      “It is the reasonable doubt in the mind of the court which is the operative factor”. 
      
    42 It was suggested in the majority judgment that some cases had indicated that such broad tests place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury had seen and heard the evidence. In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at page 687 Dawson J said: 
     
      
      “In particular, a court of appeal does not usually have the opportunity to assess the worth of a witness’s evidence by seeing and hearing that evidence given … These considerations point to important differences between the functions of the jury and those of a court of appeal. A jury is able, and is required, to evaluate the evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.” 
      
    43 In M v The Queen Brennan J at page 504 to 505 expressed the view that the test was “…to determine whether a jury, acting reasonably and appreciating the burden and standard of proof, could have convicted on the evidence available to support the conviction.” Applying that test to the facts of that case he concluded the conviction should not be overturned whereas the majority concluded the conviction should be overturned. McHugh J at page 525 came to the conclusion that the appropriate test was “If, after considering the evidence, the court concludes that a reasonable jury must have acquitted, the verdict is unreasonable even though there may be sufficient evidence, in law, to support the verdict.” Applying that test he also concluded the conviction should stand.44 In the majority judgment at page 494 it was said: 
     
      
      “But it is, we think, possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick C.J. and of the qualification suggested. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.” 
      
    45 In the context of an appeal relating to the application of the proviso to the various Criminal Appeal Acts in Australia in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 in a unanimous judgment of six judges, the High Court said at paragraph 39 on page 315: 
     
      
      “Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.” 
      
    And at paragraph 41 on page 316 it was said: 
     
      
      “That task is to be undertaken the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” 
      
    46 In my assessment of the evidence the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence. I note in this case the jury was in a somewhat better position to make an assessment because they were able to assess Mr Marlow in particular as to honesty and reliability and they were in a position to observe the appellant and compare the description of the first robber given by Mr Marlow. The appellant was not brought to Court for the hearing of the appeal.47 The basis for my belief may be stated briefly. Firstly, for the reasons I have given, there is no doubt that the premises at 58 Moore Street, Leichhardt were used for the planning of the robbery and the preparations for it. The robbers clearly intended to bring the stolen vehicle with the mobile phones back to those premises. Secondly, there was significant evidence linking the appellant to those premises. His mother’s car was observed parked in the lane near the premises at the time the robbers brought the truck into the lane after the robbery. That vehicle was still there when the Police arrived and they removed it subsequently. The appellant arrived back at the premises with the co-accused Coffen in a silver Subaru shortly after 10.30 a.m., that being approximately four hours after the robbery. The facemask with the DNA of the appellant was found in a bag next to the blue Subaru in the garage of the premises and the evidence linked that car to the robbery. Other items in the bag matched items worn by the robbers and included distinctive items. Thirdly, the evidence of the witness Marlow relating to the resemblance of the appellant to the robber and in particular his identification of the red spot in the eye of the robber is of significance as resemblance evidence. Allowing for the tension of the situation at the time of the robbery, the witness Marlow was in a good position to observe the blood spot in the eye of the robber. The robber was beside him on the forklift giving him directions and there was some discussion between him and the robber about the loading of the truck. The only part of the robber he could clearly see was his eyes and it might reasonably be expected that in daylight at such close quarters he did notice such a distinctive mark. I am not troubled by his failure to mention this feature to the Police at first. It appears to me reasonable that he was reminded of it when he saw the photograph. The jury obviously assessed him as a reliable witness and I see no reason to view him differently. 48 Accordingly, I would grant an extension of time to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal against the conviction.

     PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY SERVICES OF AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED v CLINTON JOSEPH BRILLEY 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Ipp JA. Subject to what follows concerning the possible criminal responsibility of the appellant, I agree with his Honour’s reasons and with the orders proposed by him. 
     
      
    2 Mr Bingle was the managing director and sole employee of the appellant company, to which, for consistency with the reasons of Ipp JA, I will refer as the defendant. No reference was made by the primary judge to the ownership of the shares in the defendant or to its constitution. It might be assumed that the defendant was a company that could be described as Mr Bingle’s “creature”, but to a degree this would be speculation. No one at the trial seems to have directed any attention to the nature of the defendant and Mr Bingle’s relationship to it, beyond identifying the fact that he was its managing director and sole director and making the assertion (which was admitted) of “vicarious liability”. 
     
      
    3 It may be that, for identified purposes, Mr Bingle can be identified as the “directing mind and will” of the defendant: see Lennard’s Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705 at 713 and Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153; but that proposition may require the purposes of the defendant to be identified. The purposes of a company will, in the first instance, be found in its constitution. By the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), s124, a company has the legal capacity and powers of an individual; though some restriction on the exercise of that capacity can be placed by the company’s constitution: Austin RP and Ramsay IM Ford’s Principles of Corporations Law (LexisNexis Butterworths, 13th ed) [12.130]ff. 
     
      
    4 The liability of a company for any particular breach of the criminal law will depend, in significant part, upon the nature, elements and terms of the offence. To the extent that the offence is created by statute, the process of “attribution” of criminal responsibility will principally be, or be at least based on, statutory interpretation of the provision creating the offence: Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500. In such cases, questions such as the need for a guilty mind or mens rea, the nature of that mental state and the person, agent or organ of the company who must have such state of mind will turn on understanding the words of the statutory provision and the will of Parliament. 
     
      
    5 Here, it may be that there was little complexity about the nature of the offence, or offences, but, as noted by Ipp JA, there was no pleading of any offence and no pleading at all of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), s54(2). Even if the offence or offences was or were easily identified, the primary judge concluded that Mr Bingle (not the defendant) was guilty of it or them. The inadequacies of approaching the matter thus have been dealt with by Ipp JA. The primary judge’s reasons reflect an absence of recognition of the need to attribute the conduct of Mr Bingle to the defendant in terms of criminal responsibility. This was not a matter of vicarious liability; rather, it was assessing from the nature of the offence, whether the conduct of Mr Bingle could be attributed to the defendant. This may or may not be straightforward. As managing director and sole employee, Mr Bingle may be seen as the company and its mind and will. But for what purposes? If, in committing the acts which are impugned as unlawful, he was seeking to perform or execute the defendant’s responsibilities as security guard, there may be no difficulty attributing his acts and his mental state to the defendant, even though they are unlawful: Meridian Global Funds Management and Director of Public Prosecutions v Gomez [1993] AC 442. The proposition that a corporation cannot be criminally liable because criminal acts necessarily go outside the objects (presumed lawful) of a corporation has not been accepted by the courts: Linehan v The Australian Public Service Association (1983) 67 FLR 412 at 435-436 (per Fitzgerald J); see generally Davies PL Gower and Davies’ Principles of Modern Company Law (7th ed) pp171ff. Such a proposition can be seen to rest on what has been said to amount to a fallacy that civil capacity and criminal responsibility are governed by the same considerations: Welsh RS “The Criminal Liability of Corporations” (1946) 62 LQR 345 at 347 citing Professor Winfield in The Law of Tort (3rd ed) pp105-106. Such a proposition is also difficult to sustain in the face of the Corporations Act, ss124 and 125. 
     
      
    6 There may, however, be limits to attributed responsibility. One such limit may be the nature of the offence as one of an intentional act of violence, or deliberate injury. I will return to this question. Assuming the defendant company can be criminally responsible for unlawful intentional infliction of physical harm, if Mr Bingle was not seeking to perform or execute the defendant’s responsibilities to the Club, but had engaged in a violent attack on the plaintiff for reasons other than driving him off as an intruder, it may be that, though the managing director and sole employee of the defendant company, he was no longer acting for it. An easy (and I hasten to add entirely hypothetical) example would be if Mr Bingle proceeded to rob a late night convenience store on his way home from work; or, perhaps closer to these events (though equally hypothetical) if he had caught Mr Brilley in the car and robbed him. The point is that at some point the actions of Mr Bingle may conceivably have ceased to be those of the defendant company. (Compare the notion of scope of authority referred to by Brennan J in Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 74; 178 CLR 477 at 514-515.) If, as the primary judge seems to have thought (and leaving aside for a moment the inadequate reasons), Mr Bingle was not engaged in seeking to defend himself or the property of the Club which the defendant had been retained to guard, and if he was motivated by a “callous intention to cause injury”, a question for investigation would arise whether he was the embodiment of, or to be identified as, or his actions and state of mind attributed to, the defendant company in respect of any such wrongdoing. 
     
      
    7 There is a body of authority supporting the proposition that for a company to be attributed with the intentions of a person for the purposes of criminal responsibility that person must be acting in furtherance of the company’s interests, or at least not against them: Director of Public Prosecutions v Gomez [1993] AC at 464-5, 491-2 and 496-97; Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982) [1984] 1 QB 624; R v Philippou (1989) 89 Cr App R 290; Attorney-General’s Reference (No 1 of 1985) (1985) 41 SASR 147; Durovic v R (1994) 4 Tas R 113; Rowe v Transport Workers Union of Australia (1998) 90 FCR 95; R v Rozeik [1996] 3 All ER 281; Canadian Dredge & Dock Co v R [1985] 1 SCR 662. There is authority to the contrary: R v Roffell [1985] VR 511. 
     
      
    8 Depending upon the issues at any new trial, based on properly formulated pleadings, these questions may need to be investigated and adequately addressed. 
     
      
    9 The above assumes that the defendant company could be found guilty of a crime of intentionally inflicted violence. For there to be utility in any rehearing in the District Court, this question needs to be addressed by reference, at least, to the crimes now identified by the respondent in its written submissions. These crimes were: the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s61 (common assault), s33A (discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm), s93G (causing danger with a firearm) and s93GA(1) (firing at a dwelling house or building with reckless disregard for the safety of any person).  
     
      
    10 There is now authority that a company can be guilty of manslaughter: R v HM Coroner for East Kent; Ex parte Spooner (1989) 88 Cr App R 10; P & O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd (1991) 93 Cr App R 72; Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999) [2000] QB 796; Transco plc v Her Majesty’s Advocate [2005] BCC 296; R v Murray Wright Ltd [1970] NZLR 476; and see generally the cases discussed in Clough J and Mulhern C The Prosecution of Corporations (Oxford University Press 2002) pp169ff. It does not naturally follow, however, from a conclusion that a company may be guilty of homicide based on gross negligence or some cognate culpable behaviour, that it can be guilty of a crime of intentional infliction of violence. It seems to be accepted that some offences by their nature can only be committed by a natural person. Before any consideration of the common law, it is necessary to have regard to relevant statutory provisions. The posited crimes are State crimes. Thus, relevant State legislation must be examined. Ipp JA has referred to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s16 which converts punishment by terms of imprisonment into fines. This provision removes the foundation for the argument that companies cannot be responsible for crimes in respect of which the only punishment is physical punishment of a human, whether by incarceration or otherwise. The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s10(1) is also relevant. It provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Unless a contrary intention appears, a provision of an Act relating to an offence applies to bodies corporate as well as individuals. 
        
       
       
        
       
      On one reading, the wording of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      , s10(1) may be seen to be insufficiently direct to mean that, subject to any contrary intention, any provision the terms of which create an offence applies to bodies corporate as well as individuals. In my view, however, when one looks at the history of the provision, it can be concluded that this meaning is encompassed within the section.  
       
       
       
      
    11 Until 1999, the Crimes Act, s360A(1) provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Every provision of an Act relating to offences punishable upon indictment or upon summary conviction may, unless a contrary intention appears, be construed to apply to bodies corporate as well as to individuals. 
        
       
       
      In 1999, by the  
      Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 
       (NSW), ss4 and 5 and Schedules 2 and 3, s360A was repealed and replaced by inserting a provision into the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      , which was, at first, s59 and later (after renumbering in 2001 by Act No 119 of 2001, Schedule 1[15]) s10. The Explanatory Note to the  
      Crimes Legislation (Sentencing) Bill 1999 
       gave no indication that any change in meaning was intended. In the Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Assembly, the Minister (the Hon R Debus) explained the changes as ones  
      “to rationalise the provisions relating to criminal procedure, to abolish the penalty of ‘penal servitude’, and the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and to make 
       [other consequential amendments]”. 
       
      
    12 In this context, it can be concluded that unless a contrary intention appears, the provisions of the Crimes Act to which I have referred contain offences that can be committed by a body corporate as well as by an individual. This contrary intention might appear from one or both of two related sources: either on the proper construction of the provision having regard to its text, context and history it can be seen as only intended to speak to the criminal responsibility of individuals, or the crime is one that intrinsically is not capable of being committed by a body corporate. 
     
      
    13 The appellant asserted, without elaboration, that a corporation could not form the necessary intent to support any of the above invoked offences. The respondent contested this by referring to the manslaughter cases to which I have referred. That was the extent of the debate. 
     
      
    14 I see nothing in the text or context of the provisions to which I have referred that would raise a contrary intention, other than, possibly, the nature or elements of the crimes and any conclusion therefrom that they are crimes for which it is not possible for a body corporate to be responsible. 
     
      
    15 In the light of the modern cases which have been prepared to hold corporations liable for criminal liability, directly, by the development of the doctrine of identification (Tesco Supermarkets), by attribution based on statutory interpretation (Meridian Global Funds Management) and the extension of corporate criminal responsibility for crimes such as manslaughter, it may be difficult to see why one should find any contrary intention for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act, s10(1) in provisions of the kind discussed in argument here. 
     
      
    16 The categories of offences for which a company cannot be convicted have been significantly confined in the development of the common law since the middle of last century. The old view was that any requirement of a guilty mind or mens rea meant that, generally, a corporation aggregate could not be guilty of a criminal offence: Halsbury’s Laws of England (2nd Ed) Vol 8 p111. The responsibility for crime, it was said, presupposed understanding and an act of will which a corporation could not have: see the discussion in Welsh RS op cit p347 and Edgerton HW “Corporate Criminal Responsibility” (1926-27) 36 Yale LJ 827 at 827-832. On this view, a body corporate could only be guilty of a statutory offence which by its terms made the body corporate criminally responsible for the acts of humans. Three cases in 1944 (two of the English Court of Criminal Appeal) rejected this approach: DPP and Kent & Sussex Contractors Ltd [1944] KB 146 (the provision relevantly being, “with intent to deceive, made use … of a document which was false in a material particular”); R v ICR Haulage Ltd [1944] KB 551 (the offence being common law conspiracy to defraud); and Moore v Bresler Ltd [1944] 2 All ER 515 (the provision relevantly being “with intent to deceive … make use of … any … document which is false in a material particular…”). These cases did not rest on any theory of vicarious responsibility. As explained by Welsh RS op cit at pp347-350, the place of vicarious liability in criminal responsibility was limited to such areas as public nuisance, criminal libel and statutory offences. Certainly in the last category, as made plain in Meridan Global Funds, corporate criminal responsibility depends significantly upon and involves a matter of statutory interpretation; see also R v Birmingham and Gloucester Railway Company (1842) 3 QB 223 and R v Great North of England Railway (1846) 9 QB 315.  
     
      
    17 In R v ICR Haulage, there was a recognition that the requirement of a guilty mind could be attributed to a company. Though Lennard’s Carrying was not referred to by Stable J (giving the judgment of the Court) his reasons reflected (see particularly [1944] KB at 559) the distinction made by Lord Haldane LC in Lennard’s Carrying between the action of a servant or agent and the action of someone who can be identified as the company itself. This distinction also lay at the heart of Lord Caldecote’s reasons in DPP v Kent and Sussex Contractors Ltd [1944] KB at 161 and 155-156. 
     
      
    18 The notion of identification of those persons who will be identified as the company as its directing mind and will was, of course, developed and discussed in Tesco Supermarkets v Nattrass. It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss that decision or the discussion and development of the principles of attribution of human acts and intent in Meridian Global Funds. See generally, Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu; Security Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377. It is sufficient to say that it can be accepted that a company can be convicted of a crime requiring specific or malicious intent. 
     
      
    19 What of a crime of intentional violence? The apparent disapproval of the decision in R v Cory Bros & Co Ltd [1927] 1 KB 810 by the Court in R v IRC Haulage and the cases that permit the conclusion that a company can be guilty of manslaughter enable it to be concluded that a company can be criminally responsible for a crime of violence. Nevertheless, one still needs to ask whether a corporation can be guilty of a crime of intentionally inflicting violence or whether this is such a crime which, of its nature, is only capable of being committed by an individual. Various offences have been so characterised. In R v Birmingham and Gloucester Railway Company (1842) 3 QB at 232, Patteson J referred to felonies or crimes involving personal violence; in  R v Great North of England Railway (1846) 9 QB at 326, Lord Denman CJ referred to treason, felony, offences against the person or for acts of immorality; in South Hetton Coal Co v North-Eastern News Association [1894] 1 QB 133 at 141, Lopes LJ referred to murder, incest, adultery, corruption and assault; in  R v Cory Bros & Co Ltd, Finlay J referred to the felony of manslaughter and misdemeanours involving personal violence. See also to like effect US v Kelso 86 F 304 (1898) and People v Rochester Railway and Light Co 195 NY 102 (1909). 
     
      
    20 The justifications for many of these older statements must now be seen to be removed by the more recent cases to which I have referred. The place of monetary punishment in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s16, the development of the law on the availability of attribution of specific mental state and of acts to the company, and the recognition that bodies corporate can be responsible for at least some crimes involving violence (such as manslaughter) need also to be recognised. 
     
      
    21 The identity of the offences that might be considered, from their very nature, not capable of commission by a company (and thus exhibiting a contrary intention for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act, s10(1)) must now be narrow. Bigamy is often given as the first example : see R v ICR Haulage at 554. This is sometimes said to be so because a company cannot marry someone: Pinto A and Evans M Corporate Criminal Liability (Thomson/Sweet & Maxwell 2003). This reasoning focuses on the inability of the company to do the act in question. This is an unsatisfactory basis for the conclusion. Notions of identification or attribution aside, a company can do no act and thus cannot negligently kill someone, yet it can be guilty of manslaughter. More relevantly, it seems to me, the crime of bigamy can be seen to be one which can only be committed in a personal capacity. The lack of any possibility of commission of the relevant act in a capacity for a company would mean that bigamy could never be attributed to, or the actor be identified with, a company in the relevant sense.22 It is sometimes said that perjury falls into the same category as bigamy. Undoubtedly, a company cannot physically take an oath, but an oath may be taken by someone acting in furtherance of the interests and affairs of a company with a position, and in circumstances, to permit the conclusion that the person acting was acting as the company. In Odyssey Re (London) Limited (formerly Sphere Drake Insurance plc) v OIC Run Off Limited (formerly Orion Insurance Co plc) [2000] EWCA Civ 71 the issue arose whether the perjured evidence of a witness could be attributed to the company and thus to the party to the proceedings. The context was whether the judgment in which the evidence was given could or should be set aside by reason of the fraud of the party, that is the company. In concluding that the evidence was the company’s evidence, Nourse LJ had recourse to the test adopted by Eveleigh J in R v Andrews-Weatherfoil Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 118 at 124: 
     
      
       
        
        It is necessary to establish whether the natural person or persons in question have the status and authority which in law makes their acts in the matter under consideration the acts of the company so that the natural person is to be treated as the company itself. 
        
       
       
      Brooke LJ came to the same conclusion. Buxton LJ disagreed, not with the proposition that the company could be attributed with the lie of the witness, but because on the facts, the witness was not someone whose perjury should be attributed to the company.  
       
      
    23 Sexual offences, such as rape and incest, may be able to be viewed, like bigamy, as crimes which cannot be committed in a capacity furthering the interests of a corporation. But this too is perhaps doubtful as a matter of theory, although, no doubt as a practical matter, it is unlikely that circumstances will arise in which such crimes would be able to be attributed to a company. As Welsh RS op cit at 364 and Winn CRN “The Criminal Responsibility of Corporations” (1927-1929) 3 CLJ 398 at 415 discussed, it would have been conceivable that, for instance, a company having the functions and role of the East India Company with its wide powers and governmental role could be held criminally responsible for acts of this kind. In a modern day setting, one might well be able to envisage a commercial enterprise engaged in organised violent activities which may lead to the same possibility. That one can easily conclude that it is unlikely that circumstances surrounding murder or rape would give rise to questions of attributed criminal responsibility of a company of itself does not lead to the conclusion that this could never be the case. 
     
      
    24 The same is true in relation to a lesser crime of violence. The facts here admit the ready and common sense conclusion that the possible application of some violence was part of the duties and responsibilities of the defendant company. Mr Bingle was (lawfully) armed. I do not see from any aspect of the modern cases any reason why the crimes identified earlier, involving as they do what can be said to be acts of violence, reveal from their very nature a contrary intention to their application to bodies corporate for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act, s10(1). 
     
      
    25 If the Criminal Procedure Act, s10(1) were not to be applicable, my conclusions would be the same in the light of the extended meaning of the word “person” in the Interpretation Act, s21. 
     
      
    26 For these reasons I agree with the conclusion of Ipp JA that the Civil Liability Act, s54(2) could apply to the defendant and thus the matter should be remitted to the District Court for rehearing.  
     
      
    27 BEAZLEY JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Allsop P and Ipp JA. Having regard to the detailed examination of the facts and the law in both judgments, I propose to make brief observations on two matters only. I otherwise agree with the judgment of Ipp JA and with his Honour’s orders. 
     
      
    28 The first matter relates to the question whether Mr Bingle was the directing mind and will of the defendant. Whilst I agree with his Honour’s statement of principle, I do not consider that this Court should reach a conclusion as to whether Mr Bingle was the directing mind and will of the defendant on the occasion of the incident which gave rise to the appellant’s claim. In this regard I agree with the reasons of Allsop P. The issue was not explored at trial and there may be factual considerations that may lead to a contrary conclusion. 
     
      
    29 The second matter relates to s 10(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That provision may also be relevant to the defendant’s liability. However, as Allsop P explains, no contrary intention to the imposition of corporate criminal liability is apparent in respect of the crimes identified as those that might be applicable in this case: see [24] above. 
     
      
    30 IPP JA: 
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s claim 
       
       
      At about 4:00 am on 23 June 2003 the respondent, to whom I shall refer as the plaintiff, broke into and entered the Earlwood Bardwell Park Sports Club. He was in the company of three others. They intended to steal cash from the Club’s gambling room.  
       
      
    31 At the time, David Arthur Bingle, a security guard, was in the Club. He was the managing director and sole employee of the appellant, to which I shall refer as the defendant. Mr Bingle was guarding the premises in the course of his employment with the defendant. 
     
      
    32 Shortly after the plaintiff entered the Club, Mr Bingle fired a Magnum revolver at him and wounded him. Mr Bingle then fired at the plaintiff’s accomplices, who fled. The Magnum carried six bullets. Mr Bingle fired several shots. He did not know how many. 
     
      
    33 On the challenged findings of the trial judge, O’Toole DCJ, Mr Bingle proceeded to point the Magnum at the plaintiff’s head and chest and to press the trigger repeatedly. He was then only a couple of metres away from the plaintiff. The cartridges in the gun were, however, spent. The plaintiff heard repeated clicks, caused by Mr Bingle pressing the trigger over and over again. 
     
      
    34 Mr Bingle attempted to eject the spent cartridges and fumbled in his pockets for bullets. While he was doing this, the plaintiff ran out of the Club and jumped into a car that he and his accomplices had parked in the parking area. As the car drove away, Mr Bingle fired a shot at it and then a further shot that caused the rear window of the vehicle to shatter. Mr Bingle admitted only the latter shot. The car then drove away from the scene.  
     
      
    35 The plaintiff claimed damages for personal injuries from the defendant (and not Mr Bingle personally). He relied on two causes of action, namely, negligence, and/or alternatively “assault and/or battery ... on the part of the defendant through its servants, agents and/or sub-contractors”. 
     
      
    36 O’Toole DCJ dismissed the plaintiff’s claim in negligence and that cause of action played no part in this appeal. Her Honour, however, upheld the cause of action based on assault and battery and awarded the plaintiff damages amounting in total to $185,267. The award of $185,267 included a sum of $60,000 for non-economic loss, $60,000 for aggravated damages and $60,000 for exemplary damages. 
     
      
    37 The bullet that wounded the plaintiff perforated his erector spinae, adjacent to his L3/4 disc, and his anterior left flank. The plaintiff underwent surgery to debride the wound. Later he again had to be treated surgically when septicaemia developed in the wound.  
     
      
    38 The judge found that the plaintiff had “recovered spectacularly” from his physical injuries and his “residual symptoms [were] mild and intermittent”. The plaintiff, in addition to his physical injuries, experienced depression, episodic fear and anxiety from his experience but these gradually decreased. He appears to have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.39 The defendant appeals against her Honour’s judgment. Broadly speaking, the defendant challenges certain crucial factual findings made by the judge, argues that the judge failed properly to consider and apply the provisions of Pt 7 of the Civil Liability Act 2002, failed properly to engage with the defence, and failed to give adequate reasons. 
     
      
      The pleadings 
      
    40 The amended statement of claim alleged that the defendant carried on business as the provider of security services at the Club. This was not disputed. The amended statement of claim alleged, in effect, that Mr Bingle was a servant or agent of the defendant and asserted that, “at all material times the defendant was [vicariously] liable for the actions of [Mr Bingle]”. In response to this allegation, the defendant admitted “it was vicariously liable for same”.41 The amended statement of claim pleaded that Mr Bingle fired a shot that wounded the plaintiff, and this was not in dispute. The amended statement of claim alleged that after that shot, the defendant, in effect through Mr Bingle, “again fired at the plaintiff whilst the plaintiff was standing still with his hands in the air, however the firearm did not discharge”. The amended statement of claim alleged further that the plaintiff ran from the scene and during the course of his escape was shot at several more times, in effect, by Mr Bingle. In addition it was alleged that Mr Bingle fired a bullet through the rear windshield of the vehicle in which the plaintiff was travelling and another bullet which hit the boot of that vehicle. Thus, the amended statement of claim relied on the initial shooting and wounding, attempts to shoot the plaintiff that failed because there were no bullets left in the gun, and two shots that were fired as he was escaping from the scene. The plaintiff alleged that these actions “constituted an assault and/or battery on the plaintiff by the defendant through the actions of its servants, agents and/or sub-contractors”. 
     
      
    42 The defendant denied the plaintiff’s allegations referred to in the previous paragraph. 
     
      
    43 The plaintiff did not attempt to plead the three incidents as separate torts, which they clearly were, as was rightly conceded by Mr Barry QC, who together with Mr Canceri, appeared for the plaintiff. The defendant did not take the point that the three incidents relied on by the plaintiff were three separate torts and that different considerations applied to each, and the trial was run on the basis that it was not necessary to differentiate between them. The judge approached the case in the same way. This has implications with which I deal below. 
     
      
    44 In the defendant’s amended defence the defendant asserted, in the alternative to its denials, that it “specifically relies upon the provisions of s 52 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 as amended.”45 In the further alternative, the defendant alleged: 
     
      
       
        
        (“any injury to the plaintiff) was occasioned at a time when the [p]laintiff was in the process of committing a criminal offence by breaking into and trespassing upon the premises … with intent to rob same. The [d]efendant therefore says that the [p]laintiff should not be entitled to any damages in respect of any injury sustained (if any) and in this respect the [d]efendant relies upon s 54 of the  
        Civil Liability Act 2002 
         as amended.” 
        
       
      
    46 The plaintiff did not file a reply to these defences. 
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s version 
      
    47 The plaintiff testified that, together with three others, he drove to the Club at about 4:00 am on the morning in question with the intention of breaking and entering and stealing money from the poker machines inside. He took with him a crowbar.  
     
      
    48 After the car in which he had travelled to the Club had been parked in the Club’s car park, the plaintiff emerged with a T-shirt around his face to prevent security cameras from detecting his facial features. His accomplices were similarly masked. 
     
      
    49 The plaintiff used the crowbar to open the door to a fire exit, and, in doing so, made a loud noise. Inside the Club the lighting was dim, “not all the lights were active”. The plaintiff took three or four steps into the foyer, turning towards the right so as to enter the gambling room where the poker machines were to be found. He suddenly heard two loud noises, or bangs, and felt that he had been “pushed in the back”. He fell to the ground on his right hand side and landed on his stomach. 
     
      
    50 The plaintiff got to his feet and put his hands in the air. He saw the security guard (Mr Bingle) who was then about two steps in front of him and between him and the front of the main entrance doors. Mr Bingle was standing with his side facing the plaintiff. He was looking out into the car park aiming his gun into that area.  
     
      
    51 The plaintiff had his hands in the air and he yelled out “Don’t shoot, I’m not armed.” Mr Bingle swivelled around so that he faced the plaintiff and pulled the trigger two or three times, but the gun did not fire. The Magnum was pointed directly at the plaintiff’s upper body towards his head and chest. The plaintiff was terrified and thought that he was going to be killed. As Mr Bingle pressed the trigger, the barrel spun and the plaintiff heard the gun clicking. The plaintiff said that when Mr Bingle was looking at him, his eyes were “all glassy and like pins, just like focused”. 
     
      
    52 Mr Bingle opened the gun to reload and the plaintiff fled, yelling, “Why did you have to shoot us?” The plaintiff ran straight past Mr Bingle, and jumped into the car in which two of his accomplices were sitting. He climbed into the driver’s seat and, as the car started to move, he heard another shot. As the car started to accelerate, there was another shot and the back window shattered. The plaintiff managed to get away from the scene, picking up the third accomplice without further incident. 
     
      
    53 The plaintiff said that it would “probably be lucky” if a minute had passed from the time that he entered the Club to the time he left to get to his car. He had no idea where his accomplices were from the time he entered the Club until he saw them again at the car because, as he said, “they were behind me”. He expected his accomplices to come into the Club immediately behind him after he gained entry and as he entered he assumed that they were behind him. 
     
      
       
      Mr Bingle’s version 
       
      
    54 Mr Bingle was a licensed security guard and was licensed to acquire firearms. He said that he started “my company” (the defendant) in about 2000 and acquired two firearms, a Glock automatic and a Magnum revolver. It was a condition of his job at the Club that he carry a firearm and, on the morning in question, he had the Magnum with him.  
     
      
    55 By 2003 the defendant was providing security services at the Club about five nights a week. He, personally, provided those services and commenced duties at 8:00 pm each evening. He would finish at about 7:30 am each morning. The Club had been robbed a number of times and for that reason he carried a duress alarm around his neck. This was a button that when pressed would alert the police who were supposed to respond in two to three minutes. 
     
      
    56 In February 2003, as Mr Bingle was on duty at the Club, he heard a “great big thud”. He turned around and three people wearing masks ran towards him and crash tackled him. He was carrying the Glock but was unable to draw it. The intruders took the gun from him, pointed it at his head and tried to force him to open the office door where all the money was kept. This attempt failed as Mr Bingle did not have the key. The intruders opened the door with a crowbar and sledgehammer. Mr Bingle had pressed the duress alarm and the police arrived after about six minutes. The intruders, by then, “were long gone”. 
     
      
    57 At about 4:00 am on 23 June 2003, Mr Bingle observed a car drive into the Club car park. This was an unusual event at that time of the morning. In addition, as soon as the car entered the car park, it turned off its headlights. Mr Bingle was in the Club bistro when he observed this occurring. The bistro was to the left of the foyer as one came through the entrance doors of the Club. I have already mentioned that the gambling room (where the poker machines were situated) was to the right of the foyer. 
     
      
    58 Mr Bingle crouched down in the bistro so that he would not easily be seen. He said that he was standing in a concealed position because he was afraid. That is why he only showed himself when the intruders came in. He saw someone approach his car in the car park and observed that this person had a mask or something covering his head. He pressed the duress alarm. He heard a noise at the front door and pressed the alarm again. 59 Mr Bingle proceeded to move from the bistro into the foyer and, to his surprise, observed three people inside, not one. He had only expected one. He noticed that, to gain entry, they had opened a fire door. One of the persons had a crowbar.  
     
      
    60 According to Mr Bingle, he said, “Halt. Security”, but “they moved towards me”. He was then standing in the doorway between the bistro and the foyer. He had his gun out. He had taken it out when he heard the door being forced open. 
     
      
    61 The men continued to move towards him and he warned them that he would shoot. Nevertheless, they still moved forward. He then fired one shot that he believed hit one of the men. He turned his attention to the other two who were near the front door. He said that they looked as if they were coming towards him so he tried to shoot them as well. The two men were however, able to leave the foyer without being struck. They were within Mr Bingle’s range of vision for about thirty seconds to one minute. The police arrived after about six minutes. 
     
      
    62 In cross-examination, it was put to Mr Bingle that he shot the plaintiff in the back but he denied this. 
     
      
    63 He had shot so often that he came to a point when, on pulling the trigger, the gun “just clicked”. He tried to reload. He said that he was “very nervous” and he “fumbled around”. He said, “I wanted to get another bullet in the chamber because I was afraid they weren’t finished to attack me”.  
     
      
    64 He said that he succeeded in getting only one bullet into the gun and fired one shot at the car but missed it. 
     
      
    65 He was asked directly in examination in chief why he fired his gun the first time, and he said: “Because they ignored two warnings. And were still advancing towards me”. He said: “I thought I was going to die if they got hold of me”. He insisted that the persons were coming towards him and said: “Otherwise I would not have shot”. 
     
      
    66 Under cross-examination, Mr Bingle agreed that, when the car turned its lights off, it aroused his suspicion. He was asked whether he was waiting “for them to break in”. He replied “I was only expecting one person, then I thought I had a stronger case if he was inside the Club”. He explained that he meant a stronger case “to arrest him”. He said: “Well you can get them with break and enter if they actually come in. You can’t get them with break and enter if they haven’t actually entered the Club”. 
     
      
    67 He was asked why he did not go out to the front door and shine his torch. He replied: “Well that’s what a previous guard did and they kept coming back and robbing the Club”. 
     
      
    68 He was asked: “What about if you switched on the light and shone your torch and presented yourself before they’d entered the Club”? He replied: “They probably would have shot me through the glass door”.  
     
      
    69 The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “ Q. So are you saying that they were carrying firearms? 
         
        A. They may have been. 
         
        Q. You just assumed that didn’t you? 
         
        A. You usually don’t come with nothing.” 
        
       
      
    70 It was put to him that no one else was firing a weapon apart from him, and he replied, “No, but I didn’t know that at the time.” 
     
      
    71 He asserted that he was “scared”. He said that he did not know whether the persons were his assailants from the incident that had occurred some four months before who were returning, but said that it was possible. He did not know who they were because they were disguised. 
     
      
    72 He said that when he started shooting his revolver was fully loaded. By the time the intruders had left the foyer his gun was empty. He again fired his gun outside the Club when he was standing at the bottom of the steps. He denied that he fired more than one shot at the vehicle as it was leaving. 
     
      
    73 It was put to Mr Bingle that he pointed his weapon at the plaintiff and pressed the trigger a number of times but no bullets were discharged. He denied that. He asserted that the plaintiff never had his hands in the air and never said, “Don’t shoot”.74 According to Mr Bingle, had the plaintiff got into the poker machine area - because there was access from that area into the bistro – he could have come around behind him (i.e., Mr Bingle) while the other two men were at the door. Were that to have occurred, Mr Bingle would have had one intruder behind him and two in front of him and he would have been in “more trouble”. He repeated, “If I let him get through [the poker room] there would have been one behind me and two in front of me”. 
     
      
    75 It was put to him that at no stage during the events of the morning of 23 June 2003 did he believe that what he did was necessary in self-defence, but he replied, “It was very necessary”. 
     
      
    76 A statement made by Mr Bingle to the police was put into evidence. The statement is in substance consistent with his oral evidence save that, in it, he did not mention the men coming towards him. In other words, he did not in the statement explain his conduct in shooting at the men by reference to them moving in his direction. 
     
      
    77 The statement contains the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. I heard them breaking in … , I pressed my duress alarm to call for assistance. I did not hear glass being broken, but heard the sound of the door being levered open. I then stepped into the foyer and was surprised to see three people there. 
        
       
       
        
        10. One was on the far side of the reception desk and the other two were just inside the front door. I said, ‘Halt. Security’. Because of the incident back in February, I already assumed that they may have been armed. I fired my gun. I think I fired four shots, but I don’t know. I was in fear of my life”. 
        
       
      
    78 In the statement Mr Bingle described the clothes of the first person he saw and said, “When this one entered, he was one of the two standing just inside the front door”. He described the second person he saw and said, “When I saw this one inside, he was standing on the far side of the reception desk from where I was” (this was the plaintiff). He said the third person “was also standing just inside the doorway when I saw him”. As I have mentioned, Mr Bingle made no reference to the intruders moving after he first saw them (but, of course, they obviously did).  
     
      
       
      
     
     
      
      The application of Pt 7 of the  
      Civil Liability Act 
       
      
    79 It is clear from her reasons that the trial judge assumed that Pt 7 of the Civil Liability Act applied to the plaintiff’s claim. In oral argument, Mr Barry did not submit that her Honour erred in this respect. 
     
      
    80 Section 51(3) of the Civil Liability Act provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “This Part does not apply to civil liability that is excluded from the operation of this part by s 3B.” 
        
       
      
    81 Section 3B(1) provides:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “The provisions of this Act do not apply to or in respect of civil liability (and awards of damages in those proceedings) as follows: 
         
         
        (a) civil liability in respect of intentional act that is done with intent to cause injury or death … - the whole Act except: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) …, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Part 7 (Self-defence and recovery by criminals) in respect of civil liability in respect of an intentional act that is done with intent to cause injury or death.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    82 It is not in dispute that the plaintiff’s conduct in breaking and entering the Club constituted a criminal offence. The defendant had raised Pt 7 as a defence. Section 3B(1)(a)(ii) exempts Pt 7 (in respect of civil liability in respect of an intentional act that is done with intent to cause injury or death) from the exclusionary provisions contained in s 3B(1)(a). Accordingly, her Honour was correct in assuming that Pt 7 applied to the determination of the plaintiff’s claim. 
     
      
       
        
       
      The primary judge’s reasons for regarding Mr Bingle’s evidence as “unreliable” 
      
    83 Under the heading “The Evidence”, O’Toole DCJ said that the plaintiff “was frank with counsel and court”. She said (at [16]):  
     
      
       
        
        “There are material inconsistencies in Mr Bingle’s evidence. There are gross discrepancies between his deposition, his sketch plan, the speculative statement made to police (exhibit 8) and data he recorded haphazardly in exhibit 10. Part of Mr Bingle’s evidence is implausible.  
         
         
        Mr Bingle reacted to cross-examination with inappropriate mirth. His elaborate facial expressions, unnaturally lengthy periods of silence during cross-examination and apparent difficulty reading, with and without his spectacles, conveyed the impression that his eyesight and whatever he remembers of 23 June 2003 are unreliable.”  
        
       
      
    84 There are various difficulties in determining what her Honour meant by the “material inconsistencies in Mr Bingle’s evidence.”  
     
      
    85 The Judge did not identify the “gross discrepancies” to which she referred. Mr Deakin QC, who together with Mr Stockley and Ms Beck appeared for the defendant, drew attention to the following exchange during closing addresses: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her Honour: This man is, on his own description – I think his own statement, which was made after several hours in the police station, I think he said, or a few hours, something to that effect – is materially inconsistent with what he said in oral evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Stockley: Perhaps your Honour ought to direct my attention to the particular inconsistency with which you’re concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour: I infer that his behaviour was furtive. He wanted to catch these people, for what – I mean perhaps he thought he was defending - - ”. 
        
       
      
    86 As Mr Deakin submitted, her Honour indicated neither to counsel appearing for the defendant at the trial (even when specifically asked to identify the inconsistencies she had in mind) nor in her reasons what the material inconsistencies were which led to her view of Mr Bingle’s credibility.  
     
      
    87 Mr Barry submitted that her Honour’s reference to Mr Bingle’s “deposition” was intended by her to mean his oral evidence. I think that explanation is correct. The word is otherwise unintelligible. In my view the only material discrepancy between Mr Bingle’s oral evidence and his police statement is the fact that, in his police statement (as opposed to his oral testimony), he made no reference to being induced to shoot because the men were moving towards him. 
     
      
    88 Mr Bingle’s sketch plan shows him in the bistro. I understood Mr Barry to submit that the sketch plan was inconsistent with the oral evidence because in the oral evidence Mr Bingle said he fired when he was in the foyer but the sketch plan shows that he was in the bistro. In addition, photographs show a bullet hole in the door leading from the bistro to the foyer, leading to the inference that he shot when he was standing in the bistro and not when he was standing in the foyer.  
     
      
    89 In cross-examination Mr Bingle agreed that when he drew the diagram he wanted to indicate to the police the position “of these people” when he started shooting. Nevertheless, it was not put directly to Mr Bingle that he was in the bistro and not in the foyer when he started shooting and the implications of the photographic evidence in this respect were also not put to him. Whether her Honour had these matters in mind is not at all clear because she said nothing about them. 
     
      
    90 It is also an open question, assuming that Mr Bingle’s oral evidence is indeed inconsistent with his sketch, whether these matters amount to a material inconsistency. Were Mr Bingle to have been in the bistro when he shot the plaintiff, he would have been further away from the plaintiff and the other intruders than were he to have been in the foyer. Perhaps it could be said that, for that reason, he should have been less frightened than he was. That is a debatable issue. There might only be a metre or two in any discrepancy that might arise. The discrepancy does not appear to have been debated at trial and was not discussed in her Honour’s reasons. The weight, if any, that her Honour attached to it is unknowable. 
     
      
    91 Mr Barry submitted that the speculative statement Mr Bingle made in his police statement, to which her Honour referred, was his assumption that the men were armed. Of course, that statement is speculative, but the assumption Mr Bingle made is not difficult to understand. How this assumption reflects adversely on Mr Bingle’s evidence is not apparent, nor – again – is the weight, if any, that her Honour attached to it. 
     
      
    92 The data Mr Bingle “recorded haphazardly in exhibit 10” appears to be the dates on which he acquired the Glock and the Magnum respectively. It may be that those dates were incorrect (Mr Bingle’s memory of when he in fact acquired the weapons was uncertain) but this was an entirely irrelevant matter as far as the issues at the trial were concerned. 
     
      
       
      The videotape from the security cameras 
       
      
    93 A security video camera was operating in the Club from the time that the plaintiff entered until the time that he left. According to the videotape evidence, the plaintiff was first observed in the foyer at 4:21:38. At 4:21:55 the videotape showed a figure in a dark top and light trousers (who we were informed was the plaintiff) heading towards the fire exit. It seems that more or less at about 4:21:55 the plaintiff was touching the door of the fire exit. Counsel for the plaintiff at trial suggested that the videotape showed this person at that stage with his hands in the air, but her Honour said “right arm abducted to about 80 degrees, elbow flexed, that’s what I can see”. It was suggested to her Honour that the left arm appeared to be raised as well. The judge replied, “I hear what you say”. 
     
      
    94 There are three relevant features of the videotape evidence. Firstly, the first time the plaintiff was recorded on the camera was at 4:21:38 when he entered the foyer. About 17 seconds later he was shown touching the door of the fire exit. This suggests that over this brief period the shooting leading to the wounding and the episode when Mr Bingle shot the empty gun at the plaintiff, occurred. Secondly, the judge only saw the plaintiff with his right arm raised and not both arms. Thirdly, the camera did not record the plaintiff falling to the floor, wounded, nor did it record the incident alleged by the plaintiff when Mr Bingle was said to have pointed the Magnum at his upper torso and pulled the trigger four times (i.e. when only clicks were heard). 
     
      
    95 The brevity of the period from the time Mr Bingle first saw the plaintiff in the car park until the plaintiff left the foyer emphasises the improbability that Mr Bingle acted in a considered and premeditated way. It is also cogent evidence that Mr Bingle’s conduct was largely instinctive. In addition, the videotape casts doubt on the plaintiff’s allegation that he had both hands in the air.  
     
      
    96 The fact that the videotape does not show Mr Bingle unsuccessfully trying to shoot the plaintiff seems to be of little moment as it is common ground that the plaintiff fell to the floor after he was wounded and the camera did not record that either. I infer that the camera was not able to photograph certain areas of the foyer where some of the relevant events occurred. It may be that the camera was not able to photograph the plaintiff with both his hands in the air. None of these matters was explored in evidence or her Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
       
      Difficulties with the primary judge’s factual findings 
       
      
    97 After referring to the parties respective versions, O’Toole DCJ said (at [21]), “Attributing appropriate weight to vague, conflicting, unsatisfactory and unchallenged evidence, I find the following facts”, and she proceeded to set out the facts she so found.  
     
      
    98 Her Honour did not say in her reasons that she disbelieved all of Mr Bingle’s evidence. It seems from her factual findings that she believed some of it. For example, her Honour accepted Mr Bingle’s evidence as to his conduct before the plaintiff entered the Club and even for part of the time the plaintiff was in the foyer. Furthermore she observed (at [16]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Bingle’s speech impediment reinforces one’s inference from the remainder of the evidence that any warning he gave before shooting Mr Brilley was belated or was ineffectual.” 
        
       
       
      This appears to be an acceptance of Mr Bingle’s evidence that he gave a warning before shooting the plaintiff even though the plaintiff denied that he had been given one. This is not an insignificant finding in Mr Bingle’s favour. The judge accepted that, when Mr Bingle was first able to see into the foyer, he was surprised to find more than one person there. 
      
    99 Accordingly, it cannot be inferred that her Honour regarded all of Mr Bingle’s evidence as vague, or unsatisfactory. As her Honour did not state what particular evidence she regarded as vague, as conflicting, and as unsatisfactory, it is difficult, and at times impossible, to discern from her reasons what evidence the judge regarded as deserving of these epithets. It is also not possible to discern what weight her Honour attributed to any particular piece of evidence that fell within these categories. Accordingly, it is not possible to discern, in any reasonably comprehensible way, all the elements of the reasoning process that led to her Honour finding the facts that she did. 
     
      
    100 O’Toole DCJ’s failure to identify the material inconsistencies she believed to exist, the virtual impossibility of discerning what inconsistencies she had in mind and in understanding why her Honour regarded them as material, and the lack of reasons explaining why parts of Mr Bingle’s evidence were rejected while others were accepted, are basic problems with her Honour’s credibility findings as a whole. 
     
      
    101 Her Honour made no mention of the videotape evidence. I have drawn attention to its relevance. In my view the judge’s omission to refer to it suggests that she did not take it into account. Such an omission would, alone, be a material error in the fact-finding process. 
     
      
     
     
      
    The facts found 
     
      
    102 The judge accepted (at [35]) Mr Bingle’s evidence that he saw the plaintiff’s vehicle enter the car park, and that he took out his gun and crouched on the floor of the bistro to conceal himself. She accepted that Mr Bingle glimpsed a figure with a muffled face peering into his own vehicle. She found Mr Bingle moved towards the entrance of the bistro and stood in the bistro near the entrance to the lobby. Her Honour accepted that Mr Bingle wished to hear the break in without being seen, because he thought there would be a stronger case against them for “break and enter” if they actually came inside. 
     
      
    103 The judge found (at [36]) that, after Mr Bingle heard the noise of the crowbar on the fire exit door, and while he was standing in the bistro near the entrance to the lobby, he held the Magnum in both hands, with the intention of firing it. He shot the plaintiff as the latter was walking across the lobby towards the gambling room. 
     
      
    104 Her Honour found that the following then occurred (at [37]): 
     
      
       
        
         “Mr Bingle stepped into the lobby. He was surprised to see another person/s near the fire exit. Mr Bingle ‘opened fire’ towards the fire door. Mr Brilley’s accomplice/s fled. Mr Brilley stood, raised his hands in the air and yelled: ‘Don’t shoot, I’m not armed’. Mr Bingle turned, pointed the magnum at Mr Brilley’s head and chest and pressed the Magnum’s trigger repeatedly. The Magnum clicked repeatedly. … Mr Brilley seized the opportunity: he ran across the lobby through the fire exit door and down the Club’s front steps ….” 
        
       
      
    105 The judge held (at [38]) that as the plaintiff was driving away he heard a shot. As he started to accelerate there was another shot and the back window of his vehicle shattered. 
     
      
       
      
     
     
      
      The primary judge’s “conclusions” 
       
      
    106 The observations of O’Toole DCJ set out under this heading are contained in her Honour’s reasons under the heading “Conclusions”. 
     
      
    107 After he had to some extent recovered from his injuries, the plaintiff was arrested and charged with aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit the offence of stealing from the Club. He pleaded guilty to the offence. Woods DCJ sentenced him to two and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months for the offence. Her Honour, in commenting on the sentencing remarks of Woods DCJ, said (at [18]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Reliable evidence in Mr Brilley’s civil claim undermines the propositions which his Honour accepted: that Mr Bingle ‘identified himself as security’, that Mr Brilley ‘did not comply with [Mr Bingle’s] direction to surrender’ and that Mr Bingle was justified in discharging the Magnum as Mr Brilley ‘drove off …’ “. 
        
       
      
    108 Her Honour said (at [55]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Cumulatively, Mr Bingle’s intentional actions on 23 June 2003 in wounding Mr Brilley, in attempting to shoot Mr Brilley repeatedly at short range, and in shooting at [the plaintiff’s vehicle], caused Mr Brilley’s serious injuries and the recurrent emotional distress. That conduct, in the course of Mr Bingle’s duties to Presidential Security, was motivated by his callous intention to cause injury. None of Mr Bingle’s actions was in self defence or was in defence of the Club’s property. Mr Bingle behaved with reckless indifference to his own safety, to Mr Brilley’s safety, to the accomplices’ safety and to neighbouring residents’ safety. Mr Bingle’s conduct probably constitutes an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the  
        Civil Liability Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    109 Her Honour proceeded (at [56] - [57]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence persuades me that the circumstances of Mr Brilley’s case are exceptional and that this Court’s failing to award him damages would be harsh and unjust. Therefore it does not seem to me that the  
        Civil Liability Act 
         precludes this Court’s (sic) awarding Mr Brilley damages for non-economic loss. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me the Court should award Mr Brilley aggravated damages for his pain, outrage, acute and recurrent emotional distress caused by Mr Bingle’s arrogant malevolent conduct. The Court should award Mr Brilley exemplary damages to punish, to deter and to convey the Court’s disapproval of Mr Bingle’s callous, deliberate conduct.” 
        
       
       
      Section 54: the elements of self-defence and the onus of proof 
       
      
    110 Section 54 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court is not to award damages in respect of liability to which this Part applies if the court is satisfied that: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the death of, or the injury or damage to, the person that is the subject of the proceedings occurred at the time of, or following, conduct of that person that, on the balance of probabilities, constitutes a serious offence, and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) that conduct contributed materially to the death, injury or damage or to the risk of death, injury or damage. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) This section does not apply to an award of damages against a defendant if the conduct of the defendant that caused the death, injury or damage concerned constitutes an offence (whether or not a serious offence). 
         
         
          
          Note. Sections 52 and 53 can apply to prevent or limit recovery of damages even though the defendant’s conduct constitutes an offence. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) A  
        serious offence 
         is an offence punishable by imprisonment for 6 months or more. 
         
         
        (4) …. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) This section operates whether or not a person whose conduct is alleged to constitute an offence has been, will be or is capable of being proceeded against or convicted of any offence concerned.” 
        
       
      
    111 It was not in dispute that the injuries to the plaintiff occurred at the time of, or following, conduct on his part that constituted a serious offence and that conduct contributed materially to his injuries. Thus the elements of s 54(1) were satisfied.  
     
      
    112 Sub-section (2) of s 54 provides that the section does not apply to an award of damages against a defendant if the conduct of the defendant that caused the injury concerned constitutes an offence (whether or not a serious offence). O’Toole DCJ found (at [55]) that “Mr Bingle’s conduct probably constitutes an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the Civil Liability Act.” Her Honour did not specify which conduct of the defendant (not Mr Bingle) constituted “an offence/s as defined”. She did not identify the “offence/s” concerned. The defendant challenged the findings her Honour so made. 
     
      
    113 As I have mentioned, the plaintiff did not file a reply averring that s 54(2) applied and was an answer to any reliance by the defendant on s 54(1). Proper practice required such a reply. Neverthless, the judge’s findings that none of Mr Bingle’s actions was in self-defence or was in defence of the Club’s property, and that his conduct “probably constitutes an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the Civil Liability Act”, demonstrate that s 54(2) was in issue at the trial. 
     
      
    114 Mr Barry accepted that at trial the plaintiff only contended that Mr Bingle had committed an assault. In the circumstances, it was not open to the primary judge to make findings (which she appears to have done) that Mr Bingle had committed offences other than assault. Her Honour did not find specifically that Mr Bingle had committed a criminal assault. She made findings that he had committed an unidentified number of unidentified offences. 
     
      
    115 Plainly, Mr Bingle’s act of shooting and wounding the plaintiff was capable of constituting the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This offence is defined by 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Whosoever assaults any person, and thereby occasions actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for five years. 
         
        … 
        
       
      
    116 In R v Lynsey [1995] 3 All ER 654 Henry LJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, said (at 656):  
     
      
       
        
        “In the courts, assault has generally become synonymous with battery, that is to say when the word assault was used it normally meant the intentional use of unlawful force to another’s person without his consent used.” 
        
       
      
    117 The only distinction between the offence created by s 59(1) and common assault (which is an offence under s 61) is that under s 59(1) the causing of actual bodily harm is required. Thus, in effect, s 59 is based on the usage recognised in R v Lynsey.  
     
      
    118 According to Brent Fisse, Howards Criminal Law, 5th ed (1990) The Law Book Company, Sydney, 1990 at 138 “[i]t is not easy to find a statement of the common law of assault which is both authoritative and precise”. A neat statement of the elements of the crime, however, can be found in the judgment of Lord Simon in Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan [1976] AC 182. In discussing the nature of crimes of basic intent, his Lordship said at 216 - 217: 
     
      
       
        
        “I take assault as an example of a crime of basic intent where the consequence is very closely connected with the act. The  
        actus reus 
         of assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. The  
        mens rea 
         corresponds exactly. The prosecution must prove that the accused foresaw that his act would probably cause another person to have apprehension of immediate and unlawful violence, or would possibly have that consequence, such being the purpose of the act, or that he was reckless as to whether or not his act caused such apprehension. This foresight (the term of art is 'intention') or recklessness is the  
        mens rea 
         in assault.” 
        
       
      
    119 Thus, the actus reus of common assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence without consent. The mens rea of assault requires either intention or recklessness. The offences under s 59 and s61 of the Crimes Act require no less. 
     
      
    120 In determining whether particular conduct of Mr Bingle (and the defendant) constituted the offence of assault, her Honour was required to consider and determine whether in relation to such conduct, Mr Bingle acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    121 The criminal law defence of self-defence is found in s 418 of the Crimes Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    122 As Howie J, after a careful review of the relevant authorities, explained in R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613, s 418 involves a two-stage inquiry. First, a subjective question is asked: is there a reasonable possibility that the accused believed that his or her conduct was necessary in order to defend himself or herself? The question is subjective because it focuses on what the person claiming self-defence actually perceived. If the answer to the first question is yes then, secondly, an objective question is asked: is there a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he or she perceived them? 
     
      
    123 By s 419 of the Crimes Act, in criminal proceedings the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused person did not carry out the relevant conduct in self-defence. This is part of the “golden thread” which requires the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and it is also a rule that protects the accused person’s right of silence. These considerations do not apply in civil proceedings. I see nothing in the Civil Liability Act that requires these criminal law notions to be applied to the potential riposte afforded by s 54(2) to a plaintiff who is met with an argument based on s 54(1).  
     
      
    124 By s 54(1), a court is “not to award damages” in respect of liability to which Pt 7 applies if the court is satisfied that the injuries to the plaintiff occurred at the time of, or following, conduct that, on the balance of probabilities, constitutes a serious offence on the plaintiff’s part which contributed materially to his or her injuries. Section 54(1) does not concern the liability of the defendant, it is directed against an award of damages, rather than the existence of a liability. It is a section that should be pleaded by the defendant as an answer to the plaintiff’s claim for damages. General principles of statutory construction, and fairness, lead to the conclusion that it is for the defendant to establish the matters in sub-paras (a) and (b) of s 54(1) that, by s 54(1), have to be proved to the satisfaction of the court. The section provides expressly that such proof is to be on a balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    125 Section 54(2) affords a plaintiff an answer to any reliance by a defendant on s 54(1). Save where a defendant raises self-defence as an answer to a plaintiff’s allegation that the relevant conduct of the defendant constitutes an offence, it is for the plaintiff to plead and prove that s 54(2) applies. Although the section makes no express mention of proof on a balance of probabilities, there is nothing to suggest that the usual rule in civil proceedings does not apply; the burden of proof on the plaintiff is on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    126 Where a defendant does raise self-defence to a plaintiff’s contention that the defendant’s conduct constitutes an offence, it is for the defendant to plead and prove that his or her acts, on which the plaintiff relies, were themselves performed in self-defence. The defendant, after all, is far more likely to be better equipped than the plaintiff to prove the elements of self-defence. The onus on the defendant will be on a balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    127 Section 52(2) of the Civil Liability Act is in precisely the same terms as s 418(2) of the Crimes Act. In my view, that has no bearing on the matters relating to burden of proof under the Civil Liability Act to which I have referred under this heading. 
     
      
       
      The primary judge’s treatment of s 54 
       
      
    128 As I have observed, in this case both s 54(1) and s 54(2) were in the ring (reliance on s 54(2) being based on the offence of assault having been committed by Mr Bingle). The primary judge dealt with s 54(2) by making, in essence, five findings. The first was that the “cumulative” effect of Mr Bingle’s “intentional actions” (which were “arrogant[ly] malevolent”) during the three episodes on 23 June 2003 caused the plaintiff’s injuries (including emotional distress). The second was that Mr Bingle’s conduct “was motivated by his callous intention to cause injury”. The third was that none of Mr Bingle’s actions was in self- defence or in defence of the Club’s property. The fourth was that Mr Bingle behaved with reckless indifference to the safety of himself, the plaintiff, the accomplices and neighbouring residents. The fifth was that “Mr Bingle’s conduct probably constitutes an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the Civil Liability Act.” 
     
      
    129 There are a number of serious problems with these findings. 
     
      
    130 As regards the first of these findings, I have earlier pointed out that each of the three incidents constitutes a separate tort. They were each essentially different. The first involved the infliction of a physical injury, the second involved Mr Bingle pointing a gun at the plaintiff’s upper body when he was in the process of confronting him and the third involved Mr Bingle firing two shots at the car in which the plaintiff was escaping. Of course, there must have been a significant cumulative effect on the plaintiff in consequence of each tort. But each tort caused different damage and the damage flowing from each should have been identified and quantified. Moreover, the elements of each tort have to be proved separately, even though in some instances the conduct of Mr Bingle in one or more incidents might bear on his conduct in the others. The impression given by her Honour’s reasons is that she used the cumulative effect of the conduct in each incident to prove that each tort had been committed. This may, in theory, be possible, but it does require the judge to set out details of her reasoning and the matters she has taken into account in regard to each tort so it can be seen that there has been no error. No such details are given in her Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    131 This “cumulative approach” is of particular relevance to the second finding, namely, that Mr Bingle’s conduct was motivated by his “callous intention to cause injury”. While it was plainly open to her Honour to find that Mr Bingle intended to cause injury to the plaintiff in the first two episodes, that is not at all clear as regards the third. 
     
      
    132 But there is more to the finding of callous intention to cause injury than that. This finding must be seen together with the fourth finding that Mr Bingle behaved with reckless indifference to the safety of himself, the plaintiff, the accomplices and neighbouring residents. The primary judge appears to have used these two findings to justify her findings that none of Mr Bingle’s actions was in self-defence or was in defence of the Club’s property and that his conduct probably constituted “an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the Civil Liability Act.” Such an approach reveals a fundamental error. Intent to cause injury does not negate the defence of self-defence. A finding of callous intention to cause injury says nothing about whether, in causing that injury, the defendant acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    133 It is necessary to distinguish the intent or mens rea that forms part of an offence or tort such as assault or battery from the elements of the defence of self-defence that may be raised to such a charge or tort. The intent to cause the assault or battery is the mens rea or tortious intent that is part of the crime or intentional tort sought to be defended. In the case of battery, for example, it is the intent to cause physical contact. Obviously, this intent cannot negate the assertion of self-defence. This is because the defence of self-defence follows a completed crime or tort, meaning one where all the elements, including the necessary mental element, have been made out. 134 This is illustrated by R v Kurtic (1996) 85 A Crim R 57, which concerned the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm under the then s 35 of the Crimes Act. Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Grove J and Barr AJ agreed) said (at 62):  
     
      
       
        
        “(The) issue of self-defence did not arise until the Crown had first established each of the basic ingredients of the crime with which the appellant had been charged, for self-defence must be considered upon the basis that such ingredients have been made out. In determining whether those basic ingredients have been made out, the tribunal of fact is entitled to take into account the evidence which relates to the issue of self-defence, but care must be taken that there is no conflict between those facts accepted for the purpose of determining the latter and those accepted for the purpose of determining the former. 
         
         
        The first of the issues which arose and which had to be determined in the present case was therefore whether the Crown had established that the appellant inflicted the injuries maliciously. S5 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         provides that any act which is done with an intent to injure without lawful excuse or done recklessly or wantonly shall be taken to have been done maliciously. Self- defence has been described as raising a plea by way of justification or excuse, but it seems to me that to introduce the issue of self-defence at the stage of considering whether the basic ingredients of the offence have been made out is productive of confusion and, to some extent, a danger of a circularity in reasoning.” (Footnotes omitted). 
        
       
      
    135 Thus, self-defence and the intent to injure (including a “malicious” intent as it was in R v Kurtic) are not mutually exclusive. As Hunt CJ at CL stated, a consideration of self-defence follows only after the elements of the offence have been satisfied, including the proof of an intention to injure.  
     
      
    136 There are further difficulties with the findings that none of Mr Bingle’s actions was in self-defence or was in defence of the Club’s property and that his conduct probably constituted “an offence/s as defined in s 54 of the Civil Liability Act.” These stem from her Honour’s omission to analyse the elements of the offence of assault and to consider the facts in relation to each of the three episodes so as to determine whether those elements were proved.137 There is nothing in the primary judge’s reasons that indicates that she undertook the two-stage inquiry that, as is explained in R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613, is necessary in determining whether self-defence was established.  Her Honour does not appear to have considered, in regard to any of the episodes, whether Mr Bingle believed that his conduct was necessary in order to defend himself. Nor does she appear to have considered whether there was a reasonable possibility that what Mr Bingle did in relation to each episode was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them to be. In my view, these matters alone require the judgment to be set aside. After all, the defendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s claim was largely based on self-defence. 
     
      
       
      Section 54: Can the defendant be vicariously liable for the criminal assault committed by Mr Bingle? 
       
      
    138 I have pointed out that, in response to the allegation in the amended statement of claim that Mr Bingle was a servant or agent of the defendant and the assertion that, “at all material times the defendant was (vicariously) liable for the actions of [Mr Bingle]”, the defendant admitted that “it was vicariously liable for same”. 
     
      
    139 In his closing address at trial, counsel for the defendant submitted that, despite this admission, were the primary judge to find that Mr Bingle’s actions were not “justifiable” and that “he was not performing acts that he was employed to do”, such conduct on his part “would take him outside the scope of his employment”. In my opinion, this submission, at that particular stage, did not detract from the defendant’s admission in the pleadings. The defendant must be taken to have admitted that it was vicariously responsible for the actions of Mr Bingle on 23 June 2003. 
     
      
    140 The question that then arises (which was addressed neither by counsel at the trial, nor her Honour, and which was for the first time raised on appeal by this Court), is whether the defendant, as a company, could be liable for the offence of assault. In other words, can a corporation commit an assault? If so, was the defendant company liable for the offence of assault on the facts of the case. Once the plaintiff sought to rely on s 54(2), these questions had to be resolved. 
     
      
    141 There are two classes of criminal offence that a company cannot commit. The first class arises by virtue of a company’s status as an unnatural or artificial person. For example, a company cannot commit suicide or bigamy. The second class arises by virtue of the company’s inability to be punished. Thus, a company cannot commit a crime where the only punishment is a term of imprisonment. These matters are discussed in the judgment of Stable J delivered on behalf of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v ICR Haulage Limited [1944] 1 KB 551 at 554: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences for which a limited company cannot be indicted are, it was argued, exceptions to the general rule arising, from the limitations which must inevitably attach to an artificial entity, such as a company. Included in these exceptions are the cases in which, from its very nature, the offence cannot be committed by a corporation, as, for example, perjury, an offence which cannot be vicariously committed, or bigamy, an offence which a limited company, not being a natural person, cannot commit vicariously or otherwise. A further exception, but for a different reason, comprises offences of which murder is an example, where the only punishment the court can impose is corporal, the basis on which this exception rests being that the court will not stultify itself by embarking on a trial in which, if a verdict of [g]uilty is returned, no effective order by way of sentence can be made. In our judgment these contentions of the Crown are substantially sound … .” 
        
       
      
    142 The second class referred to by Stable J has all but been eradicated in Australia following the passage of legislation converting physical sentences and punishments into fines. In NSW, this was achieved by s 16 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: 
     
      
       
        
        16 Fines for bodies corporate for offences punishable by imprisonment only 
         
         
          
          If the penalty that may be imposed (otherwise than under this section) for an offence committed by a body corporate is a sentence of imprisonment only, a court may instead impose a fine not exceeding: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) 2,000 penalty units, in the case of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Land and Environment Court, the Industrial Relations Commission or the District Court, or 
          
         
         
        (b) 100 penalty units, in any other case. 
         
        
       
      
    143 Thus, to use the example of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a company is capable of committing the crime despite punishment under s 59 (and s 61) of the Crimes Act being in the form of imprisonment alone (see, by analogy, P & O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd (1991) 93 Cr App R 72 where Turner J held that a corporation may be found guilty of manslaughter and Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999) [2000] QB 796).  
     
      
    144 The fact that a company is capable of committing a crime and may be indicted for an offence does not, however, mean that the inherent characteristics of an artificial person are not relevant to whether a company may be found guilty of certain offences, particularly those offences of which mens rea is an element.  
     
      
    145 Generally speaking, once a company is capable of committing a particular offence, it may be found guilty of that offence on one of two bases, namely, on the grounds of vicarious responsibility or on the basis that the person who committed the actus reus and had the requisite mens rea was the directing mind and embodiment of the company in the Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153 sense. 
     
      
    146 Whether the company may be found guilty on one or other of these bases depends on the legislation applicable, the nature of the offence in question, and the status and position within the company of the person who performs the acts said to constitute the offence. 
     
      
    147 Generally, a company will not be found guilty, on the basis of vicarious liability, for a criminal offence having mens rea as an element. This is traceable to at least the eighteenth century. In Huggins (1730) 2 Stra 883, Raymond CJ stated at 885: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a point not to be disputed but that in a criminal case the principal is not answerable for the act of his deputy, as he is in civil cases; they must each answer for their own acts, and stand or fall by their own behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    148 As Lord Morris and Lord Diplock explained in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass, the rejection of vicarious liability in the criminal context is based upon a refusal to attach criminal liability to a person absent a guilty mind. Lord Morris said, (at 179): 
     
      
       
        
        “In general, criminal liability only results from personal fault. We do not punish people in criminal courts for the misdeeds of others. The principle of  
        respondeat superior 
         is applicable in our civil courts but not generally in our criminal courts."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Lord Diplock said, (at 199): 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “To constitute a criminal offence, a physical act done by any person must generally be done by him in some reprehensible state of mind. Save in cases of strict liability where a criminal statute, exceptionally, makes the doing of an act a crime irrespective of the state of mind in which it is done, criminal law regards a person as responsible for his own crimes only. It does not recognise the liability of a principal for the criminal acts of his agent: because it does not ascribed to him his agent's state of mind.  
        Qui peccat per alium peccat per se 
         is not a maxim of criminal law."" 
        
       
       
      See, generally, Ford’s Principles of Company Law, 13th ed (2007) Butterworths at para 16.120 and  
      R v Murray Wright Ltd 
       [1970] NZLR 476 (New Zealand Court of Appeal). 
      
    149 I reiterate that, absent a statutory provision to the contrary, vicarious liability has been rejected as a means of establishing mens rea in crimes requiring proof of that element (as otherwise criminal guilt could be found without the offender possessing the necessary intent). 
     
      
    150 The situation is different, however, where mens rea does not form part of the offence. Parliament may create offences of strict or absolute liability, and it has long been accepted that, in such a case, the application of vicarious liability principles is not inhibited.  
     
      
    151 The following statement of Atkin J in Mousell Brothers Ltd v London and North-Western Railway Co (1917) 2 KB 836 at 845 is usually referred to as the leading authority in this area: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think that the authorities cited by my Lord make it plain that while  
        prima facie 
         a principal is not to be made criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, yet the legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such words as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the principal is liable if the act is in fact done by his servants. To ascertain whether a particular Act of Parliament has that effect or not regard must be had to the object of the statute, the words used, the nature of the duty laid down, the person upon whom it is imposed, the person by whom it would in ordinary circumstances be performed, and the person upon whom the penalty is imposed."" 
        
       
      
    152 Mousell Brothers Ltd v London and North-Western Railway Co was applied by the High Court of Australia in The King and The Minister for Customs v Australasian Films and Another (1921) 29 CLR 195. The Court said at 215: 
     
      
       
        
        “We proceed to consider, by applying the tests suggested by Atkin J [in  
        Mousell Brothers Ltd v London and North-Western Railway Co 
        ], whether sec 241 of the  
        Customs Act 
         has the effect of making the principal, if a company, liable for the act of its servant or agent when the person doing the act or some servant or agent of the company from whom he takes his instructions has the intention of defrauding the revenue.” 
        
       
      
    And at 217: 
     
      
       
        
        “Adopting the language of Atkin J quoted above, we think that the principal is liable in any case in which his servant or agent in the course of his employment ‘commits the default provided for in the statute in the state of mind provided for by the statute. Once it is decided that this is one of those cases where a principal may be held liable criminally for the act of his servant, there is no difficulty in holding that a corporation may be the principal. No  
        mens rea 
         being necessary to make the principal liable, a corporation is in exactly the same position as a principal who is not a corporation.’ If the principal is liable for the fraud of the agent actually committing the offence, he is no less liable for the fraud of some superior servant or agent by whose direction the offence is committed, but we see no reason for extending the responsibility of the principal to a case in which it is sought to make the principal responsible for the state of mind or the state of knowledge of some other servant or agent not concerned in the doing of the act.” 
        
       
      
    153 See also Tiger Nominees Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 25 NSWLR 715 where Gleeson CJ (with whom Mahoney JA and Campbell J agreed) said, at 718-719: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a rule the common law refused to impose criminal responsibility on a person, as a principal, for the misdeeds of others. The development and extension of principles imposing vicarious liability in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries reflect, to some extent, difficulties encountered in law enforcement. Principles were abstracted from developments in the law of tort, and this was done most readily when the offences could be characterised as regulatory in substance although criminal in form. Such offences were sometimes characterised as ‘public welfare offences’. Laws relating to fair-trading, consumer protection, and safeguarding the environment provide examples. 
        
       
       
        
        Questions of statutory construction commonly require consideration in this context. The ultimate issue in the present case is whether or not the legislature has, expressly or by necessary implication, created a criminal offence for which one can be found vicariously responsible. 
        
       
       
        
        Whatever may be the outer limits of the principles attracting the imposition of vicarious liability it is necessary that the relevant statutory offence be of such a nature that it is capable of commission vicariously. The operative verb “to pollute”, as defined in s 5, is sufficiently broad to attract vicarious criminal liability, especially having regard to the analogous circumstances where similarly broad language has been used to prohibit other forms of public nuisance or to promote analogous public welfare legislation …”.

       [2003] NSWCCA 31; (2003) 140 A Crim R 25 at [81]-[83] per Sheller JA, Levine J and Smart AJ. 
       
      
    154 Assault is not an offence of strict or absolute liability. Furthermore, there is nothing in ss 59 or 61 of the Crimes Act that indicates that the requisite mens rea for the establishment of those offences can be derived vicariously from a servant or agent of a corporation. It follows that the defendant in this case could not be vicariously criminally liable for an assault committed by Mr Bingle in the course of his employment. 
     
      
    155 The issue whether the defendant was criminally liable for assault because Mr Bingle was its directing mind and physical embodiment was not raised in the pleadings, nor was it dealt with in her Honour’s reasons. It was, however, the subject of the parties’ written submissions and in my view it must be considered in this appeal. It is an obvious issue and it is of fundamental importance. 
     
      
    156 It was common ground that Mr Bingle was the managing director and sole employee of the defendant. He referred in evidence to the defendant as “my company”. On the recognised tests, Mr Bingle was the directing mind and embodiment of the defendant. In view of this conclusion it is not necessary to deal with the submission in the plaintiff’s supplementary written submissions, filed after oral argument on appeal had concluded, that the trial was conducted on the basis that a company could be liable for the offence of assault.157 Once it is accepted that Mr Bingle was the directing mind and embodiment of the defendant, his conduct and his state of mind were capable of being attributed to the defendant, provided of course that his relevant acts were performed on the defendant’s behalf. I have mentioned that the defendant admitted in the pleadings that it was vicariously liable for the acts of Mr Bringle on the morning in question. I think inherent in that admission are the further admissions that Mr Bingle’s acts were performed in the interests of the defendant, were its acts, and Mr Bingle performed those acts when acting as the directing mind and embodiment of the defendant. 
     
      
    158 Accordingly I would accept that the primary judge correctly attributed Mr Bingle’s conduct and state of mind during each of the three episodes on 23 June 2003 to the defendant. That being so, it is unnecessary for me to deal with s 10(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act (NSW) to which Allsop P refers. 
     
      
    159 During argument on appeal, there was some discussion as to the meaning of s 54(5). For the sake of convenience I repeat that this section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “This section operates whether or not a person whose conduct is alleged to constitute an offence has been, will be or is capable of being proceeded against or convicted of any offence concerned.” 
        
       
      
    160 Once it is accepted that her Honour correctly attributed Mr Bingle’s conduct and state of mind on 23 June 2003 to the defendant, it is unnecessary to consider the meaning and effect of s 54(5). The situation is that the defendant was capable of being found guilty of the offence of assault by reason of the fact that Mr Bingle’s acts were its acts.  
     
      
       
      Section 52  
       
      
    161 Section 52 of the Civil Liability Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “52 No civil liability for acts in self-defence 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person does not incur a liability to which this Part applies arising from any conduct of the person carried out in self-defence, but only if the conduct to which the person was responding:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) was unlawful, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) would have been unlawful if the other person carrying out the conduct to which the person responds had not been suffering from a mental illness at the time of the conduct. 
          
         
         
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) … “. 
        
       
      
    162 In my view, the onus is on the defendant to prove absence of liability on the grounds of self-defence (on his or her part) as set out in s 52. I come to this conclusion for similar reasons as those I gave when expressing the view, in relation to s 54, that the onus lies on a defendant to prove that, because his or her acts constitute self-defence, the plaintiff cannot rely on s 54(2). I appreciate that s 52(1) provides for the circumstances under which a “person does not incur a liability”, whereas s 54(1) provides for circumstances under which a “court is not to award damages in respect of liability”. In my view, however, this difference does not outweigh the other considerations to which I referred when dealing with the onus of proof applicable in regard to s 54. 
     
      
    163 The difficulties that arise in regard to the judge’s findings in connection with the elements of self-defence in relation to the defendant’s reliance on s 54 apply equally in regard to the defendant’s case based on s 52. 
     
      
       
      Section 53 
       
      
    164 Section 53 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If section 52 would operate to prevent a person incurring a liability to which this Part applies in respect of any conduct but for the fact that the conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceived them, a court is nevertheless not to award damages against the person in respect of the conduct unless the court is satisfied that: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) the circumstances of the case are exceptional, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) in the circumstances of the case, a failure to award damages would be harsh and unjust. 
          
         
        
        
        (2) If the court determines to award damages on the basis of subsection (1), the following limitations apply to that award: 
         
         
          
          (a) Part 2 (with the exception of Division 3 of that Part) applies with respect to the award of damages despite section 3B (1) (a), and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) no damages may be awarded for non-economic loss. 
          
         
        
       
      
    165 The defendant did not plead s 53, but her Honour obviously had it in mind when she concluded (at [56]), “the evidence persuades me that the circumstances of Mr Brilley’s case are exceptional and that this Court’s failing to award him damages would be harsh and unjust”. 
     
      
    166 Her Honour made no findings as to the particular circumstances of the plaintiff’s case which led her to this conclusion, she did not state the grounds on which she considered the circumstances were exceptional and she neither identified the evidence nor explained the grounds which led her to the conclusion that a failure to award the plaintiff damages would be harsh and unjust. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    167 To summarise: 
     
      
       
      (a) There are serious problems with certain of the primary judge’s factual findings. I have set out the factual findings concerned and the difficulties with them in the section headed “Difficulties with the primary judge’s factual findings”. 
       
       
      (b) The judge did not adequately engage with the defendant’s reliance on s54 and the contention that Mr Bingle acted in self-defence. I have set out the problems with her Honour’s findings in this respect in the section headed “The primary judge’s treatment of s 54”. I have explained that similar problems arise in connection with her Honour’s findings in regard to the defendant’s defence based on s 52. 
       
       
      (c) I have referred to the absence of relevant findings concerning her Honour’s treatment of the issues raised by s 53. 
      
    168 In my opinion, the problems I have identified with her Honour’s factual findings are so material that they cannot stand. 
     
      
    169 Further, her Honour’s omission to engage with the case presented by the defendant has worked a miscarriage of justice, has produced a mistrial and is reviewable on appeal (to paraphrase Samuels JA in Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725 at 728; see also Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council (2007) NSWCA 5 at [40]). 
     
      
    170 Senior Counsel for both parties requested this Court (in the event of the appeal succeeding) to attempt to arrive at a final result itself. After giving these submissions serious consideration, I regret that I do not think that justice could be done without full and clear factual findings by a trial court, including, amongst other things, findings relating to whether Mr Bingle acted in self-defence in regard to each of the three episodes in question (bearing in mind all the elements involved). 
     
      
    171 I have mentioned that there was an issue between the parties as to whether the defendant had admitted in its defence that it was vicariously liable for the acts of Mr Bingle. I have held in favour of the plaintiff on this issue by reference to the words used in the pleadings. It may well be, however, as I think Mr Deakin implied, that the defendant did not subjectively intend to make that admission on the basis of the plaintiff’s version. It is possible that the defendant might wish to apply to withdraw that admission in relation at least to the third episode and, perhaps, in regard to the second. This would be a matter for the judge hearing such an application, were one to be made. 
     
      
       
       
       
      
    172 I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
      (a) The appeal is upheld; 
       
       
      (b) The judgment and orders of O’Toole DCJ are set aside; 
       
      
     (c) The matter is remitted to the District Court for rehearing; (d) The plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs of the appeal; 
     
      
      (e) The plaintiff to have a certificate under the  
      Suitors Fund Act 
       if otherwise entitled; 
       
       
      (f) The costs of the trial to be determined by the judge hearing the retrial.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried and convicted by a jury of two counts as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: On or about 29 April 2005 at Baulkham Hills in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with LAA without her consent, knowing she was not consenting. 
       
       
      This count alleged a contravention of s 61 
      I  
      of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 14 years. A standard non-parole period of 7 years is provided by Item 7 of the Table in Division 1A of Part 4 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999. 
       
       
      Count 2: On 30 April 2005 at Baulkham Hills in the State of New South Wales, did assault LAA. 
       
       
      This count alleged a contravention of s 61 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 2 years.  
       
      
    2 The appellant was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment: 
     
      
       
      In respect of count 1: to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 14 March 2008 and expire on 13 March 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years to commence on 14 March 2011 and expire on 13 March 2013. 
       
       
      In respect of count 2: to a non-parole period of 6 months to commence on 14 September 2007 and expire on 13 March 2008 with a balance of term of 9 months to commence on 14 March 2008 and expire on 13 December 2008. 
       
       
      Accordingly, the aggregate non-parole period imposed was 3 years and 6 months with an aggregate balance of term of 2 years.  
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    3 The appellant filed four grounds of appeal against his conviction. They read as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in law by holding that he was “satisfied” within the meaning of s 294B(6) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act  
      1986 that the complainant was “entitled” to give her evidence pursuant to the provisions of s 294B(3) of the Act. 
       
       
      Ground 2: The trial judge erred in law by declining to give a specific circumstantial evidence direction to the jury concerning the expert medical evidence given in the trial by Doctors Brennan and Sharp relevant to the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. 
       
       
      Ground 3: That in all the circumstances the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable within the meaning of s 6 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912. 
       
       
      Ground 4: That in all the circumstances there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of a post trial pleading by the complainant contained in para 22.3 of her Statement of Claim dated 31 January 2008 alleging the complainant was the driver of the car on 29 April 2005 from Bega to Sydney and was assaulted by the appellant “by driving his fingernails into her neck and then grabbing her hair at the back and pushing her face into the steering wheel of the car.” 
       
      
    4 In relation to ground 4 the appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence on the appeal. 
     
      
    5 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. I shall deal with that matter separately. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 Both the appellant and the complainant are originally from Sri Lanka. The complainant came to Australia in 1989. She attended schooling in NSW and gained post school qualifications at Melbourne TAFE in the area of accountancy. In 1999 she commenced living with the appellant in Melbourne. During this period the appellant was employed as a doctor. There was one child of the relationship, a son, who was born on 25 January 2004. 
     
      
    7 The events the subject of the charges were alleged to have taken place on the evening of 29 April 2005 with the assault allegedly occurring the following morning. By this time the relationship between the appellant and the complainant was troubled. The complainant alleged that the appellant had become abusive and violent towards her. 
     
      
    8 The complainant said that on the evening of 29 April 2005 the family had returned after a short stay in Bega. The complainant was readying herself and her son for bed. The son, aged 15 months, was still being breast fed and slept in a cot on the left side of the couple’s bed. As the complainant was lying on the bed breast feeding her son the appellant lay down beside her and started pulling up her nightie. He was wearing a sarong. The complainant was not wearing underwear. The complainant said “No” and she pulled her nightie down. At this time the child started crying so the complainant got to her knees and tried to calm him. The appellant then demanded the complainant find a bottle of sorbolene. It was not immediately located and the complainant went into another room to look for it but it could not be found. She returned to the bedroom and located the sorbolene under the bed. 
     
      
    9 The complainant gave evidence that she had hoped the appellant would use the sorbolene to masturbate himself rather than seek to have sexual intercourse with her. There was a contradiction between the evidence she gave at the committal hearing and the evidence she gave at the trial. At the committal hearing the complainant said that the sorbolene was located in another room. At the trial she said she did not recall giving this evidence and maintained that it was found under the bed. After returning to the bed the complainant returned to her position on her knees and was crawling towards her son to pick him up as she prepared to leave the bedroom with him. He was still crying. 
     
      
    10 While she was still kneeling the appellant came behind the complainant and held her leg. He then forced his penis into her anus. She did not consent to the intercourse. She said it was very painful and she felt that her anus had been ripped. Although she screamed “No” the appellant continued. After he ejaculated she went to the bathroom and spent half an hour in the shower. She said she was bleeding from the anus at this time and also saw semen. She then returned to the bed where she slept next to the appellant. 
     
      
    11 The next day the complainant was still suffering from discomfort from the sexual encounter the previous evening. She gave evidence that she avoided the appellant until sometime between 9.30 and 10.00 am when she was confronted by him on the upper floor of their duplex. The appellant was now demanding that she hand over her passport so that he could open a bank account in her name. When the complainant did not hand over her passport the appellant began screaming and yelling. He then started hitting her head into a doorframe. The Crown alleged that the appellant did this in a way that did not leave injuries by only striking the crown of her head on the doorframe and not her face. After hitting her head about three times the complainant fell to the floor. Shortly afterwards she went down the stairs carrying her son. As she did this the appellant grabbed her hair and pushed and pulled her so that she fell on the stairs landing on her bottom. The appellant then pushed her into a lounge in the lounge room and began striking her. She was holding her son on her lap. He again avoided striking her on the face but struck her on the head above the hairline using the bottom portion of his hand. The striking went on for some time with the appellant yelling at the complainant. When she began screaming for help the appellant placed a pillow over her face. This happened on three occasions causing her difficulty in breathing. 
     
      
    12 The appellant stopped his assault and told the complainant to get their son a bottle of milk. The complainant then picked up the child and her handbag and ran out of the house. She went to a neighbour’s house and rang 000. The police and an ambulance arrived at the scene.  
     
      
    13 The constable who gave evidence described the complainant as being very upset, crying and shaking at times. He could not see any injuries on her. He took a three page statement from her in his police notebook which the complainant signed. The complainant told Constable Chaplin that she had been assaulted, that her partner had got angry and grabbed her by the back of her head and slammed her head against a door frame. The complainant did not make any complaint to Constable Chaplin about being sexually assaulted. She was taken by ambulance to Westmead Hospital. 
     
      
    14 At the hospital the complainant spoke to a doctor about the sexual assault. She was released from the hospital that day but was given a referral to the Sexual Assault Unit at Liverpool Hospital. On this night the complainant went to live at a women’s refuge. 
     
      
    15 On the evening of 2 May 2005 she attended Liverpool Hospital and was examined by Dr Patricia Brennan. At that time Dr Brennan found approximately 17 skin breaks or lacerations in the area of the complainant’s anus. This included two breaks, which could be fissures, at 5 and 7 o’clock on the anal verge. Dr Brennan’s conclusion was that the injuries were consistent with the allegations made by the complainant. She took a history from the complainant and wrote it in the protocol provided by the Health Department. She recorded the complainant as saying the appellant “forced his penis into my anus repeatedly. I hate it. It feels like he’s putting a broom up me. I screamed but he kept on doing it. My anus was bleeding when he finished and is still bleeding now.” 
     
      
    16 Dr Brennan examined the complainant’s head and neck and noted a crescent shaped scab measuring 0.5 cm on the mid upper neck below the angle of the mandible surrounded by a small blue/yellow bruise. There was an old scar on her left shoulder blade that the complainant claimed was caused by previous violent acts of the appellant. There were bruises on her thighs and her left hand was injured; there were deep blue bruises of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. There was deep bruising to one of her hands. 
     
      
    17 The complainant gave evidence of the history of an abusive physical relationship. Amongst other matters she said that she was assaulted by the appellant on 25 January 2005, her son’s first birthday, after which she rang 000. On the recording of that conversation the complainant is heard to say that she had a fall after which she said “don’t worry” and that she would go to her local doctor. At that point the phone call ended. She said in evidence that the appellant had entered the room and had hung up the phone. The complainant did not have a local doctor because the appellant is a qualified medical practitioner. 
     
      
    18 Of significance to this appeal is evidence which the complainant gave of an incident when they were driving back from Bega on 29 April 2005. She said that the appellant was driving the car when they had an argument during which the appellant accused the complainant of hiding her passport. She said that the appellant kept putting his fingernails into her neck which caused her pain. She said he also grabbed her at the back of her head and pushed her head towards the dashboard of the car. She said she kept putting her hand in front of her head to stop it from hitting the dash. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
      
    19 The appellant’s case was that he had been in a happy relationship with the complainant which was confirmed by family photographs. However, the relationship changed when he said the complainant became angry because she suspected the appellant was having an affair with a female doctor in Melbourne. He said that the allegations of assault and sexual assault were fabricated after they had separated. The appellant’s sister Dammica Ford gave evidence in which she said that the complainant had said she would destroy the appellant and make him a beggar. Ms Ford said she tried to persuade the complainant not to do anything silly but the complainant was apparently intent on destroying the appellant because if she could not have him, no one else could. 
     
      
    20 When the complainant was cross-examined it was suggested to her that anal sex was a normal part of her and the appellant’s sex life and that the events of 29 April 2005 were consensual. It was suggested to her that she had initiated the anal sex with the appellant and using his hands, had held her buttocks apart. 
     
      
    21 Dr Philip Sharp was called by the appellant. He was of the opinion that the skin marks in the complainant’s anal area may have been caused by fingernails and were not from a blunt object like an erect penis. He identified two to three curved markings consistent with fingernails. He was also of the opinion that there were four breaks on the anal verge. His opinion was that the photographs contained evidence of eight skin breaks radiating from the anus. 
     
      
    22 Dr Sharp did not examine the complainant but relied upon an examination of photographs tendered in the Crown case. He was asked about the appellant’s version as put to the complainant, being of consensual anal intercourse with the penis in the anus and the complainant’s fingers also present. Dr Sharp agreed this would be an unusual presentation. However, Dr Sharp was of the view that anal intercourse does not normally lead to injury and accordingly the complainant’s injuries must have been caused in some other way. He did not agree with Dr Brennan’s opinion that the likely cause of the injuries was a forceful penile penetration in the area of the anus. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    23 In this ground of appeal the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by holding that he was satisfied within the meaning of s 294B(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that the complainant was “entitled” to give her evidence pursuant to the provisions of the Act. 
     
      
    24 At the relevant time (the Act has since been amended) s 294B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Giving of evidence by complainant in prescribed sexual offence proceedings—alternative arrangements 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to evidence given in proceedings (including a new trial) in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section does not apply to or in respect of the giving of evidence by a child if Part 4 of the  
        Evidence (Children) Act  
        1997 applies to the giving of that evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A complainant who gives evidence to which this section applies is entitled (but may choose not):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to give that evidence from a place other than the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television facilities or other technology that enables communication between that place and the courtroom, or 
           
          (b) to give that evidence by use of alternative arrangements made to restrict contact (including visual contact) between the complainant and the accused person or any other person or persons in the courtroom, including the following:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) use of screens, 
           
            
            (ii) planned seating arrangements for people who have an interest in the proceedings (including the level at which they are seated and the people in the complainant’s line of vision). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) If, to enable evidence to be given as referred to in subsection (3), the court considers it appropriate to do so, the court may adjourn the proceeding or any part of the proceeding from the courtroom to another court or place. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Despite subsection (3) (a), a complainant must not give evidence as referred to in that paragraph if a court, on its own initiative or on application by a party to the proceeding, orders that such means not be used. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) A court may make an order under subsection (5) only if it is satisfied that there are special reasons, in the interests of justice, for the complainant’s evidence not to be given by such means. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) In any proceedings in which evidence is given as referred to in subsection (3), the judge must:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure for complainants’ evidence in such cases to be given by those means or use of those arrangements, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because it is given by those means or by use of those arrangements. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (8) Any place outside the courtroom from which a complainant gives evidence under this section is taken to be part of the courtroom in which the proceeding is being held. 
        
       
       
        
        (9) If a complainant gives evidence as referred to in subsection (3) in a place other than a courtroom, the court may order that a court officer be present at that place. 
        
       
       
        
        (10) This section extends to evidence given in proceedings instituted before the commencement of this section, including a new trial that was ordered to take place before that commencement and proceedings that have been partly heard. 
        
       
       
        
        (11) (Repealed)” 
        
       
      
    25 Count 1 on the indictment is a “prescribed sexual offence” within the meaning of the definition of that term provided in s 3 of the Act. Accordingly, s 294B applied. That section creates a statutory entitlement in a complainant to prescribed sexual assault proceedings to chose to give evidence by various prescribed means including, as occurred in the present trial, by closed-circuit-television.  
     
      
    26 That statutory entitlement may only be removed by the exercise by the trial judge of the discretion provided by s 294B(5). An application pursuant to the subsection was made on behalf of the appellant at the trial but refused. 
     
      
    27 The parties are agreed (there is no transcript available) that when announcing his ruling, his Honour said “I don’t regard myself as being satisfied there are special reasons, in the interests of justice, for the complainant’s evidence not to be given by such means.” That finding was in conformity with the section. 
     
      
    28 The appellant contended before this Court that the ruling which his Honour made was not open. It was submitted that having regard to the allegation of a relationship of continuing violence and the fact that the complainant had given evidence previously in court the application which he made should have been granted. It was submitted that, by the complainant giving her evidence from a remote location, the jury would inevitably form the impression that the appellant was a violent person which would prejudice his prospects of acquittal. 
     
      
    29 The submission which the appellant made could of course be made in any case where there is an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent in a relationship of ongoing violence. There are many cases of this character. It was because of the personal trauma likely to be experienced by a complainant when giving evidence that s 294B was enacted. If the submission was accepted a substantial purpose of the legislative provision would be defeated. It may be that in an unusual case a submission in these terms may be accepted by a trial judge. However, the discretion is to be exercised in the individual circumstances of each case. 
     
      
    30 I am satisfied that in the present case the ruling which his Honour made was correct. Although the allegation against the appellant involved non-consensual sex and assault there was nothing in the circumstances which could have justified “special reasons” within the meaning of the section. No relevant error has been demonstrated (see House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505). 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    31 In my opinion this ground of appeal is misconceived. Both the doctors gave evidence as to their observations. Dr Brennan who practiced as a Staff Specialist in Forensic Medicine in the Emergency Department of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and who was the Medical Director of four sexual assault clinics in the South-West Area Health Service has very considerable experience in the examination and assessment of the anatomy of victims of sexual assault. She was well qualified to express opinions in relation to the injuries observed in the perianal and anal areas of the complainant. 
     
      
    32 Dr Sharp was confined to an examination of magnified photographs of the injuries. Although it was open to the jury to accept the opinion of Dr Sharp, this was a matter for the jury. It could, as it must have done, accept the evidence of Dr Brennan that the injuries were consistent with non-consensual penile-anal intercourse and accordingly consistent with the account of the events given by the complainant. 
     
      
    33 This was not a Crown case based solely or even in large part on circumstantial evidence. The Crown case relied upon the evidence of the complainant to establish the essential ingredients of the first count. The evidence of Dr Brennan was called by the Crown to establish that there was expert opinion that the injuries observed on the complainant’s perianal and anal structures were consistent with her allegations. However, Dr Brennan’s evidence alone could not have established the Crown case which was dependent upon the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    34 In these circumstances the appellant’s submission that “the jury could only convict the appellant of the first count if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt [that] there was no other reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence of Dr Brennan other than the act of intercourse was non-consensual” is not correct. There were a number of possible expert interpretations of the injuries, some, as the evidence of Dr Brennan indicates, being consistent with the appellant’s guilt. Dr Sharp was of the opinion that some of the injuries were likely to have been caused by the accidental infliction by either the complainant or the appellant of fingernail scratches to her anal region. Although Dr Brennan said this was possible she believed it was “an unlikely possibility.” 
     
      
    35 In these circumstances the jury was required to consider the expert evidence and determine whether it had the consequence of undermining the reliability of the complainant. If, after considering the evidence of the experts, in particular the evidence of Dr Sharp, the jury believed that there was a reasonable alternative explanation for the identified injuries leaving a reasonable doubt that the injuries may have been inflicted as alleged by the complainant, then the Crown would not have established the sexual assault charge. 
     
      
    36 The appellant further submitted that “the jury could only convict the appellant if they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt [that] the complainant’s ano-genital injuries were caused by blunt force friction as not only a rational inference but the only rational inference indicative of non-consensual sexual intercourse”. The appellant referred to Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 and R v Taouk [2005] NSWCCA 155; (2005) 154 A Crim R 69 in support of this submission. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion this submission must also be rejected. 
     
      
    38 The Crown case in Plomp was entirely circumstantial and accordingly the inference of guilt was to be drawn from all of the relevant circumstances. In Taouk the Crown case, apart from some disputed elements of no materiality, was also entirely circumstantial. 
     
      
    39 Both cases are quite different to the present. The present case was not circumstantial and a direction necessary in such a case was not required. 
     
      
    40 The directions given by the trial judge included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of Dr Sharp serves three purposes in the defence case to the sexual intercourse charge. Firstly it seeks to undermine, indeed overturn the evidence of Dr Brennan and thereby weaken the prosecution case. Secondly the defence argued that the evidence of Dr Sharp provides an explanation for the injuries sustained by the complainant inconsistent with her account thereby undermining her credibility. If you were to find she was dishonest or inaccurate in her account of how this happened, you could not then be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused on the sexual assault case. 
        
       
       
        
        Finally the evidence of Dr Sharp, says the defence, creates a reasonable possibility that the injuries to the anal and perianal area did not occur in a way that the complainant’s evidence can account for and thereby creates a reasonable possibility the injuries she received occurred in consensual sexual activity. So that is the use it seeks to make of Dr Sharp’s evidence. I went through that evidence in detail earlier. I do not intend to repeat it. Clearly you would associate it with the defence case.” 
        
       
      
    41 Having earlier directed the jury that the Crown case could not succeed “unless you are prepared to accept evidence coming from the complainant which proves the basic or fundamental elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.” His Honour later said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do remind you at the outset that although there is no direct evidence which contradicts or competes with the complainant’s evidence, bearing in mind that her evidence has been challenged, and seriously challenged, in cross-examination, before you can be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the crown has proved either of the two charges, that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent or that the accused assaulted the complainant the following day, you will have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence on the essential propositions contained in the indictment is not only honest, but is also accurate.” 
        
       
      
    42 When summarising the directions in relation to the expert evidence the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The final direction I want to give you on expert evidence is this, when taken in conjunction with all of the other evidence in this case that you have accepted, if you think, having considered Dr Sharp’s evidence carefully, that there is a reasonable possibility that the complainant’s injuries were sustained as Dr Sharp has said, that is by fingernails, then you should proceed on that basis. In other words, if the expert opinion of Dr Sharp leaves open the reasonable possibility that the complainant was injured by the accused’s hands gripping the complainant during sexual connection, you would acquit the accused because the Crown would have failed to prove the guilt of the accused in that the explanation it gives for the injuries does not account for fingernails.” 
        
       
      
    43 In my opinion no other direction was required. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 4 
       
      
    44 The appellant submitted that the verdicts of guilty on both counts on the indictment were in all the circumstances unreasonable. It was submitted that the evidence of the complaint was unreliable and her credit compromised. In support of this submission the appellant emphasised that in an affidavit sworn in the Federal Magistrate’s Court the complainant said she was aware by the first week of March that her husband was having an affair with a Melbourne doctor. When cross-examined at the trial she maintained that it was mid April when she became aware of the affair. It was submitted that the desire of the complainant to obtain revenge against the appellant for this affair was supported by evidence from the appellant’s sister that the complainant had said to her on two occasions “I play my best shot and I will destroy him, I will make him a beggar and if I can’t have him no one can have him. I will make him a de-registered doctor.” 
     
      
    45 The appellant also emphasised that the prosecution had been permitted to introduce evidence of the tempestuous relationship between the appellant and the complainant. This disclosed previous occasions of violence. Emphasis was also placed on the call to 000 which the complainant said was interrupted when the appellant took the phone from her and hung up. However, the appellant’s voice cannot be heard on the recording and the complainant does not complain in the telephone conversation that she was assaulted. 
     
      
    46 The appellant also submitted that the Crown case was weakened by the complainant’s evidence as to the events during their journey from Bega to Sydney on the afternoon of 29 April. In her evidence in chief the complainant said that during the trip the appellant kept poking her on the neck while he was talking to her and “to get his point across then he start grabbing my hair from one hand and try to smash it on the car, I was sitting in the passenger seat, in the car, and hit my head on the dashboard.” She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Did your head actually hit the dashboard? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was there anything stopping your head hitting the dashboard? 
         
        A: Yes, my hand, I kept my hand and tried to pull away from the dashboard.” 
        
       
      
    47 The appellant submitted that when cross-examined the complainant gave inconsistent evidence. The submission is misconceived. Although she initially said that her head hit the dashboard the complainant immediately said otherwise. She made plain that she had used her hand and placed it between her head and the dashboard to provide protection. Her evidence in cross-examination was consistent with her corrected account of the relevant events.  
     
      
    48 When asked how it was that the seat belt did not restrain her from being pushed forward she said that the car was “a very old Mercedes car.” The defence case was that this was incorrect. Irrespective of the age of the car it would not follow that the act of forcing the complainant’s head forward would necessarily trigger the restraining force of the belt. 
     
      
    49 It was the complainant’s account of the journey from Bega which gave rise to ground 4. Following the appellant’s conviction the complainant initiated proceedings against the appellant in the District Court claiming damages. A statement of claim commencing these proceedings was drawn by counsel who did not have the benefit of a conference with the complainant. Rather he relied upon a police statement which was provided to him by his instructing solicitor. 
     
      
    50 The statement of claim pleads in relation to the particulars of assault that “On 29th April 2005 the defendant whilst the plaintiff was driving the defendant and their child back to Sydney from Bega, the defendant assaulted her first by driving his fingernails into her neck and then grabbing her hair at the back and pushing her face into the steering wheel of the car causing her pain and injury.” 
     
      
    51 The complainant has given evidence in these proceedings that although she completed an affidavit verifying the allegations in the statement of claim this particular is not correct. She said that she was distressed at the time, due to the death of her father and signed the affidavit without paying sufficient attention to the contents of the statement of claim. The essential error is the allegation that the complainant was driving the car rather than the appellant. 
     
      
    52 I have no hesitation in accepting the complainant’s account. The police statement provided to counsel when he was asked to draw the statement of claim contains the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “65. It was not a pattern when Aruna would hit. He would mostly do it when he was stressed out or when there was nothing else to pick on me about, he would abuse me for my grammar. Other things Aruna would make me do is drive the car until it would run out of petrol, then he would make me walk no matter where we were and make me walk to a petrol station to get a can of petrol. He would drive past petrol stations and not fill up knowing he would make me walk to get petrol. 
        
       
       
        
        66. On Friday the 29th of April, 2005 Aruna, Zanuka and myself arrived home after driving straight from Bega which took us about 6 hours. We got home about 5.30 to 6.00pm. We had driven in Aruna’s car, which is the red Mercedes Benz. On the way in the car, we had a big fight and Aruna accused me of hiding my passport. Aruna said I was hiding things from him. Aruna kept putting his fingernails into my neck which would cause me pain. He also grabbed my hair at the back of my head and pushed my head forward with a lot of force trying to make me hit my head on the dashboard of the car. He did this about 3 or 4 times. I kept putting my hand in front of my head to stop Aruna from making my head hit the dash. I saw there was a lot of my hair around where the gear stick is after Aruna had done this to my head. It was like a bunch of hair that had been pulled out of my head.” 
        
       
      
    53 Unless these paragraphs are read carefully it is possible to confuse the statement in [65] that the appellant would make the complainant drive the car with the events on 29 April.  
     
      
    54 In [66] the complainant does not actually state who was driving the car and it would appear that counsel has assumed that it was the complainant. I am entirely satisfied that the particular drafted by counsel was in error. 
     
      
    55 Counsel for the appellant submitted that if this evidence had been available at the trial “the defence would have been entitled to cross-examine the complainant on this paragraph”. It was submitted that evidence of the incident in the car could have affected the prosecution case by rebutting the complainant’s evidence that the relationship between the complainant and the appellant was violent. Furthermore, the evidence was said to be relevant in determining the reliability of the complainant’s account of the circumstances of the assault on 30 April. It was submitted that “inevitably, if the jury believed the complainant about the car incident they would have been likely to accept her as reliable in respect of both the sexual and non-sexual assaults.” 
     
      
    56 The complainant and her solicitor gave evidence and were cross-examined in these proceedings. For the reasons I have given at paragraphs [52] and [53] above, I am satisfied that the complainant failed to properly check the District Court affidavit prior to signing it. In Craig v The King (1933) 49 CLR 429, Rich and Dixon JJ said that the fresh evidence must be of such a character that “if considered in combination with the evidence already given upon the trial the result ought in the minds of reasonable men to be affected. Such evidence should be calculated at least to remove the certainty of the prisoner’s guilt which the former evidence produced. But in judging of the weight of the fresh testimony the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial must be a matter of great importance” (at 439). 
     
      
    57 I have reviewed the evidence given at the trial. I am completely satisfied that this evidence does not raise any doubt as to the complainant’s credibility. The evidence does not cause me any doubt that the appellant was properly convicted. 
     
      
    58 The appellant also pointed to other suggested inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence. One suggested inconsistency was as to the location of the sorbolene cream. The complainant said she found it under the bed. During the committal she gave evidence that she found it in the “visitor’s room.” At the trial she insisted that this evidence was wrong. 
     
      
    59 The appellant further submitted that the complainant’s evidence in relation to the way she was being held by the appellant when he penetrated her was inconsistent. It was submitted that at the committal she had said that the appellant was holding her ankles but at the trial said this was not the case. 
     
      
    60 The appellant further submitted that the complainant’s account of the way she was allegedly assaulted by the appellant on 30 April was unreliable. The complainant testified that following an argument concerning her passport the appellant grabbed her hair and repeatedly banged her head against the door frame of an upstairs study room. The complainant then said the appellant dragged her by the hair down a flight of stairs. When she fell to the bottom of the stairs she said that the appellant pushed her to a couch and then hit her about the head for “5 to 10 minutes.” She was then pushed to another couch and the blows continued. 
     
      
    61 It was submitted that when the police arrived the complainant did not indicate to them that there had been a continuing course of violent behaviour. Rather she said that her head had been only once pushed into a doorframe. Constable Chaplin did not observe injuries to her head. Dr Brennan examined her scalp but did not detect any bruising. It was submitted that the evidence of the doctor did not support a vicious beating of the type alleged by the complainant. 
     
      
    62 The appellant also introduced into evidence the body of documents comprising many photographs and written material composed by the complainant. This evidence was tendered to rebut the prosecution case that the relationship was episodically violent. The photographs indicate a happy and comfortable family situation. A card written by the complainant commemorating five years of the relationship was read onto the record. In that card the complainant wrote, inter alia, “Every day I thank God for giving someone like you to me. …Aron you are my life and my love … I hope and pray the next fifty years will be filled with lots of love like the past five years.” 
     
      
    63 The appellant also emphasised the evidence of Dr Sharp and said this should have left the jury with a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt of the sexual offence. It was submitted that his evidence created a reasonable possibility that the injuries were caused by a sharp object such as the complainant’s fingernails. 
     
      
    64 On 11 May 2005 the appellant sent the complainant a mobile phone text message which said, inter alia, “I still dream of Friday night.” It was suggested that this communication, although coming from the appellant, was capable of suggesting a consensual amorous encounter as put by the appellant to the complainant in cross-examination. There was no evidence that by 11 May the appellant realised that the complainant had reported him to the police for rape. The complainant was only interviewed on 12 May 2005 and her police statement is dated on that day. 
     
      
    65 The appellant also emphasised the fact that the complainant did not mention that she had been sexually assaulted to the police when initially interviewed. Her explanation was that she was embarrassed when speaking to a male police officer. In cross-examination she was reminded that at the committal the reason she gave was that she did not think the police would do anything about it. 
     
      
    66 Each of the issues raised by the appellant, with the exception of the pleading in the statement of claim, were issues at the trial. I have read the complete transcript of the trial. Although there are some inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence in my opinion these are minor. It must not be overlooked that the jury accepted her evidence. To my mind her account of the relevant events is convincing. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. No miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
     
      
    67 I would reject grounds 3 and 4. 
     
      
       
      The sentence 
       
      
    68 The appellant seeks to agitate two issues in relation to his sentence. Firstly, he submitted that the sentence imposed for the common assault count was excessive. He further submitted that the partial accumulation of the overall sentence was inappropriate being contrary to the High Court’s approach in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    69 The trial judge imposed a sentence of 15 months in relation to count 2, the common assault. The maximum penalty was a term of imprisonment for 2 years. Having regard to the fact that the appellant had no prior convictions this sentence was severe. 
     
      
    70 In his remarks on sentence the judge found the objective criminality of the assault was high. He found it to be a sustained assault with violence being inflicted at three locations, the upstairs landing, the foot of the stairs and the couch. It involved the repeated and continual use of force. It also involved the use of objects such as the door jamb and the cushion to inflict trauma to the complainant. Occurring in a domestic situation his Honour found there “was a clear power imbalance between the attacker and his victim.” His Honour found that the assault was occasioned by the appellant’s inability to find or secure the complainant’s passport. His Honour found that he sought the passport “in the hope or expectation that he could use it as a bargaining chip on the question of if and when and how separation was to be achieved.” 
     
      
    71 The appellant denied his guilt and continues to do so. Accordingly his Honour found no remorse or contrition. However, his Honour found that there were positive indications of prospects of rehabilitation. There are no prior occasions of violence on his record. 
     
      
    72 The relationship between the appellant and the complainant was not formalised with marriage. The appellant was already married. At the time of his sentence he was 40 years of age and had qualified as a medical practitioner. He practiced medicine in Australia. He has been involved in research and has practiced medicine in remote areas serving aboriginal communities as a general practitioner and surgeon. 
     
      
    73 There is no doubt that the assault committed by the appellant was serious. I am satisfied that his Honour was correct in describing it as an assault with a high degree of objective criminality. Although the penalty imposed was severe I am not persuaded that it was beyond the appropriate range. 
     
      
    74 In relation to the first count I am completely satisfied that the sentence imposed was within the range. Indeed, having regard to the serious nature of the sexual assault a non-parole period greater than that which was imposed would not have been inappropriate. 
     
      
    75 The appellant complained in relation to the overall sentence that his Honour did not follow the approach required by Pearce. It was submitted that his Honour did not sentence individually for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. 
     
      
    76 It is true that when sentencing his Honour identified the sentence for each offence separately and defined the dates of commencement when announcing each sentence. He did not expressly acknowledge that those dates had been identified as appropriate having regard to issues of totality. Faithful adherence to the requirements in Pearce would have required the sentences to be imposed and subsequently the extent of accumulation defined by reference to issues of totality. 
     
      
    77 Notwithstanding the manner in which his Honour pronounced the sentences I am not persuaded this Court should intervene. In my opinion the sentence for each offence was justified and the total sentence appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    78 In my opinion the Court should make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal sentence granted. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1 The appellant pleaded guilty in the Balmain Local Court on 4 June 2008. He was charged with driving a vehicle with a low range concentration of alcohol in his blood. He was convicted and fined $900 plus costs and disqualified from driving for 12 months.2 He seeks leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 12. After hearing the application, I determined there was a significant point of law involved in the appeal and granted leave to appeal. I now grant leave for him to withdraw his plea of guilty.3 There is no doubt that, at the time he was stopped by police and his breath was analysed, the concentration of alcohol in the appellant's blood was 0 .055. The appellant does not deny that he had been to dinner with some friends and had drunk some wine with dinner. Although he was surprised by the reading when he was breathalysed, he did not doubt or ever contest the accuracy of the reading. He was acutely aware of the offence because in evidence there are documents showing that, following a conviction for a low range PCA charge very recently, he completed a Traffic Offender Intervention Program successfully and was intending to drive responsibly. 4 The issues for me to decide on this appeal are: 
     
      
      (i) whether the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available where the charge is driving with above the prescribed concentration of alcohol in the blood; 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) whether he has made out a defence of honest and reasonable mistake to the charge and is not guilty; 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) if he has committed the offence, whether the matter should be dealt with under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, section 10. 
      
    5 In the affidavit in support of his application, which was not challenged, he stated that at the time of the offence he was suffering from a bad cold and had taken cough mixture containing ethanol, a form of alcohol, at 6.30 p.m. He was apprehended about three hours later. It is not suggested that the cough mixture by itself would have been sufficient to raise the concentration of alcohol in his blood over the limit. He says also that by itself, the wine he consumed with his dinner would not have done so. His belief was that he had ingested wine in a quantity that was not enough to make his alcohol concentration above the limit.6 Mr Shaw QC, on his behalf, advanced the proposition that the offence to which he pleaded guilty was not an offence of strict liability. If the appellant were given leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, Mr Shaw would then advance the proposition that the appellant did not know that his blood alcohol concentration was over the limit, and he had honest and reasonable grounds for believing that it was not, because he had been taking a cough medicine which in fact contained alcohol, but which, at that time, he did not know contained alcohol. 7 The relevant legislation reads as follows:Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, s 9 Offence - low range prescribed concentration of alcohol  
     
      
      (2) A person must not, while there is present in his or her breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol:  
       
        
        (a) drive a motor vehicle, or  
         
         (b) occupy the driving seat of a motor vehicle and attempt to put the motor vehicle in motion, or  
         
        (c) if the person is the holder of a drivers licence (other than a provisional licence or a learner licence) -occupy the seat in a motor vehicle next to a holder of a learner licence who is driving the vehicle.  
        
       
      
    8 On its face, this section appears to speak in absolute terms. The offence is committed if the accused person drives the vehicle and if he or she has the prescribed concentration of alcohol. How the alcohol got into the person is irrelevant.9 To me, if the matter were free from authority, the words creating this offence appear to show an intention to establish an offence of strict liability. However, it is clear that the law leans against the creation of such offences without clear and express words in the statute. It was not suggested in this case that the prosecution must prove intention in ordinary circumstances.10 In CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25 the High Court has affirmed the general principle that honest and reasonable belief in a state of events which, if true, would render a person not guilty of an offence, will be a defence to a charge of committing that offence if the accused proves, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she had such a belief. Mr Shaw says that here the appellant had taken the cough mixture, and therefore had honest and reasonable grounds for believing that his blood alcohol concentration was below the prescribed limit. 11 The case of DPP v Bone [ 2005] NSWSC 1239 is binding on me. There, Adams J considered that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available to an offence under the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, s 9 (3). It was not necessary for him to decide whether the offence was made out: [37]. His Honour purported to follow and apply Elliott v Crawford (Supreme Court of Tasmania, 30 November 1989) a decision of Underwood J, upon which Mr Shaw also relied.12 The prosecution points out that where an accused person is charged under s 9 (1A), the provision dealing with holders of provisional licences or learners permits, an offence is committed if any concentration of alcohol at all is present. A specific defence is provided for a driver who has ingested alcohol because it is contained in medicine. The relevant provision reads:11A Defence for offence relating to novice range prescribed concentration of alcohol It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence under section 9 (1A) if the defendant proves that, at the time the defendant did the act referred to in section 9 (1A) (a) or (b), the presence in the defendant’s breath or blood of the novice range prescribed concentration of alcohol was not caused (in whole or in part) by any of the following:  
     
      
      (a) the consumption of an alcoholic beverage (otherwise than for the purposes of religious observance),  
       
      (b) the consumption or use of any other substance (for example, food or medicine) for the purpose of consuming alcohol.  
      
    13 The prosecution case is that it could not be the intention of Parliament to allow a defence similar to that provided by s 11 where a person is charged under s 9(2). If Parliament had intended that there should be such a defence, it would have made a similar specific provision.14 This argument appears to be similar to the argument rejected by the majority of the High Court in CTM. The absence of a specific defence does not mean that the general common law principle does not apply.15 I find, albeit reluctantly, that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available.16 The next issue is whether the appellant has discharged the evidentiary burden that falls on him. His unchallenged evidence is that the cough mixture he had taken contained alcohol, and the inference that must be drawn is that that alcohol would have been reflected in the concentration of alcohol measured by the police. Having raised the possibility that the ingestion of medicine had an effect on his blood alcohol concentration, must the appellant then show that his belief, that he was below the limit, was reasonable ?17 The prosecution case is that he has not done so. It is necessary, it says, for the appellant to adduce evidence to demonstrate the effect of taking the cough mixture. The appellant says that, by asserting that at the time he was apprehended, he had consumed a cough mixture without knowing that it contained alcohol, he has raised the possibility of a defence. Therefore, in the appellant's submission, the evidentiary burden shifts to the prosecution to negative the defence. 18 There is a great deal of merit in this argument, as a matter of general principle. If, in general terms, a defence is available, it is not incumbent on the accused to do more than raise the possibility of its existence. The evidentiary burden shifts to the prosecution to negative the defence, and to do so beyond reasonable doubt. It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that an accused person, in the absence of a specific requirement of the law, need not prove anything. There is no reason why that general proposition does not apply in the circumstances of this case.19 In my view, the position of the prosecution would have been stronger if it had challenged the assertion made by the appellant in his affidavit, or at least required him for cross-examination, so that the strength of his assertion about honest and reasonable belief might be tested. By failing to do so, the prosecution accepts the truth of the assertions made by the appellant. It would be open to the prosecution to test the strength of the evidence adduced by the appellant, and if necessary to call evidence to rebut any assertion made by the appellant. It may have been difficult in the circumstances in which I dealt with this appeal for the prosecution to have done so, because it was necessary for me to hear the whole of the appellant's case in order to determine whether leave should be granted. However, it would have been open to the prosecution to seek to have the matter adjourned as soon as I announced my determination to grant leave.20 I find that, once the appellant raised the defence of an honest and reasonable belief by asserting facts, that, if true, would have exonerated him from guilt of the offence, the evidentiary burden of disproving that defence shifted to the prosecution. The prosecution has not discharged its evidentiary burden.21 I therefore allow the appeal and quash the conviction. 22 I should say that even if the decision on the point of law had been different, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant has a previous conviction for driving with a low range concentration of alcohol, which is quite recent, the circumstances of this offence, raised the possibility that his commission of the offence, though technically proved by the presence of the relevant level of alcohol concentration, is sufficiently explained by his consumption of the cough medicine to constitute circumstances which are completely different from the arguments one commonly hears in such cases. 23 The appellant, despite some historical offences, appears to be a well-regarded member of the community and performs many useful functions in the community and particularly the Italian community. However, the main reason which leads me to make this statement are the circumstances of the offence. It would in my view be an appropriate case in which to dismiss the charges pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, section 10.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Matthew Robert Curtis, pleaded guilty in the District Court to four counts of break, enter and steal. On the first count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months. On each of the second and third counts, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 2 years and 3 months, which were also concurrent with the sentence on the first count. On the fourth count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years, which was accumulated upon the other sentences by one year. The aggregate sentence, then, was imprisonment for 4 years and 9 months with an effective non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 4 The offences were committed at private homes in Young over a period of about ten days in May 2006. Each of the homes was readily accessible, and the applicant stole a variety of items, comprising money, jewellery, a video recorder and a Playstation. However, from the home the subject of the fourth count he also stole two rifles and a shotgun, which he later disposed of. It was the theft and disposal of those firearms which led the sentencing judge to pass the heaviest sentence on that count. He committed the offences to fund his addiction to a pain-killing drug, oxycontin, which he was buying illegally.5 The applicant was thirty-one years old at the time of the offences, and is now thirty-three. He has a bad criminal record, including a number of previous convictions for break, enter and steal. He was extended leniency for those offences in earlier years, but subsequently served terms of imprisonment for several of them. Some of the offences on his record were committed while he was on parole.  
     
      
    6 He had a long history of drug abuse, principally of heroin and amphetamines, dating from his early teenage years. It appears that this abuse began during a troubled period of his life, and led to his offending behaviour. There were periods of abstinence when he tried, unsuccessfully, to deal with his addiction. There was such a period prior to the offences in question, but some months before they were committed he was introduced to oxycontin and quickly became dependent on it. 
     
      
    7 There is no need to refer to other aspects of his subjective case. The sentencing judge found special circumstances in respect of the sentence for the fourth count, partly because of the accumulation of that sentence upon the other sentences but also in recognition of the need to afford him an extended period of supervision to adjust to life in the community and to address his drug addiction. His Honour discounted the sentences by twenty-five per cent because of his early pleas of guilty.  
     
      
       
       
      The application 
       
      
    8 The application was argued by the applicant’s solicitor, Ms White, who submitted that His Honour had erred in five respects in his approach to sentence.  
     
      
       
      Co-operation with authorities 
       
      
    9 Firstly, it was said that the applicant should have been allowed a discrete discount of sentence because of his co-operation with the authorities. It was not until about two months after the offences that he was charged with them. Police had executed a search warrant at the premises where he was living, and some of the stolen property was found. He was arrested and, during a recorded interview, he admitted that the property was the subject of the four break-ins and disclosed his involvement in them. As to one of them, he admitted an offence of which the police were not then aware.  
     
      
       
      His Honour referred to this evidence in his remarks. However, he later observed that there had been “some degree of pre-trial disclosure”, but “not complete disclosure”. This was a reference to the fact that the applicant declined to tell police who it was to whom he had disposed of the firearms the subject of the fourth count. It was in that context that His Honour said that he could not “give him additional punishment for his failure to co-operate with the authorities”, but expressed his concern about that lack of co-operation.  
       
      
    10 These passages convey, said Ms White, that His Honour failed to give the applicant’s admissions, and his disclosure of an offence of which he was not suspected, the weight in mitigation of sentence which they deserved. Indeed, she argued that, but for his admissions, the applicant might have been charged with no more than several counts of receiving stolen property and that those offences might have been dealt with summarily. 
     
      
    11 That last argument is no more than speculative. Putting aside the offence admitted by the applicant of which the police were not aware, the material before this Court does not enable us to evaluate the evidence against him, absent his admissions, in respect of the other three offences. Nor could it be assumed that charges of receiving would have been dealt with summarily, given his criminal history.  
     
      
    12 It is clear that his Honour was mindful of the applicant’s co-operation and took it into account appropriately. Its mitigating effect was diminished by his refusal to disclose the identity of the person who received the firearms, and his Honour was rightly concerned about his failure to provide police with information which might disclose their whereabouts and, perhaps, lead to their recovery. That approach was well open to his Honour. 
     
      
       
      Firearms 
       
      
    13 Secondly, Ms White submitted that his Honour gave undue emphasis to the theft of the firearms and their disposal. In addition to the passages in the remarks to which I have already referred, she drew our attention to another passage in which his Honour said that the applicant had “committed a serious error of judgment …in taking the firearms of [the relevant victim], thus attracting the much greater sentence for that offence than the other matters”.  
     
      
    14 In large part, this complaint has been dealt with by what I have already said. The fourth count was significantly more serious than the others because it involved the theft of firearms, which were then passed on to some unidentified person. Ms White argued that his Honour treated the applicant’s refusal to disclose the identity of that person “as an aggravating factor in the calculation of the sentence to be passed”, and that that approach was unwarranted and amounted to an infringement of his right to silence.  
     
      
    15 However, it is clear from his remarks that his Honour did not treat that matter in that way. As I have said, he saw it as bearing upon the extent of the applicant’s co-operation with the police. He also saw it as relevant to the measure of remorse which might be evidenced by that co-operation and by the pleas of guilty. As to remorse, his Honour also had regard to evidence which the applicant gave in the sentence proceedings to the effect that he had given the firearms to somebody to dispose of because they were not in working order. His Honour rejected that evidence because it was inconsistent with a statement by the owner of the weapons about their condition. No error has been shown in his Honour’s assessment of the significance of the firearms and of what the applicant had to say about them.  
     
      
       
      Protective custody 
       
      
    16 His Honour accepted evidence that the applicant had been assaulted by several other inmates while in custody, and expressed concern about the adequacy of the medical treatment which he had received. It seems that the assault was perpetrated by prisoners who recognised him as a person who had previously been on protection and who, presumably, suspected him of having been an informer. As a result of the assault, he had again been placed on protection, although he gave very limited evidence about the conditions of custody which that involved.  
     
      
    17 Clearly, protective custody for the remainder of his sentence was a possibility, although his Honour observed that that might be a difficult decision for the applicant, given the apparent reason for the assault and the disadvantages which generally attend that status. His Honour also observed that he faced some danger in custody and could expect to serve his term “in circumstances of some fear”. He took this development into account, noting that it was not “a significant mitigating matter but it is a matter relevant to be considered”.  
     
      
    18 Ms White’s complaint about this matter, as articulated in written submissions, was that his Honour fell into error “in not further discounting the sentence due to the fact that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody”. In fact, as I have said, his Honour was not certain that the applicant would do so but was conscious of the additional stress which he must experience as a result of the assault. In any event, if by that submission Ms White meant that his Honour should have quantified a discount of sentence because of this evidence, that course would have been inappropriate. His Honour took this matter into account to the extent which he expressed and, again, no error has been shown in his approach.  
     
      
       
      Drug addiction 
       
      
    19 As I have said, the applicant’s drug addiction appears to have had its origin in a difficult period of his life in his early teenage years. A psychiatrist, who provided a report, found “suggestions of relatively long standing depression” in the applicant, which had perhaps increased in severity in the period during which the offences were committed. His Honour appears to have accepted a connection between that depression and the events of his teenage life. However, he found no causal relationship between that condition and the offences.  
     
      
    20 His Honour also considered that the applicant’s dependence on oxycontin at the time of the offences was “a matter of choice”. He made that finding after referring to the familiar passage in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346, in which Wood J (as then was) considered the relevance of drug addiction to sentence. Among other things, the former Chief Judge recognised that such addiction might be a relevant subjective circumstance if its origin or extent suggested that “the addiction was not a matter of personal choice….” (at [273] (c)(ii)). 
     
      
    21 Ms White argued that his Honour’s finding was not available in the light of the link, which he appeared to accept, between the applicant’s troubled early life, his drug addiction and his depression. As she put it in written submissions, despite that evidence his Honour did not seem “to have regarded that relationship as a causal connection sufficient to be a mitigating factor on sentence”.  
     
      
    22 This misconceives the effect of this aspect of the remarks on sentence, read as a whole. His Honour clearly had regard to the history of the applicant’s use of drugs established by the evidence. What he was saying was that, although difficulties in his early life might have led to his drug abuse and to an enduring measure of depression, his resort in his mature years to the use of oxycontin after a period of abstinence ought fairly to be described as his personal choice. No doubt, his dependence on the drug was his motive for the commission of these crimes, but it did not sound in mitigation on the basis explained by Wood J in Henry. 
     
      
    23 That said, it is clear that his Honour had regard to the applicant’s long history of drug abuse, and its origin, as part of his subjective case. Yet again, no error has been shown in the manner in which this aspect of the case was dealt with.  
     
      
       
      Prospects of rehabilitation 
       
      
    24 Finally, Ms White challenged his Honour’s conclusion that it could not be said that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. She outlined that submission in writing, but did not develop it orally. Given the applicant’s age and criminal history, that finding was clearly open. Despite it, as I have said, his Honour found special circumstances partly in the hope that his rehabilitation might yet be achieved. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    25 Accordingly, none of the challenges to his Honour’s reasons for sentence has been made out. I might add that, in any event, I am satisfied that no lesser sentences were warranted. Moreover, the applicant had the benefit of concurrent sentences on the first three counts and, given the totality of his criminality, the aggregate sentence could only be described as moderate.  
     
      
    26 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

       REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  On 11 April 2008, the prisoner John Harry Faehndrich was convicted by a jury of the charge that he on or about 13 August 2006 at Forster in the State of New South Wales did murder Dianne Condon. The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of 20 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the prisoner. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the prisoner must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 378-379. 
     
      
    3 On the first day of the trial the prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment and the trial proceeded on the charge of murder. It was the prisoner’s case at trial that he was acting under provocation when he killed Dianne Condon and the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind was raised by him. The jury was also instructed that in order to find the accused guilty of murder that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing the death of Dianne Condon was not carried out in self-defence.  
     
      
    4 The deceased died when she was stabbed by the prisoner with a pair of scissors and her vertebral artery was incised. They had been in a relationship of about three months duration. At the time of her death, the deceased was staying with the prisoner in a motel room at Forster. She was 36 years old when she was murdered.  
     
      
    5 The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner deliberately and intentionally stabbed the deceased with the scissors and caused her death, that the acts causing her death were not carried out in self-defence and the prisoner was not acting under provocation. The jury must have found that the acts causing death were done with either an intention to kill Dianne Condon or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. The members of the jury were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind had been established by the prisoner. 
     
      
    6 An important matter of fact in the trial was whether the deceased had attacked the prisoner with the scissors. The jury’s verdict does not determine this issue. On the issue of provocation, it was open to the jury to accept the prisoner’s evidence and find that the acts causing death were the result of a loss of self-control on his part that was induced by the deceased’s conduct towards him but to find that the deceased’s conduct was not such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. As to self-defence, it was open to the jury to accept that the prisoner genuinely believed that it was necessary to do what he did in his own self-defence, but to find that what he did in stabbing the deceased was not a reasonable response in the situation that he perceived it to be. Another basis for the verdict was for the jury to find on the issue of provocation that there was nothing in the conduct of the deceased which induced the prisoner to lose his self-control. As to self-defence, it was open to the jury to find that the prisoner did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to do what he did in his own self-defence.  
     
      
    7 The prisoner’s account to the jury of events that occurred in the motel room on Sunday 13 August 2006 included his waking up about midnight and finding that Miss Condon was not in the room. After he had looked without success for her, she returned and went to bed. He described being at his wits end and going for a walk near the water. When he returned after about two hours he noticed that the bed had been made and Dianne was lying on it. She had her head at the end of the bed. He observed all the bags were packed including his. He saw in her mouth what he described was like spit which he thought was unusual. His first impression was that she had overdosed or over self-medicated. He said “What have you done? Do you want me to call an ambulance?” The first thing she said was she wanted to be with her mother.  
     
      
       
      He tried waking her, picked her up and carried her into the bathroom. The prisoner said she appeared to be bringing something up in the toilet and then he actually helped her get into the shower. When she was in the shower she was laying on the floor. He kept, he said, on coming in to watch her and she said to him “Fuck off, leave me alone.” The prisoner told the jury that she came out of the bathroom, he really did not look at her but she came up to her cosmetic bag. He said he was standing over near his checkered bag which was roughly in the middle of photograph eight of exhibit E. The prisoner said he asked the deceased, “How are you?” she said, “You’re not deserting me, you cunt.” He saw her coming at him with scissors in her hand. When he first noticed the scissors she was very close to him. He went to grab hold of her, they had a struggle and then fell. The next thing he remembered was that she was bleeding from the neck area and he could remember trying to stem the blood flow. When he saw Dianne Condon with the scissors he thought that the love of his life was trying to stab him. He tried to defend himself. He said he was not angry but shocked. At the time she was dressed in a bath towel which was wrapped around her. When asked by Mr Bodor QC what happened after he tried to stem the flow of blood, the prisoner told the jury he could remember flashbacks. He could remember being panicky and a momentary attempt at cleaning that to him seemed futile. He could recall doing some re-arranging of the packed bags. He thought he actually threw the scissors into one of the bags. He said he had to get out of there and wanted to die.  
       
      
    8 The Crown invites me to find that the deceased did not approach, come at or attack the prisoner with the scissors. Mr Bodor for the prisoner submits that such a finding should not be made. He contends that the deceased had been volatile in the relationship as had the prisoner. The scissors were hers and in her bag. Given the fact that the prisoner, on the version given to police by the deceased on 18 June 2006 that the prisoner assaulted her, it may well be, Mr Bodor argued, that she grabbed the scissors in an attempt to either frighten or attack the prisoner. He got the better of the wrestle for the weapon and thereafter, provoked by that disloyalty as he saw it, in a rage he used the scissors. Mr Bodor further submits that this is a factual matter which the Court might not be able to resolve.  
     
      
    9 I find that the prisoner’s evidence as to the circumstances in which he killed the deceased to be largely untruthful. It is appropriate to observe that his account of what occurred when he returned to the room and took Miss Condon into the bathroom was not supported either by the toxicology results or the evidence of Dr Lee, a forensic pathologist, as to the consequences of an overdose of medication on the physical capabilities of the deceased. Furthermore, there was a significant difficulty with the honesty and reliability of his evidence when what he had told Dr Nielssen and Dr Giuffrida, the psychiatrists, about seeing the deceased “frothing at the mouth” was considered. 
     
      
    10 Forensic evidence given during the trial included Dr Lee’s testimony that the body of the deceased was located in the far corner of the motel room near the rear door adjacent to the bathroom. She was lying on her right side with her head towards the corner. A large pool of blood lay on the carpet next to the door frame of the bathroom door. A second large pool of blood lay underneath the head and neck area of the deceased. No other heavy deposits of blood were present at the scene, but a large quantity of low level splashed blood was present along the southern wall with a small quantity present on the western wall. The body was partly covered by a moderately bloodstained brown blanket and a number of towels.  
     
      
    11 Dr Lee told the jury that the blood patterning present on the blanket did not correspond to blood either on the deceased or on the carpet. On removal of the blanket, a heavily bloodstained towel was noted to be lying over the mid part of the trunk and left arm with patterning that again did not correspond to that part of the body. On removal, a bath towel was observed to be wrapped around the body, being approximately at mid breast level. Part of the bloodstaining on the towel in the region of the left arm corresponded to the bloodstains seen on the body, but those on the mid-back did not correspond to the injuries on the back, being of a contact type and deposited from the outer aspect. Dr Lee expressed the opinion that the most obvious thing about the bloodstained towels with the exception of the bath towel wrapped around the body at approximately breast level was that their appearance was compatible only with their placement by another individual, in other words, certainly not by the deceased. The appearance of the blood being unrelated to that of the position where they were found meant that they had been used to soak up blood from other surfaces or areas. It was quite clear, Dr Lee said, that there had been cleaning up of bloodstains within the bathroom. It may well have been, Dr Lee said, explained by some of the blood that was on the towels. 
     
      
    12 The most obvious feature Dr Lee could see about the scene was that there were two areas of bloodstaining within the room. One was very much under the area where the deceased’s injuries were and much of that blood could have got onto the carpet while the deceased was effectively there. But the deceased, Dr Lee said, had obviously spent a significant period of time in the area of the heavy bloodstains right next to the bathroom door and had been relatively still there, in other words, bled just into one area. Dr Lee testified that the only way this could have occurred from one site to the final site was as a result of active movement, or by passive movement. In other words, she had been moved by some other individual shortly prior to death. The bloodstains he referred to as being on the walls were all low-level bloodstains. Dr Lee opined that the deceased had not risen significantly after her first collapse. She had collapsed more or less in the area of the bathroom door and then had moved at a very low rate, not more than a few centimetres, 10 or so centimetres, above the floor to end up in the second position. 
     
      
    13 Dr Lee conducted an autopsy and described 11 stab wounds to the deceased. Injuries one and two were a pair of penetrating injuries of the mid-back below the level of the shoulder blades. They were consistent with a pair of scissors being opened and showed evidence, Dr Lee said, of having involved a heavy degree of force.  
     
      
    14 Dr Lee gave evidence of a main group of penetrating injuries to the deceased which were injuries three to 11. They were present in the right and right back of the neck and represented a single group of injuries. 
     
      
    15 The jury was told by Dr Lee: 
     
      
       
        
        “The number of injuries in the group is strongly indicative of a minimal degree of relative movement between the two parties during the course of this part of the incident. Clearly, if the deceased had been moving around, trying to get away from her attacker, running about, crawling about, whatever it was, moving her head, moving her neck, I would not have expected all of the injuries to be in this very small area in one side of the neck. These injuries certainly would be expected to have been fatal.” (T 245 l 12 to 19).  
        
       
      
    16 His examination of the deceased revealed very extensive injuries to the spinal column and upper area. He said the vertebral artery had been incised, this being expected to produce very heavy haemorrhage. That damage is well recognised to be rapidly fatal.  
     
      
    17 Dr Lee described an area of fracturing being on the body at C4 and a small chip fracture of the transverse process of the T7 vertebra. He explained that the spinal cord was dissected and it revealed damage to the dura mater of the neck level. There was also significant damage to the right brachial plexus. 
     
      
    18 The damage to the spinal cord and to the elements of the brachial plexus, Dr Lee said, would be expected to be disabling in that they would interfere with the function, of not only of the right arm, because some of the nerves of the right arm had been cut through which would interfere with that arm operating, but it would interfere with the functioning of the rest of the right side of the body because the spinal cord had been damaged. He expressed the opinion that the deceased was very significantly disabled from the time of receiving those injuries and that would have been immediate. It would certainly have made struggle and movement very difficult. Effectively, this would reduce the use of the right arm and some reduced use of the right leg. It would be fair to say, he said, that the injuries to the neck which had caused damage would represent ones where a heavy degree of force had been used. 
     
      
    19 In cross-examination by Mr Bodor he agreed that whilst he spoke of 11 wounds, there could be significantly less than 11 stabs, in other words, getting some pairing of wounds by the two blades going in at the same time.  
     
      
    20 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has excluded as a reasonable possibility that the deceased attacked the prisoner with the scissors. The only rational inference to be drawn beyond reasonable doubt from the combination of: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The heavy blood stains next to the bathroom door and under the deceased’s body; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Injuries one and two being a pair of penetrating injuries to the mid-back below the level of the shoulder blades; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Injuries three to 11 the main group of penetrating injuries in the right and right back of the neck; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) The deceased was 160 centimetres in height, weighed 52 kilograms and was of a slim build. The prisoner is a tall and solidly built man; 
        
       
        
       
        
        (v) The bath towel wrapped around the deceased’s body at approximately breast level. The bath towel had not been disturbed; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) The deceased was lying on her right hand side with her head towards the corner; and  
        
       
       
        
        (vii) The presence of the large quantity of low level splashed blood along the southern wall  
        
       
       
      is that as the deceased was coming out of the bathroom she was stabbed once in the back by the prisoner with the scissors which knocked her to the ground. She was then stabbed at least a further four times with the scissors in the right and right back of the neck. Shortly after the attack, the prisoner moved the deceased’s body to where it was found.  
       
      
    21 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to do what he did in his own self-defence.  
     
      
    22 During the trial, Jeffrey Marr gave evidence of text messages from the deceased and of a phone call with her. Without detailing all of his testimony, of particular relevance are the phone call and text messages on 12 August 2006 the day before the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    23 Mr Marr told the jury that on 12 August 2006 he received a text message from the deceased asking him if he would phone her. When he rang her she was crying. She said she had to get away from [the prisoner] and she didn’t know what to do. She needed help. Mr Marr told her to go down the road and hitch. The deceased said she was afraid of hitching. Mr Marr then discussed with her about contacting a friend. 
     
      
    24 Six minutes later, he received another text message from her which read: “I want to go to your [lace] and yes I am leaving John. Please help me please?” 
     
      
    25 When replying to that message, Mr Marr told the deceased she couldn’t come to his place because the lady he shared the house with would not agree to Dianne coming there. He suggested that she should go to Patti’s place. On the same day at 1.16pm he received a text message from the deceased which read: “I’m not going to Patti’s. Don’t worry. I will figure out something. Thanks for worrying.”  
     
      
       
      At 1.20pm he received another text message which read: “Don’t text back. He is back. I will be alright. I will figure out something”. 
       
       
      At 1.36pm, he received another text message which was the last he received from the deceased which read: “Don’t text until I text you. Thanks.” 
       
      
    26 The prisoner in his evidence said that he did not see the text messages. He testified that the deceased did not tell him she was out of there and that she was sick of it. He was aware that Dianne was in contact with Jeffrey Marr by text messages prior to the weekend. They were texting each other and that did not have any affect on him. 
     
      
    27 Mr Bodor submitted that not too much emphasis should be placed on this material because during the course of the relationship there had been “highs and lows.” The jury was asked to consider text message sent by the deceased to the prisoner on 9 and 10 August. Those text messages were expressions by Miss Condon of her love for him.  
     
      
    28 I accept that the relationship between the deceased and the prisoner was turbulent. The Crown in submissions referred to the offence occurring “in the background of a dysfunctional relationship of three months duration between two dysfunctional individuals.”  
     
      
    29 As I have recounted, it was the prisoner’s evidence at trial that the deceased prior to coming at him with the scissors said “You’re not deserting me, you cunt”. The inference which arises from this evidence is that the deceased attacked him as she held the belief that the prisoner was leaving her. The prisoner’s testimony, however, is to be assessed against the text messages, the telephone call deposed to by Mr Marr and the forensic evidence. In my view, it is plainly untrue that the deceased held the belief that she was being deserted by the prisoner.  
     
      
    30 The Crown submitted to the jury that the only rational conclusion to be drawn from Mr Marr’s evidence was that Miss Condon intended leaving the prisoner. 
     
      
    31 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference is that the deceased intended leaving the prisoner and notwithstanding his evidence at trial he became aware of her intention prior to the killing. It is for this reason that the prisoner killed the deceased.  
     
      
    32 Having made these findings, I am comforted to some extent by the prisoner’s letter dated 31 May 2008 addressed to me on sentence (exhibit 1 on sentence) in which he writes:  
     
      
       
        
        “…when threatened with separation, I fought to cling to others at all costs  
        and in my relationship with Dianne I could not accept her rejection. When confronted with the possibility that she was going to leave me, I lost self control and killed her. I agonize over this every day. 
        ” (italics added)  
        
       
       
      What is written by the prisoner receives further consideration in these sentencing remarks at [63]-[67].  
       
      
    33 The attack upon the deceased was ferocious. The prisoner stabbed her a minimum of four times to the right and right back of the neck. A heavy degree of force was used causing very extensive injuries to the spinal column and upper area. The vertebral artery was incised. The pair of penetrating injuries of the mid back were significant injuries which also involved a heavy degree of force. The penetrating injury described by Dr Lee as stab wound number one being at the very centre of the back with a total track depth of 5.5 centimetres penetrated the visceral pleura and the lung. It was an awful death.  
     
      
    34 At the time he stabbed the deceased I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intention to kill her.  
     
      
    35 The deceased’s body was found in the motel room by the manager on the Monday morning (14 August). He had knocked on the door and there was no answer. There was no movement at all and the curtains were drawn. Having tried using the master key to open the door, he found that the inside chain lock was connected. Entry was obtained by shouldering the door open.  
     
      
    36 Senior Constable Phillips, a crime scene investigator, attended at the motel room at about 2.30pm. Both beds in the room, she told the jury, appeared to have been made up. There was a large red, white and blue plastic shopping bag located next to the cane chair. The zip was open. She could see items of clothing in it. On the top of the side bench were three bags one of which was a green recyclable bag. The scissors used by the prisoner to stab the deceased were found at the bottom of the bag. Items of clothing on which reddish coloured stains were observed and proved positive to the presence of blood were bundled up and piled up inside the bag. They all appeared, the police officer said, to be neatly folded. In the green bag was a white plastic bag containing ugg boots and ‘New Balance’ joggers. The white plastic bag was closed off in a knot. 
     
      
    37 Michelle Franco, a forensic biologist, examined a swab taken from the outside of the ugg boot and found that human blood was detected and the DNA profile matched that of Dianne Condon. She examined a swab from the inside heel of the right ‘New Balance’ jogger and found that human blood was present and that the DNA profile matched the profile of the prisoner. Upon examination of the swab from the inside left heel of the ‘New Balance’ jogger, Ms Franco found that human blood was present and that the DNA profile matched the profile of the prisoner. 
     
      
    38 In the navy bag and pink backpack items of clothing were found which gave a positive reaction to blood as did a reddish coloured stain on a quilt on the double bed. Senior Constable Carrington gave evidence of red staining on the outer side of the curtain meaning that portion of the curtain which faces the motel room window which gave a positive reaction to a presumptive test for blood. A small area of red staining on a white opaque curtain also tested positive for blood.  
     
      
    39 Between 7am to 8am, on Sunday 13 October the prisoner had spoken with Mrs Young in the reception area of the motel about extending his stay until the following Tuesday. When informed that they were fully booked on the Monday night, the prisoner asked about the DO NOT DISTURB sign as “Dianne had a rough night last night. She needs sleep”. He was told by Mrs Young that “If you put the DO NOT DISTURB sign out, the girls won’t even knock on the door.” 
     
      
    40 Ms Malone, a house maid, told the jury that she had walked past the room and had seen a DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging on the outside of the door. At about 9.20am she was asked by the prisoner not to “bother doing room 7, she’s [the deceased] had a very bad night and I’m letting her rest”. She responded by saying, “I will not go into that room because you have your DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door.” 
     
      
    41 The prisoner, I am satisfied, spoke to Mrs Young and to Ms Malone and placed the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the outside of the door in order to prevent anyone entering the room and discovering the body. 
     
      
    42 He had taken a taxi to Bunnings Warehouse shortly after 9am, purchased a quantity of rope and had returned by taxi to the motel.  
     
      
    43 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the combination of: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The connected inside chain lock; 
        
       
      
     (ii) The drawn curtains; 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) The presence of the ugg boots and ‘New Balance’ joggers in the white plastic bag which was tied up and inside the green recyclable bag; 
        
       
      
     (iv) The evidence of Michelle Franco referred to at [37]; 
     
      
     (v) The scissors being at the bottom of the green recyclable bag; 
     
      
       
        
        (vi) The brown blanket and the heavily stained towel over the mid-part of the trunk of the left arm of the deceased; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) The evidence of cleaning up of bloodstains within the bathroom; 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) The prisoner’s conversation with Mrs Young; 
        
       
      
     (ix) The prisoner’s conversation with Ms Malone; and  
     
      
     (x) The trip to Bunnings 
     
      
       
      is that after the killing, the prisoner had acted calmly and coherently to ensure that what he had done would not then immediately be discovered.  
       
       
      
    44 The acts of the prisoner after the killing were of importance in the trial as they indicated that at the time of the acts causing death, his capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself was not substantially impaired by abnormality of mind which was recognised by Dr Giuffrida when he told the jury in answer to a Crown question at T 437 L 31-37 : 
     
      
       
        
        “I have a lot of difficulty with that. I am thinking of the circumstances in which I have seen people who have committed these sort of offences be in a state of depression or psychosis. I mean, they are usually pretty disturbed afterwards. I mean, it is pretty hard for them to go about their business in an organised sort of coherent way, as he appeared to do, from what you are saying.  
        
       
       
        
        Q (The Crown) I appreciate it is a matter for the jury to decide whether he did it or not? 
        
       
       
        
        A I’m simply saying that he appeared to go about it in a coherent, organised way, which surprises me in the circumstances. Yes, I have difficulty fitting that in with everything else.” 
        
       
      
    45 The Crown acknowledged before the jury that the prisoner had a long term depressive illness. The first question for the jury’s consideration on the partial defence was whether the prisoner had established that it was more likely than not at the time of the stabbing his capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by his severe depressive illness which I am satisfied the prisoner failed to do.  
     
      
    46 Consistent with the approach taken at trial, the Crown did not suggest at the proceedings on sentence that at the time of the commission of the offence the prisoner was not suffering from a chronic and severe mental illness nor did the Crown suggest for the purpose of sentence that the Court would find that the killing was unprovoked. The Crown submits that the Court would be entitled to find, in relation to mitigating factors, that the prisoner was provoked by the annoying and inconsistent conduct of the deceased – that is, that it may have disposed him to become angry or lose his temper. Mr Bodor contends that something occurred that was provocative to the prisoner given his dysfunctional nature and his clear mental illness, but insufficient in law to give him the benefit of that provocation before the jury. 47 Dr Nielssen had diagnosed the prisoner as having a recurrent depressive illness, alcohol abuse and personality disorder. During his evidence, Dr Nielssen said at T 289 L 16-22: 
     
      
       
        
        “But I would say that it probably, his condition, as I understand it, a state of unstable mood with depression arising from an unstable personality. Because I think that’s probably my main diagnosis; that probably it would not have affected his perception of events or understanding of right and wrong to a great degree.  
        But it may have affected his capacity to control his actions because of sudden severe mood swings associated with the condition 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    48 Dr Giuffrida diagnosed a longstanding and pervasive severe depression. The prisoner also had a chronic anxiety disorder, panic attacks and a specific social phobia. The psychiatrist concluded that the prisoner was a very impaired man who had a constellation of anxiety depressive illnesses. He opined:  
     
      
       
        
        “I think that he had such a pervasive depression, I think it is inevitable to some extent it would simply have clouded this man’s judgment to a major degree. I couldn’t find anything directly from what he said, that said to me he didn’t understand what he was doing or that he didn’t understand that it was morally or legally wrong.  
        But I think that there was probably a loss of control element in this case.  
        I think that there is, throughout his history, a kind of impulsiveness and it is a very unfortunate combination to have that sort of personality, of impulsiveness, in the context of someone with a major depressive illness that is ongoing. So I think the loss of control element that goes towards section 23A, towards substantial impairment, was there.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    49 In a report dated 7 July 2008 which was tendered during the proceedings on sentence Dr Giuffrida wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “I remain of the view that Mr Faehndrich has probably suffered from a life-long chronic  
        dysthymia 
         although that in any case is quite consistent with an underlying  
        borderline personality disorder 
        . I remain of the view that there were very definite periods when the nature and severity of depression would satisfy the diagnosis of a  
        major depression 
        . I think there is more than adequate evidence on his history that he has suffered from a very significant generalised chronic anxiety disorder and has had episodes of panic disorder. He probably also suffers chronically from a range of anxiety related disorders including social phobia and agoraphobia. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In my previous report of the 5 February 2007, I said that I did not think at that time Mr Faehndrich had a  
        borderline personality disorder 
        , although on the further evidence available to me from the documents provided, it would seem that there is an inescapable conclusion that Mr Faehndrich does in fact suffer from a borderline personality disorder in the moderate to severe range.” 
        
       
      
    50 When reviewing the material forwarded to him which included a report dated 27 January 1995 from Dr Les Darcy, Dr Giuffrida observed that:  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Faehndrich also demonstrates a picture of serious affective instability resulting from a marked reactivity of mood.  
        There is also clearly a pattern of inappropriate and intensive anger and rage directed particularly towards those women who have attempted to break off a relationship with him.”  
        (Italics added)  
        
       
      
    51 The prisoner told the jury that his relationship with the deceased by August was quite volatile – very nice at one moment and the next moment it would change completely. He had given evidence that her drug taking was a source of conflict between them and when she took drugs her whole demeanour would change. He recounted that the deceased had called him a “rock spider” when they were watching television on 10 August 2006 for which she apologised by text message. On the next day she bought him a bracelet. He described spending the Friday together and having their ups and downs. Things would be fine one minute and the next minute she would verbally attack him. He said he wouldn’t know whether he was coming or going. He recounted the deceased’s upset on the Saturday when he wouldn’t buy a dolphin ring for her and said that he felt “she was pushing all [his] buttons”. He felt that she was just using him, that one minute she would be building him up and the next minute she would be attacking him. 
     
      
    52 The text message at 6.19pm on 10 August retrieved from the deceased’s mobile phone by Senior Constable Kauter and the evidence of Miss Keating the shop assistant supported this evidence. 
     
      
    53 As I have said at [28], the relationship between the deceased and the prisoner was turbulent. I accept that the prisoner at times did not know where he stood with Miss Condon which was the case on the day before she died.  
     
      
    54 The prisoner at the time of the commission of the offence suffered from various mental illnesses which included a longstanding and pervasive depression and an underlying personality disorder. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his mental illness contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way. His mental illness affected his capacity to control his anger and rage when he became aware of the deceased’s intention to leave him. The prisoner’s moral culpability for his offending is reduced by reason of his mental illness and the objective seriousness of the offence is mitigated by the presence of this factor: s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Hemsley  [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36], R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]. 
     
      
    55 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the deceased was not such that could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. I am, however, satisfied on the probabilities that the changes in the deceased’s attitude and behaviour towards him contributed to the loss of self-control. To this extent, I find that the prisoner was provoked by the deceased which mitigates the objective seriousness of the offence: s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Having made that finding, I hasten to add that Miss Condon was entitled to end the relationship whenever she chose to do so. The deceased sadly would not have been aware of the impact that her volatility in the relationship was having upon the prisoner. 
     
      
    56 It is a factor in mitigation that the murder was not planned: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    57 As this is an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, it is necessary to consider where the offence committed by the prisoner lies on the range of objective seriousness of the offence of murder. The Crown invites me to find that having regard to the serious mental illness of the prisoner, this killing falls into the middle range of objective seriousness. Mr Bodor does not dispute the Crown’s proposition that this murder falls within the middle range of objective seriousness but submits that it is at the lower end of that range. 
     
      
    58 The ferocity of the attack upon the deceased increases, to my mind, the objective seriousness of the offence and places the offence slightly above the middle range of objective seriousness. The prisoner’s mental illness, the limited provocation and the lack of planning are factors which mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence. I conclude that the offence is to be characterised in the lower half of the middle range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    59 The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procdure) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).  
     
      
    60 Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    61 The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the prisoner’s culpability is: see R v Merritt (2004) 146 A Crim R 309 at [52]. As I have found at [58], the prisoner’s level of culpability is not such that his crime falls within the worst category of the offence of murder.  
     
      
    62 The prisoner’s criminal history includes convictions for assault (1989, 1993, 1996) breaches of apprehended violence orders (1992, 1994) and breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders (1992, 1994, 1995). On 6 June 2005, for an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced in the Local Court at Port Macquarie to a term of imprisonment for 6 months which was suspended upon his entering in a s 12 bond for 6 months with Probation and Parole supervision. There also appear on his record convictions for embezzlement (1992) and stealing (1988,1993). That criminal history deprives the prisoner of the considerations of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. I do not take his prior criminal offending into account as a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    63 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was a partial acceptance by the prisoner of responsibility for the deceased’s death. He, however, during the trial maintained that he had been attacked by the deceased. In his letter dated 31 May 2008, the prisoner expresses his “deepest unreserved remorse for causing the death of Dianne Condon”. He writes that “there has not been a day go by that I have not wished that I could turn back time. I say this not because of the predicament that I now find myself in but because I am so terribly sorry Dianne is dead and that I am the cause of her death”. He expresses his deepest regret to the deceased’s family and his appreciation for the pain they must feel for her loss and the further trauma they must have experienced in giving evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    64 Remorse as a mitigating factor is now qualified by s 21A(3)(i)-(ii) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires the prisoner to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. 
     
      
    65 A favourable consideration of his remorse was encouraged by his acceptance in the passage from the letter that I have quoted at [32] that the cause of the death was his loss of self-control when confronted with the possibility that the deceased was going to leave him and his unconditional acceptance of the jury’s verdict. It seemed that the prisoner had totally accepted responsibility for his actions as well as acknowledging the loss and injury which they caused. What has been written in the letter, however, is to be balanced against Dr Giuffrida’s account of his interview with the prisoner on 28 June 2008 which postdates the letter. Dr Giuffrida wrote (at page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “…He said that he felt remorseful about the killing and he admitted ‘my attack was excessive’. On the other hand he insisted that Diane [sic] had attacked him with a pair of scissors and that he acted in self-defence. I pointed out to him the apparent inconsistency on the one hand between his saying that he acted in self defence when Diane [sic] attacked him with a pair of scissors and his statement that his attack was excessive and more so that she was a relatively slight woman [and he] was a tall and heavily built man. He responded to this saying “I have to accept the decision of the jury. I would have found me guilty too…I lost it…I still have a blank for what happened.” 
        
       
      
    66 And further (at page 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “He appeared to still cling to the idea that he stabbed the victim in self defence. He was not easily disabused of that notion.” 
        
       
      
    67 It appears, notwithstanding what is stated in the prisoner’s letter to me, that the prisoner continues to maintain that he was attacked. Whilst I accept that he regrets having killed Miss Condon and has acknowledged her tragic loss, I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that his acceptance of responsibility extends beyond the use of excessive force and that he at this time, takes full responsibility for the killing. I take into account to this extent remorse as a mitigating factor.  
     
      
    68 The prisoner was born on 19 May 1956 and is 52 years of age. He was 50 years old at the time of the murder. The prisoner did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. During the trial, he informed the jury of his subjective circumstances. He was brought up in Waratah, Newcastle by his parents who had migrated to Australia from Germany. He described not having a normal relationship with his parents who had high expectations for him. They had grown up with the Hitler Youth and had the concept of “the Aryan race”. He had expectations placed on him as a young boy, the consequences of failure being verbal and physical abuse. There were times when he would be locked in a dark room. There would be other times when he defecated in his pants and his mother would put it in his mouth and make him eat it. His mother would strap him with a cat-o’-nine-tails. He was not allowed to have friends around and was treated in a way that he interpreted as being somewhat programmed. His studies suffered at age 15 when he felt different from other people and could not cope. There were times when he missed out on exams because he feared a bad result. He had difficulties with panic attacks and experienced claustrophobia. He had suicidal thoughts and sought medical help during his first year at university. 
     
      
    69 The jury was told that he married when 21 years old and the marriage lasted for some 10 years. He did not have a problem obtaining employment but experienced difficulties holding onto a job. There were times he was on sickness benefits caused by depression. The marriage broke down, he believed, because of his inability to cope with his family and his depressive state. He had consulted a number of doctors and was on medication from time to time. The prisoner entered into another relationship which ended in 1995. He described experiencing periods of severe depression and being admitted to Port Macquarie Hospital. There followed admissions to the mental health ward at Maitland Hospital and to the Port Macquarie Hospital for his severe depression. Dr Hines had diagnosed a bipolar disorder and he was placed on a series of lithium. At the time of Miss Condon’s death he was on a disability pension which, he understood, was granted for bipolar disorder. 
     
      
    70 I accept that the prisoner’s personal circumstances have been difficult. He has experienced over his lifetime a gradual escalating pattern of episodes of major depression. As Dr Giuffrida deposed, he was “a man with a very considerable psychological disturbance”.  
     
      
    71 In the prisoner’s case his mental illness renders him in an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and I give little weight to that factor. Such a killing in a domestic relationship would otherwise have called for a strong element of general deterrence: Hemsley; R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71.  
     
      
    72 On the other hand, in cases involving mental illness, there is a countervailing consideration which may arise, namely the need to evaluate the danger that the offender presents to the community. This necessitates consideration of the need for specific deterrence. Engert at [68], Hemsley at [36]. 
     
      
    73 There is on this issue a difference in the opinions expressed by the psychiatrists.  
     
      
    74 In the present case there can be no doubt that as a consequence of his mental illness the prisoner found it difficult to control his anger and rage towards the deceased who was going to leave him. His inability to control his anger has affected his relationship with women, other than the deceased, which was recognised by Dr Giuffrida in the passage quoted at [50] above. 
     
      
    75 Dr Nielssen in a report dated 2 June 2008 (exhibit C on sentence), after noting the prisoner’s age, observed that the risk of all kinds of offending, especially violent offences declines to low levels with advanced age. He expressed the opinion that the prisoner’s “psychiatric disorder increases the risk of further impulsive behaviour associated with periods of severe depression”. Dr Nielssen observed that the prisoner seemed to have responded to consistent treatment for depression in an alcohol free environment and the effect of his unstable personality may be less noticeable if he were to remain abstinent from alcohol.  
     
      
    76 Dr Giuffrida made a risk assessment using the HCR–20, a risk assessment instrument. The prisoner’s score was 35 out of 40 which placed the prisoner at high risk of future violence. He wrote (at page 9):  
     
      
       
        
        “From a purely clinical perspective, the critical issue of future risk of violence and dangerousness relates to Mr Faehndrich’s severe borderline personality disorder and to a considerable extent the anxiety and depressive symptoms he experiences which are very considerable and indeed disabling. I note that Mr Faehndrich is now 52 years of age, an age by which most personality disorders start to ameliorate and become less destructive or disabling to self and others. On the other hand, the pattern of self destructive behaviour and relationship instability has unfortunately been fairly constant over Mr Faehndrich’s adult life. Mr Faehndrich’s pattern of intense but unstable relationships with women repeatedly over his adult years with a pattern of idealisation in the early stages of the relationship giving way to devaluation and a sense that he has been betrayed and wronged when the woman tries to break away from that relationship gives me cause for concern about his future ability to form a stable and satisfying relationship in the future. Again from a clinical perspective, it would seem that the major risk factor for Mr Faehndrich in the future relates to a fairly narrow range of risks, that being towards women with whom he forms intimate relationships. The category of persons at future risk of harm by Mr Faehndrich really narrows down to those women with whom he forms an intimate relationship and where the same pattern of intense idealisation and ultimate sense of betrayal and devaluation occurs.”  
        
       
      
    77 And (at page 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the significant risk issue of Mr Faehndrich’s Borderline Personality Disorder, that condition has often proved quite resistant to a range of psychotherapeutic endeavours. Nonetheless there is some modest evidence that long term psychotherapy and one is talking about initially regular weekly therapy continuing over five years or so that there can be long term benefit. In Mr Faehndrich’s case the thrust of such therapy should ideally be aimed at achieving an understanding and insight into the nature of his intrapsychic dynamics and the way his intense psychological needs and dependency interfere with the smooth, effective and appropriate interpersonal relationships that he develops. He needs to be able to identify in particular the distortions in his perception of the other party in the relationship and the way that in turn effects his emotional responses and in turn his conduct towards the other person. Whether that is achievable remains to be seen.” 
        
       
      
    78 Mr Bodor submits that the prisoner is not the risk that Dr Giuffrida presumes and that Dr Nielssen takes a more realistic approach recognising the risk of repeated homicide offences is especially low. He refers to the prisoner’s advanced years upon release and his genuine commitment towards his rehabilitation. The Crown points out in oral submissions that the prisoner has a history of not accepting the termination of a relationship. It doesn’t flow, the Crown contends, that as he gets older in life that necessarily he will cease to have relationships with women. The nature of them may physically change but he also seems, the Crown argues, to adopt a relationship where he becomes dependent upon them, they co-dependent upon him and it is from that he has the difficulty of leaving. The Crown submits that the Court should not find he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. In written submissions, the Crown submits that there is a need for specific deterrence.  
     
      
    79 The prisoner’s efforts whilst he had been in custody towards his rehabilitation which are detailed in his letter are encouraging. They are supported by the testimonial from Reverend King, the education credit certificates and his employment record. Imprisonment, he states “has brought some structure into my life”. He acknowledges the need to continue counselling and medication and his acceptance of whatever the medical experts deem necessary as continued treatment in gaol and upon release.  
     
      
    80 The level of danger which the prisoner presents to the community arising from the conditions which diminish his capacity for self-control I conclude is confined to women with whom he may develop an intimate relationship.  
     
      
    81 I accept that the danger will decrease with age. I am not satisfied, however, that it will diminish entirely. Whilst Dr Giuffrida’s opinion might be considered to represent an overly pessimistic view of the risk of re-offending upon release, I have no doubt that much will depend upon the insight the prisoner develops into his mental illness whilst serving his sentence. There is, in my opinion, a need for a limited element of specific deterrence in the sentence. I have kept in mind the principle of proportionality and that the sentence is not to be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    82 I am unable to find that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend. That does not mean that I find that he has no prospects of rehabilitation. To do so would ignore the positive steps which he has taken whilst incarcerated. His future prospects remain uncertain.  
     
      
    83 Mental illness may be of further relevance in the sentencing task where it is established that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Hemsley at [35]. That is not the case with this prisoner.  
     
      
    84 Victim impact statements of Jason Condon and Darren Blatch have been tendered. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the prisoner’s sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 97 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    85 The prisoner has been in custody for the offence since 21 August 2006. Accordingly, the sentence will commence on that date.  
     
      
    86 The characterisation of the offence at [58] as being in the lower half of the middle range of objective seriousness, the little weight given to general deterrence and the prisoner’s age are matters which justify departure from the application of the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    87 The appropriate head sentence is 20 years imprisonment. I do not find any special circumstances which justify the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. The prisoner’s mental illness and age have already been taken into account in reducing the head sentence and to take them into account as special circumstances would amount to “double counting”: see R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. 
     
      
    88 John Harry Faehndrich, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years which is to commence on 21 August 2006 and is to expire on 20 August 2021. I set a balance of term of 5 years which is to commence on 21 August 2021 and will expire on 20 August 2026.  
     
      
    89 You will be eligible to be released to parole on 20 August 2021. It is a condition of your release to parole that you continue under psychiatric treatment and receive appropriate medication.  
     
      
    90 In accordance with Dr Giuffrida’s report, I recommend that the following steps being taken by Justice Health: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The prisoner should be immediately assessed by the Justice Mental Health Team. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The prisoner is to remain under the regular care of a psychiatrist whilst in custody and receive appropriate medication. 
        
       
       
       
      I direct that a copy of Dr Giuffrida’s report dated 7 July 2008 be forwarded by the Crown to the Justice Mental Health Team at the prison where the prisoner is incarcerated for its immediate attention together with a copy of these recommendations. The attention of the Justice Mental Health Team is to be directed to the “Treatment Recommendations” on page 10 of the report.

    4 On 27 November 2006 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that he on or about 29 July 2005 and 30 July 2005, at Orchard Hills, St Marys, Prospect and other places in the State of New South Wales did take [CD] without her consent and with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to intimidate the said [CD] to fear harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the said taking, actual bodily harm was occasioned to the said [CD]. 
     
      
    5 The offence being one of aggravated kidnapping contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 is punishable by 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period has not been prescribed for this offence. 
     
      
    6 Two matters on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence namely: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Aggravated kidnapping contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , the particulars of which were that on 30 July 2005, at Prospect, Kingswood, Campbelltown and other places, the applicant took [CD] without her consent, with an intention of obtaining an advantage, namely, to intimidate the said [CD] to fear harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the said taking, actual bodily harm was occasioned to [CD].  
        
       
       
        
        (b) Steal motor vehicle contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , the particulars of which were that on 31 July 2005 at Penrith, the applicant stole a Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle, the property of [CD]. The maximum penalty for this offence is a term of 5 years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    7 The Judge allowed a utilitarian discount of a little over twenty per cent for the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 9 October 2006 and to expire on 8 October 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 8 October 2017. 
     
      
    9 The notice of appeal identifies four grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour failed to properly backdate the sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour failed to properly consider and apply the principle of totality to the sentence imposed.  
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour, having found special circumstances, failed to reflect that finding in the non-parole period ultimately imposed. 
        
       
      
     4. The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    10 The offence (and the matters on the Form 1) occurred over the course of the weekend of Saturday 30 and Sunday 31 July 2005. It is necessary to detail the facts of the applicant’s offending to appreciate its seriousness. The facts are mainly derived from an agreed statement of facts which was tendered during the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    11 The applicant and the victim had been in a relationship for about two months which had been terminated a couple of days before the offence. On Friday 29 July 2005, the victim was at the home of a friend in Penrith. At around midnight, the applicant came to the house and asked her to give him a lift in her car. He directed her to a semi-rural road at Orchard Hills with no street lighting. As they drove along the road, the applicant pulled the hand brake on and made the victim stop the car. He started yelling and screaming at the victim and told her to get out of the driver’s seat and get into the passenger’s seat. The applicant then took control of the car and drove to a nearby street where he stopped the vehicle. He got out, walked around to the passenger’s side and ordered her out of the car. He was armed with a knife with a 20cm blade. The applicant pushed and shoved the victim and made her walk into one of the paddocks. He pushed her to the ground with her face down. He then kicked her, punched her in the ribs and in the head. She was ordered to put her hands behind her back. Her hands and feet were then tied together with silver coloured duct tape. A piece of tape was placed over her mouth.  
     
      
       
      The applicant screamed at the victim calling her a dog and threatened to kill her. He said he had a “ 
      fit full of beaut 
      ”. The victim understood by this that he was threatening to kill her by injecting her with a substance. He also cut her foot with the knife and held the knife under her nose and said he would cut her nose off. The applicant also held the knife to the victim’s throat. The victim managed to get her hands free and struggle with him. She tried to get the knife from him and during the struggle he cut the palm of his hand. The victim then lost consciousness. The victim recalled being on the ground with the applicant standing over her yelling at her to get up. The applicant, who still had the knife, made the victim get up and told her to get back into the car. He then demanded her telephone which she gave to him. After she got into the car he drove off 
       
       
      At around 5.50am he stopped at a Service Station at St Marys. The victim went to the toilet and bought a drink. She asked the operator for help but he didn’t say or do anything and she had to return to the car. The operator later made a statement telling police that when the victim approached him she had bruises on her face and appeared upset. She was weeping. She moved her mouth, said the word “Help” and then walked to the toilet.  
       
       
      The applicant then drove to his home at Prospect which he shared with [AB], arriving at about 7am. He fell asleep on the lounge. The victim sat down and spoke to Ms [AB]. She had the duct tape attached around her wrists and ankles which Ms [AB] cut away. The victim thought about running away but she was sore and didn’t know where to go. The applicant woke up after a short time. He yelled at her, called her names and said that she was going to die. After he had a shower he screamed at the victim to get back in the car. He told the victim he was driving them to a house at Kingswood. While they were in the car, he yelled at her and punched her. She was told that he was going to keep her hostage for a month. When they pulled up at a set of traffic lights the applicant leaned over and punched the victim with a closed fist. He took the gear knob off and hit her with it.  
       
       
      They drove to an address at Kingswood where the victim was taken into a garage. He tied the victim’s hands behind her back with zip ties and ordered her to sit on the garage floor. They stayed in the garage for part of that day. The applicant hit her and kicked her many times. He also hit her once on the head with a black metal bar. That afternoon she was driven back to her friend’s house at Penrith as the applicant wanted to get the victim’s other mobile phones. At first only he got out of the car. As he could not find the phones the victim got out of the car and went inside. Her friend asked her if she was alright. As the applicant was there the victim felt she could not say anything. He had made her wear sunglasses to cover the bruises on her face. Once the mobile phones were found, they sat in the car. The victim’s friend had asked the applicant “When is she coming back?” The applicant pointed at the friend and said, “You won’t be seeing her for a very long time.” While they were sitting in the car he received a phone call from someone who said the Police had been called so he drove to a house in the Campbelltown area. By this stage it was late in the afternoon on Saturday 30 July 2005. While they were in the car throughout that day, the applicant had punched the victim in the head, chest and ribs. He asked her questions. If she didn’t know the answer, or if he felt she was lying, he would punch her.  
       
       
      It was dark by the time they arrived at the Campbelltown house. The applicant told the victim that he was going to keep her there. He said he had a number of friends and he was going to let them have sex with her. He also said that there was a cellar at the house and he was going to put her down there. They went inside the house. There were a couple of women inside the house who tried to speak to the victim. The applicant told them not to speak to her because she was  
      “just a dog”. 
       Whilst at the house he slapped her to the face once and yelled at her, calling her a dog. 
       
       
      Soon after they arrived at the house, the applicant went into the bathroom. When he came out his demeanour had changed and he was nice towards the victim. She telephoned her friend that night and told her that she would be back on Sunday “about 11.30am”. No further incident occurred that night and the applicant and the victim spent the night at the house. The victim was still scared of the applicant and unsure if his behaviour would change.  
       
       
      The following morning the applicant drove the victim back to the friend’s house at Penrith arriving around midday. She walked inside and the applicant drove off in her car. Later that day she told her friend what had happened.  
       
       
      The next day the victim went to the Nepean Hospital. She was seen in the Emergency Department. She complained of pain to her face, head, right knee and ribs. A doctor examined her face (including two black eyes), her ribs, right knee, throat and the back of her neck. She had a superficial stab wound to her left foot. 
       
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    12 The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a report from Dr Anthony Samuels, a forensic psychiatrist, and a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was born on 20 February 1967 and at the time of offence was aged 38 years. He was one of four children with older twin brothers and a younger sister. His father was a violent alcoholic and left the family when the applicant was nine years old. He lived with his mother the majority of the time, with some periods spent with his father. He left school in year 6 at age 13. He has no formal qualifications and apart from a period of employment as a labourer between the ages of 21 and 25, he had been unemployed. For eight years prior to sentence he had received a Disability Support Pension. He was divorced after a marriage of nine years. He entered into another relationship which lasted for five years until his partner died. The applicant has two children from this union who were 15 and 17 years old at the time of sentence. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that his life “fell apart” following his partner’s death. Due to his lifestyle of drug abuse and lawlessness his children were removed from his care following the intervention of the Department of Community Services.  
     
      
    14 His lengthy history of illicit drug abuse commenced when he was 15 years old with cannabis and “acid trips”. At the age of 17, he commenced using amphetamines and crystal methamphetamine colloquially known as “speed” and “ice”. He developed a daily addiction to these drugs and reported that the only time he was “drug free” was when he was in gaol. Whilst in custody for the present offence, the applicant entered the methadone program and was on a 115mg dose at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    15 The applicant told the author of the pre-sentence report that his daughter had been sexually abused and approximately four days before he committed the offence he had learnt the details of the abuse. On the day of the offence, he had a bad reaction to a shot of “speed”, had subsequently “lost it” and proceeded to commit the offence. 
     
      
    16 Dr Samuels considered that the applicant has had a significant poly-substance abuse history. His alcohol abuse did not appear to have been a recent problem. Dr Samuels opined that the applicant had developed mood and anxiety symptoms as well as some psychotic symptoms in the form of paranoia and perceptual disturbances. He was no longer using illicit substances and had been on a low dose of an antipsychotic medication. The psychologist regarded him as having antisocial personality features. The applicant had expressed remorse to the psychologist for what had happened and was keen to become drug free.  
     
      
    17 A statement from Sandra Laycock, a drug and alcohol counsellor with the Department of Corrective Services, was tendered (exhibit J) which disclosed that the applicant was regularly having one on one sessions on a voluntary basis with the counsellor, had regularly attended voluntary group sessions and had become aware that he had many issues to address.  
     
      
    18 The applicant’s extensive criminal history includes convictions for offences of violence and dishonesty. Terms of imprisonment have been previously imposed for offences of assault, making a false instrument, attempt stealing of a motor vehicle, possession of implement capable of entering a conveyance, possession/use of prohibited weapon, supply and possession of prohibited drugs, stalk/intimidate with intention to cause physical/mental harm, enter dwelling with intention to steal, take and drive conveyance without consent of owner, possess shortened firearm (not pistol) without authority, goods in personal custody reasonably suspected of being stolen and escape from lawful custody. 
     
      
    19 For the offence of escape from lawful custody, he was sentenced in the District Court at Sydney on 20 June 2003 to imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 29 August 2004 and expiring on 28 February 2006 with a non-parole period of 6 months expiring on 28 February 2005. The applicant was released to parole on that day.  
     
      
    20 The present offence was committed whilst he was subject to parole. His parole was revoked on 18 August 2005 and the applicant commenced serving the balance of parole when he was arrested on 9 October 2005. The revocation of the parole order expired on 10 May 2006.  
     
      
    21 On 28 October 2005, the applicant was sentenced in the Local Court at Campbelltown to concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 8 months for offences of take and drive a motor vehicle, drive whilst disqualified, driving furiously and entering a dwelling to commit a felony. The term of the sentences commenced on 9 October 2005 and expired on 8 October 2006. The non-parole period expired on 8 June 2006.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the Appeal  
       
      
    Ground one - His Honour failed to properly backdate the sentence.  
     
      
    22 The Crown concedes that this ground of appeal has been established. The commencement date of the sentence was 9 October 2006 which resulted from the Crown’s indication to his Honour that that was the date on which the applicant had been bail refused solely for the matters for which he was to be sentenced. The correct date was 9 June 2006 as the non-parole period of the sentence imposed by the Local Court expired on 8 June 2006 with the full term of the sentence expiring on 8 October 2006. As he was bail refused for the present offences, he remained in custody after 8 June 2006. He was otherwise entitled to be released to parole.  
     
      
    23 Section 24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In sentencing an offender, the Court must take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) anytime for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to that offence…” 
          
         
        
       
       
      His Honour was obliged by s 24(a) to take into account the time the applicant had been held in custody in relation to the offence which his Honour inadvertently did not do as the sentence he imposed commenced after the expiration of the full term of the Local Court sentence. The sentence should have been backdated to commence from 9 June 2006.  
       
       
      Ground two - His Honour failed to properly consider and apply the principle of totality to the sentence imposed.  
       
      
    24 It was submitted for the applicant that his Honour was required to take into account the existing sentence which was being served and consider with respect to that sentence whether the aggregate sentence was ‘just and appropriate’ to the totality of the offending behaviour. At no stage did his Honour, it was argued, consider the issue of the totality of the sentences imposed including the sentence for which he had previously been sentenced. The sentence should have been made partially concurrent with the previous sentence. During oral submissions in this Court, counsel argued that the effect of the sentence flowing on from a sentence of a full year for the other matters was to impose a starting point of 15 years rather than the Judge’s starting point of 14 years. The submission was confined to the sentence imposed in the Campbelltown Local Court and did not include the custody served as a result of the revocation of parole. In view of the Crown’s concession as to the first ground of appeal, the applicant’s complaint as to the accumulative effect of the Local Court sentence is reduced to 8 months.  
     
      
    25 No submission was made for the applicant before the Judge that he should take into account the time spent in custody for the Local Court offences and his Honour did not refer to the principle of totality in his sentencing remarks.  
     
      
    26 Whether a sentence is to be served concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively on an existing sentence is determined by the application of the principle of totality. As was explained by the Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11]:  
     
      
       
        
        “One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in  
        Mill v The Queen 
         (1988) 166 CLR 59;  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 and  
        Johnson v The Queen 
         (2004) 78 ALJR 616.” 
        
       
      
    27 The totality principle is designed to avoid a court imposing a “crushing sentence” in the sense that “it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release”: R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [17].  
     
      
    28 The sentence imposed by his Honour taking into account the 8 months the applicant had previously served, the total period he would spend in custody and his age of 38 years was not, in my opinion, a “crushing” sentence. It cannot be characterised as destroying any expectation of a useful life after release.  
     
      
    29 In any event, the totality principle, in my view, did not apply as the applicant was not serving an existing sentence when he came to be sentenced by the Judge. The full term of the Local Court sentence had expired on 8 October 2006. He had from that time been in custody for the offence for which he was to be sentenced because bail had been refused on 24 October 2005.  
     
      
    30 This Court has previously considered the application of the principle of totality to a sentence that had commenced and expired during an offender’s time in custody on remand for an offence for which he was to be sentenced.  
     
      
    31 In Huntington v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 196, the applicant was convicted of one count of assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act and one count of commit an act of indecency contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act. On 1 September 2006, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for a fixed term of 80 days in respect of the first offence and to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 months with an additional period of 5 months in respect of the second offence. Each sentence was backdated to commence on 8 May 2006. The applicant had been arrested on 8 January 2006 and had remained in custody bail refused since that time. On 19 May 2006, he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months for use offensive weapon. The non-parole period commenced on 9 November 2005 and expired on 8 May 2006. It was agreed by both parties at the sentencing hearing that the applicant’s custody in relation to the offences for which he was to be sentenced dated from 8 May 2006, from which date the sentencing Judge commenced the sentences. It was argued on appeal that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the pre-sentence custody and in failing to apply the principle of totality. Hislop J (with whom Giles JA and James J agreed) in rejecting this ground of appeal said at [26]: 
     
      
       
       “Save in exceptional cases, the general principle is that although when a person is being sentenced for an offence a period which he has already spent in custody in relation to that offence should be taken into account, a period which the person has spent in custody in respect of an unrelated offence should not be taken into account –  
       R v Niass 
        (unreported NSWCCA 16 November 1988);  
       R v John David 
        (unreported NSWCCA 20 April 1995). The present is not an exceptional case.” 
       
      
    32 There is, in my opinion, nothing about the present case which makes it exceptional. 
     
      
    33 The second ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground three 
       -  
      his Honour having found special circumstances, failed to reflect that finding in the non-parole period ultimately imposed.  
       
      
    34 The applicant complains that although his Honour found special circumstances, the non-parole period was reduced only by two months. It was submitted that such a minor reduction failed to properly implement the Judge’s finding of special circumstances and a greater reduction in the non-parole period was called for. It was also submitted that his Honour’s finding that imprisonment would provide opportunities for the applicant’s rehabilitation through the provision of programs available to those held in custody was contrary to the evidence as to the almost insurmountable difficulties he faced in being able to attend rehabilitation programs to address his drug problem.  
     
      
    35 As to this last submission, there had been discussion during the sentencing proceedings on 1 June 2007 as to whether the applicant’s escape classification would restrict or prohibit his access to rehabilitation programs. Prior to sentencing the applicant on 14 June 2007 the statement from Sandra Laycock to which I have referred at para 17 above was tendered and marked exhibit J. As I have recited, the statement made reference to the applicant’s contact with Ms Laycock on a regular basis to address his issues in one to one counselling sessions and that he had attended group programs on a regular basis. He was then classified as an “EIU” (Escape High Risk Unsentenced) prisoner. Ms Laycock went on to recount that as a result of a future sentence, he “would be classified as a sentenced E1 or E2 inmate…” and “with [this] classification it is almost impossible for him to attend group Alcohol and Other Drug Programmes and can be very difficult to do one to one counselling due to high demand for this service”.  
     
      
    36 It is evident that his Honour did not overlook the difficulties of access to rehabilitation programs which arose from his prison classification. The Judge expressly referred to exhibit J in his sentencing remarks. It was open to his Honour to find that the applicant required the discipline of the custodial setting to maximise the opportunities for rehabilitation and he could, if he wished, take advantage of those programs that he might be offered whilst in custody.  
     
      
    37 During his remarks on sentence, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have also turned my mind to the question of special circumstances. I am of the view that there are some limited circumstances to which I might apply this description, largely arising as a consequence of the submissions made to me today, regarding the lost opportunity to pursue remedial programs whilst in custody. The adjustment to the statutory ratio provided in s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , however, will not be great.  
        
       
       
        
        The sentence upon which I intend to settle will provide more than adequate time on parole for the adjustment of the offender from his custodial setting and his return to the community.” 
        
       
      
    38 Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances. As was observed in Regina v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 per Spigelman CJ at [31] the size of an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene”. The Court will usually not intervene unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive: see Cramp per Spigelman CJ at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19]. This is not such a case. No error by his Honour has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    Ground four – the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    39 Counsel for the applicant took issue with the Judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence being greater than the mid-range.  
     
      
    40 It was submitted that his Honour made factual errors with respect of the length of time that the victim had been held in captivity. The first contention was that his Honour said that the captivity commenced at 7am on the Friday morning when it in fact commenced at approximately midnight, some 17 or 18 hours later.  
     
      
    41 The agreed facts tendered on sentence disclosed that the victim’s detention commenced at about midnight on 29 July 2005. In his remarks on sentence under the heading “The Submissions of Counsel”, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown points out that detention was not for a short period but extended from about 7am on Friday 29 July 2005 until the following Sunday morning.” 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour had earlier summarised the agreed facts and had relevantly stated (ROS at 9):  
     
      
       
        
        “During the evening of Friday 29 July 2005, [CD] was at Penrith, the home of her friend [EF]. About midnight, the offender came to those premises and persuaded Ms [CD] to go with him.” 
        
       
      
    43 The incorrect reference to the commencement of the detention was made in the context of his Honour’s summary of the Crown submissions. It seems to me that what has occurred is no more than an inaccurate recounting of the Crown submissions. The Judge had previously accurately recited the agreed facts. I am not persuaded that the Judge made the factual error which is claimed.  
     
      
    44 The next factual error that his Honour is said to have made is that the applicant pleaded guilty to the single count on the indictment which related to the captivity which concluded at Prospect. The submission, as I understand it, is that the Judge erred when he said that the detention extended “until the following Sunday morning”. It was an agreed fact that the applicant arrived with the victim at his home at Prospect at about 7am on the Saturday morning. Later on that day he drove the victim to an address at Kingswood.  
     
      
    45 During his sentencing remarks, the Judge said (ROS at 33):  
     
      
       
        
        “The events, upon which the Crown relies for the principal charge, are those occurring from when the offender first took Ms [CD] through to the point where she was held at Prospect. The first of the additional offences occurred from when the offender took Ms [CD] from that address to Kingswood, returned to Ms [EF’s] house and then to Campbelltown before returning her finally to Ms [EF’s] house where she was released.” 
        
       
      
    46 It is plain from these remarks that his Honour was aware that the time of the detention for the count on the indictment ended when the victim was taken from Prospect. In any event, his Honour was entitled to take into account that the victim’s detention had continued from the time that they had left Prospect until her release about midday on Sunday. This was the first offence on the Form 1. No error was made by the Judge in respect of the length of time that the victim had been detained. 
     
      
    47 It was contended for the applicant that there were a number of unusual features in the commission of the offence which impacted upon the overall objective criminality displayed, the significance of which was not apparently fully appreciated by the Judge. The features which were pointed to included no physical assaults upon the victim after they arrived at the applicant’s home until the time of driving to Kingswood, the change of his demeanour after he emerged from the bathroom at the Campbelltown house, the telephone call by the victim to her friend on the Saturday night and her return to her friend’s home on the next day around noon. The objective nature of the criminality displayed after the applicant and the victim arrived at Campbelltown early in the Saturday evening was said to be of a very much lower order than it had been. 
     
      
    48 The applicant’s offending in the early hours of the Saturday morning involved a high degree of violence. The victim was forced from her vehicle at knife point, marched into a paddock and pushed to the ground. She was kicked, punched, bound and gagged. The applicant threatened to kill her by injecting her with a substance and to cut off her nose with a large knife which was held under her throat. He cut her foot with the knife. During the assaults she lost consciousness.  
     
      
    49 Although it is true that the degree of actual violence decreased from that time, the use of actual violence did not cease until some time after they arrived at the Campbelltown house. A very real threat of violence to the victim existed throughout the whole of the detention. After he woke up at the Prospect house, the applicant verbally abused the victim and told her that she was going to die. When she was being driven to Kingswood, his threats included telling her she would be kept as a hostage for a month. Whilst in the garage at Kingswood, the victim’s hands were tied with zip ties behind her back and she was hit and kicked many times. At the Campbelltown house, the applicant’s threats included sexual assault by his friends and her detention in a cellar.  
     
      
    50 In R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, this Court considered the offence of kidnapping contrary to s 86 of the Crimes Act. Howie J (with whom Bell and Hislop JJ agreed) said at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person. As his Honour noted, there are a number of factors that can be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence under s 86 including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain, is not, in my view, conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence.”  
        
       
      
    51 In view of the arguments advanced for the applicant, it is necessary to recognise that circumstances which increase the seriousness of the unlawful detention are not confined to the period within which the victim is detained or to the actual use of violence. A real threat of violence and the presence of a weapon, like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury are factors of aggravation even though actual injury may not be occasioned to the victim.  
     
      
    52 When actual bodily harm is occasioned and/or the kidnapping is committed in company, the statutory scheme for the offence of kidnapping in Division 14 of the Crimes Act elevates the basic offence (s 86(1)) to an aggravated offence (s 86(2)) or a specially aggravated offence under s 86(3). 
     
      
    53 Greater weight is to be given, in my view, to considerations of protection of society, general and specific deterrence when violence is threatened or actual violence is used in the kidnapping. 
     
      
    54 His Honour’s finding that the offence was “well above the middle of the range” of objective seriousness was essentially one of fact. I am not persuaded that the Judge overlooked a relevant consideration or that wrong principle was applied or that the finding was not open on the evidence: R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140, Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282. His Honour’s characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of the offence was open to him. In my view, this was a very serious offence.  
     
      
    55 The seriousness of the offence, as the Judge found, was aggravated by the fact that he was on parole at the time. The offences on the Form 1, particularly the first offence, were serious in their own right and his Honour was entitled to increase the sentence for the principal offence “to a significant extent” (ROS at 34) by taking them into account. His Honour was generous in his allowance of a discount for the plea and closely considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    56 A number of sentences imposed in other cases was attached to the applicant’s written submissions. None of the cases referred to persuade me that the sentence in this case was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    57 In my opinion, the sentence is within the upper end of an appropriate range and the undiscounted starting point of sentence of 14 years imprisonment does not manifest error. 58 The fourth ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    59 The applicant’s success upon appeal is confined to the commencement date of the sentence. I propose to re-sentence the applicant so that the sentence commences on 9 June 2006.  
     
      
    60 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
      
     (ii) Appeal allowed.  
     
      
       
      (iii) Quash the sentence in the District Court only to the extent of the commencement and expiration dates of the sentence. 
       
       
      The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 9 June 2006 and to expire on 8 June 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 8 June 2017. 
       
       
      The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release to parole is 8 June 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN J: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: Stephen Walter James Ryan seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. For an armed robbery committed on 19 March 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months dating from 2 November 2007. The charge was laid under s97(1) Crimes Act.3 On the afternoon of 19 March 2007, the applicant, aged 18, had been drinking alone. Shortly after 7.30pm the applicant entered the Bogas Service Station in Windsor Parade, Dubbo where Charles Rogers was working as the console operator. The applicant was armed with a knife. While Mr Rogers was bending down at a cupboard, the applicant grabbed Mr Rogers’ shirt, forcing him to stand up. The applicant pointed the knife at Mr Rogers and asked for money. Mr Rogers and the applicant went into the locked console, where Mr Rogers opened the cash register and placed cash into a plastic bag. He gave the applicant the plastic bag and two packets of cigarettes. As the applicant left the console area he cut the telephone cord and told Mr Rogers not to call the police.4 The entire incident was captured on closed circuit television and the footage was later shown on local television. There was no response by the public. Three days later, on 22 March 2007, the applicant, together with his parents, attended the Dubbo police station. He participated in an ERISP and made full admissions to the armed robbery. He also gave the police the plastic bag which contained most, if not all, of the money stolen from the service station.5 The applicant entered a plea of guilty in Dubbo Local Court on 8 June 2007 and maintained his plea in the District Court. He stood for sentence before Woods ADCJ on 31 October, 1 and 2 November 2007.6 The sentencing judge had before him affidavits sworn by the applicant, his mother, Teena Bonham and his father, Stephen Ryan senior. Annexed to the applicant’s affidavit was a work reference from the Dubbo Aboriginal Lands Councils, stating that the applicant had commenced maintenance work there in April 2007 and was a punctual and keen worker. 7 Ms Bonham stated that the applicant was deeply affected by the death of his cousin, Lana Ryan, in March 2005. Lana had lived with the applicant’s family “on and off” throughout her life, and the applicant regarded her as his older sister. Lana committed suicide while in the Bathurst Correctional Centre and Ms Bonham was of the view that her death affected the applicant “like nothing else.” Ms Bonham stated that the applicant began drinking heavily after Lana’s death and “in hindsight I feel that we did not assist [the applicant] with his grieving.”8 At the time of Lana’s death, the applicant was 16 years old. After her death, he did not return to school and eventually left home at the age of 17 to work on the gas line being constructed between Coolah and Tamworth. He lived in a labourers’ camp for 6 months and immersed himself in the drinking culture there. After returning to Dubbo, the applicant commenced working on the Community Development Employment Project and was later offered a carpentry apprenticeship with a building company. However, he continued to drink alcohol excessively and ceased work with the company around Christmas 2006. His family sent him to stay at an uncle’s home to dry out. He was then voluntarily admitted to “The Glen” rehabilitation centre. However, on 18 March 2007, the day before the offence, he was discharged from that program for using a mobile telephone to call his mother.9 Mr Ryan senior gave evidence that he had had difficulties himself with substance abuse but had successfully addressed these and was now a respected member of the local aboriginal community in Dubbo. Mr Ryan gave evidence of the changes in the applicant since the offence: “I think he’s been educated a bit since the incident. He’s said to us that he’s got to deal with the grief and loss issues which are making him – which help make him a substance abuser… He’s tried to – well, as far as I know he’s maintained zero tolerance with substances.”10 A psychological report prepared by Saskia Cowles-Low was also tendered. The history obtained indicates that the applicant was admitted to Orana Haven rehabilitation centre after the offence but was discharged because he drank alcohol following the death of an aunt. In a letter from Orana Haven, it appeared that two older inmates had “influenced” the applicant’s behaviour. Ms Cowles-Low concluded that the applicant was a person of low average intelligence who has a “limited repertoire of coping skills.” She was of the view that the applicant was suffering from a moderate major depressive disorder, alcohol dependences and substance dependence. She said “The depression is likely a reactive depression in relation to his cousin’s death. It is also a complex grief reaction compounded by his sense of guilt and self-blame.” Ms Cowles-Low was of the opinion that, in order to reduce his risk of re-offending, the applicant could be treated within the community by ongoing attendance at substance support groups, medical review of his depression and psychological counselling. Ms Cowles-Low also concluded that a custodial sentence would be particularly harmful since the applicant’s cousin had died in custody.11 The sentencing judge also had available to him two pre-sentence reports. The report of 19 July 2007 stated that the applicant was suitable for medium/high level supervision and that the Probation and Parole Service would direct him to attend loss and grief counselling and drug and alcohol relapse prevention and counselling. This recommendation was confirmed in the report of 17 September 2007. The applicant was assessed as being unsuitable for either a Community Service Order, because he had not remained in the community for 3 months drug and alcohol free at the time of writing the report, or periodic detention because the nearest centre in Bathurst is about 200 kilometres away from Dubbo.12 There are two grounds of appeal. They may be considered together. The first asserts that his Honour erred in two respects of his consideration of the guideline judgment in R v Henry and Others [1999] NSWCCA 111. The second asserts that the sentence is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    13 It was first submitted that his Honour erred in the assessment of the general range of s97(1) sentences given by this Court. It was submitted that his Honour had misled himself by considering a period of three to five years as being the non-parole period, producing a notional starting point of eight years, that with be compared to the guideline in Henry of a four to five year head sentence. 
     
      
    14 Secondly, it was submitted that his Honour erred by not giving full consideration to the subjective circumstances of the offence or that the offender’s behaviour was due to the effects of his alcohol and substance addiction. The complaint was that his Honour focused on intoxication at the time of the offence rather than giving consideration to “the applicant’s underlying impaired judgment”. Reference was made to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in Henry.  In R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 Hulme J stated at 58 - 
     
      
       
        
        …there would be cases where the general rule would not apply, for example where the addiction was the result of youth or medical treatment over which the offender had no relevant control.  
        
       
      
    15 It was submitted that his Honour did not give enough weight to these factors - 
     
      
    i. that the applicant developed an addiction to alcohol at the age of 17 years when he was living in labourers’ camp and isolated from his family, shortly after the suicide of his cousin; 
     
      
    ii. that following his commission of the offence, the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from an untreated moderate major depressive disorder arising from his cousin’s death; and  
     
      
    iii. that the applicant was assessed as having an information processing speed in the bottom 5th percentile of the community, so his ability to think ahead and consider consequences is limited. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted under the second ground of appeal that the offender should have been given a suspended sentence. Three arguments were made, first that his Honour erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, secondly that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the voluntary disclosure of the offence by the applicant and thirdly that the erroneous interpretation of Henry resulted in his Honour unduly fettering his discretion.17 Attention was drawn to the applicant’s youth, his major depressive disorder, his alcohol dependence, hist attempts at rehabilitation and to positive changes in his outlook and behaviour.18 In relation to the applicant’s voluntary disclosure, the applicant relied upon the prosecutor’s submissions at sentence that it was quite probable that police would have been unable to identify the offender save for his voluntary disclosure. Further, the fact that the applicant did not have a criminal record; that he had left Dubbo following the offence requiring him to travel back there to attend the police station; his immediate admission; and the return of the stolen money were matters that should have been given greater weight.19 In relation to the third argument, the applicant relied upon the JIRS statistics. Of the 159 offenders sentenced between October 2002 and September 2007, who like the applicant were aged between 18-20 years, pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions, 45% received sentences other than full-time imprisonment. 30% received suspended sentences, with or without supervision. It followed that there was no requirement for the circumstances to be “truly exceptional” or even “exceptional” to warrant a sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment.  
     
      
    20 It seems to me that the words spoken by his Honour and now complained of must be considered in context. Having reviewed the facts, his Honour referred to R v Henry and said (AB 11) -  
     
      
       
        
        …it does refer to a tariff range of between three and five years actual custody… 
        
       
      
    21 Later his Honour said (AB 15) -  
     
      
       
        
        Normally in such robberies of service stations I would have to be considering a starting point of around eight years… 
        
       
      
    22 Still later his Honour said (AB 15) -  
     
      
       
        
        So even considering a starting point could be in the upper bracket of penalties I will determine a starting point of five years and find that after giving allowance for the surrender to the police and return of the stolen money and the plea of guilty I would come to a head sentence of three years, which then after allowing for special circumstances I would reduce to a non-parole period of fifteen months. 
        
       
      
    23 The words attributed to his Honour at AB 11 appear erroneous. In R v Henry this Court was concerned with full terms, not non-parole periods. Whether his Honour would have been justified in “normally” working from a notional starting point of eight years for a head sentence does not really arise for consideration here, because, as the passage last extracted shows, his Honour did not do so in the present case. It appears to me that his Honour began with a notional starting point of five years’ full term, a figure within the range spoken of in R v Henry, and reduced both the head sentence and the non-parole period to allow for the favourable features of the case. I do not think that his Honour misled himself.  
     
      
    24 The submission that his Honour did not give full weight to the subjective circumstances of the offence and gave “little consideration” to the applicant’s underlying impaired judgment is a conclusion that could be contended for or arrived at only from the resulting sentence. What is clear is that his Honour was alive to these matters. He dealt with the two pre-sentence reports and the reports of those persons close to the applicant, as well with the psychological opinion of Ms Cowles-Low. It was apparent to his Honour that the applicant had been assessed as unsuitable for a Community Services Order or a Periodic Detention Order. His Honour dealt in detail with the applicant’s motivation, his substance abuse, his depression following upon the death of a near relative, his need for assistance and his prospects of rehabilitation. The sentence imposed – a non-parole period of one year and three months followed by a period of eligibility for parole of one year and nine months – is remarkably low for an offence of this kind, a hold-up by the use of a knife of a defenceless and vulnerable person at night. Such a sentence could be justified only by full and proper allowance for the important features I have mentioned. 
     
      
    25 The applicant was able to mount an impressive subjective case. There were his voluntary confession and restitution and the consequent plea of guilty, made early and maintained. But a subjective case, however strong, cannot be seen in isolation: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. His Honour had to consider the strong subjective case against the objective seriousness of the offence, with the danger from the knife occasioned to Mr Rogers, the distress deliberately caused to him and its serious effect upon him. Unfortunately he found himself unable to return to his occupation.  
     
      
    26 It does not seem to me that a proper weighing of these competing features was bound to produce a sentence less than that imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    27 It was submitted that statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales showed that between October 2002 and September 2007 16% of persons who had offended under s97(1) received sentences of less than full time imprisonment. It followed, it was submitted, that the trial judge had a discretion to impose a sentence upon the applicant of less than full time custody. 
     
      
    28 That may be so, but the question for this Court is not whether his Honour could have imposed such a sentence but whether his Honour was bound to do so, whether the sentence imposed was outside the proper range of sentencing discretion. In my opinion that has not been demonstrated.  
     
      
    29 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    30 PRICE J: I agree with Barr J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Price J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and the reasons therefore. As can be seen from his Honour’s reasons, this is a difficult appeal. At the sentencing, the Crown gave its imprimatur to the anticipated effective outcome of the sentencing judge’s views, though before his Honour delivered his sentencing remarks. These remarks, however, betrayed the errors identified by Price J. Also, the total effect of the sentences was a result which, in my view, should be seen as manifestly inadequate by reference to any reasonable appreciation of the seriousness of the offences, their repeated occurrence and the fact of commission while on conditional liberty. Giving the fullest weight possible to the respondent’s assertions of reform and rehabilitation and to the Crown’s approach at the sentencing hearing, it is necessary to increase the respondent’s sentences, at least, as identified by Price J.2 JAMES J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on the respondent in the District Court at Gosford on 7 February 2008 on the ground of manifest inadequacy. The respondent had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and came before the Judge for sentence on the following counts: 
     
      
       
       
        
        Count 1: Break and enter with intent contrary to  
         
         s 113(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7: Break, enter and steal contrary to  
         
          
           
            
             
              
              s 112(1) of the  
              Crimes Act 
              ; 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Steal motor vehicle contrary to  
         
          
           
            
             
              
              s 154AA(1) of the  
              Crimes Act. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
      
    4 The respondent asked the Judge to take into account on sentence 14 offences which had been included on a Form 1. Twelve of these matters were offences of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act. The remaining matters were an offence of break and enter with intent contrary to s 113(1) and an offence of attempt break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1). When sentencing the respondent, the Judge said that the offences included on the Form 1 had been taken into account in the sentence imposed for count 2.5 An offence contrary to s 154AA(1) of the Crimes Act is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. Offences contrary to s 112(1) are punishable by 14 years imprisonment whereas offences contrary to s 113(1) are punishable by imprisonment for 10 years. The standard non-parole period provisions do not apply to these offences.  
     
      
    6 The Judge found that all the pleas of guilty had been entered at the first reasonable opportunity and the respondent was entitled to the full utilitarian discount. Bearing in mind the utilitarian discount and the genuinely expressed remorse and contrition, a discount of 25 per cent was allowed.  
     
      
    7 The following sentences were imposed: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Fixed term of 15 months imprisonment to date from 12 December 2006 and expire on 11 March 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
         
        (including 14 Form 1 matters) Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 12 June 2007 and expire on 11 June 2009 with an additional term of 2 years 6 months to date from 12 June 2009 and expire on 11 December 2011; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Fixed term of 15 months imprisonment to date from 12 January 2007 and expire on 11 April 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: Fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to date from 12 February 2007 and expire on 11 August 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: Fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to date from 12 March 2007 and expire on 11 September 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6: Fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to date from 12 April 2007 and expire on 11 October 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7: Fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to date from 12 May 2007 and expire on 11 November 2008.  
        
       
      
    8 The total effective sentence imposed by the Judge was a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 12 December 2006 and expiring on 11 June 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months expiring on 11 December 2011.  
     
      
    9 The principles relevant to Crown appeals against sentence are well established and were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle "" 
        for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
        "": per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para 62.” 
         
          
        
       
      The offences 
       
      
    10 During the sentencing proceedings, an agreed statement of facts was tendered. The facts of each offence are mainly derived from that document. 
     
      
    11 The circumstances of count 1 (s 113(1) offence) were that between 5pm on 3 June 2005 and 7am on the next day the respondent broke into the business premises of Action Steel at Tuggerah. He accessed the Telstra roadside phone line pit and severed the telephone lines disabling the alarm system. He cut a hole in the chain link security fence and smashed an external alarm box. He then smashed a window and entered the building where he smashed an alarm control. Offices within the building were ransacked before the respondent left by a side door. 
     
      
    12 The circumstances of count 2 (s 112(1) offence) were that the respondent in the early hours of the morning on 7 February 2005 went to the Home Central complex at West Gosford. Having forcibly entered the control room, he severed Telstra cables to the Timberland store thereby disabling the alarm system. He then cut a hole in the perimeter fence, smashed a window in the front door of the Timberland store, entered the store and ransacked the counter and office area. In the rear storeroom, he located a safe which was bolted to the floor inside a cupboard. The respondent forced the safe from the cupboard and exited the building through the rear fire escape. The safe contained $284.83 in cheques and $4017.70 in cash. The safe and cash have not been recovered.  
     
      
    13 For count 3 (s 154AA(1) offence) the facts disclose that about 3am on 9 October 2004, the respondent cut a heavy chain securing vehicles in the yard of Skyline Auto Sales at Gosford. He smashed the windows of two motor vehicles in the yard which he moved. He then stole a 1990 Ford 150 pick-up utility.  
     
      
    14 The circumstances of count 4 (s 112(1) offence) were that between 1pm on 3 February 2002 and 8am the next day the respondent cut a hole in a rear perimeter fence of the business premises of Coventry Auto Parts at Campbelltown. Having smashed a window, he reached through the hole in the window and stole three socket sets to the value of $525. 
     
      
    15 Count 5 (s 112(1) offence) involved the respondent breaking into the premises of Bayline Roofing at Tuggerah between 2pm on 7 May 2006 and 5.30am the next day and stealing $500 cash. 
     
      
    16 Count 6 (s 112(1) offence) concerned the respondent breaking into the premises of Northcoast Shower Screens at Tuggerah between 12pm on 16 April 2005 and 7am on 18 April 2005 from which he stole a free standing safe, a cash box and $500 in cash. 
     
      
    17 The circumstances of count 7 (s 112(1) offence) were that about 10pm on 13 June 2006 police responded to an alarm activation at the Anthony Automotives workshop at Erina. Police found the phone lines cut and surveillance cameras and external alarms disabled. A window of the office had been smashed and $300 cash stolen. A hole had been cut in a rear perimeter fence. Shortly afterwards, the respondent and co-accused were arrested. 
     
      
    18 It is necessary to detail the facts of the offences on the Form 1 to appreciate the seriousness of each of these offences. 19 The circumstances of the first offence were that between 5.30pm on 31 August 2006 and 6.50am on 1 September 2006, the respondent cut a rear chain link security fence to gain entry to the business premises of Drought King Water Tanks at Charmhaven. He accessed the Telstra phone lines in a roadside pit near the premises and severed them to disable the alarm systems. He removed an external alarm mounted on the wall of the building, smashed a window in the front door and rummaged through the office area. No property, however, was stolen. 
     
      
    20 The circumstances of the second offence were that between 5pm on 2 June 2006 and 6am the next day, the respondent broke into Harcorp Projects at West Gosford and stole three laptop computers and three computer monitors valued at $10,281.  
     
      
    21 Offence 3 involved the respondent breaking into All States Trailer Spares and Sales at Tuggerah and stealing $2,100. Offence 4 involved an attempted break in at a business premises at Erina whereas offence 5 involved the respondent breaking into Randbuild, West Gosford from which he stole two wide screen computer monitors, one computer and two sets of PGA brand golf clubs and bags valued at $2,000. In committing offence 6, the respondent broke into business premises at Warnervale at about 9.07pm on 26 March 2006 from which he stole a metal safe containing $1,000 cash. Offence 7 involved the respondent breaking into business premises at Erina between 17 June and 20 June 2005 from which he stole a cash register containing $300 and an eftpos card reader. 
     
      
    22 The circumstances of offence 8 were that the respondent between 11 May 2005 and 12 May 2005 broke into Planit Enterprises at Erina and stole a flat screen computer monitor, a saw and other equipment of a total value of $1,300. Offence 9 concerned a break in by the respondent into business premises at West Gosford in the early hours of 21 March 2005 where he stole a strong box containing $200 and a further $200 cash. In committing offence 10, the respondent broke into business premises at Tuggerah where he stole computer equipment valued at $2,426, whereas in committing offence 11 he stole equipment of a total value of $4,700 after breaking into business premises at West Gosford between 5.35pm on 27 January 2005 and 6.15am on the next day. 
     
      
    23 Offences 12, 13 and 14 involved the respondent breaking into business premises at West Gosford and Erina. The circumstances of offence 12 were that after breaking in, the respondent stole a combination lock floor safe containing $3,000. Cash and equipment of a total value of $2,340 were stolen by the respondent in committing offence 13 and $461 cash in committing offence 14. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    24 The respondent was born on 14 April 1961 and was aged 46 years at the time of sentence. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a report of a psychologist Anna Robilliard, a pre-sentence report dated 7 February 2008 and the oral evidence of the respondent himself. A letter from the respondent to the Judge, a Justice Health report, a reference from the chaplain to the inmates and staff of the Parramatta Correctional Centre, another reference and a certificate of completion of the drug and alcohol awareness workshop were also tendered.  
     
      
    25 The respondent has been married twice and is in a long-term de-facto relationship with his current partner of 10 years. There is one child of the first marriage, a son who at time of sentence was aged 24 years. Following the break down of this marriage, the respondent re-married in the later 1980s. He and his wife had three sons, the eldest of whom died when 5 years old due to cancer. It seems that the loss of their son brought about the end of the marriage in 1997. Whilst he has a good relationship with his son from the first marriage, the respondent has not had contact with his children of the second marriage. Towards the end of 1998 he commenced a new relationship which was current at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    26 The author of the pre-sentence report, Ms McDonald, contacted the respondent’s partner who described him as a good and loving father to his children who were keen to have him home. There are three daughters from this relationship, an 8 year old and 5 year-old twins. Ms McDonald observed that the trauma resulting from the death of his young son had greatly affected the respondent who was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and was prescribed anti-depressants in 1999. He stopped taking drugs when his partner became pregnant.  
     
      
    27 It seems that he commenced using cannabis around 2002 as a way of coping with the stress and depression resulting from the loss of his son. Ms McDonald reported that she had been told by the respondent that since he had been in custody he had come to the realisation that cannabis use was not the answer to his problems and was adamant that he would not be using drugs anymore. He told Ms McDonald that the main motivation for his offending behaviour was to obtain money to support his cannabis use. She expressed the opinion that since he had reportedly been drug free for 14 months on remand, it was possible that his arrest and incarceration “may have severed his escalating drug use and consequent offending behaviour”. 
     
      
    28 In her report, Ms Robilliard observed that the motivation for the offences was primarily to find cash to replace money he used to buy cannabis and for household expenses. The psychologist noted that the applicant was well-practised in denying and avoiding the impact of his behaviour on others. She opined that when he was able to see the wider consequences of his anti-social conduct he may be able to accept responsibility for his criminal history and choose a different future direction. In the past he had used cannabis to help him avoid painful psychological and emotional issues. Ms Robilliard considered that the respondent would benefit from parallel eduction and counselling in this regard. A period of ongoing monitoring and support post release would be helpful.  
     
      
    29 During his evidence, the respondent assured the Judge that his criminal behaviour would not happen again because he had hurt his family and the community. He testified that he was not using cannabis and did not have any craving for the prohibited drug.  
     
      
    30 The respondent’s prior criminal history for offences of dishonesty, which the Judge described as “reasonably lengthy”, includes sentences of imprisonment which were imposed by the District Court on 27 August 1981 for two counts of break, enter and steal. On the first count he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and on the second count to a cumulative term of 18 months imprisonment. He was also sentenced on two counts of larceny of a motor vehicle to 12 months imprisonment. A non-parole period of 15 months was imposed. On 21 September 1994 he was placed on a three-year good behaviour bond for larceny of a motor vehicle. On 16 May 1984, he was sentenced in the Local Court for possession of implements to enter a conveyance to imprisonment for 3 months. On 16 February 1987, he was ordered to perform 100 hours community service for illegal use of a motor vehicle, stealing and possession of implements. Terms of imprisonment of 9 months with additional terms of 3 months were imposed in the District Court at Liverpool in April 1991 for two counts of break, enter and steal and two counts of possession of house breaking implements. 
     
      
    31 On 26 April 2004 on a charge of receiving he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in the Gosford Local Court which was suspended on his entering into an 18 month good behaviour bond which was subject to Probation and Parole supervision.  
     
      
    32 It is important to observe that counts 1, 2, 3 and 6 and offences 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the Form 1 for which the respondent was sentenced were committed whilst he was subject to this suspended sentence. 
     
      
    33 There are offences of stealing, entering inclosed land and cultivation of Indian hemp upon the respondent’s record for which he has been convicted and fined.  
     
      
    Submissions 34 There is one ground of appeal which is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The Crown also submits that there are four discrete errors by the Judge which are said to be that his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) erred in failing to adequately reflect the aggravating features of this case in the sentence imposed; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) erred in the manner in which he applied the principles in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1994) 194 CLR 610; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) failed to properly reflect the Form 1 matters when sentencing for count 2; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) erred in the excessive adjustment to the statutory ratio following a finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
      
    35 The Crown, as an alternative submission, argues that this Court would otherwise be satisfied that, by reason of some latent error, the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    36 The Crown complains that the Judge erred in failing to adequately reflect the aggravating features of this case in the sentence imposed. The Crown refers to the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 and points to a number of factors being present which enhance the objective seriousness of the offences. Whilst acknowledging that the Judge stated in his sentencing remarks that he had regard to the principles set out in Ponfield, the sentence imposed failed to reflect the fact that the presence of the aggravating factors had a cumulative effect upon the seriousness of the offences. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submits that the Crown’s complaint is in truth a complaint of manifest inadequacy. The Judge, it is argued, had regard to Ponfield and this is not a case where there was a failure by the Judge to have regard to that guideline judgment. There was no patent error by the Judge. 
     
      
    37 The second complaint by the Crown is that the Judge erred in the manner in which he applied the principles in Pearce. Not only were the individual sentences imposed inadequate, his Honour erred in his consideration of the second limb in Pearce, that is, the imposition of inadequate sentences combined with their almost total concurrency resulted in the aggregate sentence being manifestly inadequate. The Crown argues that the extent of the accumulation was nominal and insufficient to properly reflect the criminality involved.  
     
      
    38 In response to this complaint, counsel for the respondent submits that his Honour made no express error of principle in exercising his discretion concerning fixing the commencement date of the sentences. Questions of accumulation or concurrence are discretionary and involve evaluations on which judicial minds may differ. There was no express error in the approach taken by the Judge and it is submitted that this complaint is really one of manifest inadequacy. 
     
      
    39 The Crown’s third complaint is that the sentence on count 2 failed to properly reflect the 14 matters of a similar nature on the Form 1. Although the sentence on count 2 was more than the other sentences imposed, the Crown says that the effective non-parole period for this count was 7 months which does not properly reflect the degree of criminality. As to this complaint, counsel for the respondent contends that his Honour expressly had regard to the matters on the Form 1 when he sentenced the respondent on count 2. There was no express error in the approach taken by the Judge and the complaint is really one of manifest inadequacy.  
     
      
    40 The fourth complaint raised by the Crown is that the Judge erred in the excessive adjustment to the statutory ratio following a finding of special circumstances. The Judge allowed an effective ratio of 50 per cent between the overall non-parole period and balance of term (and a ratio of only 44 per cent on the sentence for count 2). The Crown contends that the exercise of the Judge’s discretion miscarried as he failed to have regard to the fact that the non-parole period must adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offences. A non-parole period of only 2 ½ years failed to reflect the multiplicity of offending on conditional liberty. It is so short, the Crown contends, that it implies error. 
     
      
    41 Counsel for the respondent submits in answer to this complaint that special circumstances were clearly open in this case on account of, inter alia, the respondent’s age, the accumulation of sentences, the need for supervision upon release and the responsibilities he had to his three daughters. A considerable variation to the ratio was open to the Judge in light of his factual findings in respect of which the Crown does not complain. During the proceedings on sentence, the legal representative for the respondent submitted that special circumstances were open and this submission was not the subject of any dispute by the Crown appearing at first instance. Counsel for the respondent points out that the Judge before proceeding to sentence raised with both counsel the sentences he intended to impose and the Crown did not wish to be heard. 
     
      
    42 The final contention for the Crown is that the effective sentence imposed was so manifestly disproportionate to the facts and circumstances of the case that it can be said that a substantial wrong has occurred. The Crown asks this Court to intervene to re-sentence the respondent notwithstanding the principle of double jeopardy and the residual discretion of the Court in Crown appeals.  
     
      
    43 Although conceding that the offences committed by the respondent were clearly serious, counsel for the respondent submits that the undiscounted starting point of the sentences was well within an appropriate range. Reference is made to Ayoubi v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 364 which is said to demonstrate that the sentence imposed upon the respondent was not manifestly unjust.  
     
      
       
      Decision  
       
      
    44 At the conclusion of the submissions on sentence, the Judge proceeded to sentence the respondent. His Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing task which he dealt with by delivering ex tempore reasons. 45 The first discrete error is said by the Crown to be that the sentence imposed failed to adequately reflect the aggravating features of the case.  
     
      
    46 Whilst declining to specify a sentencing range, this Court in Ponfield considered that the seriousness of a s 112(1) offence was enhanced by the presence of any of 11 factors identified by Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Sully agreeing) (at [48]). The following factors identified in Ponfield are relevant to the present case: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution. 
        
       
      
     (iii) The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. 
     
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        (v) The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 21 of the  
        Criminal 
          
        Procedure Act 
        ). In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each:  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 72 ALJR 1416. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        (viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that  
         
          
          value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    47 Factor (iii) must be considered in light of R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. Prior criminal offending is not an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle and does not determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. 
     
      
    48 It is clear that his Honour was mindful of the guideline judgment as he expressly referred to Ponfield on four occasions during his ex tempore sentencing remarks. He considered the aggravating factors contained in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There is some overlap between the aggravating factors in s 21A(2) and those identified in Ponfield. 
     
      
    49 In his consideration of aggravating factors, the Judge had regard to the respondent’s previous convictions as being relevant in “a Veen sense” to the question of punishment, personal deterrence and the prospects of rehabilitation. He noted that the respondent was on conditional liberty “in relation to a substantial number of these offences”. His Honour then said: (ROS at 5) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the activity was planned but the planning seems to be no more or less than that required to commit the offences, and in that sense the Court will take it into account without regarding it as an aggravating factor under s 21A.” 
        
       
      
    50 With respect, at the very least, the agreed facts of counts 1, 2 and 7 and offence 1 on the Form 1 disclose a significant degree of professional planning and execution by the respondent. In committing the offence constituting count 1, the respondent accessed the Telstra roadside phone line pit and severed the telephone lines disabling the alarm system before cutting a hole in the chain link security fence and smashing an external alarm box. The circumstances of count 2 include the respondent entering the control room of the Home Central complex where he severed the Telstra cables to the Timberland store, which he intended to break into, thereby disabling the alarm system. Having cut a hole in the perimeter fence and having smashed a store window, he removed a safe which had been bolted to the floor inside a cupboard. The steps that were taken to commit the offence which constitutes count 7 include the cutting of phone lines and the disabling of surveillance cameras and external alarms. The circumstances of the first offence on the Form 1 include the respondent accessing the Telstra phone lines in a road side pit near the premises he intended to break into and severing them to disable the alarm systems. The external alarm mounted on the wall was removed. 
     
      
    51 These offences were plainly the result of professional planning and execution by the respondent, which was an aggravating factor identified in Ponfield. The Judge, with respect, erred in failing to take into account the respondent’s professional planning and execution as a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    52 Although his Honour in shortly stating the facts made mention that on most occasions [the offences] involved the disabling of alarm systems and the physical smashing of either windows, doors or fencing, there was no mention by the Judge in his consideration of aggravating factors that any of the offences had been accompanied by significant damage to property. As I have indicated, significant damage to property is a factor identified in Ponfield as enhancing the seriousness of a s 112(1) offence. I am conscious that his Honour’s remarks were delivered ex tempore and the omission of a reference to such damage as an aggravating factor does not necessarily mean that it was overlooked. His Honour’s consideration of the amounts of money which were stolen, however, suggests that the significant damage to property was not regarded as a factor of aggravation. 
     
      
    53 The facts disclose in counts 1, 2, 7 and offence 1 on the Form 1 the severing of telephone lines, the cutting of a security or perimeter fence, the smashing or disabling of an external alarm or surveillance camera and in counts 1 and 2 the ransacking of office areas. In my view, there was significant damage to property which was a factor of aggravation. With respect, the Judge erred in failing to take into account the significant damage to property as a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    54 When referring to the amounts of money which had been stolen, the Judge said: (ROS at 5) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is fair to say that at times, reasonably large amounts of money, upwards of $4,000 were taken. In the Court’s view while the Court takes into account those amounts, it exercises its discretion under s 21A(5) not to aggravate the penalty any further by reason of the s 21A provision that deals with substantial loss.” 
        
       
      
    55 His Honour was referring to s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     And to s 21A(5) which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    56 It seems from the passage that I have quoted at paragraph 54 that the Judge found that the stealing of amounts of money in excess of $4,000 was a substantial loss and a factor of aggravation. Count 2 was the only offence where money exceeding that amount was stolen. Computer equipment, however, valued at $10,218 (Form 1 offence 2) power drills and other equipment valued at $4,700 (Form 1 offence 11) were stolen. His Honour was not required to increase the sentence by reason of the aggravating factor which he found. His Honour was, nevertheless, obliged to consider this factor in conjunction with other aggravating factors which were present in assessing the seriousness of the respondent’s offending. As was said by Grove J in Ponfield at [48]:  
     
      
       
        
        “Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is an accumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection.” 
        
       
      
    57 The first offence in time for which the respondent was to be sentenced was committed between 3 February 2002 and 4 February 2002 when he broke into the business of an auto parts dealer and stole three socket sets to the value of $525 (count 4). At the time of the commission of this offence, the respondent was not subject to conditional liberty. The suspended sentence of imprisonment was imposed on 26 April 2004. On this count the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months. 
     
      
    58 When he broke into the business of Northcoast Shower Screens in April 2005 and stole $500 cash (count 6), the respondent was subject to the suspended sentence. Although, as I have recounted, his Honour noted that the respondent was on conditional liberty at the time he committed a number of offences, the length of the sentence imposed on count 6 does not appear to reflect the presence of that factor of aggravation. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation: see, for example, R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28. The same length of sentence for counts 4 and 6 cannot be explained by different conduct nor by the principle in Pearce which obliged the Judge to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality. I am satisfied that his Honour overlooked the presence of this factor of aggravation when he sentenced for count 6.  
     
      
    59 The respondent was also subject to conditional liberty when he committed the offences constituting count 1 (s 113(1) offence), count 2 (s 112(1) offence) and count 3 (s 154AA(1) offence). The shorter sentences for counts 1 and 3, perhaps, might be explained by the available maximum sentences.  
     
      
    60 A fixed term of 18 months imprisonment was also imposed for count 7. Factors of aggravation which were there present included professional planning and execution and significant damage to property. The same length of sentence as count 4 indicates, in my view, that the Judge did not consider the accumulative effect of these factors of aggravation upon the seriousness of this offence.  
     
      
    61 On count 2 the respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 2 ½ years. His Honour took into account when imposing this sentence the 14 matters on the Form 1. The length of the sentence was significantly more than the other sentences. The Crown complains that the sentence on count 2 failed to properly reflect the fact that there were 14 matters of a similar nature on the Form 1. 
     
      
    62 The notional starting point for this sentence making allowance for a 25 per cent reduction for the plea of guilty was 6 years. Before embarking upon a consideration of the Form 1 offences, it is necessary to observe that the following factors of aggravation were present in the commission of the principal offence: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The respondent was on conditional liberty; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The offence was the result of professional planning and execution; 
        
       
      
     (3) The respondent had a prior record of like offences; 
     
      
       
        
        (4) The offence was accompanied by vandalism and significant damage to property; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The value of the property stolen was substantial, namely, $284.83 in cheques and $4,017.70 in cash. 
        
       
      
    63 The offence was committed on the 7 October 2005. It was the fourth offence in time of break, enter and steal for which he was to be sentenced.  
     
      
    64 Whilst his Honour rightly remarked that “in relation to R v Ponfield that all of the offences relate to business premises, all of which were vacant and the break and enters occurred at such time of day as made it exceedingly unlikely anyone would be present”, the victims of the respondent’s offending were small business proprietors, mainly on the Central Coast, many of whom had gone to considerable expense in an endeavour to make their properties secure against burglary. The proprietors of small businesses may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse impact of a break and enter. It is well known that such crimes may result, inter alia, in the loss of no-claim bonuses and substantial increases in insurance premiums that are to be paid. The ransacking of offices, the loss of cheques and cash can cause particular difficulty for small businesses. As Johnson J (with whom Mason P and Barr J agreed) in R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 observed at [93] “the owners of small businesses are likewise entitled to the protection of the law” and a significant element of general deterrence should apply.  
     
      
    65 This Court in R v Harris (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break, enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. To my mind, there is no good reason why what was said in Harris should not apply to repeat offenders who break into business premises.  
     
      
    66 Although the Judge announced when sentencing the respondent that the “Court has had regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which sets out the purposes of sentence” it is evident, with respect, that little regard was given to the need for general deterrence. General deterrence was a factor to be taken into account on count 2 as it was with all of the other sentences to be imposed. 
     
      
    67 The maximum sentence for a s 112(1) offence of 14 years imprisonment was not irrelevant to the sentencing task. It is the maximum penalty which has been legislated by Parliament. The maximum penalty serves as a yardstick or as a basis of comparison between the case before the Court and the worst possible case: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [31]. 
     
      
    68 The objective seriousness of the primary offence called for, in my opinion, a substantial sentence before the offences on the Form 1 were taken into account.  
     
      
    69 There are 12 offences of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1), one offence of attempt break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) and one offence of break, enter and steal with intent contrary to s 113(1) on the Form 1. All of the offences are serious. A number of them are more serious than some of the individual offences for which the respondent was charged. Offences 7 – 12 inclusive were committed whilst the respondent was subject to conditional liberty. 
     
      
    70 It is settled principle that the sentence for the primary offence should not be only slightly increased if the offences to be taken into account on the Form 1 are serious in their own right: R v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185; R v Pearce (2001) 126 A Crim R 508; Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146.  
     
      
    71 Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002, the guideline for Form 1 sentencing, explained at [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by 
         
        reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given 
         
        when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.” 
        
       
      
    72 It is important to bear in mind the significant advantages that the Form 1 procedure provides to the administration of justice and the sentence must reflect that fact. It promotes the objective of rehabilitation by providing an opportunity “to clear the offender’s slate” and there is the utilitarian value in the admission of guilt which saves resources in further investigation by law enforcement agencies: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) 1999 No 1 of 2002 per Spigelman CJ at [62] – [65].  
     
      
    73 These considerations notwithstanding, the sentence imposed by the Judge on count 2 did not reflect the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution from a serious offender.  
     
      
    74 One of the reasons, in my view, that this difficulty has arisen is because the Judge, with respect, did not have regard to all of the factors of aggravation that were present and to their accumulative effect upon the seriousness of the primary offence.  
     
      
    75 It is necessary to give consideration to the mitigating factors that were present in the respondent’s case. The Judge found that he had shown remorse and had pleaded guilty. Although not making a final determination, it appeared to the Judge that there was some basis for confidence that upon release the respondent would attempt to lead a law abiding life style. His Honour referred to the respondent’s age, above average intelligence, his insight into his present predicament, the impact that had upon his partner and children and the respondent’s appreciation that if called up for breach he would be required to serve the balance of parole in custody. Regard was had by his Honour to the efforts made by the respondent since his incarceration and the Judge made particular reference to the letter from Justice Health which indicated that the respondent had no significant issue with drugs. The Judge took into account all of the subjective material before him and remarked that the pre-sentence report and the report from Ms Robilliard were “generally speaking” favourable.  
     
      
    76 The respondent’s record, however, indicated that he had learnt little from the sentences imposed by courts in the past. Leniency had been extended to him on 26 April 2004 when the 18 month term of imprisonment was suspended. Within a few weeks of receiving this indulgence, he broke into the premises of Bayline Roofing and stole $500. As previously stated, a number of the offences were committed whilst he was on the good behaviour bond of the suspended sentence a condition of which was Probation and Parole supervision. The supervision condition appears to have been of little assistance to him. The fact that his repeat offending was motivated to finance his use of drugs was not a mitigating factor. It was an aggravating factor for those offences which were committed after he had entered into the bond as the use of illegal drugs was itself a breach of that bond. 
     
      
    77 The respondent’s evidence that he appreciated the harm caused by his criminal behaviour and assurances that he would not re-offend had to be assessed against the fact that he had re-offended shortly after the suspension of his sentence and continued to do so. The suspended 18 month term of imprisonment which was hanging over his head ought to have ensured that he did not continue to offend. He had previously served terms of imprisonment for similar offences.  
     
      
    78 His Honour in determining the length of the individual sentences and the non-parole period (a topic which will be considered separately) gave disproportionate weight, in my opinion, to the subjective material and failed to have sufficient regard to the objective gravity of the offending and to specific and general deterrence. 79 The Crown complains about the manner in which the Judge applied the principles in Pearce. In applying the principles established in Pearce the Judge said that he would impose discrete sentences on each offence and the principle of totality would be applied by only partly cumulating the sentences. Fixed terms were imposed in relation to counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and the commencement dates of each sentence were staggered by one month. The non-parole period of 2 years for count 2 was set to commence one month after the commencement of the sentence for count 7. As a result of partial accumulation and concurrency, the effective additional sentence for each of the offences other than count 2 was one month. The effective additional non-parole period for count 2 was 7 months. 
     
      
    80 In Harris this Court considered the appropriateness of concurrent sentences in relation to multiple offences of break, enter and steal. Although in the present case wholly concurrent sentences were not imposed what was said by the Court in Harris remains of relevance. The Court stated at [40] – [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “An increase in the number of offences will commonly also demonstrate a need for greater weight to be given to many if not all of the purposes of sentencing and for the effective sentence to be longer that (sic) if only one offence had been committed. Making sentences wholly concurrent means that the second and subsequent effectively constitute no punishment and sends a clear message to those members of the criminal community who chose to live by breaking and entering and stealing or the like that once they have committed one or a few offences, they can continue offending with virtual impunity so far as sentences are concerned. Absent good reason, it should not occur – see  
        R v Brown 
         [1999] NSWCCA 323 at [24];  
        Mungomery  
        (2004) 151 A Crim R 376 at 381. 
        
       
       
        
        Considerations of general and personal deterrence demand that the courts signal to would-be offenders, many of whom in this area are serial offenders, that they can expect punishment for each of their offences.  
        
       
       
        
        Nor is it an adequate reason for complete concurrency that a group of offences such as breaking, entering and stealing may be of the same type or committed as part of one criminal spree. As the Court has sought to point out, implementation of a decision to commit another offence will generally involve more loss and damage, and more victims. When it does, there is also a greater entitlement of the community to retribution.” 
        
       
       
      And at [44]-[45]: 
       
       
        
        “Implementation of the principle of totality is perhaps the most common circumstance where concurrency of sentences is justified. However it is important that that principle be properly understood and applied. Perhaps the leading statement of it is an extract from D A Thomas, “Principles of Sentencing” endorsed in  
        Mill v R 
         (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is ‘just and appropriate’.”  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Two points may be made. Firstly, the principle is expressed in terms of coming back from the result of a simple aggregation. Secondly, if each individual sentence is appropriate for the criminality of the offence to which it relates, prima facie additional criminality requires an increase in sentence. Obviously the totality principle imposes limits to that last proposition but those limits will rarely if ever go so far as to justify wholly concurrent sentences for all of a series of offences such as those here.  
        Subject to those limits, in general, sentences significantly cumulative should be imposed for separate serious offences of which those here are all examples 
        ” (Italics added).  
        
       
      
    81 Each of the counts involved its own serious individual criminality. An effective additional sentence of one month for each of six of the offences (counts 1, 3-7) may not be considered to send a clear signal to serial offenders that they can expect punishment for each of their offences. 
     
      
    82 Although this was a complex sentencing exercise and his Honour was constrained by the principle of totality, greater accumulation was required on at least one of these counts. I am not persuaded, however, that his Honour erred in the manner in which he applied the principles in Pearce to count 2. 83 The next matter about which the Crown complains is the adjustment to the statutory ratio following a finding of special circumstances. The Crown points out that the Judge allowed an effective ratio of 50 per cent between the overall non-parole period and balance of term (and a ratio of only 44 per cent on the sentence for count 2). The Crown contends that the ratio was excessive.  
     
      
    84 The Crown referred the Court to the examination in Harris at [64-68] of the JIRS statistics relating to s 112(1) and s 112(2) offences. In Harris the Court noted at [67] that a comparison of the full terms and non-parole periods in 5 of the 7 groups there set out reveal that the median non-parole period was 50 per cent of the median full sentence. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When regard is had to the terms of s 44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , the effect of which is to require a non-parole period to amount to three-quarters of the total sentence unless the court decides that there are “special circumstances”, it is apparent “special” is being given an operation that bears no relationship to its meaning.” 
        
       
      
    85 His Honour found special circumstances by reason of the respondent’s age of 46 years, his need for some ongoing treatment and counselling and the fact that a number of the sentences would be cumulative. There is no challenge by the Crown to his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    86 The degree of adjustment of the statutory ratio, special circumstances having been found, will not usually be interfered with by this Court unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [13]. 
     
      
    87 The ultimate constraint, as was explained by Spigelman CJ in Simpson at [63], upon the sentencing Judge’s discretion following a finding of special circumstances, is that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.” 
        
       
      
    88 In my view, the non-parole period of 2 years 6 months does not appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the respondent’s repeat offending much of which occurred when he was subject to conditional liberty.  
     
      
    89 Counsel for the respondent referred to Ayoubi where the offender had pleaded guilty to 12 counts of break, enter and steal, one count of break and enter with intent to steal and one count of stealing and attempting to break out. A further 14 offences were taken into account on a Form 1. The offences were committed in breach of conditional liberty. The offender was sentenced to an effective head sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. The offender had broken into commercial premises and stolen in excess of $88,000 over six weeks. It was said that the sentence considered in Ayoubi demonstrates that the sentence imposed upon the respondent was not manifestly unjust. 
     
      
    90 The principal complaint in Ayoubi was that the offender’s mental illness had not been properly taken into account by the sentencing Judge. The question was not one of manifest inadequacy but manifest excess. Latham J (with whom Giles JA and Sully J agreed) in dismissing the appeal considered that the sentences were wholly with the sentencing Judge’s discretion and were not manifestly excessive. Her Honour observed at [33] that the aggregate sentence imposed might be seen as lenient. This case provides, in my view, little support for the argument advanced on behalf of the respondent.  
     
      
    91 In the present case, a number of errors of principle have been identified which have resulted in a total effective sentence which falls, in my opinion, outside an appropriate range and is manifestly inadequate. When this Court is re-sentencing after error has been demonstrated by the Crown, the sentence imposed will generally be towards the bottom of the available range. A total effective sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months is such a sentence. The notional starting point of the sentence for count 2 should not have been less than 7 years. The sentences for counts 6 and 7 should not have been less than 21 months.  
     
      
    92 Although the Crown has been successful in demonstrating error, the Court has a “lively discretion” to refuse to intervene. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, the Court has regard to double jeopardy and to the approach taken by the Crown’s legal representative before the Judge.  
     
      
    93 It is well established that the Crown’s concurrence with, or failure to object to, a proposed course of action by the sentencing Judge must be weighed in the exercise of the Court’s discretion to interfere on a Crown appeal or to interfere to a lesser degree than otherwise would have been appropriate. This Court (Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J) in  Allpass at 565 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The weight to be given to such a consideration depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, but it may be of considerable significance if the respondent was given a non-custodial sentence at first instance. Its weight may also vary with the degree to which the appellate court thinks the sentencing judge fell into error.” 
        
       
      
    94 In the proceedings on sentence, the Judge after hearing submissions from counsel for the respondent and the legal representative of the Crown stood the matter down. After a short adjournment, the following appears in the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Mr Brown, I have in mind a combination of sentences, most of which are fixed with the main one with the Form 1 being a non parole and additional term, and they’re all slightly cumulative one on the other, but the effective total sentence that I have in mind would be a non parole period of two and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. Is there anything that either of you wanted to say about that? 
        
       
       
        
        BROWN (for the offender): No, I don’t want to be heard on that. 
        
       
      
      WHITAKER (for the Crown): No, your Honour. 
     
      
     HIS HONOUR: Right.”  
     
      
    95 Whilst it is plain that the Crown was made aware of the sentence that was contemplated and submissions were invited, the errors of principle which have lead to the manifest inadequacy of the sentence were not exposed until his Honour delivered his sentencing remarks. I am also mindful of Guideline 28 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions concerning the role of the prosecutor on sentence which obliges a prosecutor not to seek to persuade a court to impose a sentence of a particular magnitude. As was explained by Buddin J (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed) in R v Lay [2006] NSWCCA 45 at [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is readily apparent that the task of a prosecutor on sentence is a very important one. It can also be a very challenging one. There is a delicate balance to be struck between assisting a court to avoid appealable error and ‘forensic urging’ which is properly discouraged.” 
        
       
      
    96 Prior to the adjournment, the Crown’s representative had made appropriate submissions which included offering to his Honour some authorities on the principle of totality.  
     
      
    97 This was not a case where the Crown remained silent when a submission had been made that a non-custodial sentence should be imposed: see for example R v Chad (Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 May 1997, unreported), Everett v The Queen. Furthermore, the degree to which his Honour fell into error was significant. This is not a case, in my opinion, in which the Court ought to exercise its discretion not to intervene. 
     
      
    98 In identifying at paragraph 91, a total effective sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months, I have taken into consideration the respondent’s affidavit affirmed 25 June 2008 which indicates that he has continued to remain drug free and has not committed any offences against gaol discipline. I find special circumstances for the reasons expressed by his Honour. 99 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court on counts 2-7 inclusive are  
       
       quashed. 
       
       
      3. In respect of count 2 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a  
       
        
        non-parole period of 2 years 9 months to date from 12 September 2007 and expire on 11 June 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months expiring on 11 December 2012. 
        
       
       
      4. In respect of count 3 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months commencing on 12 October 2007 and expiring on 11 January 2009. 
       
       
      5. In respect of count 4 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 12 December 2007 and expiring on 11 June 2009. 
       
       
      6. In respect of count 5 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 12 March 2008 and expiring on 11 September 2009. 
       
       
      7. In respect of count 6 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 21 months commencing on 12 June 2008 and expiring on 11 March 2010.  
       
       
      8. In respect of count 7 sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 21 months commencing on 12 December 2008 and expiring on 11 September 2010. 
       
       
        
        The overall effective sentence will be a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months commencing on 12 December 2006 and expiring on 11 September 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years 3 months expiring on 11 December 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        The earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 11 September 2010.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On the 2 March 2007 the offender went out to celebrate a friend’s 21st birthday party. He says that he remembers drinking some alcohol and having a single ecstasy tablet. The following evening he was driving his car along Alfords Point Road at Menai. With him were two of his friends, Matthew Darwin and Christopher Jones. The offender was still under the influence of ecstasy. His driving was impaired to the extent that he could not perform the relatively simply task of negotiating a slight left hand bend. He drove onto the incorrect side of the road, forcing an oncoming vehicle to swerve out of the way. He continued to travel on the wrong side of the road, crossing into what was, for vehicles travelling the other way to him, the kerb side lane. Eventually the inevitable happened. There was a head on collision between the car that he was driving and the car driven by Mrs Patricia Hamilton. The forces generated by that collision must have been enormous. It is amazing, having seen photographs of the cars after the collision, that no one was killed. Mr Hamilton suffered very significant injuries. Mr Darwin and Mr Jones, the offender’s friends, also suffered grievous bodily harm. 2 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage to three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He admits that he was driving under the influence of ecstasy.3 The offender’s decision to drive, whilst under the influence of that drug, was described in some of the references, tendered on his behalf, as a mistake. It was much more than that. It was a decision to commit a serious crime with terrible consequences for which the offender must now be punished. 4 He was born on 7 February 1986. His parents separated when he was two and he has had very limited contact with his father since then. His mother remarried when he was sixteen, which caused a rift in his relationship with her, but following her separation from her new husband and her becoming ill, the relationship improved. He currently lives with a friend and his friend’s family. He was a gifted student at high school, obtaining a scholarship to attend a private school. He was apparently a gifted singer as well. Upon leaving school he took up a carpentry apprenticeship and is now doing building studies at TAFE. He is performing very well in his studies. He has been employed at Southern Cross Constructions for the last four years and his employer speaks very highly of him. 5 I am satisfied that the offender is a young man with much to contribute to society and that he is generally, a person of good character. One qualification to that finding concerns his drug use. He began using cannabis while still at school and later started using it on a daily basis. He also used alcohol and started using cocaine and ecstasy. His use of these drugs appears to have been regular and for him, commonplace. Thus, while these offences for which I am to sentence the offender, are the first to appear on his criminal history, he has been regularly breaking the law by his voluntary consumption of illegal drugs. It was one particular aspect of this illegal behaviour which led to him causing significant injuries to three innocent people. 6 After the motor vehicle accident, Mrs Hamilton suffered severe injuries. They were fractured left ribs, a left pneumothorax, fractured left ulna, fractured left clavicle, fractured distal left femur, a rupture of the left patella tendon, subarachnoid haemorrhage, splenic contusion, soft tissue trauma to the left breast and facial scars. She was in hospital and then a rehabilitation unit for over two months. She must now use a crutch. Before the collision Mrs Hamilton led a full and active life, which was often envied by many. She enjoyed her work, was fit and happy. She regularly bushwalked and kayaked and these activities would often take her overseas with friends. Since the collision, her friends have travelled to Kakadu and Italy, but she was not able to accompany them on these trips. She can paddle her kayak, for short distances only, with the aid of friends, but is unable to bushwalk at all. Her mother died whilst she was in hospital being treated for her injuries and she is greatly saddened because she was not able to be with her mother in her final days. Mrs Hamilton now feels old and has lost her independence. She requires assistance with many simple tasks, including shopping, gardening and housekeeping. Though she is hopeful of returning to work, that prospect is becoming more remote. She is in constant pain in her knee, ankle and more recently her left arm. Mrs Hamilton is unable to exercise and thus her weight is increasing with associated health problems. She is of the belief that she faces at least a further four operations and is currently seeing a psychologist. 7 Christopher Jones underwent surgery as a result of suffering various fractures. He also suffered a laceration to his right forehead, broken teeth, lacerations to his chin, multiple lacerations to his right upper leg and foot, lacerations to his left leg, lacerations to his right calf and a four-centimetre laceration to his right lumbar region. Mr Jones has received several apologies from the offender and appears to have accepted those apologies, having supplied a written testimonial. 8 Matthew Darwin suffered various fractures, a large bowel tear with three mesentric tears, a lacerated bowel artery, an avulsed appendix and bruising to the left lung. He still has some weakness associated with the repair to his abdominal wall and may require further surgery. 9 Evidence was given by the offender that he had apologised to his friends and that they had apparently accepted that apology. The Crown Prosecutor specifically told me that Mrs Hamilton did not wish the offender to be sent to full time custody. At the time I indicated, with the greatest of respect to Mrs Hamilton, that her views, whilst admirable, were irrelevant to the task I had to perform. I will explain why. Many victims of criminal behaviour, particularly where that criminal behaviour has led to life long consequences for those victims, want to see the offender punished in the severest possible way. Judges must ignore such desires for revenge and retribution. Equally, where victims of offences are able to forgive an offender, those wishes too must also be ignored. When sentencing an offender, the Court has to take into account the protection of other potential victims, not only those people who might have forgiven the offender. For that reason, general deterrence is an important aspect of most sentences. It is a credit to Mrs Hamilton that despite having her life changed in an instant by the offender’s wrongdoing, she expressed the view that she did. I trust she will understand and not be offended when I say that I am unable to do what she asks. 10 The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 is clearly important because it is a guideline judgment to which I must necessarily refer, of course, as reconsidered in a later decision of R v Whyte(2002) 55 NSWLR 252 . In fact Jurisic was the first guideline judgment issued by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. It came after a relatively constant stream of successful Crown appeals against the leniency of sentences imposed for offences of dangerous driving causing either death or grievous bodily harm. The decision in Jurisic is relevant for another reason as well. There is a close similarity between the circumstances of that case and the circumstances of the present case. The offender in Jurisic was also affected by a drug, in his case cocaine, when he crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a car coming the other way. Jurisic also involved three offences of dangerous driving under the influence of a drug occasioning grievous bodily harm. Perhaps the most important point of distinction however, was that he, unlike this offender, had a significant history of traffic offences. He was also older. In Jurisic the Crown appeal against the leniency of the sentence imposed upon him was allowed. The sentence was quashed and he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a minimum period of one year. Justice Sully held that a much longer sentence would not have been appealably severe, although that view was not shared by other members of the Bench who addressed that particular issue. 11 I mention the facts in Jurisic because of their similarity with the present. On occasions, the Court of Criminal Appeal has suggested that sentences in other particular cases are not particularly useful in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose on a particular offender because of differences between the two cases. But here, where there is a close similarity in the objective facts and where Jurisic was the case which first introduced guideline sentences to New South Wales, I have paid particular attention to the sentence ultimately imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Of course, that is not to say that a single case sets a benchmark. There are differences between Jurisic and the present circumstances and it must be remembered that the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal followed a successful Crown appeal, such sentences ordinarily being lower than what the court considers should have been imposed at the first instance.12 The present case falls closely within what the Court identified in Whyte as being a frequently occurring case. The submissions made on behalf of the offender accepted that that was the position, however, there is one matter where there is a difference between the frequently recurring case and the present and that is a matter which works in the offender’s favour. It should have been identified in the submissions made on behalf of the offender but was not. The frequently recurring case, as identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal, involved a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. In this case, the three pleas of guilty were entered before the magistrate. That is a matter which works in the offender’s favour when the guideline judgment is considered. The guideline judgment says that a custodial sentence would usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. This is not a case where the moral culpability of the offender is low by any means. It is a serious decision to get behind the wheel of a car when the person’s ability to drive is impaired by either alcohol or drugs. By so doing the offender accepted a risk that because of his inability to control his car properly, he would cause serious injury or even death to other innocent road users. It is the decision to take that risk which shows a high level of moral culpability. It must also be remember that drug taking is itself a criminal offence, so what led to three serious criminal offences was the offender’s earlier criminal conduct. 13 It is to be noted that the number of people put at risk by the offender’s driving were not only those who ended up being seriously hurt. Another car had to swerve out of the way once the offender started driving on the wrong side of the road and he had travelled eight kilometres, intending to travel further of course, on a Saturday evening. 14 The level of MDMA found in the offender’s blood was well above usual blood levels following typical street doses. Dr Perl’s statement was tendered. She said that at such high concentrations there are changes in perceptions, blurred vision, ataxia, unsteadiness, anxiety, and muscle tension in addition to cardio vascular changes. Hallucinations are also much more likely to occur. 15 I have found that the offender’s moral culpability is high. In such a case the guideline in Whyte says that a full time custodial sentence of less than two years would not generally be appropriate. That is for a single offence. Questions of accumulation have also to be considered. The solicitor for the offender conceded that there needed to be a level of accumulation in the sentences to be imposed. That concession is appropriate. 16 I have no doubt that the offender is remorseful, but that is usually the case for offences of this type. It is a rare offence of dangerous driving occasioning either death or grievous bodily harm, where the offender does not feel sorry and even ashamed of his or her conduct. Once confronted with the devastating consequences of their criminal actions, most offenders wish that they could turn the clock back. So although the offender is, of course, entitled to the benefit of my finding that he is remorseful, that is a finding almost universally made in cases of this type, a fact which must be borne in mind when formulating the appropriate sentence in the light of sentences imposed in other similar cases. 17 The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and I am satisfied he is unlikely to offend again in this way. It was suggested in the submissions made on behalf of the offender, that it was a mitigating feature that he was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions. In this regard, reliance was placed on the fact that the offender was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. It cannot be a mitigating feature of an offence of dangerous driving whilst under the influence of a drug, that the offender was under the influence of a drug. 18 There are clearly special circumstances in this case. The offender is a young man who will be serving his first custodial sentence. The written submissions on behalf of the offender suggested an appropriate sentence of two and a half to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two to two and a half years, to be served by way of periodic detention. Having reviewed this matter carefully, I am satisfied that the overall sentence suggested by the solicitor for the offender was, surprisingly, longer than appropriate. I am also satisfied that the sentence should be served by way of full time imprisonment, rather than periodic detention. A sentence of periodic detention of any length, is one which would be insufficient to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct and the effects of that criminal conduct on the three victims of it. A sentence of periodic detention is, in my way, a lenient one, especially as it remains the case that after serving one-third of the sentence, there is no overnight component to the offender’s custody and the sentence becomes more like a community service order. A sentence of periodic detention of any length would be insufficient to effectively deter others who might be tempted to drive whilst under the influence of drugs. The safety of our roads is of concern to all of us and the courts must take whatever steps they can to promote the idea that innocent road users are able to travel along public roads without the risk that they will be faced with a vehicle coming directly towards them as a result of an offender’s decision to drive whilst his or her ability to drive is seriously impaired. 19 After reducing the sentences I would otherwise have imposed upon the offender by approximately twenty-five per cent to reflect his pleas of guilty, the sentences I impose are as follows:20 For the offences to which the offender pleaded guilty relating to Mr Darwin and Mr Jones, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year and a head sentence of two years to have commenced on the day the offender went into custody, July 3 2008. For the offence involving Mrs Hamilton, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year with a head sentence of two years to commence on 3 January 2009. Thus, the effective sentence will be a non-parole period of eighteen months with a head sentence of two and a half years. The offender is to be released to parole on 2 January 2010. Any other orders required?21 BUTT: Your Honour, there are a number of matters on the 166 Certificate. My instructions are that they be dismissed as back up charges, I believe there are five charges.22 HIS HONOUR: I will dismiss the back up charges on the 166 Certificate.

    2 The overall sentences imposed by the trial judge provided for a non-parole period for Mr Pham of 10½ years (with an additional term of 3½ years) and for Mr Tran of 12 years (with an additional term of 4 years). 
     
      
    3 Mr Pham and Mr Tran appeal against their convictions. Mr Tran carried the burden of this argument in his appeal. Mr Pham was not represented on the conviction appeal. Mr Haesler SC, who appeared for Mr Pham in the Crown’s sentence appeal (to which I will come) indicated that Mr Pham was content to take advantage of any successful argument put on behalf of Mr Tran, but did not wish to be heard on the conviction appeal. 
     
      
    4 The Director of Public Prosecutions (the “DPP”) appeals under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentences imposed by the trial judge on both Mr Pham and Mr Tran alleging manifest inadequacy and various errors in her Honour’s approach to sentencing. 
     
      
    5 Mr Tran also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on him on the ground that the sentences were manifestly excessive. I would take it that Mr Pham would also seek the benefit of any view held by the court that Mr Tran’s sentence was manifestly excessive, to the extent the reasoning could be applied to him. 
     
      
    6 It is convenient to begin with Mr Tran’s conviction appeal. Before dealing with the arguments put on Mr Tran’s behalf, it is of assistance to appreciate, in summary form, the interplay of the different bodies of evidence in relation to each count. Both the Crown and Mr Tran’s counsel assisted the Court in this regard. That is said not only to thank counsel for their helpful submissions, but also to make the point (in advance of dealing with the significant argument that her Honour’s summing-up was unbalanced) that the trial judge had the difficult task of explaining to the jury in a not short trial involving 17 counts (some in the alternative) how different parts of the evidence were said to fit together in a largely circumstantial Crown case, not traversed by any positive case by either Mr Tran or Mr Pham. 
     
      
       
      Counts 1, 2 and 3 (Mr Tran) 
       
      
    7 These counts related to Mr Tran’s possession of 700grams of heroin (count 1), 71.9grams of cocaine (count 2) and 3.1kg of methylenedioxy-methylamphetamine (ecstasy or “MDMA”) (count 3). The Crown case was that visual surveillance and telephone intercepts showed that Mr Tran resided or spent a great deal of time at certain premises in Cabramatta (“the Cabramatta house”) and also showed him engaged in the supply of these drugs. 
     
      
    8 The evidence for counts 1, 2 and 3 arose from surveillance, the execution of a search warrant, the analysis of drugs found in the execution of the warrant, the police record of interview with Mr Tran, surveillance over a number of days including the logs of the surveillance to which a number of police officers gave evidence, telephone intercepts that suggested Mr Tran lived or spent a great deal of time at the Cabramatta house, expert evidence of Det Sgt Cadden about the terms and methodologies by persons involved in supplying prohibited drugs, translators of intercepted conversations, voice identification of intercepted communications, the admission by Mr Tran of his voice on some intercepts as then used by the voice interpreter.  
     
      
    9 As an indication of the complexity and volume of the evidence it can taken that in the helpful Crown summary of the trial prepared for the appeal the outline of the various segments of the evidence concerning counts 1, 2 and 3 occupied 57 pages.  
     
      
       
      Counts 4 (Mr Tran), 5 and 6 (Mr Pham)  
       
      
    10 These counts related to a transaction involving Mr Tran and Mr Pham and a third party, to whom I will refer to as Mr Th. The Crown case was that Mr Tran, who had recently returned from Saigon, offered to supply Mr Pham with 700grams of heroin, an offer Mr Pham accepted so that he could supply that quantity on to the third party, Mr Th (counts 4 and 5). Mr Tran was unable to produce the 700grams of heroin and as Mr Th needed to return to Melbourne, Mr Pham obtained 187grams of heroin from another man, to whom I will refer to as Mr Th(2), which he (Mr Pham) then supplied to Mr Th (count 6). Mr Th was arrested on 25 February 2006 while he was driving from Sydney to Goulburn at which time 187grams of heroin were found in his possession in the car he was driving, a car which was registered in the name of Mr Pham’s daughter. 
     
      
    11 In relation to these counts the Crown relied on a combination of intercepted telephone calls and physical surveillance. In relation to the telephone calls, translators and voice identification evidence was necessary together with the evidence of Det Sgt Cadden. Numerous police gave evidence as to the surveillance. Also, there was evidence of the arrest of Mr Th given by various police. The summary of evidence in relation to these counts in the summary of trial occupied 23 pages. 
     
      
       
      Counts 7 and 8 (Mr Tran) and 9 and 10 (Mr Pham) 
       
      
    12 The Crown case was that there was an offer by Mr Pham to Mr Tran, accepted by Mr Tran, recorded in two telephone intercepts on 25 March 2005, to supply 5 units of cocaine. Counts 7 and 9 alleged that the offer involved a quantity of 5kgs. Counts 8 and 10 were in the alternative in the event that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the quantity alleged. Mr Pham and Mr Tran were found not guilty of counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 but were found guilty of the statutory alternative to counts 8 and 10 respectively being the supply of cocaine. 
     
      
    13 The Crown relied on intercepted telephone communications in relation to these counts which involved preparation of transcript by translators, voice identification evidence and the evidence of Det Sgt Cadden. The outline of this evidence in the summary of trial occupied 4 pages. 
     
      
       
      Counts 11 (Mr Tran) and 12 (Mr Pham) 
       
      
    14 The Crown case was that there was an offer to supply 700grams of heroin by Mr Tran (count 11) to Mr Pham who then offered to supply the 700grams to a third party, a Mr Th(2). Mr Th(2) was arrested by police on 1 April 2005 with .59grams of heroin in his possession shortly after he left a house in Bankstown (“the Bankstown house”), a place where Mr Pham stayed. On the Crown case the .59grams of heroin was a sample. 
     
      
    15 The Crown relied, in respect of these counts, on intercepted telephone conversations which involved translation, voice identification and the evidence of Det Sgt Cadden. The outline of the evidence in the summary of trial in respect of these counts occupied 14 pages. 
     
      
       
      Counts 13 (Mr Tran) and 14 (Mr Pham) 
       
      
    16 These counts related to 700grams of heroin found in Mr Pham’s possession when he was arrested by police at Liverpool after he got off a bus from Melbourne the day before. The Crown case was that Mr Pham had travelled to Melbourne to obtain the drugs and had them in his possession for the purpose of then supplying them to Mr Tran who was waiting impatiently for them.  
     
      
    17 The Crown relied upon various telephone interceptions in relation to these counts, with accompanying evidence of translation, of voice recognition and of Det Sgt Cadden. There was also evidence from a listing device at the Bankstown house. There was also evidence from the arrest of Mr Pham and a record of interview with Mr Pham. The outline of the evidence in relation to these counts in the summary of trial encompassed 14 pages. 
     
      
       
      Count 15 (Mr Pham) 
       
      
    18 This count related to an offer by Mr Pham on 4 March 2005 to supply a large commercial quantity (1kg) of N, N-Dimethylamphetamine (“Ice”) to Mr Tran. 
     
      
    19 The Crown relied upon telephone interceptions, with accompanying evidence of translation, of voice recognition and of Det Sgt Cadden in relation to this count and the outline of the evidence occupied a page and half of the summary of trial. 
     
      
       
      Counts 16 and in the alternative 17 (Mr Tran) 
       
      
    20 These counts related to a number of alleged supplies (offers to supply) by Mr Tran of the drug Ice between 26 December 2004 and 16 June 2005. One of the alternative supplies in count 16 was the subject of the alternative count 17. That supply related to Mr Tran being in possession of 490grams of the drug Ice. 
     
      
    21 The Crown relied on a body of telephone interceptions with accompanying evidence of translation, of voice recognition and of Det Sgt Cadden in relation to these counts as well as evidence connected with the arrest of Mr Tran. The outline of the evidence in relation to these counts encompassed 16 pages of the summary of trial. 
     
      
       
      The appeal by Mr Tran 
       
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in allowing the expert evidence of Det Sgt Stuart Cadden 
       
      
    22 Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence was directed to the language (once translated) used by Mr Pham, Mr Tran and others in intercepted telephone conversations. The conversations were translated into English by qualified translators. Det Sgt Cadden then gave evidence, in effect by way of “decoding” the language, as to (using that prepositional phrase very generally) the meaning of certain words. 
     
      
    23 Before examining his evidence, and the complaints made about it, it is fair to say that the evidence was important to the Crown’s case. A significant body of evidence was obtained by surveillance and by interception of telephone calls. The conversations recorded were almost totally in Vietnamese and, when translated, did not in terms refer to any of the drugs in question. The Crown’s case was that when one appreciated the code that was present one could interpret the conversations as ones relevant to the dealing in the drugs in question. 
     
      
    24 Det Sgt Cadden first gave evidence on 8 and 9 November 2006 on the voir dire about his qualifications, experience and his analysis of the telephone intercepts. After this evidence was given counsel for Mr Tran (who was not counsel on the appeal for Mr Tran) put three submissions as to the inadmissibility of the evidence: (a) that it was not a proper subject of expert evidence; (b) that he was not shown to be qualified; and (c) that Det Sgt Cadden did not sufficiently disclose his reasoning.25 Only the third argument was pressed on appeal. It was submitted that by failing to produce a drug code table and drug price table referred to in his evidence and not divulging details of the previous matters that he had been involved in prevented Mr Tran from adequately testing the evidence or its basis. 
     
      
    26 The trial judge ruled that Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence was admissible and he gave it orally. 
     
      
    27 The reasons given by the trial judge for allowing the evidence were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Detective Cadden said the basis for each opinion was his knowledge accumulated in his six years experience of drug investigations, listening to conversations recorded by intercepted telephone or use of listening devices, reading transcripts of such conversation, conversations with informants, conversations with persons arrested and charged with drug offences and conversations with other drug investigators. In forming his opinions he said he referred to, but did not rely on, a dictionary compiled within the New South Wales Police Service of words heard in investigations and their meanings. He said he did not allow anyone else’s opinions as contained in that list of words replace his and he relied on his own experience to form his opinions. 
        
       
       
        
        The value of drugs was a factor in the opinions he expressed about some words. He said he referred to a list or record maintained with the New South Wales Police Service of prices of drugs. He declined to produce the list of prices or the list of words nor could he produce when asked in cross-examination by Mr King, counsel for Mr Tran, any record or note from any particular investigation in which he had been involved. Mr King submitted that without those documents being produced the basis of opinions could not be tested. In my view the detective does not need to produce those documents to demonstrate experience and knowledge. I do not read the authorities as requiring the production of such material in order to meet the test in Makita v Sprowles or the other authorities. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    28 In my view, the trial judge’s reasoning was correct. The complaint is and was that the witness did not produce two documentary sources of knowledge to which he had recourse. This did not affect the exposure of his reasoning process. Self-evidently, there was no production of written material to which the witness had made reference. As to the “dictionary” that was maintained by the Police Service, Det Sgt Cadden said that he did not use the document to form his opinion; rather, he relied on his own experience to do so. In relation to the price list, Det Sgt Cadden did accept on the voir dire that he had reference to the list; but it is also clear from his evidence that he had recourse to his own extensive experience. 
     
      
    29 The absence of these documents did not mean that the witness’ reasoning was not exposed. I will not lengthen these reasons unnecessarily by setting out Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence in full; but the following examples can be given:

        Q. Sir were you able to identify in that conversation anything consistent with the usage of drug code terminology? 
         
        A. Sir the word cabinet is a term which is consistent in my experience with a reference to the prohibited drug ice or crystalline methylamphetamine. I base that on a number of reasons, one being experience I’ve had in that word, in a term through the sources as we’ve spoken of in my experience as I went through I started my evidence, also based it on a translation of a Vietnamese word which literally leads me to believe the word cabinet is an alternate word for fridge. Just bear in mind if I could refer to my notes for the exact translation of that word if the court allows me. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
          
         
        Q. So paragraph 107 is where you start? 
         
        A. Sir the word fridge in Vietnamese is in my knowledge is made up of two words being To and Lun, now I don’t profess to have the tone marks or the pronunciation correct in those words. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What does To mean? 
         
        A. To I understand to mean cabinet. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And Lun? 
         
        A. Lun means cold. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Together? 
         
        A. Well literally meaning a cold cabinet. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What if anything is that consistent with in drug terminology in your experience? 
         
        A. Would be drug ice or crystalline methylamphetamine. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is your view in relation to the use in this call of the word cabinet? 
         
        A. Sir in my experience the word cabinet is consistent with a reference to the prohibited drug ice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just for clarity sir, you’ve given evidence that cabinet is translated as To in Vietnamese, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes that’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is is Lun is cold? 
         
        A. Yes that is where the word fridge comes from the word cabinet To Lun, in other word cabinet with the word Ao on the end Ao becomes like a wardrobe. Cabinet To means in my experience with the Vietnamese language a domestic container and if you were to put Lun at the end which means cold it becomes a fridge, you put Ao at the end which is clothes it becomes a wardrobe, that’s my understanding of the variation of the Vietnamese language, one word will denote something and the following word will mean what it actually is. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just sticking with the example you’ve given of To Lun? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is the literal meaning of that in English? 
         
        A. Cabinet cold but is used to refer – it is used to mean fridge. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes and that term To Lun is consistent with what usage in the drugs trade in your view? 
         
        A. It’s also consistent with ice or crystalline methamphetamine – methylamphetamine. 
         
        Q. In that case the word cabinet is used? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Right. Do you have a view as to whether the word cabinet standing alone is consistent with any usage in drug terminology? 
         
        A. Yes sir it’s consistent with the reference to the ice or crystalline methylamphetamine. The words in my experience are interchangeable. 
        
       
       
       
        
        CALL DATED 31/12/04 AT 12:06AM READ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sir, I draw your attention to the use of the words “Leng Chai” which the translator translates as “pretty boy” or “young boy” in the statement of Ken at the fourth entry and again in the statement of Ken at the fifth entry. Are you able to discern a usage or not able to discern a usage consistent with coded conversation? 
         
        A. Sir, only to refer to earlier that’s a – that’s a code not overly familiar to me as in Leng Chai. However, I’ve given my opinion as to a boy in the previous call. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Further down the page you see the two speakers at three lines from the bottom. Anh-Ba says, “No, just those er er those what you call you know those er um um nine five with me.” And then he refers to it in the next sentences, “Those nine five types.” What, if anything, can you discern from that usage? 
         
        A. In my experience numbers such as those are consistent with a price. A person in my experience who is discussing a price will never actually say at $95,000 they will generally in this example, and I’m using it as an example, that the numbers $95,000 would be shortened to nine five. Similarly $50,000 may be shortened to 50. That’s part of the code. They don’t wish that to be – they don’t wish to be openly heard discussing sums of such high nature that may require explanation at a later date.

        Q. Sir, I draw your attention to the statement, “I’ll just go and buy some stuff and I’ll bring those papers over to you soon.” What, if anything, do you say about that? 
         
        A. Sir, the word “papers” in my experience is consistent with a reference to money. That’s – that term is almost a universal term not only in Asian use also in other nationalities when referring to money. There are a number of variations of that term and they are raised throughout my – my evidence to come, but it universally means – that I’ve never known it to mean anything other than money. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Sergeant I draw your attention to the second line of the intercept of 13 January 2005 where Mr Pham referred to there as Sang says I can give you two old men with walking sticks. What do you say if anything about the use of the term old man generally speaking? 
         
        A. Sir in my experience the term old man or old men is consistent with a reference to a 350gram block of heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you heard it used in the drug trade before? 
         
        A. Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it common or not common? 
         
        A. It is relatively common. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is it used to refer to? 
         
        A. A block of heroin, a 350gram block of heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Does the walking stick have any particular significance for you? 
         
        A. I’m unable to say sir with any clairty. 
        
       
       
       
        
        CALL DATED 21 JANUARY AT 13:13 HOURS READ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I draw your attention, sir, to the sixth line in which Tu Lo says, “Hey about the old man Anh-Ba”? 
         
        A: Sir that’s consistent with the previous calls I’ve seen in this exhibit regarding the term “old man” being a reference to the drug heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I draw you to five lines on where Tu Lo says, “But they say get him to come down to the house number 5, can you do that? Anh-Ba come down to Tu Lo to number 5. The house number is 3 I mean the house number is 130. They want him to come over to the house number 105 Oh I mean 125”? 
         
        A. Sir it proves I’ve given my evidence regarding the house number being consistent with the price given that the house number is what the value is. This series, this part of the conversation certainly assists in that opinion. 130 and 125 being in my opinion the references to thousands of dollars is a very consistent price for a 350gram block of heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Consistent with what? 
         
        A. Consistent with the price for a block of heroin of that nature. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At this time? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, please go on? 
         
        A. that’s what would be expected to pay and the discount say of five obviously my opinion would be $5,000 and that would be consistent with what one might expect a person to request as a discount for a block of heroin when considering you’re paying that much money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that interpretation consistent with the difference between $130,000 and $125,000? 
         
        A. Yes sir, yes. 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    30 These examples, which are typical, show that the reasoning of the witness was disclosed. The evidence was partly based on his familiarity with terms from his experience and a process of inductive and deductive logic, together with some common sense. The evidence can be seen to be substantially based on his expertise. The contrary was not propounded on appeal. 
     
      
    31 The objection at the trial (and on appeal) was as to the threshold admissibility of the evidence for lack of exposed reasoning. In my view that complaint is not made out. 
     
      
    32 No complaint was made at the trial (or on appeal) based on either or both ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The absence of the documents that were held by a third party (the Police Service) and that were readily identifiable at the time of the voir dire and before, might conceivably have formed a basis of such an application. No doubt, however, the amenability of the documents to production by a subpoena would have been relevant to any such application. 
     
      
    33 The argument was that there was an absence of reasoning. There was not. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to re-open its case after commencement of the address by the Crown Prosecutor 
       
      
    34 This complaint arose out of evidence given by a Mr Nguyen. His evidence dealt with voice recognition. Mr Tran (the appellant) had accepted that it was his voice on some of the recorded interceptions; but he did not make that concession as to all recordings said to be of conversations involving him. Mr Nguyen’s evidence was intended to be used to prove that it was Mr Tran’s voice on all the tapes as the voice of “Anh-Ba”. On the voir dire, Mr Nguyen gave evidence by reference to his statement dated 2 December 2006 to the effect the voice of Anh-Ba appeared in the listed telephone calls. At the trial, the Crown Prosecutor sought to take a short cut to avoid taking Mr Nguyen to every transcript. This course, however, led to the statement of Mr Nguyen not being tendered, by oversight. This occurred through the inadvertence of the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    35 The trial judge permitted this oversight to be cured. There was power to do so: Wasow (1985) 18 A Crim R 348 at 350 (though a case before any defence case); and R v Chin (1985) 157 CLR 671 at 677 and 685. The question is essentially one of fairness, based on the accused being entitled to know the case to be met. There could have been no doubt that Mr Tran and his counsel understood the intended extent of Mr Nguyen’s evidence. It was not asserted that there was any step taken or not taken by the defence based on the limitation in the Crown case caused by the error. Rather, it was submitted that prejudice would be caused by the possibility or a potential for the jury placing disproportionate weight on the evidence lately produced. Counsel for Mr Tran cross-examined on the further evidence. 
     
      
    36 In all the circumstances, I do not see any error in the exercise of the discretion by the trial judge to remedy an oversight in a complex trial in a body of evidence that was clearly before the defence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown Prosecutor to reply after the appellant’s address 
       
      
    37 At the end of the address by counsel for Mr Tran, the Crown Prosecutor raised certain aspects of the address which he asserted went beyond the evidence. The Crown Prosecutor suggested three possible remedies: that Mr King (counsel for Mr Tran) address and correct the errors; that the judge address and correct them in her summing up; and that the Crown have a right of reply. 
     
      
    38 The trial judge took Mr King’s comments in debate over the issue that the first alternative was not possible because Mr King took the view that there were no misstatements. No complaint was made on appeal about this conclusion by the trial judge. 
     
      
    39 The trial judge then recited s160(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) which permits the Crown to make a supplementary address if the accused’s address asserts relevant facts that are not supported by any evidence. The trial judge concluded that there were matters that fell within s160(2). No complaint was made on appeal about this conclusion of the trial judge. 
     
      
    40 The complaint on appeal was that the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion miscarried in allowing the Crown to deal with the issue because the mistakes by Mr Tran’s trial counsel were thereby highlighted. 
     
      
    41 The decision of the trial judge was supported by the terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, s160(2) and also by the discussion by Hunt J in O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 404. In particular, were her Honour to have dealt with the matter herself, the risk of prejudice of the kind asserted by Mr Tran was equally, if not more, likely, having regard to her Honour’s authority. 
     
      
    42 I see no error in the exercise of the discretion. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The trial judge erred in her direction about possession 
       
      
    43 This point was not taken by counsel for Mr Tran at the trial. Leave is therefore required to argue the point: rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
    44 The argument concerned the trial judge’s direction about possession of the drugs found at the Cabramatta house. The trial judge directed the jury that they could consider the evidence in relation to Mr Tran being in sole possession of them or being jointly in possession of them with an identified woman. There was some evidence that this person was living in the house. 
     
      
    45 In the direction given by the trial judge, her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        It’s not the Crown case that  
        [the named woman] 
         was in joint possession of the heroin with Mr Tran.  
         
         
        The Crown has pointed to the phone calls which it says were made by Mr Tran to show that he had custody and control of the heroin found in the house. 
         
         
        But if you concluded on the evidence that is available to you that Mr Tran and  
        [the named woman] 
         were jointly in possession of the heroin, that is that they together intentionally exercised exclusive control over the heroin as against the rest of the world, then you could still find Mr Tran guilty of count 1, that is if you find all the elements of the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
    46 In fact the Crown Prosecutor had in his closing address told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        You would find that he had access to all the material in that house, particularly the drugs. Even if he had access together with  
        [the named woman] 
        . 
        
       
       
      Also, in the absence of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor said the following to the trial judge: 
       
       
        
        Your Honour, the Crown case is that Mr Tran either lived there or was a frequent visitor there and in either case had the power to exclude others from possession of the drugs, whether he did so alone or together with  
        [the named woman] 
        . 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    47 It could not be shown, and indeed it was not submitted, that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs were in Mr Tran’s possession solely or jointly with the woman in question. 
     
      
    48 The point was not taken at the trial. The Crown’s case did support the direction. Leave should not be given to raise the point. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The trial judge erred in relation to her direction as to lies 
       
      
    49 Again leave is required to raise the point, it not having been taken at the trial. 
     
      
    50 In Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211 (per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) and Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 244 (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) the question of the appropriate direction about lies was discussed. These principles were helpfully summarised by Whealy J in R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 at [24] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A lie can constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence (i.e. it relates to a material issue).  
         
         
        (2) The lie must be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest.  
         
         
        (3) The jury must be satisfied that the lie was a deliberate lie.  
         
         
        (4) The lie may be taken into account only if the jury is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence, or some aspect of it, and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence.  
         
         
        (5) It is necessary for the jury to be reminded that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    51 Whealy J also, dealt with the problem of circularity in relation to reliance on lies by referring at [38] to Zheng v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 572 at 576-77; R v ST (1997) 92 A Crim R 390 at 394; Mercer v R (1993) 67 Crim R 91 at 98; and R v Middleton [2001] Crim LR 251; and R v Harron [1996] Crim LR 581 at 583. 
     
      
    52 In Zheng at 576-77, Hunt CJ at CL said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        Once the jury had reached that conclusion concerning the appellant’s conduct, there was nothing further which the Crown had to establish relating to that particular conduct of the appellant. For the jury to be invited to conclude that the appellant’s lies concerning his conduct in the car park was available as evidencing a consciousness of guilt, which could then in turn be taken into account in some way in determining whether the appellant had in fact conducted himself in that way is a wholly circular argument. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words, the appellant’s lies as to what he did in the car park could not logically be established without first reasoning that the appellant had in fact done in the car park what the Crown’s witnesses said that he did, where their evidence was the only evidence that he so conducted himself. This circular process of reasoning was necessarily erroneous in relation to the second and third counts, where that was the only conduct concerning the appellant which the jury had to consider. Lies should not have been left at all in relation to those two counts. 
        
       
       (footnotes omitted) 
       
       
        
       
      
    53 The Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury, referring to lies that on the Crown case had been told. He relied upon these as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    54 The trial judge’s directions about lies covered five pages of transcript. Complaint was made about two particular aspects of these directions: 
     
      
       
        
        Next I want to say something to you about lies. The Crown has submitted to you that each of the accused lied in his interviews with police and the Crown has submitted that those lies show that each accused is conscious of his guilt of the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Specifically the Crown submitted that Mr Tran lied in his interview about the following things, that he lived in  
        [an address at Marrickville] 
        , the infrequency of his visits to  
        [the Cabramatta house] 
        , his lack of knowledge of heroin in  
        [the Cabramatta house]. 
        
       
       
        
        …. The Crown also submitted that he lied in the explanations he gave for his possession of the Ice in his car on 16 June, that he was given it by a man named Peter. To deliver to Domino’s Pizza at Canley Heights, for a payment of $1,000 [without knowing what he was delivering]. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    55 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Tran that the jury was invited to use the alleged lie by Mr Tran about his “lack of knowledge of heroin or white powder in [the Cabramatta house]” (being an aspect of the ultimate issue) in the assessment of the ultimate issue in relation to counts 1-3. A similar submission was made about Mr Tran’s (allegedly false) explanation for the presence of the drug Ice in his car in relation to count 17. 
     
      
    56 The trial judge did, however, in her direction, seek to divorce the consideration of the lies from the underlying evidence about the issues in question and break any circularity. Her Honour directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown asks you to consider the lies as evidence in support of the other evidence in the Crown case. So in order to decide if a statement is a lie, you cannot look at the evidence in the Crown case that the Crown wants you to find supported by lies. That means you cannot look at the telephone intercepts or the surveillance to decide that if one or other of the accused told a lie, in order to use that lie as support for the evidence in the telephone intercepts and the surveillance evidence. You cannot go round in circles like that, you have to look for other evidence to decide if you can identify a lie. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    57 No complaint was made at the trial about the adequacy of this direction as to eliminating the risk of any circular reasoning. It is possible that it could be argued that this is a case in which it is difficult to identify evidence other than that which her Honour said should not be taken into account, that could support the conclusion of the lies. That complaint was not made at the trial. 
     
      
    58 Given that her Honour did deal with the circularity issue and that no complaint was made at the trial below as to this aspect of the summing up, it has not been shown, in my view, that leave should be granted under rule 4. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The trial judge’s summing up was unfair and unbalanced and led to a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    59 This complaint was made below. On appeal, Mr Tran relied on the matters raised by counsel at the trial. 
     
      
    60 Trial counsel first complained of the lack of resemblance of the summing up to the address by the Crown. The second complaint was that it did not take the form of an outline of the arguments of the respective parties. Thirdly, complaint was made about the volume or extent of the consideration of the Crown’s case. This was to be contrasted with a comment at the end of the summary of the Crown’s evidence that they had heard what Mr King (counsel for Mr Tran) said about that and that the judge need not remind them of that. 
     
      
    61 A number of things need be said about the Crown case and the summing up. First, the number of counts and the complexity of the fragmented evidence from surveillance, telephone intercepts, translation, voice recognition, code evidence, searches pursuant to warrants and arrests, and records of interview made a careful marshalling of the evidence of the Crown in a coherent way a very difficult task. The trial judge meticulously collected and discussed the evidence in relation to each count to bring form and structure to it. The task was a difficult one. It was a task necessary to be done in order that a complex Crown case could be adequately explained to a jury. It was a task necessary to be done to do fairness to the Crown. The trial judge was not obliged to leave opaque any body of evidence that may not have been fully or coherently explained by the Crown in its address. 
     
      
    62 The difficulty for the accused at the trial was that when a coherent and meticulous collection of the evidence was displayed in the summing up, it is, and was, apparent that the Crown case was very strong. That was not the product of an unfair summing up; rather, it was the product of a meticulous and clear organisation of the material by the trial judge. 
     
      
    63 After the objection was made by counsel for Mr Tran her Honour said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        All right thank you. Well in my view the summing up was a resume of the evidence in relation to each count. It was organised to relate the evidence to each count. I did put the defence case in my view but it’s difficult to put a defence case higher than the case that was run which in both cases was fairly minimal. I did put your criticisms of Detective Cadden’s evidence in my view. They essentially boiled down to the criticisms as I put them. If the Crown is strong and the defence case is less so a balanced summing up does not have to weaken the Crown case and strengthen the defence case in order to be balanced. I did not water down any warnings. I gave them in accordance with the legislation and the authorities which had considered them. Your application is refused. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    64 The legitimacy of her Honour’s views need to be assessed. 
     
      
    65 The address by counsel for Mr Tran occupied two days. A significant attack was made on the reliability of Det Sgt Cadden as a witness and of his evidence. The evidence of other experts was called into question, in particular that of voice recognition. The jury were taken over large sections of the evidence, in an address, which, if may say without intended disrespect, lacked a degree of cohesion and clarity. The evidence of words used in the transcripts and Det Sgt Cadden’s interpretations were gone over at length. It would not be a productive task to try and summarise the almost two hundred pages of transcript. It is sufficient to say that the jury were asked to find reasonable doubt in circumstances of the reciting of a mass of apparently confusing and unorganised evidence from witnesses some of whose reliability was put in question, in the face of the asserted explanations given by Mr Tran in his records of interview. 
     
      
    66 Mr Tran’s case can be summarised as follows. Mr Tran did not give evidence but evidence was called on his behalf. Mr Tran’s solicitor, Mr Elliot, gave evidence that as a result of his client’s instructions he went to a shop in Cabramatta where there was a restaurant called Hai Ven. On the front glass door of the restaurant there was a painting of palm trees. Mr Elliot also gave evidence that he went to the office of Fair Trading and conducted searches on business names for those premises and found the premises had also been known as Cay Dua in 2002. Documents from the New South Wales office of Fair Trading recorded that Hai Ven was registered in August 2003 and at the time of trial was still registered in that name. The premises had previously been registered as Cay Dua in 1998. A Mr Pham (a NAATI level 3 translator) gave evidence that one of the business names provided to him by Mr Elliot, Cay Dua, translated to “coconut tree” when spoken but it read as “palm tree”. This evidence related to the intercept evidence and the references to meeting at the palm tree. There was a palm tree outside the Cabramatta house.  
     
      
    67 Mr Tran admitted that he went to the Cabramatta house with the palm tree but submitted that the Crown was not able to prove through the surveillance evidence that he had gone there every time that he had mentioned. Counsel submitted that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tran was in possession of the drugs found there. 
     
      
    68 Mr Tran through his counsel sought to show through cross-examination that Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence about the coded conversations could not be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. It was submitted that Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence was biased, that he knew of the arrests and what was found at the arrests and that this would have influenced his interpretation of the calls in a particular way. Counsel also submitted that there were other possible meanings to the words attributed as “drug code” by Det Sgt Cadden. He also submitted that the Crown had not proved that Det Sgt Cadden’s suggested meanings were the only possible meaning. 
     
      
    69 Counsel for Mr Tran also submitted that the Crown had not shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the interpreters had correctly attributed the identities to the voices except for those calls in respect of which admissions were made.  
     
      
    70 Mr Tran’s counsel also submitted that his behaviour was inconsistent with guilt and that he participated in all interviews with police and that he did not do anything to counter surveillance when things went wrong (when arrests occurred).  
     
      
    71 He also said that there was no fingerprint or DNA evidence that linked Mr Tran to the drugs.  
     
      
    72 Mr Pham’s case was that whilst drugs were found in his bag he did not know what they were. He said that there was sufficient doubt in the Crown case not to convict him. He did not give evidence. He also submitted through his counsel that Det Sgt Cadden’s opinions should not be accepted. 
     
      
    73 There could be no doubt that the jury was aware of counsel’s attack on the reliability of the voice recognition and code evidence, even though the attack on that evidence was made, if I may say, in a less than coherent manner. Also, the jury were provided with the transcript of addresses of counsel for both accused and of the Crown Prosecutor after the trial judge’s summing up. 
     
      
    74 The trial judge in her summing up over two days clarified the content and the structure of the evidence. Her Honour did not seek to set out all that counsel for Mr Tran had said. She said, of course, that the acceptance of the witnesses and the reliability of their evidence was a matter for the jury. From time to time her Honour referred to the explanations given by Mr Tran. 
     
      
    75 It was plain from the summing up that the jury were required to address the reliability of the Crown’s evidence, in particular that of Det Sgt Cadden and the voice interpretation. Her Honour directed the jury in summary form about Det Sgt Cadden’s evidence and the criticism of it; warned the jury about the need for caution before accepting the voice identification evidence; directed the jury about such evidence as there was led by Mr Tran; and drew attention to the explanations given by the appellants in their records of interview. 
     
      
    76 The assessment of the fairness and balance of the summing up is to a significant extent a matter of impression after reading all that counsel put and then assessing the approach of the trial judge and the effect it may or would have had on the jury, such that it can be concluded that the directions so lacked judicial balance and so partook of partiality as to render the trial a miscarriage of justice: Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 34; and Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18[29]. Given the trial judge’s attempts to create some order and structure from the evidence, given the long and discursive address by counsel for Mr Tran and given such attention as the trial judge gave to the case of Mr Tran I am not prepared to conclude that there was any lack of fairness in the approach her Honour took. 
     
      
    77 I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    78 For the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal against the conviction of Mr Tran. No separate arguments were put by Mr Pham against his conviction. His appeal therefore also fails. 
     
      
       
      The sentence appeals 
       
      
    79 The DPP complains that the sentences imposed on Mr Tran and Mr Pham were manifestly inadequate and that her Honour’s sentencing remarks betrayed certain identified errors. 
     
      
    80 Mr Tran and Mr Pham also sought leave, should their conviction appeals be dismissed, to appeal against the severity of their sentences.  
     
      
    81 I will deal with the DPP appeals first. 
     
      
       
      Mr Tran 
       
      
    82 Mr Tran was found guilty of a number of offences of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity (counts 3 and 16), in an amount not less than a commercial quantity (counts 1, 4, 11, 13), in an amount not less than an indictable quantity (count 2) and of supplying a prohibited drug (the statutory alternative to count 8). 
     
      
    83 The maximum penalty for each of the offences of supplying a large commercial quantity was life imprisonment. The standard non-parole period fixed pursuant to s54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for each of these offences was 15 years. The maximum penalty for each of the offences of supplying a commercial quantity was 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
     
      
    84 The first error asserted was a failure to take into account correctly Mr Tran’s previous convictions, which included possession of heroin for which a sentence of 10 years had been imposed (with a 6½ year non-parole period). This record was taken by the judge to deny Mr Tran leniency. The DPP submitted that the record and the serious nature of the convictions should have led to a more severe penalty for the reasons expressed in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477: 
     
      
       
        
        [T]he antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences… 
        
       
       
        
        The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    85 I see no error in this regard in the judge’s approach. The judge said that this being the second time Mr Tran had offended as to drugs “personal deterrence and condign punishment must be factors in sentencing him”. Her Honour had regard, in my view, to the considerations referred to in Veen (No 2). 
     
      
    86 The second asserted error identified was not to sentence Mr Tran to non-parole periods equivalent to the standard non-parole periods. Her Honour’s approach was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Tran is to be sentenced for eight offences and Mr Pham six. Because of the number of transactions at different times and involving different drugs concurrent sentences would not properly deal with all of their separate criminality and therefore the sentences should, according to principle, be partially accumulated. However, the total effective sentence for each man must be appropriate to his total criminality. Because of the number of counts for which each of Mr Tran and Mr Pham is to be sentenced I have come to the view that if I were to impose a standard nonparole period for each offence I have categorised in the midrange of seriousness and to accumulate for separate episodes of criminality I would in each case impose total effective sentences which would be excessive when one stands back and examines the total criminality. I have therefore decided to impose non-parole periods less than the standard non-parole period for all offences to which I considered they would otherwise apply, and to make some sentences concurrent for offences, which involve separate criminality. To do otherwise, that is apply the standard non-parole periods and then apply principles of at least partial accumulation for separate criminality, would lead to sentences disproportionate to the offenders’ total criminality. I will back date the sentences to commence when each of Mr Pham and Mr Tran were taken into custody on arrest being 15 May 2005 and 16 June 2005 respectively. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    87 In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-624[45] McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        To an offender, the only relevant question may be “how long”, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    88 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s54B permitted the sentencing judge to set a non-parole period longer or shorter than the standard period: s54B(1), for reasons set out in s21A of that Act: s54B(3). 
     
      
    89 There were no relevant mitigating factors in s21A(3), present on the facts here. The legitimacy of her Honour’s approach therefore depends on the terms of s21A(1)(c) or the final sentence of s21A(1). Section 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         (1) In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:  
         
        (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
         
        (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
         
        (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
         
        
       
      
    90 Section 21A(1)(c) is directed, in terms, to the offence. Here, her Honour’s consideration was to the overall effect of all sentences for all offences, that is, the totality of the sentences. This can be seen as recourse to a relevant “rule of law” for the purposes of the last paragraph in s21A(1). In applying the last sentence of s21A(1) (in particular these last words, “rule of law”) one would need to follow Pearce, above. On one reading of her Honour’s remarks on sentence, it is open to conclude that her Honour may not have complied with Pearce, by reducing the standard non-parole periods by reason of her view as to an appropriate overall sentencing result, rather than fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considering cumulation, concurrence and totality. On the other hand, it may only be a question of mode of expression of putting into effect the approach in Pearce. In the end, I do not think it matters how one views this part of her Honour’s sentencing remarks. The DPP conceded on appeal that even had her Honour set the standard non-parole periods, she could have reached the same overall sentencing result by a process of accumulation and concurrence. This concession makes it unnecessary to consider further the way her Honour expressed her approach to the non-parole periods and totality. I would not interfere with the sentences. In my view, the sentences and their accumulated effect are not manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    91 The third asserted error was her Honour’s failure to determine the quantity of cocaine in the conviction on the statutory alternative count to count 8. Her Honour was of the view that she was not able to do so on the evidence. In these circumstances she was not obliged to make such a finding. Her Honour was then criticised for imposing a sentence no greater than could have been imposed in a Local Court. Her Honour said that she proposed “to keep in mind the lower maximum penalty of two years when sentencing Mr Tran for this offence”. Her Honour’s remarks on sentence indicated a fixed term of 3 years. The trial judge’s approach was not contrary to R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16] as submitted by the DPP. 
     
      
    92 Overall, in my opinion, the sentences imposed by her Honour do not reflect a failure to take into account the total criminality of Mr Tran’s offences. 
     
      
    93 Nor do I consider the sentences manifestly excessive. These were serious crimes reflecting an ongoing commercial participation in the trafficking of drugs. The sentences in my view properly reflect the criminality of Mr Tran. 
     
      
    94 Thus I would dismiss the DPP’s appeal against sentences imposed on Mr Tran and grant Mr Tran’s application for leave to appeal against his sentences, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Mr Pham 
       
      
    95 Essentially the same arguments were put in relation to the sentences imposed on Mr Pham. For the same reasons the DPP’s appeal against the sentences imposed on him should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    96 I would make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. As to Mr Tran - 
       
       
        
        (a) Refuse leave to raise as a ground of appeal the direction of the trial judge about joint possession. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Refuse leave to raise as a ground of appeal the direction of the trial judge about lies. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Dismiss the appeal against his conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him, and dismiss the appeal. 
        
       
       
      2. As to Mr Pham – 
       
       
        
        (a) Dismiss the appeal against his conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him, and dismiss the appeal. 
        
       
      3. As to the Director of Public Prosecution’s appeals: 
       
       
        
        (a) Dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed on Mr Tran. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed on Mr Pham.

   JUDGMENT1. I am hearing an appeal by Timothy Adam Hodge. His appeal to me is from sentences imposed on him by a Magistrate. 2. The sentences were imposed on 16 June 2008 at the Forbes Local Court. On that day Mr Hodge was sentenced for five crimes. One was malicious damage committed on 31 March 2007. The second was resisting arrest committed on 20 July 2007. The third was intimidating a person committed on 17 August 2007. The fourth was resisting arrest committed on the same day and the fifth was assault committed on 30 September 2007.3. For all of those crimes the Magistrate sentenced Mr Hodge to imprisonment. The prison sentences varied but the overall result was twelve months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months.4. Briefly what happened is this. So far as the malicious damage was concerned, Mr Hodge was convicted by the Magistrate - after a defended trial - of damaging a petrol bowser at a local service station. There did not appear to be any other aggravating circumstances but the behaviour was immature and unprovoked. He has apparently paid the compensation. 5. The first resist arrest occurred on 20 July 2007. He was drunk and disorderly in public. Police arrived. They tried to calm him down and send him away, he was abusive to them. In particular he singled out a police officer who was a woman and used very abusive language towards her. The police in my opinion acted very tolerantly. At first they arrested him but then when he got away they suggested to his girlfriend that she take him home and they would issue a summons.6. Not content with that suggestion Mr Hodge took on the police again and continued his verbal abuse. It is not the kind of abuse that anyone in the community should tolerate and in particular the police who were merely trying to do their job that evening. In the end they arrested him and in the course of that arrest he had to be tackled to the ground. He continually thrashed his body about and attempted to lift himself off the ground. He had to be handcuffed and physically placed into the police vehicle.7. The offence committed on 17 August 2007 - the resist arrest - occurred when police were trying to arrest Mr Hodge after his behaviour which amounted to intimidation which I will return to shortly. When they tried to arrest him he put both feet forward in front of him on the ground in order to resist the efforts of the police in moving him. A struggle occurred and two or three police were required to put him into the custody of the police vehicle. 8. I regard the malicious damage as low in the range of objective seriousness. I regard the two offences of resist arrest as standard offences of resist arrest; they are not serious instances of that crime. As I said the behaviour is not to be condoned and the police in my view acted very reasonably and should not be required to tolerate such behaviour. But the resisting arrest was not accompanied by any particularly aggravating features.9. The offence of intimidating a person which was also committed on 17 August 2008 is in a different category. The person intimidated was an off-duty police officer which was an aggravating feature under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In addition, at the time of committing that offence Mr Hodge was on a bond imposed under s 9 of the same Act for a previous offence of assaulting an officer in the execution of their duty.10. Although being on the bond was also an aggravating feature of the two resist arrests I regard the aggravation as more serious in the case of the intimidation focused on a particular police officer.11. The off-duty police officer, Detective Sergeant Howard, was accompanied by his female partner. He reported that Mr Hodge had been verbally harassing him. Both Mr Howard and Mr Hodge argued. Mr Howard and his partner walked away but Mr Hodge remained and continued his verbal abuse of Detective Sergeant Howard. In fact at one stage he called out to him “You’re dead you cunt”. But not long afterwards Detective Sergeant Howard received a telephone call on his personal mobile phone. He recognised the voice of Mr Hodge. Mr Hodge said “You’re a putrid dog, you’re a dog, why don’t you come down here and fight me like your dog, you’re gone.” Detective Sergeant Howard immediately terminated the call and reported the incident.12. Understandably Detective Sergeant Howard felt threatened and intimidated due to the threat which had been previously made in the street, the fact that Mr Hodge had obtained his personal mobile phone number and the threat of physical violence. I regard the closeness of time between the threat in the street of “You’re dead cunt” and the threat made on the phone which was concluded by the words “You’re gone” to cause in any person a concern for their well being and indeed their life.13. I regard this as an offence which - because of its aggravating features of being inflicted upon a police officer and whilst he was on conditional liberty for assaulting a police officer - is particularly serious. So far as its objective seriousness is concerned it is within but not far within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.14. The last offence that Mr Hodge was convicted of was an assault. That occurred on 30 September 2007. A man left a hotel with some companions. Mr Hodge challenged him but the man kept walking. Mr Hodge then pursued the man, verbally abused him. The man who obviously knew Mr Hodge asked what his problem was. Mr Hodge’s response was to grab hold of the man’s shirt but Mr Hodge would not let go. A security officer intervened and the man stepped back but as he did so Mr Hodge swung his left arm and struck the man in the face with a closed fist causing him to stumble back. Hence he was charged with assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900.15. I have heard evidence which I accept and which I regard as impressive from Mr Hodge’s mother. I do not propose to recount all of her evidence. Mr Hodge is obviously from a close and supportive family. She as his mother has observed his behaviour over the years. He reacted adversely to the death of two friends, one of them a very close friend, in a car accident some years ago. She noticed a change in his mood and behaviour and drinking and behavioural habits.16. At some time also there was an incident between Mr Hodge and the police. It was relatively minor but provoked a complaint by Mrs Hodge to the Commissioner. The complaint resulted in the initial charge not being proceeded with. So far as Mr Hodge is concerned he was dealt with inappropriately by the police. There followed over some years a good deal of friction between Mr Hodge and the police in Forbes where Mr Hodge lives. With his mother’s encouragement but also on his own initiative, Mr Hodge undertook counselling and this has been quite successful to date. 17. He has had a mixed history of employment but has some skills and has secured employment at various stages which he has kept. One period of employment was interrupted by the fact that he kept becoming the centre of attention by the police. However he expects to obtain employment on a property in Gooloogong not far from Forbes in the near future.18. There is a pre-sentence report which recommends his suitability for community service orders and eligibility and suitability for periodic detention orders. It notes a need for anger management and focus on alcohol consumption and suggests that he would be suitable for a medium level of supervision. 19. There are also references from respected persons in the community who, I accept, know about his offending behaviour and who point out that he is from a strong and supportive family and, in one case, expresses the opinion that he will mature and prove himself as a result of these adverse experiences. These adverse experiences I might add are crimes committed by him. 20. He has a criminal record. It includes as I said an offence of assaulting an officer in the execution of their duty. That was committed in July 2006 and he received a good behaviour bond in January 2007. He has convictions for goods in custody and a driving conviction as well for driving in a manner dangerous.21. Mr Hodge was born on 5 November 1987 so that he is not yet twenty-one. 22. Mr Allen who appears for Mr Hodge submits that the matters could be dealt with with a combination of community service orders and bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.23. Mr Monaro who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions acknowledges the fact that the two resist arrests were fairly standard examples of that crime and that the malicious damage was not so serious as to warrant imprisonment. However he pointed out that the intimidation of the off-duty police officer was in another category and I accept that submission. He drew my attention to the two aggravating features to which I have referred.24. Both legal representatives regarded the assault on the man outside the hotel as a significant crime but not a serious example of that kind of offence.25. I regard the intimidation as the most serious of the offences, aggravated as it is for the reasons that I have indicated. Because he was already on a good behaviour bond for assaulting the police and because he chose as his victim a police officer, I regard those two aggravating features as serious enough to warrant a sentence of imprisonment.26. I have considered the alternatives and because of those aggravating features I do not regard them as appropriate. However I regard Mr Hodge’s age as a significant factor. The authorities make it clear that a younger offender should be dealt with by a sentence with more emphasis on the prospects of rehabilitation rather than deterrence and denunciation. This is for a number of reasons but one is well illustrated in this case. It seems to me that because of his youth Mr Hodge reacted immaturely to a number of unfavourably early life experiences - one being very tragic. His immaturity has produced violence and offensive crimes. However, he seems to be on the way to rehabilitation and I regard sentences which will encourage that course of rehabilitation as more appropriate than sentences which involve full-time or part-time custody. For that reason I propose to impose a sentence in due course for the intimidate offence which I will suspend.27. I regard the malicious damage as a crime which should attract a fine and the first offence of resisting arrest as also one which should attract a fine. However in respect of the second resist arrest, although objectively less serious, it was committed after he had already been charged and indeed pleaded guilty to the first resist arrest. I propose to impose a community service order in respect of that crime and a community service order in respect of the assault.28. I regard the sentence fixed by the Magistrate for the intimidation - of four months - as appropriate but I will suspend that sentence.29. Accordingly I determine this appeal against sentence as follows. Under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentences of the Magistrate. Instead of those sentences I impose the following sentences:· In respect of the crime of malicious damage the offender is convicted and fined $500.· In respect of the crime of resisting arrest committed on 20 July 2007 he is convicted and fined $750.· In respect of the intimidation offence committed on 17 August 2007 I impose a sentence of imprisonment of four months and I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of that sentence for the whole of the period and I direct that Mr Hodge be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for four months.· The conditions of that good behaviour bond are as follows: (1) That he be of good behaviour. (2) That he notify the registrar of this court of any change of his residential address. (3) That he appears in court at any time if called upon to do so. (4) That he accept supervision from the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and accept any reasonable recommendations or directions of that Service, particularly as they relate to maintaining current alcohol and drug counselling, intervention and attending additional alcohol and drug counselling or programme; maintaining current anger management counselling interventions and attending upcoming anger management group programmes, monitoring peer relation and impact of these relations on criminal behaviour. (5) That he reports to the officer of the Probation and Parole Service at Forbes on or before Monday 25 August 2008.· In respect of the offence of resisting arrest committed on 17 August 2007, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, under s 8 of the Crimes(Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make a Community Service Order directing Mr Hodge to perform community service for fifty hours.· In respect of the offence of assault committed on 30 September 2007, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, I make a Community Service Order directing the offender to perform community service for fifty hours. Those hours are to be cumulative so that the total number of hours is 100. 
    Mr Monaro are there any other orders I need to make?MONARO: No your Honour. I was just concerned whether your Honour can suspend a short sentence.HIS HONOUR: It’s just got to be under two years.ALLEN: Yes.MONARO: Thankyou your Honour nothing further.HIS HONOUR: Yes s 12 yes. Mr Allen is there anything else?ALLEN: No.30. Mr Hodge you have won your appeal. You’ve been successful. Your behaviour has been dreadful but you’ve heard that I’ve taken into account what’s been happening in your life. I’m sure other judges or rather Magistrates made this speech to you before but you’ve just got to pay attention. You’re a young man, you come from a good family. They’re supporting you, it looks as though you’re on the right track but you’ve just got to stay out of trouble. You’ve got to take note of what they’re saying about alcohol and anger management, get yourself back on track and stay away or else you’ll end up in gaol. You heard me say that for a young man your age judges don’t like sending them to gaol, it’s a kind of experience that you’ve now had for a few days and you can tell why. I’ve fined you for the two of the offences but for what you did to the police officer I’ve given you a suspended sentence of four months. Now if you breach that suspended sentence you’ll come back before me or another judge and it is very difficult to avoid gaol, do you understand that?APPELLANT: (no verbal reply)The cards are stacked against them with these suspended sentences. If you come back it’s very hard to avoid gaol. For the other - the resist and the assault - I’ve given you Community Service Orders. Pnce again you’ve got to do that, you’ve got to do your 100 hours and if you breach or you don’t then chances are you’ll be brought back and you’ll have to have other sentences considered. Do you understand that?APPELLANT: Thankyou your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right well good luck.

The property in the strata plan consists of 11 small shops, mostly selling takeaway fast food, as well as 14 allocated parking spots and common property. The plaintiff owns five of these shops and the defendant owns one.2. The plaintiff sues the defendant for defamation for a circular letter he posted on or about 14 July 2006 to four other strata plan property owners and for publication of the same circular letter on the front of an electricity cabinet, near the toilet block situated on the common property.3. The plaintiff pleads that this publication, the text of which is set out below, conveys the following imputations: 
     
      
      (a) The plaintiff is a gangster; 
       
      (b) The plaintiff is a criminal; 
       
      (c) The plaintiff has engaged in a calculated plan to illegally dispossess the other strata owners of their rights under the strata plan. 
       
       
      
     4. The issues in these proceedings are determined in accordance with the  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 (NSW). These issues are: 
      
      
      
      (a) 
       Publication 
      : publication of the letters posted to the four co-owners is admitted but publication of the notice on the electricity circuit cabinet is denied; 
       
       
      (b) 
       Imputations 
      : whether the imputations pleaded are conveyed and defamatory; 
       
       
      (c) 
       Defences 
      : whether the publication on the electricity circuit cabinet was published on an occasion of qualified privilege either at common law or pursuant to s 30  
      Defamation Act  
      2005 (the other publications being conceded to be published on an occasion of qualified privilege) and whether the defendant was actuated by express malice, in relation to all of the publications; and whether a defence under s 33 (triviality) is made out; 
       
       
      (d) 
       Damages 
      : whether any damages awarded should include aggravated compensatory damages. 
      
      
     5. A defence of partial justification (to imputation (c)) was formally abandoned at the beginning of the defendant’s address. I granted leave to the parties to provide me with additional submissions concerning the impact of the abandonment of this defence and also to enable the defendant to consider some additional issues on publication, malice and aggravated compensatory damages.  
      
      
     The background to the publications 
      
      
     6. The strata plan was registered in 1978 (Exhibit B and P2). It is clear from the plans (Exhibit B and J) that there was a storeroom behind lots 7 and 8 of the strata plan at this time. On 27 September 1983 the members of the meeting of the body corporate of the strata plan approved the construction of a toilet on the common property behind lot 9 (Exhibit Q). All of these events occurred prior to both the plaintiff and defendant becoming proprietors of lots in the strata plan.  
      
      
     7. The defendant became the proprietor of lot 4 of the strata plan in 1985 (T 118). Shortly after he became an owner, he and the other owners decided to erect the toilet block approved in 1983 for the common use of persons visiting the strata plan. This was accordingly built on the common property. The necessary approvals were obtained from the local council for the construction of the toilet block, but no by-law was passed, nor was there any registration of the by-law in accordance with the provisions of the precursor to the  
     Strata Schemes Management Act 
      1996 (NSW).  
      
      
     8. Examination of the minute books shows that J A Somerville Pty Ltd real estate agents were appointed following the annual general meeting of the proprietors on 29 September 1987. It was proposed that two proprietors volunteered to liaise with the managing agents and one of these was the defendant (Exhibit P1). However, according to the annual general meeting minutes of 1 October 1988, he was not a member of the council. Amongst the general business items was a note that one proprietor had built an extension to his shop without the consent of the body corporate and it was not known if the work was council approved. There were also concerns about the poor state of cleaning. The defendant’s role was minimal during this time. He attended meetings but was not elected to the council until 22 August 1998, the date when he was also appointed to carry out the cleaning of the common property, details of which are set out further below. 
      
      
     9. The plaintiff commenced leasing shop number 7 in 1990 where he sold yeeros (a takeaway food) and in 1995 began buying shops starting with shop 8 (T 8), with the result that at the time of publication he owned shops 6 to 10. At all relevant times the defendant leased his shop to tenants (currently a pizzeria with takeaway service to clients). He had very little contact with the defendant until 2005. 
      
      
     10. The following alterations referred to above are of relevance to these proceedings: 
      
      
      
      (a) prior to October 1988 (before the plaintiff purchased any shops) a portion of the property behind shop 8 was closed off. In 2005 the plaintiff rendered the wall of this area and moved the door; 
       
       
      (b) a large toilet, for use by customers, tenants and delivery staff, was also constructed on the common property in about 1988. 
       
       
      (c) in about 1995, a small toilet was constructed behind the shop that the plaintiff had bought during the year; and, 
       
       
      (d) changes were made to the parking area, such as painting lines and putting numbers on parking spots. Each shop had a limited number of parking spaces. The defendant’s tenant’s lease included these car spaces, and the defendant appropriated another car spot as “his” parking spot. 
      
      
     11. On 22 August 1998 the body corporate authorised the defendant to carry out cleaning for $2,600 per year. The plaintiff was at that time one of three people running the body corporate. In 2002, the plaintiff was elected to all three executive positions and in 2004 the cleaning fee was increased to $70 per weekly visit. However at about this time, the plaintiff and Mr Tranh, another shop owner, became dissatisfied with the state of cleanliness and general conduct of the body corporate. 
      
      
     12. On 15 July 2005 an extraordinary general meeting was held. The plaintiff and defendant attended, and the other owners gave each of them proxies. By special resolution the management contract with Somerville was terminated. However, there was no resolution passed as to the appointment of office bearers (although the plaintiff in his evidence said he thought he and Mr Tranh had been appointed, there is no record of this). Two weeks later, another managing agent, Vincent Montano Strata Management, was appointed, in a contract signed by the plaintiff and Mr Tranh, although at this stage only the defendant held any executive capacity, according to the minutes. 
      
      
     13. The defendant did not take any steps to appoint any other agent, or to call the annual general meeting for the year 2005. The body corporate is compelled by law to hold annual meetings. Only the defendant held any executive position, but he did nothing to ensure the company complied with its statutory obligations. 
      
      
     14. On 27 March 2006 Mr Montano wrote a letter to the defendant: 
      
      
      
      “Re: cleaning @ 125 – 135 Marrickville Rd., MARRICKVILLE 
       
       
      We have today been informed by the Executive Committee that your services are no longer required as of 31st March 2006. 
       
       
      We take this opportunity to thank you for a job well done.” (Exhibit 2) 
      
      
     15. The defendant said in his evidence that he did not receive this letter until 21 April 2006. He denied that he was upset about losing the cleaning contract and said that he did not need the money (T 164). The defendant wrote to the new strata manager, Mr Montano, on 21 April 2006 pointing out that he was the only person who was on the executive, adding: 
      
      
      
      “Seemingly the Body Corporate had no Annual General Meeting in 2005. You must be aware that AGMs are mandatory. This will be a very contentious issue not only for me but for the rest of the Owners Corporation… In the interim, legal advice will be sought and the Department of Fair Trading will be notified of the situation.” 
      
      
     16. On 9 May 2006 Mr Montano, acting apparently on the instructions of the plaintiff and Mr Tranh, called an annual general meeting for 29 May 2006. This business on the agenda included approval of the accounts and the budget for the forthcoming year and the appointment of office bearers. The plaintiff, the defendant and Mr Tranh attended the meeting. The financial accounts were approved. The plaintiff was elected as chairperson, with Mr Tranh as the secretary and the defendant as the Treasurer. 
      
      
     17. The problems with the cleaning were dealt with at this meeting. It was agreed that the plaintiff and Mr Tranh would provide one year of cleaning for free, and that the defendant would be paid for the cleaning he did in April 2006. Thus, although the letter of 27 March had been written without the authority of the executive, the situation had been regularised and the defendant was paid for the additional cleaning he had done during April. 
      
      
     18. On 7 July 2006, with the new strata executive in place, the strata manager, Mr Montano, issued a notice for an extraordinary general meeting to be held on 21 July 2006. The business of the meeting was to deal with the following 6 motions: 
      
      
      
      (a) Motion 1 – That the minutes of the last Annual General Meeting be approved. 
       
       
      (b) Motion 2 – That the structures NOT shown on the Strata Plan which include the toilet block and the small toilet outside shop 9 be approved. 
       
       
      (c) Motion 3 – That the change of door location at the back of shops 7 and 8 be approved. 
       
       
      (d) Motion 4 – That Vincent Montano Strata Management Services be confirmed as Managing Agents for Strata Plan 13595. 
       
       
      (e) Motion 5 – That the current Executive Committee be dissolved and that nominations for a new Committee be called and an election held for membership of the Committee and its Office Bearers. 
       
       
      (f) Motion 6 – That the Strata Manager be appointed to represent the Owners Corporation at any Fair Trading hearing. 
      
      
     19. At this time, Mr Tranh was the validly appointed secretary of the body corporate and it was part of his duty, pursuant to s 22  
     Strata Schemes Management Act  
     1996 (NSW), to call such a meeting. However, it is conceded by the plaintiff that the motions to approve the existing structures were not put in the proper way. For the structures on the common property to be approved, a by-law had to be prepared for registration at the Registrar’s General’s office and appropriate compensation paid. In particular, these resolutions would need to be passed unanimously.  
      
      
     20. It was in response to these motions that the defendant wrote the matter complained of. However, he took some other steps first. 
      
      
     21. On 1 June 2006 he wrote to the plaintiff: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      RE – RUBBISH DEPOSITED ON NO 4 2 CAR PARKS 
       
       
      Remove that rubbish forthwith and that means immediately, without delay, at once, it has been there for months and also since I talked to you last has duplicated. 
       
       
      Your inaction means lack of civility and respect. 
       
       
      Hoping that this short notice will motivate for prompt action.” (Exhibit 1) 
      
      
     22. Since the defendant had been responsible for the cleaning of the property until the beginning of May, these complaints show a degree of exaggeration. However, this was only the beginning of a series of several hundred letters and emails, as well as nine complaints to the CTTT. 
      
      
     23. On 26 June 2006 the defendant made the first of a series of nine complaints to the CTTT. This complaint was that Mr Montano should be removed “FOR INEFFICIENCY – FOR INCOMPETENCE – FOR: OMITED [sic] TO CALL AGM 2005 – NO FINANCIAL REPORT FOR 2005 – NO ANSWER TO MY CORRESPONDENCE – NO REPLY TO MY PHONE CALLS – NO KNOWLEDGE STRATA MANAGEMENT SCHEMES”. It was signed by the defendant as “Executive Committee Treasurer” (Exhibit 8). 
      
      
     24. The defendant wrote to the managing agents on 1 July demanding payment for not only April but also May 2006 (“I am here on a MISSION and I don’t accept NO for an answer” – Exhibit 9) as well as a copy of their licence and the management agreement. The body corporate had already paid the April account, and Mr Montano paid the $280 “ex gratia from my office account”, according to his handwritten note on Exhibit 9. He wrote again on 12 July asking for the names and addresses of shop owners for shops 1 – 3, 5 and 11 (he later sent the matter complained of to these addresses) as well as again requesting the agency agreement. 
      
      
     25. On 17 July 2006 the defendant filed a further application (Exhibit 11) seeking the order “Pull down the erection and bring the rest to the original state within 2 months.” However, this application postdates the matter complained of, which was published three days beforehand. 
      
      
     26. On 14 July 2006 the defendant sent the matter complained of to each of the four shop owners listed. The text, leaving in all grammatical and spelling errors, is as follows: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      TO THE OWNERS OF SHOP 1, 
       
      SHOP 2, SHOP 3, SHOP 4, 
       
      SHOP 5, SHOP 11 
       
      LET US UNITED 
       
      FOR A GOOD CAUSE 
       
       
      RE – GENERAL MEETING OF STRATA PLAN 13595 
       
      21 TH JULY 2006 
       
       
      MY FRIENDS, 
       
       
      I am the owner of shop 4 for the last twenty years. I am not fully qualifed LAWYER but I have done a Law course. If you wish to fill a PROXY FORM send it to me or ring on 99581541 anytime. THIS MEETING IS OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR STRATA PLAN 13595. 
       
       
      The GANGSTERS want our land, your land, my land and take possession of it in illegally form. The GANGSTER is the owner of shops 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and the IGNORANT STRATA MANAGER works at unison with the gangster APOSTOLOS. Read very careful the MOTIONS OF THE AGENDA; if you can’t understand ask someone with knowledge regard STRATA MANAGEMENT. This MEETING is very important. Ask yourself a question – Why we want an other Meeting when we already had one on 29th May 2006???? 
       
      Motion 2) of the Agenda: The land outside at the rear of SHOP 9 has been already taken and now be approved. THEY THING [sic] WE ARE VERY VERY STUPID. 
       
       
      Motion 3) That the change in shops 7 & 8 be approved. All of this has been done illegally, everything against the LAW. We are very lucky in this COUNTRY WE HAVE A LAW TO OBEY TO. 
       
       
      We want to preserve our RIGHTS, if not god knows what will happens next. UNITED WILL WIN. Please, please, come to the Meeting or fill the PROXY FORM and send to me. United will WIN. I am with you, I am part of the STRATA PLAN 13595. United will become a force. Say NO, NO, NO, to any of the motions presented to you. Marrickville Council is investigating this, but they are a bit slow. A Solicitor has been appointed, because we want the LAW to win. 
       
       
      I have put 2 Applications with the FAIR TRADING (Government Body), one against APOSTOLOS, and one against the strata manager, and will be a meeting in the CITY on 25th July (if you wish come along) and this is why they have call this URGENT MEETING, fear that the LAW will take over. I have spent a lot of my personal time to stop these LAW’S BREAKERS. I can’t stress more forceful than this. PLEASE, PLEASE, come to the meeting or fill up a PROXY FORM AND SEND TO ME. United will WIN. 
       
       
      It is your land, it is my land. We are lucky in the COUNTRY we have LAW and rights and let show them what we can do in UNITY. Let the law be the winner and punish the LAW’S BREAKERS. 
       
       
      BEST REGARDS TO ALL OF YOU & GOOD LUCK 
       
       
      VINCENT – EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER & TRESURER – STRATA PLAN 13595” 
      
      
     Publication 
      
      
     27. It is not in dispute that each of the named recipients was sent this letter. The disputed issue concerning publication is whether a copy of the matter complained of was also affixed to the electricity cabinet outside the toilets near the car park. 
      
      
     28. The evidence relied upon by the plaintiff to establish publication is as follows: 
      
      
      
      (a) The plaintiff gave evidence he saw the matter complained of posted on the electricity cabinet opposite the common toilet block of the strata plan (T 33-34). In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed he could not read English well, but he was able to recognise his own name and some other key words. He took the notice down and threw it in the bin.  
       
       
      (b) Mr Mohammad Hai, the tenant of lot 6 of the strata plan, saw the defendant sticking something on a part of the wall that he had first called a noticeboard (T 78 line 11) but which he then said was “just the power point, big wooden piece” (T 78 line 18). In cross-examination he was asked whether it was a noticeboard or the surface of an electrical cabinet and he said “in front of the noticeboard” (T 79). When shown a picture of the noticeboard and asked if that was the noticeboard he was referring to he said “No, not, nothing else when here. It was from my door in the corridor, it was just opposite”. In fact the noticeboard was not erected until later in 2006. What Mr Hai appears to be endeavouring to say, in poor English, is that there was no noticeboard there at the time and that the notice in question was put “just opposite”. 
       
       
      (c) One of the complaint the defendant made to the CTTT and the managing agent was the absence of a noticeboard and in a number of emails (in particular an email sent which is number 43 in Exhibit Z) he sought the erection of a noticeboard on the common property for the purpose of displaying notices. 
       
       
      (d) The matter complained of uses the word “gangster” three times to describe the plaintiff. The defendant said he used this word to attract the attention of the persons to whom it was addressed. It is certainly a colourful word, although a word which is perhaps not as often used in modern parlance as it used to be. In any event, shortly after the matter complained of was asserted to have been pinned to the electricity cabinet door, passers-by began calling out the word “gangster” to the plaintiff in his shop with such frequency that the other residence complained and threatened to call the police. 
      
      
     29. The defendant submits that I should accept the denial of Mr Carpino that he did not put a copy of the matter complained of on the door to the electricity cabinet.  
      
      
     30. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a copy of the matter complained of was affixed to the electricity cabinet. In addition to the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr Hai, the circumstances in which the defendant agitated for a noticeboard with a lock so that notices could be put up, and the circumstances in which the plaintiff was subsequently harassed by unknown persons calling out “gangster” to him, are corroborative. The defendant only sent his letter on 14 July, and with the weekend intervening he no doubt was anxious that all the other owners to whom he had written would have an opportunity to read his letter. In those circumstances, on the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the defendant pasted a copy of the matter complained of on the electricity cabinet.  
      
      
     31. The defendant, in written submissions, disputes publication on the basis that if anything was seen on the door of the electricity cabinet by the plaintiff or by Mr Hai “it is not proved to have been put there by Carpino” (defendant’s outline, paragraph 1). As it happens, I am satisfied by Mr Hai’s evidence that it was the defendant who put the matter complained of on the electricity cabinet. However, to assert that it is necessary to prove that the defendant put it there is to misunderstand the very broad definition of conduct able to constitute publication, for the reasons explained by Isaacs J in  
     Webb v Bloch  
     (1928) 41 CLR 331. 
      
      
     32. While it has not been precisely pleaded, liability for publication could still be made out on the principles set out in  
     Webb v Bloch 
      at 363-364 where Isaacs J citing with approval the meaning of “publication” in  
     Folkard 
      on  
     Slander and Libel 
     , 5th ed. (1891), at p. 439 that: 
      
      
      
      “The term  
      published 
       is the proper and technical term to be used in the case of libel,  
      without reference to the precise degree 
       in which the defendant has been instrumental to such publication; since,  
      if he has intentionally lent his assistance to its existence for the purpose of being published 
      , his instrumentality is evidence to show a publication by him.” [emphasis given by Isaacs J] 
      
      
     33. There is a helpful summary of cases concerning a defendant’s liability for a publication which is put on public view in  
     Frawley v State of New South Wales 
      [2006] NSWSC 248. Strictly speaking, it is not a prerequisite for liability for publication to show that the defendant personally was responsible for the placing of a copy of his circular letter on the electricity cabinet, where it was in public view.  
      
      
     Are the imputations conveyed and defamatory? 
      
      
     34. Imputations are no longer the cause of action in New South Wales under the  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 (NSW). Where a judge-alone trial on all issues takes place, how should the judge approach this issue? I have adopted the approach taken by Simpson J in  
     Holmes v Fraser 
      [2008] NSWSC 570 at [22] – [28] and I have approached the question of whether each imputation was conveyed and defamatory in accordance with paragraphs [31] – [45] of her Honour’s judgment. 
      
      
     Imputation (a) 
      
      
     35. The word “gangster” occurs three times in the second paragraph of the matter complained of. The matter complained of sets out that “The GANGSTERS want our land, your land, my land and take possession of it in illegally form [sic]”. The plaintiff is then identified as the gangster and a statement is made that “the IGNORANT STRATA MANAGER works at unison [sic] with the gangster APOSTOLOS”.  
      
      
     36. The defendant submits in relation to both imputations (a) and (b) that the word “gangster” is an “abusive expression that would have been brushed off” (defendant’s submission, page 1) which Mr Rollinson, in oral submissions, put firstly on the basis of a claim of “vulgar abuse”. 
      
      
     37. The law relating to vulgar abuse has been comprehensively explained by the Court of Appeal in  
     Bennette v Cohen 
      (2005) 64 NSWLR 81. The facts in this case were as follows. A s 7A jury found that an imputation that the plaintiff had done illegal work which severely damaged the environment was conveyed but was not defamatory. The Court of Appeal noted at [46] – [47] that  
     Mundey v Askin 
      [1982] 2 NSWLR 369 establishes the law of New South Wales on vulgar abuse in defamation. There is no dichotomy between vulgar abuse on the one hand and defamatory matter on the other (at [51]). An imputation which is conveyed may, in certain circumstances, lose its defamatory meaning by reason of the context, particularly in the case of spoken words (in both  
     Bennette 
      and  
     Mundey 
     , the words in question were spoken). The Court of Appeal concluded (at [57]) that ordinary reasonable people could take the view that references to working illegally and work which severely damaged the environment was so indefinite and imparticular that they could not injure the plaintiff’s reputation. 
      
      
     38. However, the comments of the Court of Appeal relate to defamatory meaning, not to capacity to convey. How can it be said that the word “gangster” constitute a word that the ordinary reasonable reader would have “brushed off”? Counsel for the defendant submitted that this is because this is a “bane and antidote” case:  
     Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd 
      [1980] 2 NSWLR 418. The facts in  
     Morosi 
      were as follows. A radio broadcast dwelled at some length upon rumours concerning Ms Morosi (describing her as “the most notorious women’s name in the country”), but then went on to say that there was no truth in any of these claims, was held to be defamatory. Samuels JA noted at [6]: 
      
      
      
      “I do not doubt that there are occasions when a publication which seeks to refute a calumny which it expressly states may be held incapable of conveying any defamatory meaning.  
      Bik v Mirror Newspaper Ltd 
       (25) is an example. But such cases must be comparatively rare… [I]n a case such as this the material already contains a defamatory imputation; and the inquiry is whether that effect is overcome by contextual matter of an emollient kind so as to eradicate the hurt and render the whole publication harmless.” 
      
      
     39. While each publication must turn on its own facts, as Samuels JA noted at [8], it is necessary in a bane and antidote case to point to at least some antidote. In the present publication, there is none at all. Counsel for the defendant appears instead to be suggesting that the publication was so grossly defamatory that nobody would take it seriously. That is not an argument which has ever enjoyed any degree of acceptance by the courts. Nor is it an argument to say that the subject matter (an extraordinary general meeting of a body corporate) is so anodyne that no imputation can be conveyed. 
      
      
     40. Accordingly I am satisfied that imputation (a) is conveyed. 
      
      
     Imputation (b)  
      
      
     41. In addition to the same argument as was put in relation to imputation (a) (which I reject for the same reasons) the defendant submitted that imputations (a) and (b) do not differ in substance. 
      
      
     42. A criminal is a person who breaks the law. A gangster is a person who, usually as a member of a gang (hence the name), takes things by intimidation and force. There are many persons who may be described as criminals but who are not “gangsters”. To call a person a gangster is to accuse a person of engaging in the kinds of conduct (criminal or not) which gangsters use. This is a different meaning to “criminal”. 
      
      
     43. The reference to the plaintiff as a “law’s-breaker” [sic] in the last two paragraphs of the matter complained of, in the context of the need for the plaintiff to be punished for breaking the law (line 33) in circumstances where he has already acted illegally, is capable of conveying the imputation that the plaintiff is a criminal. The ordinary reasonable reader is not alive to the niceties of differentiation between civil and criminal law, but any allegation that a person who has “already” done the wrong thing and should be punished as a law-breaker runs the risk of conveying an imputation that the person about whom it is published is a criminal. 
      
      
     44. Imputation (b) is conveyed. 
      
      
     Imputation (c) 
      
      
     45. Objection is raised to imputation (c) on the basis that the imputation is pitched too highly. It is asserted that all that the matter complained of is capable of conveying is that the plaintiff, amongst others, plans to obtain approval for what was an illegal structure, if motions were passed at the next body corporate meeting. 
      
      
     46. The matter complained of says that the land outside of the rear of shop 9 “has already been taken” in circumstances where the plaintiff is asking for approval afterwards. It is asserted that the plaintiff and the strata manager think that the other owners “are very very stupid”.  
      
      
     47. The ordinary reasonable reader would not read the matter complained of as an assertion that the plaintiff amongst others was planning to obtain approval for an illegal structure. The matter complained of clearly says the plaintiff wants to take land belonging to others, having already taken possession of it illegally, and is now asking for approval in circumstances where he is counting on the other owners being “very very stupid”. 
      
      
     48. Accordingly imputation (c) is also conveyed. 
      
      
     Defamatory meaning 
      
      
     49. The defendant made assertions that imputations (a) and (b) (if conveyed) are incapable of conveying a defamatory meaning by reason of being vulgar abuse. I reject this for the reasons set out above. 
      
      
     50. The defendant’s submission that the ordinary reasonable reader would brush these imputations off and pay no regard to them is completely unmeritorious. These are imputations of great seriousness and ordinary right thinking members of the community would think less of a person about whom each is conveyed. 
      
      
     51. Having determined these issues, I now turn to a question of the defences. 
      
      
     Defences 
      
      
     52. The defendant has pleaded defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30  
     Defamation Act 
      2005 and a defence of unlikelihood of harm pursuant to s 33. I shall first consider the defence of qualified privilege. 
      
      
     Qualified privilege 
      
      
     53. A defence of qualified privilege both at common law and pursuant to s 30  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 is pleaded. 
      
      
     54. A publication is taken to have been made on an occasion protected by qualified privilege at common law where the person who makes the communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is made has a corresponding duty or interest to receive it. 
      
      
     55. The plaintiff has conceded that the four publications which were sent by the defendant to the identified fellow members of the body corporate were publications made on an occasion of qualified privilege at common law. In relation to these publications, the sole issue to be determined is whether the defence of qualified privilege both at common law and pursuant to s 30 of the Act is defeated by malice. Consequently, my findings about whether the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege are only directed to the publication placed on the electricity cabinet. 
      
      
     56. Both the common law and statutory defences are pleaded, and the statutory defence is of particular relevance to the publication placed in the public arena because of the extent of publication. I will deal with the statutory defence first. 
      
      
     Section 30 – qualified privilege 
      
      
     57. Section 30(1) of the  
     Defamation Act 
      2005 provides as follows: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      30 Defence of qualified privilege for provision of certain information 
        
       
       
      (1) There is a defence of qualified privilege for the publication of defamatory matter to a person (the ""recipient"") if the defendant proves that:  
       
       
       (a) the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having information on some subject, and 
        
        
       (b) the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to the recipient information on that subject, and  
        
        
       (c) the conduct of the defendant in publishing that matter is reasonable in the circumstances.” 
       
      
      
     58. The matters which a court may take into account in determining whether the conduct of the defendant is reasonable in the circumstances are set out at s 30(2) of the Act. Section 30(2) provides: 
      
      
      
      “(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a recipient has an apparent interest in having information on some subject if, and only if, at the time of the publication in question, the defendant believes on reasonable grounds that the recipient has that interest.” 
      
      
     59. The defendant has provided the following particulars (under cover of a letter dated 27 February 2007) to establish qualified privilege both at common law and pursuant to the statutory defence. These particulars are as follows: 
      
      
      
      (a) the recipients were fellow owners of units in the Strata Plan and members of the Owners Corporation and had a common interest with the defendant in the fair and effective management of the affairs of the Corporation; 
       
       
      (b) that common interest extended to the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of which the owners of lots in the Strata Plan had received notice on 7 July 2006; 
       
       
      (c) each recipient had an actual interest or, alternatively, an apparent interest in receiving information on the above subject; 
       
       
      (d) the conduct of the defendant was reasonable in the circumstances for the foregoing reasons. 
      
      
     60. It will be readily apparent that none of these particulars deal specifically with the publication on the electricity cabinet. Those particulars are of course relevant to the four publications sent by the defendant to his fellow owners (which the plaintiff concedes was published on a protected occasion), but the notice pinned to the electricity cabinet was able to be read by any persons using the public toilet, including persons making delivery to the shops, tenants, customers and the like. The defendant has denied publication on the electricity cabinet ever took place, which is a significant barrier to the defence being made out but submits that the defence would still apply. In order to determine whether the criteria for a s 30 defence has been made out, I set out each of the provisions in s 30(3). 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(a) – The extent to which the matter published is of public interest 
      
      
     61. Matters that are the private affairs of an individual or relatively small group of people have generally not been considered matters of public interest. It is not sufficient if the opinion has a relationship to matters of public interest only in the most peripheral way. In  
     Green v Schneller 
      [2000] NSWSC 548 Simpson J at [24] set out the test as follows: 
      
      
      
      “By far the most significant decision for present purposes is that of the High Court in  
      Bellino 
      . There the majority held that the concept of a subject of public interest entails the notion that the person or institution whose activities are involved has engaged in activities that either inherently, expressly or inferentially invite public criticism or discussion. It is this test that is apposite to determine whether the matters to which the imputations published by Ms Schneller relate can properly be said to be matters of public interest. It is hardly necessary to note, having regard to the test posed, that it is insufficient for Ms Schneller to establish that members of the public viewing the program might find themselves interested in her assertions about the conduct of her neighbour. A salacious interest by members of the public in a particular subject matter, of which they had no previous knowledge and which was introduced to them by the very publication in question, does not translate the subject matter of the publication into a mater of public interest for the purpose of the various relevant sections of the Act. It is necessary therefore to consider how, on behalf of Ms Schneller, it is suggested that Mr Green's behaviour meets that test.” 
      
      
     62. In  
     Green v Schneller 
      the subject matter of the dispute was an argument about problems caused by a rupture in the sewer line between their properties. The remarks of Simpson J are very apposite to a case such as the present. At best, any public interest would be of a borderline nature. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(b) - performance of the public functions or activities of the person 
      
      
     63. The plaintiff was an ordinary member of the public. He was not performing any public function or activity.  
      
      
     Section 30(3)(c) – the seriousness of any defamatory imputation carried by the matter published 
      
      
     64. Each of the defamatory imputations carried is serious. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(d) – the extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicions, allegations and proven facts 
      
      
     65. I have set out in more detail below the degree to which the statements in the matter complained of are not in fact capable of being proven facts. A number of the statements are statements which must have been known by the defendant to have been false. In addition, the matter complained of contains allegations and suspicions, details of which are set out below. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(e) – whether expeditious publications was warranted 
      
      
     66. This is a particular designed to be relied upon by media publications. Counsel for the defendant submitted that there was great urgency because of the forthcoming meeting. I have found, however, for reasons set out more fully below, that there is very little connection between the CTTT hearings and the contents of the matter complained of. However, there was to have been a body corporate meeting of some importance, and that would in my view warrant expeditious publication of such information. The difficulty is, however, that the defendant did this as well as provides that information to the four recipients. How can it be said that it was necessary in addition to place a copy on the cover of the electricity cabinet? It was submitted that there was a concern that one or more of the recipients of the letter might not receive the letter in time. However, the defendant denied placing the publication there, and cannot have it both ways. It was certainly in their interest to be told, but it was not necessary for it to be drawn to the attention of the general public. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(f) – the nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates 
      
      
     67. Again, this is a particular designed to be relied upon by media defendants. There is nothing in the nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates to have any relevance here. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(g) – the sources of the information in the matter published and the integrity of those sources 
      
      
     68. If the source of the information was the CTTT, that would be a source with integrity. However, since most of the information contained in the matter complained of was false to the knowledge of the defendant, the fact that some of that information came from a source of integrity is largely irrelevant. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(h) – attempts to get the other side of the story 
      
      
     69. Again, this is a particular designed to be relied upon by media defendants. No attempts at all had been made by the defendant to obtain the plaintiff’s side of the story. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(i) – other steps taken to verify the information in the matter published 
      
      
     70. I repeat the matters I referred to in relation to s 30(3)(g) above. 
      
      
     Section 30(3)(j) – any other relevant circumstances 
      
      
     71. No other relevant circumstances were identified by the defendant in submissions. However, it is important to look at the factual background to this case in the context of the very long history of informal dealings of this body corporate. This was not a case where a sudden and potentially unwelcome change to the structure, perhaps impacting on tenants and customers, was likely to be made. This was a meeting about regularising a state of affairs that has existed for many years. The publications of such a notice may well have alarmed persons reading it who knew nothing about the circumstances of this long history.  
      
      
     72. This is a clear case of a publication which is in excess of that which is required both in language and extent of publication, which is not reasonable, and therefore cannot be protected by s 30. 
      
      
     The defence of qualified privilege at common law 
      
      
     73. In  
     Holmes v Fraser  
     [2008] NSWSC 570 Simpson J considered the elements of the defence of qualified privilege at common law under the new statutory regime, and I gratefully borrow her Honour’s explanation of the elements at [84] – [91]. 
      
      
     74. The plaintiff concedes that the publications to the owners were published on an occasion protected by qualified privilege at common law as well as pursuant to s 30, submitting that the defence is defeated at common law, as is the statutory defence, by malice. My findings about whether the defence of qualified privilege at common law is made out is accordingly restricted to the publication which I have found the defendant put on the electricity cabinet. The plaintiff submits that the defence cannot extend to this publication as the requisite duty and interest cannot be made out. 
      
      
     75. As a matter of logic it is hard to see how the defendant can assert duty and interest for a publication he denies making at all. The defendant’s denials (T 135, 184) appear to concede there was no duty or interest. He said (at T 184) “there is no reason to put the letter on the meter there… I want not the neighbourhood, I want the owners be there…I just wanted the members of the strata, on the strata role, to be there, not anybody else… [It was] nothing to do with the tenants. What I wanted, the owner [sic] to attend the meetings. No one else.”  
      
      
     76. The particulars of duty and interest given by the defendant relate only to the publications to the other owners. In circumstances where there is a flat denial of publication, the question must arise, both under the statutory and common law defence, as to whether these defences can be available at all.  
      
      
     77. The defendant appears to have conceded he had no interest in telling persons other than the other owners of his concerns; he certainly had no duty to communicate these matters to passers-by on their way to the toilets who would have been able to read this document nearby. 
      
      
     78. The defence of qualified privilege at common law, like the statutory defence, is accordingly not available for the publication placed on the electricity cabinet. 
      
      
     79. I now turn to a consideration of the issue of malice. In the event that I have erred in holding that the publication which was placed on the electricity cabinet was not published on an occasion of qualified privilege, I have addressed my findings as to malice in relation to this publication as well as to the other publications. 
      
      
     Malice 
      
      
     80. The defence of qualified privilege, both at common law and under the Act (s 30(4)) is defeated if the plaintiff proves that the publication is actuated by malice. 
      
      
     81. The plaintiff relies on the following to establish malice: 
      
      
      
      (a) the defendant was motivated to cause harm to the plaintiff because of the termination of the agreement for cleaning the common property. The defendant agreed in cross-examination that he blamed the plaintiff, Mr Tranh and Mr Montano for this (T 164) although he denied it had upset him. He agreed he was offended and angry about the lateness of the letter and its contents, which he considered disrespectful to him (T 164, 206 – 7); 
       
       
      (b) the defendant resented his loss of status as the owner who was “king of the show” and his conduct towards the plaintiff from mid-2006 was motivated by a desire for revenge rather than a legitimate assertion of his own rights and interests; 
       
       
      (c) the defendant’s failure to consider the matter complained of was capable of conveying any or all of the imputations (interrogatory 1), which is evidence of recklessness; 
       
       
      (d) failure to inquire (interrogatory 5) and the selective view he took of the information he did possess (T 176). For example, he did not take into account that similar use of the common property by other owners, including himself; 
       
       
      (e) the absence of any belief in the truth of the imputations (interrogatory 7); 
       
       
      (f) the use of violent, sensational and extreme language in the matter complained of. The plaintiff admitted that words such as “gangster” were used to “entice” owners to attend the forthcoming meeting; 
       
       
      (g) the publication of other material defamatory of the plaintiff which affirms and repeats the imputations (interrogatories 20 – 22). 
      
      
     82. Malice may be shown if it is proven the defendant used the occasion upon which the immunity is founded for some wrong or improper purpose or motive, other than the interest which gave rise to the privileged occasion, or that he or she spoke dishonestly or in knowing or reckless disregard for the truth. It may be proved that inferences can be drawn from the language of the matter complained of or by extrinsic evidence on matters such as the relationship between the parties, the mode and extent of publication and the conduct of the defendant in publishing it: Brown  
     The Law of Defamation in Canada 
     , 2nd ed., vol 2, [16.1]. Malice is essentially a state of mind and it is the defendant’s primary or predominant motive in publishing that is determinative:  
     Horrocks v Lowe  
     [1975] AC 135 at 149. Proof of malice involves, in almost every case, the drawing of inferences from proved facts ( 
     McKenzie v Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd 
      (1990) 20 NSWLR 42 at 51 per Clarke JA). Its proof is not confined to the four corners of the publication (Brown, at [16.4(1]). 
      
      
     83. The defendant asserts that no malice has been proved “as at 14 July” and that this is the “only issue” (defendant’s submissions, page 2). The purpose of the publication, according to the defendant, was twofold. Firstly, he wished to encourage the other owners to attend the meeting, and secondly, he wanted to draw to their attention the application he had lodged with the CTTT, for which there was, he said, a meeting at the CTTT on 25 July. His concern was that if these motions were passed, then the matters he had raised with the CTTT would be bypassed.  
      
      
     84. The defendant put in a series of nine complaints, many of which overlap. The first of these was filed on June 21 and sought the removal of Mr Montano for inefficiency, citing his failure to hold an AGM, prepare financial records or answer inquiries from the defendant. All these claims were pointless, because there had in fact been an AGM the month before, where all these things had been done, and Mr Montano not only did respond to the defendant’s request for documentation but also reimbursed the defendant personally from his own pocket after there was a delay in sending the letter terminating the defendant’s cleaning contract. 
      
      
     85. The CTTT did remove Mr Montano, but not for any of the reasons put forward by the defendant. It is necessary to look carefully at the decision of the Strata Schemes adjudicator, Mr D Forbes, which was handed down on 22 September 2006, because this reveals what the meeting at the CTTT was about. I set out the text of this document in full. 
      
      
      
      “SUBMISSIONS 
       
       
      Submission on behalf of the Applicant: 
       
       
      The Applicant is the owner of lot 4 in SP 13595. 
       
       
      The Applicant submits that the management structure of SP 13595 is not functioning satisfactorily. In particular: 
       
        
         
        
       There was no Annual General Meeting of the Owners Corporation between October 2004 and May 2006. 
       The management agreement between Strata Plan 13595 and Vince Montano Strata Management Services is dated 1 August 2005 for an unspecified period. 
       There was no general meeting of Owners Corporation 13595 to approve the appointment of Vince Montano Strata Management Services. 
       The owners of Lots 6 to 9, Apostolos Moumoutzakis, and the owner of Lot 10, Milton Moumoutzakis, dominate the management decisions of the strata scheme. 
       Illegal structures have been erected on common property. 
       On 18 August 2006, the Executive Committee purported to amend the Minutes of the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 21 July 2006. 
       
       
      The Applicant provided a written consent to appointment as Strata Managing Agent from J A Somerville Pty Ltd together with a proposed Strata Management Agency Agreement. 
       
       
      Submissions on behalf of the Respondent: 
       
       
      The Respondent is Apostolos Moumoutzakis. 
       
       
      On 21 August 2006, the Respondent made a written submission in response to the application. 
       
       
      The Respondent alleges that the application is part of a personal and nasty campaign against him, initiated by the Applicant, Vincent Carpino. The Respondent believes that Mr Carpino is causing trouble because his cleaning services contract for the parcel has been terminated by the Owners Corporation. 
       
       
      The Respondent states that he blocked an existing door to Shop 6, to prevent water overflowing from the drain in the corridor into the shop. He relocated an existing door 300mm further South on the external wall to facilitate a fire & emergency exit. 
       
       
      An external toilet was erected some 7-8 years ago at the rear of Lot 10, because the existing toilet was filthy and unsuable. 
       
       
      It is obvious that over the years the owners have made and implemented decisions that have not been recorded. 
       
       
      The owners should be allowed to make their own decisions and resolutions based on their needs and legal requirements. 
       
       
      The Respondent would like to seek an order approving all existing alterations at their present location and the registration of an Exclusive-Use By-law, to eliminate future arguments. 
       
       
      On 13 August 2006, the Respondent’s lot was vandalised. His external toilet was smashed and doors and walls were painted. 
       
       
      The Respondent requested a common sense resolution of the dispute. 
       
       
      The Respondent submitted a number of e-mails and letters from the Applicant with his submission. I find the content of these e-mails and letters quite disturbing. 
       
       
      Submissions on behalf of Other Interested Persons: 
       
       
      On 22 August 2006, the owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3 in SP 13595 made a written submission in response to the application. 
       
       
      The owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3 support the application and object to the Owners Corporation allowing privately held buildings to be built on common property, namely the small toilet and the brick building enclosure. 
       
       
      FINDINGS 
       
       
      1. The Applicant is the owner of Lot 4 in SP 13595. 
       
      2. The Respondent is the owner of Lots 6, 7, 8 & 9 in SP 13595. 
       
      3. The  
      Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (“the Act”)  
      applies. 
       
      4. The application for an order by an Adjudicator was made by an interested person, namely the owner of a lot in the strata scheme. 
       
      5. The application is incorrectly brought against the Respondent. 
       
      6. The application should have been brought against the Owners – Strata Plan No. 13595. 
       
      7. On 25 July 2006 the Registrar joined Owners Corporation SP 13595 as another interested party to the application. 
       
       
      THE DECISION 
       
       
      The Applicant bears the onus of proving the grounds required to make the order sought on the balance of probabilities. 
       
       
      It is submitted that I should make an order under Section 162 of the Act, to appoint a person as Strata Managing Agent of SP 13595, to exercise all the functions of the Owners Corporation. 
       
       
      An Adjudicator may make an order under Section 162 if the Adjudicator is satisfied that the management structure of the strata scheme is not functioning, or is not functioning satisfactorily. 
       
       
      I have considered all the evidence filed and submissions made in response to the application. 
       
       
      There are 11 lots in Strata Plan 13595, which is a commercial scheme comprised of shops and restaurants. 
       
       
      The Applicant is the owner of Lot 4. Mr & Mrs H Moumoutzakis are the owners of Lots 6, 7, 8 and 9. Milton Moumoutzakis is the owner of Lot 10. 
       
       
      Mr Moumoutzakis controls 423 out of 1000 unit entitlements. 
       
       
      The present strata managing agent, Vincent Montano Strata Management Services, was appointed pursuant to a Management Agency Agreement dated 1 August 2005. It appears that there was no meeting of the Owners Corporation to approve Mr Montano’s appointment. 
       
       
      The minutes of meetings of the Owners Corporation have not been accurately recorded. 
       
       
      Over the past twenty years, a number of structures have been erected on common property, without formal approval of the Owners Corporation. Some of these structures are being exclusively used by owners or occupiers of particular lots, in contravention of the Act. 
       
       
      The relationship between the Applicant and the Respondent has completely broken down. The Applicant has made veiled threats against the Respondent that cause me a great deal of concern. Both the Applicant and the Respondent are on the Executive Committee of the Owners Corporation SP 13595. It is obvious to me that they cannot work together in the best interests of all lot owners. 
       
       
      The Respondent’s shop has been vandalised. 
       
       
      It is in the interests of both parties, and the other lot owners, that an independent Strata Managing Agent be lawfully appointed to manage the strata scheme effectively, and to solve the problem of the structures erected on common property. 
       
       
      Taking into account all the evidence provided, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the management structure of Owners Corporation SP 13595 is not functioning satisfactorily. 
       
       
      It is appropriate in all the circumstances to appoint a compulsory Strata Managing Agent to exercise all the functions of Owners Corporation SP 13595. 
       
       
      It is appropriate in all the circumstances to give the compulsory Strata Managing Agent all the functions of Owners Corporation SP 13595, including all the functions of Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Committee. 
       
       
      Once appointed, the compulsory Strata Managing Agent will have sole responsibility to ensure that the management structure of Owners Corporation SP 13595 begins to function satisfactorily. 
       
       
      The Applicant has provided a written consent to appoint J A Somerville Pty Ltd, the holder of Strata Managing Agent’s licence issued under the  
      Property, Stock and Business Agents Act 2002 
      . The requirements of Section 162(4)(b) have been met. 
       
       
      D Forbes 
       
      Strata Schemes Adjudicator 
       
      Consumer, Trader & Tenancy Tribunal 
       
      22 September 2006” 
      
      
     86. The removal of Mr Montano and his replacement by the previous strata management company had little or nothing to do with the matters to be raised at the EGM in July. These problems had to be regularised, whoever the strata manager was.  
      
      
     87. The defendant did make a second application to the CTTT against the plaintiff, seeking orders for the unit 10 toilet and the walls of the store room demolished (exhibit 11). However, this was filed on 17 July 2006, after the motion was sent around, and was in response to its contents.  
      
      
     88. The other reason given, namely the defendant’s wish that persons attend the meeting to vote against the motion, is germane to the occasion of qualified privilege both under common law and pursuant to s 30. 
      
      
     89. The motions on the agenda should have been framed as a special resolution to amend the by-laws (ss 47 and 52  
     Strata Schemes Management Act 
     ) and, after a unanimous vote, should be sent to the Registrar-General’s office in proper form (s 48). A by-law can, but does not have to, contain conditions. Section 53 provides that a by-law “may confer rights or special privileges subject to such conditions as may be specified in the by-law (for example, a condition requiring the payment of money by the owner or owners of the lots concerned, at specified times or as determined by the owner’s corporation”).  
      
      
     90. Most importantly, where a new structure is erected on the common property, this must be done by a special resolution: s 65A. 
      
      
     91. The purpose of the  
     Strata Schemes Management Act  
     is to create an alternative mode with distinctive requirements to requirements under legislation such as the  
     Conveyancing Act 
      1919 ( 
     White v Betalli 
      [2007] NSWCA 243 at [30] – [32]). The purpose of the Act was to introduce “more flexibility” into strata title schemes concerning “day-to-day issues” (Minister for Housing, NSW Legislative Assembly,  
     Hansard  
     (no. 254), 13 November 1996 p. 5921).  
      
      
     92. This information, if contained in the defendant’s letter, together with information about the entitlement of the body corporate to seek publication, would have been entirely proper. 
      
      
     93. However, there is nothing in the matter complained of capable of conveying this kind of information. It is a series of statements which must have been known by the defendant to be false. In particular: 
      
      
      
      (a)  
      “I am not fully qualified lawyer but I have done a Law course” 
      . This was false. The defendant conceded in cross-examination that he had not completed a Law course of the kind required to become a fully qualified lawyer. He had not studied any relevant course subject containing information concerning strata title law, although he had completed a continuing education course on family law at the University of Sydney. 
       
       
      (b) “ 
      Why we want another meeting when we already had one on 29th May 2006???? 
      ” This was false, because the defendant well knew that the position had to be regularised, and also because the meeting on 29 May had been the annual general meeting and this issue had not been under consideration. 
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff had taken possession “ 
      illegally 
      ” and “ 
      against the law 
      ”; the plaintiff and the strata manager were “ 
      law’s breakers 
      ” and the owners were asked to “ 
      punish the LAW’ BREAKERS 
      ”. This was false to the knowledge of the defendant. He knew there had been approvals given many years ago, that the problem was that this was not properly done, and that the situation needed to be regularised. 
       
       
      (d) “ 
      Marrickville Council is investigating this, but they are a bit slow. A Solicitor has been appointed, because we want the LAW to win 
      ”. There was no evidence of any investigation by the council or appointment of a solicitor.  
       
       
      (e) “ 
      I have put two Applications with the FAIR TRADING …and will be a meeting in the CITY on 25th July (if you wish to come along) and that is why they have called this URGENT MEETING 
      ”. However, the notice was sent around on 7 July and reached the defendant some time before 17 July, which is the date of the second of his applications. It was the defendant’s complaint to the CTTT that was in response to the notice of meeting, not the other way around. There was only one application to the CTTT, calling for Mr Montano to be removed. This was not an impediment to these resolutions. 
       
       
      (f) The whole premise of the publication was false. If a unanimous resolution was required, then only the defendant needed to vote against the motion. However, it is not clear to me that the defendant actually understood this, so I have not treated this as being knowingly false. It was, however, a reckless statement to make, when the terms of the  
      Strata Schemes Management Act 
       are quite clear, and he had received this advice from the CTTT which he was able to impart more rationally in his letter of 9 December 2007 (Exhibit R). 
       
       
      (g) The plaintiff was not a gangster. The defendant knew this, but used the word “ 
      gangster 
      ” to entice people to read the publication and vote against the plaintiff. 
      
      
     94. The matter complained of contained a series of statements known by the defendant to be false. It was, in addition, couched in language of the most extreme kind. The plaintiff is called a “gangster” (three times), a ‘LAW’S BREAKERS” (twice) and it is because of “fears that the LAW will take over” that the plaintiff is acting “illegally” (twice) and “against the law”. “[G]od knows what will happen next”. Finally, the defendant calls on the other owners to “punish” the “LAW’S BREAKERS”.  
      
      
     95. The few truthful statements are that this is a meeting of great importance and that all the owners need to vote.  
      
      
     96. In  
     Calwell v Ipec Australia Pty Ltd  
     (1975) 135 CLR 321 at 322 – 3, Mason J cautioned against a close textual analysis of the words and that whether the language was extravagant would depend on the facts of the case (cited with approval in  
     Pinniger v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd  
     (1979) 26 ALR 55 at 61 – 2;  
     Shelmerdine v Mewett  
     [1993] SASC 3932 at [15]). Greater violence of language may be expected where someone makes an unexpected discovery, or is party to a hot dispute, and such words should not be weighed in “nice scales” ( 
     Penton v Calwell  
     (1945) 70 CLR 219 at 243). Severe language and wrongheaded criticism is not necessarily evidence of malice:  
     Peterson v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd  
     (1995) 64 SASR 152. 
      
      
     97. However, in the present case, the insults are so extreme that they actually get in the way of any coherent understanding of the publication, very much in the same way as the publication in  
     Skalkos v Assaf 
      (2002) Aust Torts Reports 81-644. 
      
      
     Publication of other defamatory material 
      
      
     98. Both before and after publication of the matter complained of, the defendant wrote approximately one hundred letters and emails to the strata manager and to the plaintiff in which he made serious allegations about the plaintiff. 
      
      
     99. Counsel for the plaintiff only tendered part of this correspondence. What was tendered was sufficient to show the sarcastic and insulting tenor of this avalanche of correspondence. On some occasions, the defendant sent up to four emails a day, as well as letters.  
      
      
     100. I have set out extracts I consider relevant. Some of them (as particularised in the Statement of Claim) refer to or repeat the allegations in the matter complained of; this is relevant to the issue of aggravated damages. Others are relevant to the issue of malice because they refer to the letter terminating the defendant’s cleaning contract (which the plaintiff submits is the true motive for publication of the matter complained of), or because the defendant boasts about his ability to harass the plaintiff and Mr Montano, this being evidence of hostility and ill will. I have set all of these extracts out together because it is important to read this correspondence in chronological order in order to arrive at accurate findings of fact on all these issues:

      (ee) “There is not one word when ALREADY the land of the owner’s Corporation has been taken or better said ROBBED. What is your view? What is your reply? Not one word in the LAW about proposal by Moumoutzakis when the land has been taken already.” [letter to Mr Sarroff, 13 April 2007]; 
      
      
     Conclusions concerning malice 
      
      
     101. I make the following findings in relation to malice concerning the defence of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30: 
      
      
      
      (a) I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant’s sudden concern about these long-standing encroachments on the common property was largely as a result of his anger at the circumstances of the termination of the cleaning contract. The references to this letter in his subsequent correspondence make this quite clear. He admitted in cross-examination he considered the letter terminating his services disrespectful (T 164, 206-7). Whether or not this letter was disrespectful, it was not an excuse for an unwarranted attack on the plaintiff for taking steps to regularise the situation concerning structures on the common property; 
       
       
      (b) I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant resented the plaintiff because he thought the plaintiff had become, to use his own words, “king of the show” and that his motivation in opposing the regularisation of the situation was not a legitimate concern as to the plaintiff’s activities but a desire for revenge. The defendant’s abusive and insulting conduct towards not only the plaintiff but all three managing agents is of significance. After Mr Montano was replaced by Mr Sarroff, the defendant began to attack Mr Sarroff, eventually writing “I thought Montano was bad enough, here history repeats itself” and Mr Sarroff was removed. The current managing agent, Mr Conides, was called by the plaintiff, and gave evidence of continuing complaints by the defendant; 
       
       
      (c) the defendant’s failure to consider the matter complained of was capable of conveying serious imputations was reckless; 
       
       
      (d) the defendant admitted in cross-examination that what inquiries he made were selectively used (T 176) and he never made inquiries of the plaintiff; 
       
       
      (e) the defendant did not have any belief in the truth of the imputations and abandoned a plea of truth to (c); 
       
       
      (f) the defendant conceded that some of the language (e.g. “gangster”) was excessive. 
      
      
     102. Individually each of these is capable of amounting to evidence of malice. When viewed collectively, these matters paint a very clear picture of a defendant motivated by malice to publish serious allegations which he knew to be false, out of anger and a desire for revenge. Accordingly the defences of qualified privilege both must fail. 
      
      
     Section 33 triviality  
      
      
     103. Section 33 of the  
     Defamation Act 
      provides: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      33 Defence of triviality 
       
       
      It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the circumstances of publication were such that the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm.” 
      
      
     104. The particulars provided under cover of a letter dated 27 February 2007 were to the effect that the matter complained of was delivered to not more than eight persons excluding the plaintiff, that each of those persons had a special interest in the matter and was in a position to verify the facts therein. 
      
      
     105. The defence of triviality under the new Act is explained by Simpson J in  
     Holmes v Fraser  
     at [77].  
      
      
     106. The extent of circulation of the matter complained of in  
     Holmes v Fraser  
     was 629, a far greater number than the handful of people who read these publications. However, the potential for damage was high. Each of the members of the body corporate could vote against the plaintiff ( 
     Holmes  
     at [80]) and apart from Mr Tranh did in fact do so. The use of the very strong word “gangster” had potential for harm and the defendant admitted as much in the witness box. 
      
      
     107. Limited extent of publication, by itself, is insufficient for the defence to succeed. The defence of triviality has failed even where the publication is only to one person:  
     Jones v Sutton 
      (2004) 61 NSWLR 614. 
      
      
     108. The defence of triviality may be made out where there is publication to a small number of persons well acquainted with the plaintiff and able, themselves, to make a judgment of their own knowledge as to the likelihood of any substance in the imputation conveyed:  
     Doelle v Bedey 
      [2007] QCA 395 at [10]. The circumstances in which the publication was placed on the electricity cabinet for any passers-by going to use the toilet could not hope to satisfy such a test. Nor could it be said that the plaintiff was “unlikely to suffer any harm” following publication of a letter containing legal advice from a person purporting to have legal training which accused the plaintiff of conduct of a very serious nature. 
      
      
     109. Section 13  
     Defamation Act 
      1974 (NSW) required only that the plaintiff was “not likely to suffer harm”. Section 33  
     Defamation Act 
      2005 requires that the plaintiff be “unlikely to suffer any harm”. Whether this is a mere restatement of the same provision, or places the bar higher, may be a matter for debate, but on any test the likelihood of harm flowing from such a publication, given the extreme gravity of the imputations and the circumstances in which it was made, is very high. Accordingly the defence under s 33 fails. 
      
      
     110. All defences having failed, I now consider the issue of damages. 
      
      
     Damages 
      
      
     111. The matter complained of was addressed to four persons, who were fellow shop owners in the strata plan. However, the additional copy of the matter complained of which was pasted on the electricity cabinet for several days was read by other persons, such as Mr Hai, the tenant of shop 6, and also, I find, by one or more of the persons who called out “a gangster” at the plaintiff over a period of time commencing shortly after the notice was placed on the front of the electricity cabinet.  
      
      
     112. A plea of “grapevine effect” is made in reliance upon this evidence. The relatively small number of readers is comparable to the extent of publication in  
     Trantum v McDowell  
     [2007] NSWCA 138. The facts in that matter was very similar, in that a defamatory publication was circulated to approximately one dozen owners in a strata title complex. However, that case was decided in accordance with the principles relevant to the  
     Defamation Act 
      1974 (NSW). It is necessary for me to examine the provisions of the  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 (NSW). 
      
      
     Provisions of the  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 (NSW) relating to the award of damages 
      
      
     113. These provisions are as follows: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      34 Damages to bear rational relationship to harm 
        
       
      In determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any defamation proceedings, the court is to ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the harm sustained by the plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded.  
       
       
      35 Damages for non-economic loss limited  
       
      (1) Unless the court orders otherwise under subsection (2), the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss that may be awarded in defamation proceedings is $250,000 or any other amount adjusted in accordance with this section from time to time (the ""maximum damages amount"") that is applicable at the time damages are awarded.  
       
       
      (2) A court may order a defendant in defamation proceedings to pay damages for non-economic loss that exceed the maximum damages amount applicable at the time the order is made if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the circumstances of the publication of the defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages.  
       
       
      (3) The Minister is, on or before 1 July 2006 and on or before 1 July in each succeeding year, to declare, by order published in the Gazette, the amount that is to apply, as from the date specified in the order, for the purposes of subsection (1).  
       
       
      For orders under this subsection, see Gazettes No 84 of 30.6.2006, p 5043 (amount declared: $259,500); No 80 of 15.6.2007, p 3793 (amount declared: $267,500) and No 72 of 20.6.2008, p 5482 (amount declared $280,500).  
       
       
      (4) The amount declared is to be the amount applicable under subsection (1) (or that amount as last adjusted under this section) adjusted by the percentage change in the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician of the average weekly total earnings of full-time adults in Australia over the 4 quarters preceding the date of the declaration for which those estimates are, at that date, available.  
       
       
      (5) An amount declared for the time being under this section applies to the exclusion of the amount of $250,000 or an amount previously adjusted under this section.  
       
       
      (6) If the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in subsection (4), the amount declared is to be determined in accordance with the regulations.  
       
       
      (7) In adjusting an amount to be declared for the purposes of subsection (1), the amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) is to be rounded to the nearest $500.  
       
       
      (8) A declaration made or published in the Gazette after 1 July in a year and specifying a date that is before the date it is made or published as the date from which the amount declared by the order is to apply has effect as from that specified date.  
       
       
      36 State of mind of defendant generally not relevant to awarding damages  
       
      In awarding damages for defamation, the court is to disregard the malice or other state of mind of the defendant at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate or at any other time except to the extent that the malice or other state of mind affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff.  
       
       
      37 Exemplary or punitive damages cannot be awarded  
       
      A plaintiff cannot be awarded exemplary or punitive damages for defamation.” 
       
       
      
     114. The statutory cap under s 35(1) has been adjusted to $280,500.  
      
      
     115. The manner in which these sections should be applied to defamation proceedings had only been considered in a handful of cases. In  
     Attrill v Christie 
      [2007] NSWSC 1386 Bell J awarded damages of $110,000. In  
     Martin v Bruce 
      [2007] NSWDC 264 I awarded damages of $25,000 for a limited publication to members of a club, where the extent of publication was four persons. Neither of these proceedings was defended as to liability. 
      
      
     116. There have been two recent awards of damages under the new Act in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceedings which were contested as to liability. In  
     Holmes v Fraser  
     damages were awarded for publication of a letter to 629 recipients. However, Simpson J noted at [110] that there was “little material on which to base an award of damages”, and that “doing the best I can” her Honour assessed the damages at $70,000. 
      
      
     117. In  
     Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd 
      [2008] NSWSC 693 McClellan CJ at CL explained the working of s 35, rejecting a submission that there should be two “caps” on damages, one in respect of the Daily Telegraph publication and the other in respect of the Sunday Mail publication, for a total aggregate cap of $561,000 prior to any consideration of aggravation.  
      
      
     118. The nature of defamation means that each letter posted by the defendant, as well as the copy placed on the electricity cabinet, is capable of constituting a separate publication. 
      
      
     119. The plaintiff submits, and I accept, that I should assess the damages in the same fashion as that explained by McClellan CJ at CL at [8] of  
     Davis 
     . 
      
      
     120. Section 35(2) provides that damages for non-economic loss may exceed the maximum damages amount applicable if and only if an award of aggravated compensatory damages is warranted. 
      
      
     121. The operation of s 35(2) has been the subject of debate. In a seminar paper provided to the New South Wales Bar Association on 24 June 2008, Mr T K Tobin QC, who was the Queens Counsel for the plaintiff in  
     Davis 
     , made the following points concerning s 35(2): 
      
      
      
      “23. The section produces a very strange result unless interpreted to apply to separate defamatory publications and not to proceedings generally. That is, in the  
      Davis 
       case there would be two caps, one in respect of the Daily Telegraph and another in respect of the Sunday Mail for a total aggregate cap of $535,000 prior to any consideration of aggravation. 
       
       
      24. While section 35(1) refers to ‘proceedings’, section 35(2) refers to ‘defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate’, in the singular. 
       
       
      25. By section 4 ‘matter’ is defined to include ‘(a) an article, report, advertisement or other thing communicated by means of a newspaper, magazine or other periodical’. It is significant that it is defined in the singular not plural. This is consistent with the effect of section 8. 
       
       
      26. By section 8, there is a single cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the person even if more than one defamatory imputation about the person is carried by the matter. Thus, the cause of action relates to the particular defamatory matter not to all defamatory matter that may be included in the proceedings or to which the proceedings relate. Thus, in this case there is a separate cause of action in respect of two separate matters. To say that there is a global cap relating to all causes of action, even if they are separate and distinct publications, seems inconsistent with the effect of sections 4 and 8. Moreover, if that is the case then the cap could be circumvented by the procedural device of starting separate proceedings for each publication. 
       
       
      27. Alternatively, by operation of the discretion in section 35(2), damages in excess of the cap may be awarded if the circumstances of the publication warrant such an award of aggravated damages. If the two defamatory publications are regarded as being governed by the one cap on damages, in that relief is sought in the same proceedings, then by operation of section 35(2), the Court may exercise the discretion in favour of increasing damages because of effectively the doubling of the extent of publication, which is a matter in aggravation of damages. This approach ensures that section 35 is not interpreted so as to permit a defendant to avoid pay damages for more than one defamatory publication. 
       
       
      28. Finally, the interpretation of section 35(2) needs to be considered. The literal wording of the subsection means that once the pre-condition is satisfied (i.e. that the circumstances of the publication were such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages) the judge may award damages above the cap. Moreover, there is no limitation on the type of aggravated damages available, such as aggravating factors which arise post-publication.” 
      
      
     122. Mr Tobin QC noted there was as if no authority on the point and that in the absence of any express provision to aggregate or limit existing common law right as to aggregated damages of the kind provided for relating to punitive damages (in s 39) this interpretation should be accepted. 
      
      
     123. McClellan CJ at CL has, however, rejected this approach at [18]-[20] in  
     Davis 
     .  
      
      
     124. Having made these preliminary comments, I now turn to a consideration of the evidence on damages. 
      
      
     125. The plaintiff has lived in Marrickville since 1973 or 1974. He regularly attends the Greek Orthodox Church there and his customers include customers from other shops in Marrickville. He has worked in the take-away food business for all of his professional life. 
      
      
     126. Prior to publication of the matter complained of, nobody had ever called him a gangster or a criminal (T 38). However, after the matter complained of was left on the electricity cabinet, the plaintiff said that: 
      
      
      
      “There are drivers that drive outside my place, my shop, and they keep on shouting at me, ‘Gangster. You are a gangster’ et cetera, and I have reported the case to the police, but they have not been caught as yet.” 
      
      
     127. He was asked how many times this had happened and he said: 
      
      
      
      “Many times. Even last night, they passed through three times.” (T 38) 
      
      
     128. He had seen the vehicles but he was unable to write down the registration number as the word “gangster” was shouted when the car was moving. The plaintiff went on to say: 
      
      
      
      “…even people from the units, nearby units, they have complained to the police because of this.” 
      
      
     129. This evidence was not the subject of challenge. 
      
      
     130. The plaintiff said that he suffered upset when he saw the notice on the noticeboard. He later torn it down and threw it in the rubbish bin (T 34). He said (T 35): 
      
      
      
      “I see the letter again. I'm shy and I think about it. I was scared to take it off or leave it there. And because maybe I think no good to take it off, not take, to leave there. But not - and then we - me take it off and threw it the rubbish. The time we seen them.” 
      
      
     131. In addition, since these events, the other tenants have stopped talking to him. This made him feel “very awful” (T 37). He said that at the meeting which occurred after the publication: 
      
      
      
      “Everybody was looking at me as a kind of criminal. We did not reach any agreement in this meeting. That's the reason I found a lawyer, Alex, to continue my case, to take care of my case.” 
      
      
     132. This was identified as the lawyer who looked after the “strata corporation issues” (T 37). 
      
      
     133. The plaintiff was somewhat inarticulate, and did not give very extensive evidence about hurt to feelings. Nevertheless, it is clear that his hurt to feelings was considerable. 
      
      
     134. A number of the factual statements made by the defendant were wrong. These included not only the wrong statement that the meeting had been called illegally, but also the false statements made by the defendant about his having studied law to the extent that, while not being a qualified lawyer, he was not far short of this standing. This was a serious misrepresentation. In fact the plaintiff had completed some kind of continuing education course on family law at The University of Sydney. While the defendant was entitled to point out that there needed to be a unanimous resolution and a by-law if parts of the common property were to be appropriated in the manner proposed, and some form of compensation could be sought, this did not entitle him to misstate the situation in the way he did, particularly since the defendant well knew that prior to these changes had all been made a considerable number of years beforehand and that what was being sought to be done was to regularise the situation. 
      
      
     135. In determining issues relating to award of damages I must have regard to: 
      
      
      
      (a) The quantum of damages, which must be proportionate sustained by the plaintiff (s 34); 
       
      (b) The maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss, namely $280,500 (s 35(1)); and 
       
      (c) I must disregard the state of mind of the defendant, including any malice of the defendant, except to the extent that it affected the harm suffered by the plaintiff (s 36). 
       
       
      
     136. I am satisfied that the plaintiff should be awarded general damages. I now turn to a consideration of the award of aggravated compensatory damages. 
      
      
     Aggravated compensatory damages 
      
      
     137. The plaintiff submits that I should have regard to the following aggravating factors: 
      
      
      
      (a) The publication was actuated by malice and a desire to harm the plaintiff, and malice may remain an aggravating factor in the assessment of general damages and in particular hurt to feelings, notwithstanding s 36 of the Act. 
       
       
      (b) The defendant repeated the defamatory allegations in subsequent material published to others, including the strata manager. 
       
       
      (c) The falsity of the imputations to the knowledge of the plaintiff increased his hurt. 
       
       
      (d) The conduct of the defence, including the reliance on a defence of justification to the third imputation pleaded, which was dropped at the end of evidence. 
       
       
      (e) The defendant’s wrong refusal to apologise to the plaintiff or otherwise retract the matter complained of. 
      
      
     138. There is substantial evidence of malice, and a feature of the matter complained of and for that matter subsequent publications was an intent to “mock and ridicule” (to borrow the expression used in  
     Davis 
      at [37]) the plaintiff. As it was the case in  
     Davis 
     , although the matter complained of purported to be about a body corporate meeting, the letter was framed in such a personal manner as to amount to malice. 
      
      
     139. In  
     Davis 
      McClellan CJ at CL rejected a submission that the defendant was running a campaign against the plaintiff. However, the evidence here which I have set out in detail above, indicates to the contrary. 
      
      
     140. The defendant’s affirmation of the defamatory imputation in subsequent material published by the defendant can be seen from correspondence he sent to Mr Montano. 
      
      
     141. The conduct of the defence, including the late abandonment of the defence of justification, is conduct which may aggravate the plaintiff’s damages:  
     Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Tingle 
      [2001] NSWCA 194. Such conduct was held to justify an award of aggravated compensatory damages in  
     Davis 
      at [32]-[33]. Finally, the defendant’s refusal to apologise, when an apology was sought at an early stage of the proceedings, may be relevant not only to ordinary compensatory damages but also aggravated compensatory damages, for the reasons explained by McClellan CJ at CL at [36]. The defendant asserted that he did in fact apologised. The text of his apology is as follows: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      DEAR SIR, 
       
       
      RE – APOSTOLOS MOUMOUTZAKIS – YOUR REF. AA: AN: MISC. 
       
      LETTER 26-07-2006 
       
       
      The continues SAGA OF APOSTOLOS. 
       
       
      Please, give me the opportunity to describe the incivility and the bad manners of the odd times I have met APOSTOLOS MOUMOUTZAKIS by the following events: 
       
       
      1) Three years ago he pushed me in a physical way out of his shop because I asked him to move his car from my car park. 
       
      2) He has used my two car parks on and off for the last 10 years. Too much kindness. NO THANK YOU, YET!! 
       
      3) Two years ago I asked to move his car from my car park once again his reply was: 
       
       “I can park wherever I like”. 
       
      4) Last year a big mixing machinery was left in my car park no 4 for at least 3 months. NO THANK YOU – NOR APOLOGIES YET!! STILL WAITING. 
       
      4) Forget years ago. 
       
      5) Up to this moment he has 2 (two) 44 gallons drums sitting still in my car park – photos have been taken – after numerous requests not only from me but also from the STRATA MANAGER his cohort, and even was mentioned at the AGM May 2006. 
       
      6) During the months of March, April, and part of May I could not park my car in my car park because of his building materials and debris while his ILLEGAL construction in a COMMON PROPERTY WAS GOING ON. He has usurp part of my land by 750cm. 
       
       
      If he is able and capable in his Own writing to apologize six times to me I will apologize for my alleged comments, if he can prove it. I shall wait until the pigs will start flying – maybe – APOSTOLOS is the worst offender in the car park of STRATA PLAN 13595, for uncleanness and disorderly parking. Every tenants every owners can testify his bad manners.” 
       
       
      
     142. The terms of this letter are such that the plaintiff relies on it in seeking aggravated compensatory damages. 
      
      
     The defendant’s submissions on damages 
      
      
     143. Counsel for the defendant (written submissions, p 2) submitted that damages, if reached, would be “minimal”, on the basis that the only harm since publication was that the owners of shops 1, 2 and 3 (in other words, all other owners except the defendant and Mr Tranh) were not so friendly towards him. It is asserted that the minutes of nearly all the meetings since do not evince opposition to the plaintiff’s proposals as these other owners either support the plaintiff’s proposals or are indifferent to them. 
      
      
     144. In oral submissions, counsel for the defendant submitted that there was no basis for the award of aggravated damages, particularly since the number of persons who had read the publication was so small. Counsel for the defendant did not address the issue of the impact of the abandoned plea of truth on aggravated compensatory damages. 
      
      
     145. The purpose of damages for defamation is consolation for the distress caused by the publication, reparation for the harm done to reputation and vindication of the plaintiff’s reputation:  
     Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd 
      (1993) 178 CLR 44. As the Court of Appeal has emphasised in  
     Ali v Nationwide News Pty Ltd  
     [2008] NSWCA 183, a solatium for injured feelings forms a large element in the damages awarded for defamation. The award must show that the plaintiff has been vindicated in his reputation and should reflect the high value the law places upon reputation, so the plaintiff can point to the sum awarded to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge.  
      
      
     146. The defendant’s submissions fail to address the evidence of the plaintiff concerning the ongoing problems he has had not only with his fellow owners but also with members of the public. Nor do they address his hurt to feelings not only resulting from the original publication but from repetition of the imputations in subsequent correspondence to the strata manager. 
      
      
     Conclusions concerning damages 
      
      
     147. The plaintiff should be awarded damages which take into account all of the matters referred to by the Court of Appeal in  
     Ali, 
      but in the context of the cap on damages imposed for the 2005 legislation, and paying particular regard to the limited extent of publication. 
      
      
     148. As a matter of general observation, publications to a handful of persons rarely if ever attract substantial damages. The impact of the cap on damages must mean that awards of damages at the lower end of the scale is appropriate for such publications. 
      
      
     149. In awarding damages, I should include an amount for aggravated compensatory damages. The bringing of a hopeless defence of partial justification, which was abandoned after the defendant had to make concessions in the witness box is but one of a series of matters which individually and collectively constitute grounds for such an award. 
      
      
     150. I have had regard to the manner of assessment of damages under the new Act by Simpson J in  
     Holmes v Fraser 
      at [103] – [110]. In particular I note that s 36 provides that I am to disregard the malice of the defendant at the time of publication or at any other time except to the extent that the malice affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff. In  
     Holmes  
     there was no evidence that the malice affected the harm but in the present proceedings the saga of correspondence following the publication and the defendant’s conduct of the litigation has affected the harm sustained by the plaintiff. In  
     Holmes  
     there was only the matter complained of but in these proceedings the plaintiff has had to live with these allegations on a daily basis because they have been repeated. 
      
      
     151. I have also taken into account that pursuant to s 38 evidence of an apology or other mitigation is admissible. The defendant in cross-examination claimed that he would apologise to the plaintiff and said he had already done so (see the text of the letter set out above). The tenor of his offer to apologise in the witness box was much the same as his letter, and far from amounting to apology was a further cause of distress to the plaintiff. 
      
      
     152. Taking all of the above factors into account, I assess the plaintiff’s damages at $50,000.  
      
      
     153. The parties have asked me to reserve on questions of interest and costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Cogswell DCJ in Sydney District Court on 1 June 2007. The applicant was dealt with for offences which had been committed on 9, 10 and 21 November 2005 respectively at which times the applicant was aged 17 years. His Honour also took into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, three offences of robbery in company and one offence of attempted robbery in company which were all committed on 20 September 2005.  
     
      
    3 The principal offences were armed robberies on 9 and 10 November and, on 21 November, assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon accompanied by wounding. The maximum prescribed penalty for the lastmentioned is imprisonment for 25 years to which is attached a standard non-parole period of 7 years and the maximum penalty for the armed robberies is 20 years imprisonment. At the date of sentence the applicant was approaching near to his 19th birthday. He had been kept in juvenile detention since his arrest in November 2005.  
     
      
    4 The sentences imposed did not, in respect of the armed robberies, reflect the sequence of their commission but nothing turns on this. His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows. For the second armed robbery on 10 November, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 22 November 2005 and expiring on 21 November 2007; for the first armed robbery on 9 November, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 22 May 2006 and expiring on 21 May 2008 and for the armed assault with wounding on 21 November (taking into account the Form 1 offences) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months 7 days commencing on 22 November 2006 and expiring on 28 February 2010 with a balance term of 3 years 8 months 21 days commencing on 1 March 2010 and expiring on 21 November 2013. 
     
      
    5 The structure of the sentences was expressly designed by his Honour so that the minimum term of custody would expire 6 months after the applicant’s 21st birthday. That age is the limit during which an offender may be directed to serve his sentence in a juvenile detention facility: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, s 19. His Honour gave such a direction. 
     
      
    6 The facts in relation to the offences were summarized in his Honour’s remarks and I substantially draw therefrom for this narrative. It is convenient to describe the offences in the sequence in which they occurred.  
     
      
    7 On 20 November 2005 the applicant and some friends formed a belief that the girlfriend of one of the latter had had her mobile phone stolen. As a group they went in search of a presumed thief. They passed a golf course where they saw some young men who were searching for golf balls. They stopped and a co-offender approached and then slapped and punched one of the young men while the rest of the group stood around. Thereafter members of the applicant’s group continued to accost those who had been searching for golf balls and from them stole a bumbag and two mobile phones.  
     
      
    8 The applicant’s role was to keep a lookout and provide his physical presence. He acknowledged that in so doing he intentionally assisted those whom he knew were committing offences although he himself made no demands on the victims nor did he participate in any battery of them. He did not share in the property taken.  
     
      
    9 It can be noted that one of the co-offenders in these offences was a youth named Jeremiah who is now deceased. I will make further reference to him in due course.  
     
      
    10 The first armed robbery (9 November) occurred at Leumeah. The applicant and two co-offenders were cruising in a vehicle seeking a target for robbery and they selected an establishment called Bernie’s Take Away. The applicant and one other alighted from the vehicle and entered the shop where, at the time, there were employees and customers. The customers included young girls aged 11, 12, 14, 17 and 18.  
     
      
    11 The two active offenders, one of them the applicant, were brandishing machetes. Customers at the front of the store were told to “get the fuck inside”. The offenders demanded money and the applicant attempted to jump over the counter but the counter broke beneath him. The customers were directed not to look at them and the expressions included words such as “shut your fuckin” eyes, get down, just stay there”.  
     
      
    12 Approximately $2,000 was taken from the till. His Honour found that none of the victims suffered any injuries by which I take him to have meant injuries of a physical nature. He commented that the circumstances may have been terrifying for everyone involved and an “almost nightmarish experience”.  
     
      
    13 On the next day (10 November) the second armed robbery was committed upon Domino’s Pizza Shop. A co-offender kept a lookout and the applicant entered the shop with a machete secreted inside his trouser leg. Once inside, he produced the machete and jumped the counter, holding the weapon at two victims, one of whom was aged 16, from whom he demanded money. The content of the cash register was handed over but the applicant drew attention to a safe. A bag of coins was withdrawn from the safe and given to him. He jumped back over the counter and left through the front door. About $500 was taken.  
     
      
    14 The third offence on 21 November 2005, clearly correctly described by his Honour as the most serious, occurred when the applicant and a co-offender were again driving in a vehicle looking for a target for robbery. The Woodbine Neighbourhood Store near Campbelltown was selected. The applicant entered that store at about 8 to 8.15 pm with a machete secreted in his clothing. At that time there were present two staff of the store, a Mr Pham and his mother, as well as two female customers aged 17 and 22.  
     
      
    15 The applicant jumped on the counter and called out repeatedly, “Where’s the money?” He descended from the counter and brandished the machete at Mr Pham. The two female customers fled and hid next door. 
     
      
    16 Mr Pham resisted and a struggle ensued. His Honour found that the applicant continued to hold the machete but “did not pull on it during the struggle”. Nevertheless Mr Pham sustained a deep laceration to his right hand which severed his fingers. Mr Pham was able to push the applicant who ran from the store and decamped in the waiting car with his co-offender. No property was taken. 
     
      
    17 At Liverpool Hospital Mr Pham underwent extensive surgery. Despite such intervention, he is left with permanent impairment rendering fine motor tasks and many hand functions either unsafe or impossible. 
     
      
    18 It is convenient to note at this point that the applicant was not without prior record, having had findings of guilt recorded against him at Campbelltown Children’s Court on 16 May 2005 for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, upon each of which he had been ordered to enter a bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months and to be subject to supervision by Juvenile Justice. Both bonds were current when all of the above offences were committed.  
     
      
    19 The evidence showed that Juvenile Justice assessed the applicant’s response to supervision as “excellent” and formally suspended supervision on 10 October 2005. The officers were presumably unaware then that in the month immediately before the decision to suspend supervision, the applicant had committed the crimes which were eventually included on the Form 1. However an officer, Mr Strachan, testified that the suspension had followed a prediction that the applicant was “the boy deemed least likely” to commit further offences. Obviously that prediction was not fulfilled. When the crimes of 20 September were drawn to the attention of Mr Strachan he expressed the opinion that the applicant had made a “negative decision” and he commented that “anyone of us can make a negative decision at any time”.  
     
      
    20 Mr Strachan was questioned about the three offences in the month after supervision was suspended and said that the information about these “came out of the blue” and was “a total shock”. In summary, his evidence was that he maintained his opinions about the reform of the applicant particularly by referring to his good behaviour in detention but in predicting the absence of likely future offending he conceded he would “probably be a bit more guarded” than previously. 
     
      
    21 His Honour adverted to subjective matters in the applicant’s favour. In particular he related to the trauma of being called to the scene where his friend Jeremiah died as a result of stab wounds. He was present at the death. The applicant’s reaction was claimed to be to seek to assuage stress and depression over the death by consuming vast amounts of intoxicating liquor. He stated that the motive for the robberies was to obtain money to buy alcohol. 
     
      
    22 Jeremiah was described as more than a friend to the applicant, being something like a big brother or a mentor. The situation was obviously not entirely beneficial for the applicant as Jeremiah, as noted above, was a participant in the attacks and robberies near the golf course on 20 September. A psychological report by Juvenile Justice signed by a Ms Hollier and a Mr Van Gestel records an interview with the Assistant Principal of the school attended by both the applicant and Jeremiah. Whilst her opinion that the death impacted on the school population can readily be accepted, the absence of reference by her to Jeremiah’s conduct on 20 September, if indeed she had been made aware of it, would tend to undermine her praise of him as “a remarkable influence on many of the students at the school”.  
     
      
    23 A single ground of appeal asserted that the Crimes Act s 98 offence was manifestly excessive. Of course, the sentences for the robberies on 9 and 10 November are now expired. In a written submission it was stated that the applicant did not appeal against the non-parole period but was concerned only with the parole period. It was accepted in oral submissions that these periods were not amenable to being separately assessed and what was contended was that the total term was excessive and therefore a substituted lesser total term would result in a reduced parole period even allowing for the possibility that the non-parole period might be again identically specified. 
     
      
    24 Despite the limited expression of the ground even as so explained, there were some submissions of specific error to which attention should be directed. 
     
      
    25 It was submitted that his Honour did not state how he took the applicant’s subjective circumstances into account in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. The emphasis is in the written submission. Subjective matters do not of their nature intrude into an assessment of objective seriousness. They are available, if found, to ameliorate the sentence which would reflect objective seriousness but they are not elements of it. His Honour was not obliged to compartmentalize any favourable subjective circumstances which he found and “how” he took them into account was by an implicit assessment of sentence lower than it would have been had they not been found. 
     
      
    26 Next it was asserted that his Honour did not refer to s 21A of the sentencing legislation in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Specific reference was made to s 21A(3) subs (h), (i), (j), (k) and (m). All of those provisions describe possible mitigating factors which are subjective to the offender. They refer to rehabilitation, remorse, impaired awareness, a plea of guilty and assistance to authority. They are not elements of objective seriousness. In fact his Honour did refer to all of those provisions (except (i)) when expressing reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. Subsection (i) refers to remorse which his Honour, elsewhere in his remarks, accepted as “real”. His Honour’s approach was correct. 
     
      
    27 A written submission was made that his Honour did not appear to have properly applied s 44(1) of the sentencing legislation. Oral submissions revealed that the essence of complaint was a failure to apply to the individual impositions on each count a “discount” which he had quantified. The absence of direct application was said to have resulted in the sentence on count 3 being excessive.  
     
      
    28 His Honour had stated that he considered the overall criminality merited a sentence in the region of 13 years imprisonment. Nevertheless, taking into account matters which he mentioned, he said that he would apply a discount of “some 35 percent” and taking into account some further matters he reached a head sentence determined to be in “the region of 8 years”.  
     
      
    29 Counsel drew attention to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 to the effect that a judge sentencing for more than one offence must fix the appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. That authority is, of course, accepted. Putting to one side the sentences on counts 1 and 2 and the extent of cumulation which matters have not been the subject of challenge, counsel for the applicant calculated the discount which reduced 13 years to 8 years at about 38 percent and further calculated a notional “starting point” for the sentence on count 3 of about 11 years and 4 months on the assumption that a 38 percent discount had independently been applied to an initial assessment on count 3. 
     
      
    30 Thus, it was argued, if the 7 years standard non-parole period was to be imposed, it would, absent special circumstances and pleas of guilty and assuming division of term as set out in the statutory formulation (for a mid-range offence, as his Honour found it to be) be represented by a head sentence or total term of 9 years 4 months. Therefore, a head sentence of 11 years 4 months must be manifestly excessive where there had been a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    31 Whilst I would accept the applicant’s submission that discounting a total, rather than assessing appropriate sentences on individual counts, would not be synchronous with Pearce, it is plain that the “arithmetic” being applied by his Honour was in fact to the overall term of 13 years, as he stated, and the hypothetical calculations submitted by counsel for the applicant do not accord with the process his Honour explicitly followed and are not demonstrative of the type of error contended. His Honour’s approach did not lead to any adverse consequence affecting the applicant requiring intervention by this Court.  
     
      
    32 One of the matters which his Honour expressly took into account in the applicant’s favour was the content of a document identified as Exhibit D. An authority relevant to the content of that exhibit is R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. This Court has been made aware of the content of the exhibit and it suffices for present purposes to record that fact.  
     
      
    33 The final contention by the applicant was that some sentences on co-offenders had relevance “at least in the assessment of the Form 1 offences”. The impositions on two of the participants (one juvenile and one adult) in the September 20 offences were referred to. To say the least, the submission faces an initial hurdle of seeking to compare precise sentences received by the co-offenders with an imprecise enhancement of a sentence received by the applicant for a completely different offence. The submission did not recognize the nature of the Form 1 procedure. Although the facts identify co-offenders in the principal offences, it does not appear that they were charged with the Crimes Act s98 offence which mandated that the proceedings against the applicant be heard in the District Court. He was alone in the shop when he wounded Mr Pham. It appears that the co-offenders in the principal offences were dealt with in the Children’s Court which could not have happened if a s 98 charge had been preferred. In the whole of the circumstances there was no error in his Honour’s determination that, as he put it, parity was not a significant factor.  
     
      
    34 None of the applicant’s contentions has been made good. The minimum period of custody represents approximately 53 percent of the total term, a division very much in the applicant’s favour when compared with the ratio specified in the sentencing statute. The very precise non-parole period and consequent balance term were expressly set by his Honour in order to allow the applicant to serve the whole of his minimum custody in juvenile detention. Of course, whether he is in fact released when that period expires is a matter for determination by other authority. It is a compelling inference that his Honour reduced the non-parole period in order to accord the benefit of juvenile detention to the applicant and the complementary inference is that, but for the limit of age during which the applicant may be so detained, the non-parole period was likely to have exceeded 53 percent of the total term.  
     
      
    35 The offences committed by the applicant were very serious and included the repeated putting in fear of shopkeepers and their customers culminating in the causing of permanent injury to Mr Pham on the third occasion. The Crown submission that the sentences reflect the objective seriousness of the offences whilst taking adequate account of the applicant’s subjective circumstances should be accepted. No lesser sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
    36 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

      6 AUGUST 2008 
       
       
       
      2007/1675 REGINA v GORDON ERIC WOOD 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON A REPORT OF JURY MISCONDUCT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This judgment concerns competing applications made by the parties as a result of a report made to the Court and evidence adduced under the provisions of the Jury Act. The accused, Gordon Eric Wood, is charged with having murdered the deceased, Caroline Byrne, by throwing her from the top of the cliff at The Gap, Watsons Bay, one night in 1995. The Crown Prosecutor began his opening late on the first day of the trial and concluded it on the second day. By the conclusion of the opening the jury had a reasonably detailed knowledge of evidence the Crown expected to call and what assertions it would make relying on that evidence. On Wednesday 30 July, the third day of the trial, the jury were taken for an inspection of certain features at Watsons Bay. They were shown the place from which the Crown would be submitting that the accused had thrown Ms Byrne to her death and the place where the Crown would be saying that she landed at the foot of the cliff, meeting her death. Several other features were pointed out as well. It was obvious to the jury that the acts of the accused relied on would be said to have taken place on a dark night when visibility was limited. The Crown mentioned in opening that there was a sea mist on the same night which further interfered with visibility. 
     
      
    2 The evidence began on the fourth day of the trial, Thursday 31 July. At the conclusion of the evidence in chief of the first witness the Court adjourned. Later the same afternoon there was received in my chambers a report, the effect of which was that a person claiming to be a member of the jury had had a telephone conversation with a journalist and had disclosed that some members of the jury were intending to return to The Gap that night for a private inspection. That would have been contrary to explicit directions I had given the jury. I arranged for an officer of the Sheriff’s Department to retrieve confidential particulars about each juror and to telephone each juror and tell that juror three things namely, first, that the Court had been led to believe that some members of the jury were intending to return to The Gap that night to have a private inspection, secondly, that on no account should such an inspection be held and thirdly that the jury would be asked about this on the next sitting day, namely Monday 4 August. The officer concerned managed to do so by about 6:40pm on Thursday 31 July. 
     
      
    3 On Friday 1 August I invited counsel and their solicitors to my chambers. The accused was not present. I told counsel the substance of the report that I had received, what I had done in response and my understanding of the action the Sheriff’s officer had been able to take. The court reporter attended that conference and made an official transcript of everything that was said. 
     
      
    4 The Court sat on Monday 4 August. The accused was present. I repeated for the benefit of the accused and everybody else present the substance of what had happened on Thursday, 31 July. At my request Mr Jason Morrison attended. He gave evidence on oath. I asked all the questions myself, having given counsel an opportunity to suggest things that I should ask. Mr Morrison is a broadcaster at radio station 2GB. He said that he received a telephone call at 9:20am on the morning of Thursday 31 July. This evidence followed -  
     
      
       
        
        Q. And did you speak to the person on the other end of the phone?  
         
        A. I did, yes. Will gender help you at all? 
         
         
        Q. Did it seem to be a man or a woman?  
         
        A. It was a woman.  
         
         
        Q. Did you know that woman?  
         
        A. No. That woman, though, said to me that she was calling me because we had had contact some time in the past and that she knew - words to the effect that I knew a little bit about the legal system, which was a bit humorous, actually, but that's what she said.  
         
         
        Q. What did the woman say?  
         
        A. She told me first up that she was a juror in the case of Mr Wood. And I immediately interrupted her and I said, ""Well, I doubt that, because, if you were, you would have been told you're not allowed to speak to the media."" And she said, ""Oh, I'm not calling you to ask about the case, I'm calling you for some advice."" And I interrupted her and told her that she could get me into a lot of trouble if this conversation went any further. And I said, ""I ask that you hang the phone up now and talk to the judge. The judge is the only person that can help you out.""  
         
         
          
          Before I could get - almost get - end the call, she then asked me, she said to me, ""Well, I think you've got to know that there is a plan by some people on the jury to go out and"" - words to the effect of - ""check out the crime scene at night."" And I said to her, ""Look, you've told me too much. I'm going to have to end the call."" And she said, ""Well"" - and she continued on. I - she said again words to the effect of, ""We were taken out there during the day the other day and it's pretty clear that they don't want us to see it at night."" And, at that point, I said, ""Look, I'm going to have to hang up. This has gone too far. You've got to talk to the judge.""  
          
         
         
          
          And she then said again, words to the effect, ""I'm only after advice."" And I said, ""Well, I'm sorry, I don't want to be rude, but I can't give you it. I can get into a lot of trouble if this phone call goes any more."" And she said to me, ""Well, I can't - there's a woman on the jury who is quite a bully and she's telling us we should do it."" And then she told me something - and this is a little sensitive. Would you like me to tell you, because it goes to the effect of what this juror said?  
          
         
         
        Q. Right. Please?  
         
        A. She said, ""This woman has already decided that he's guilty and that we should go out and see why."" I said, ""Look, bye-bye, I cannot talk to you any more. You have got to tell the judge. I am going to tell the judge."" And I put the phone down, and that was it.  
        
       
      
    5 Mr Morrison went on to say that he was so concerned that he spoke about it to an in-house lawyer. That led to the report being made in due course to my chambers. Although the caller told Mr Morrison that they had had contact at some time in the past, nothing she said enabled him to identify her. Nothing that she said enabled him to identify any juror that might have been intending to go to The Gap. There was this evidence -  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Q. Did she say anything that might enable any identification of any of the jurors who were intending to go to The Gap?  
           
          A. No. No. The only thing she said about another juror was the woman, who I described as being a bit of a bully, who'd made her mind up, and that was it.  
           
           
          Q. Was she one of the ones who were intending to go to The Gap?  
           
          A. I'm not clear about that. I don't know.  
           
           
          Q. Can you remember anything else about the conversation, do you think?  
           
          A. I can tell you about - I mean, only the characteristics of the lady's voice. Actually, I can tell you that there was - it sounded like it was being made in a noisy street environment. I said to my lawyer this morning when we were out the front here, ""It sounded like it was out here somewhere"", outside the Court building, it was that kind of ambience. And she had a voice that suggested to me that she could be of middle age, but it's a guess, your Honour.  
           
          
         
        
       
      
    6 Mr Morrison said that no sound record was made of the telephone call.  
     
      
    7 I asked Mr Morrison to remain while I examined jurors. 
     
      
    8 Section 68B of the Jury Act is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A juror must not, except with the consent of or at the request of the judge or coroner, wilfully disclose to any person during the trial or coronial inquest information about:  
         
        (a) the deliberations of the jury, or 
         
          
          (b) how a juror, or the jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in the trial or coronial inquest. 
          
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. 
         
         
        (2) A person (including a juror or former juror) must not, for a fee, gain or reward, disclose or offer to disclose to any person information about:  
         
        (a) the deliberations of a jury, or 
         
          
          (b) how a juror, or a jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in a trial or coronial inquest. 
          
         
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units. 
         
         
        (3) The deliberations of a jury include statements made, opinions expressed, arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations. 
         
         
        (4) Subsection (1) does not prohibit a juror from disclosing information to another member of the jury during a trial or coronial inquest. 
        
       
      
    9 Section 68C is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        (1) A juror for the trial of any criminal proceedings must not make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.  
         
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. 
         
         
        (2) This section applies in respect of a juror from the time the juror is sworn in as a juror and until the juror, or the jury of which the juror is a member, is discharged by the court having conduct of the proceedings. 
         
         
        (3) This section does not prohibit a juror:  
         
        (a) from making an inquiry of the court, or of another member of the jury, in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror, or 
         
        (b) from making an inquiry authorised by the court. 
         
         
        (4) Anything done by a juror in contravention of a direction given to the jury by the judge in the criminal proceedings is not a proper exercise by the juror of his or her functions as a juror. 
         
         
        (5) For the purpose of this section, making an inquiry includes the following:  
         
        (a) asking a question of any person, 
         
          
          (b) conducting any research, for example, by searching an electronic database for information (such as by using the Internet), 
          
         
        (c) viewing or inspecting any place or object, 
         
        (d) conducting an experiment, 
         
        (e) causing someone else to make an inquiry. 
        
       
      
    10 Section 55DA is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A judge may examine a juror on oath to determine whether a juror has engaged in any conduct that may constitute a contravention of section 68C. 
         
         
        (2) A juror is not excused from a requirement to give evidence on such an examination on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the juror has committed an offence against section 68C. 
         
         
        (3) However, if the judge is satisfied, after the evidence has been given, that the evidence may tend to prove that the juror has committed an offence against section 68C, the judge is to cause the juror to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence. 
         
         
        (4) In any proceedings for an offence against section 68C, evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given cannot be used against the person. 
         
         
        
       
      
    11 It seemed to me that if the person who had spoken to Mr Morrison was indeed a member of the jury some things might have been said in contravention of the provisions of s68B. If the caller was telling the truth those jurors contemplating a private view at Watsons Bay were contemplating an act contravening the provisions of s68C. If they had already conspired to do that act they might already, without ever going to Watsons Bay, have committed an offence under s68C. 
     
      
    12 I took the view that s55DA gave express power to me to question any juror on oath or affirmation about any plan to visit Watsons Bay. I took the view that my inherent right to control the trial process included power to question any juror about any possible infringement of s68B. Having in mind the provisions of s55DA Jury Act and s128 Evidence Act I questioned each juror in turn, first informing the juror that there was nothing to fear from telling the truth and that any truthful answer that tended to incriminate would be unable to be used afterwards in a prosecution for any offence. I said that I would give a certificate accordingly if necessary. 
     
      
    13 Having first told the jury as a whole the substance of what had been reported to me and my intention to try to ascertain by examination of them answers to questions thereby raised, I invited the jury to retire. I invited any juror who had telephoned a journalist during the currency of the trial to send me a note to that effect. No note was forthcoming. I questioned each juror individually in the absence of all other jurors. In that way I asked each juror three questions -  
     
      
    1. Whether the juror had made a telephone call to a journalist during the course of the trial, speaking about the jury;2. Whether that juror was aware of anybody else having made such a call; and 3. Whether the juror was aware of any plan by any members of the jury to return to The Gap at Watsons Bay to have a private inspection. 
     
      
       
      
    14 Each juror answered each question in the negative. One added to his answer to the third question something about a discussion the jurors had at Watsons Bay to the effect that they should perhaps have a further view, but that did not mean a private view. That portion of the answer was of no concern to me. 
     
      
    15 Mr Morrison heard the jurors give their evidence. He wrote down the number of one whose voice, he said, was similar to that of the caller. However, he made it clear that he was not positively identifying that juror as the caller. 
     
      
    16 I had been given some idea of things that had been said to the Sheriff’s officer during his conversations with members of the jury on the evening of Thursday 31 July. I asked the officer to attend. He is Mr Brian David Alexander Murray, Acting Assistant Sheriff, Acting Manager Court Administration. He gave evidence. He confirmed that he had received a request from the Registrar of the Court asking him to telephone each juror and say these three things, namely that the Court had been led to believe that one or more jurors were going to The Gap that night to make their own inspection, that on no account should anyone make such an inspection and that the jury would be asked about it on Monday at Court. 
     
      
    17 Mr Murray said that he had not been asked to gather information from jurors. He confirmed that by 6:40pm on Thursday 31 July he had spoken to all 12 jurors. I asked him whether any juror’s response had enabled him to know whether that juror had some knowledge of an intention by members of the jury to return to The Gap for a private inspection. He said that the response of one juror made him think so. He identified a female juror and repeated her jury number. He said that she had said that she had heard the conversation, something like that, in the jury room. Mr Murray was asked to state as precisely as possible what he had said to the juror and the response she had given. The evidence was as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Murray My name is Brian Murray from the Sheriff's Office in Sydney. I am ringing on behalf of the court. The judge in the trial has asked me to contact all jurors this evening because the court has been led to believe that one or more jurors are going to visit The Gap tonight to make their own private inspection of the site. 
        
       
       
        
        Juror Oh, yes. I - I heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room. 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Murray said that although he had kept a note of what he had said to the jurors he had not recorded any answer any juror had given.  
     
      
    19 I called into court the juror identified by Mr Murray and there was this evidence -  
     
      
       
        
        Q Did you receive a telephone call on Thursday evening from Mr Murray of 
         
          
           
            
            the Sheriff's Office? 
            
           
          
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. I want to put to you a conversation-- 
         
        A. (Witness nodded). 
         
         
        Q. --and ask you whether that conversation took place? 
         
        A. (Witness nodded). 
         
         
        Q. First of all, Mr Murray introduced himself and got you to identify yourself – I want to get through that? 
         
        A. Yep. 
         
         
        Q. Did he then say these words, or some words close to them, ""The judge at the trial has asked me to contact all jurors this evening because the court has been led to believe that one or more jurors are going to visit The Gap tonight to make a private inspection of the site""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did he say something like that to you? 
         
        A. Yep. From what I recall, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did you respond to him? 
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I think initially I went, ""What?"" And then I said, ""Really? They kind of joked about that, but not seriously."" 
         
         
        Q. Would you mind repeating that answer please? 
         
        A. I said, ""What? Really? They kind of joked about that, but I don't think so."" 
         
          
           
            
            But the joke was more about going back. I never thought that they were doing it on their own. It was more of a - ""We should go back"", you know, but, no, I didn't think they were doing it on their own, no. 
            
           
          
         
         
        Q. Did you say these words, or something close to them, ""Oh, yes, I heard something - I heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room""? 
         
        A. Ah, I think I said more along the lines of, ""I thought they were joking"". But I don't think it was ever regarding a private visit, no. 
         
         
        Q. Are you now telling us what you were saying to Mr Murray, or are you giving us your-- 
         
        A. No, my opinion of what they said. 
         
         
        Q. Just let me ask the question. If we both speak at once we will never know what was said. I will start again. I gained the impression from your last answer that you had stopped telling us about what you had said to Mr Murray and were giving the court your own impression of the meaning of conversations in the jury room? 
         
        A. (Witness nodded). 
         
         
        Q. Is that right? 
         
        A. That's correct. 
         
         
        Q. All right. So you told Mr Murray that you thought they were joking? 
         
        A. Yep. 
         
         
        Q. Yesterday I asked you this question-- 
         
        A. Uh-huh? 
         
         
        Q. --""Are you aware of any plan by any members to return to The Gap at Watsons Bay to have a private inspection?"" 
         
        A. (Witness nodded). 
         
         
        Q. You answered ""No""? 
         
        A. (Witness nodded). 
         
         
        Q. Do you stand by that answer? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    20 At my request Mr Murray returned to the witness box and there was this evidence -  
     
      
       
        
         
        Q I want to go back to the conversation that you had with the juror whose number you gave us,  
        (and then I repeated the number) 
        . Do you remember anything else the juror said about things she had heard said in the jury room? 
         
        A. No, your Honour. As soon as I - to the best of my recollection, as soon as she had mentioned anything about a conversation in the jury room, I ceased the conversation in the jury room and not to say anything more on that matter. 
         
         
        Q. Did she say anything to you to the effect that she thought they were joking when they said what they said in the jury room? 
         
        A. No, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Mr Crown? 
         
         
        CROWN: Your Honour, would your Honour  
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ask Mr Murray, if possible, that the juror said, ""I heard some of them joking - oh, yes, I heard some of them joking in the jury room."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: That's really a different question. 
         
         
        Q. Did she say some such words to you, in your recollection? 
         
        A. That is not my recollection, your Honour. 
        
       
      
    21 The evidence having been received, counsel made their submissions. The principal question arising was whether the woman who telephoned Mr Morrison was a member of the jury. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that she was not and that she was a “malevolent member of the public” whose intention was to interfere with the proper processes of the Court. He submitted that the Court should accept at face value the denials of each member of the jury as to the making of any telephone call and as to any knowledge of any plan to have a private inspection at Watsons Bay. Mr Terracini QC pointed to similarities in what the caller said to Mr Morrison and what the juror said to Mr Murray. He invited the Court to prefer Mr Murray’s evidence to that of the juror. He submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that the telephone call to Mr Morrison was a hoax. He submitted that the evidence was sufficient to cause grave feelings of disquiet if the trial should proceed. 
     
      
    22 Mr Murray’s evidence is important. It was not suggested that I should not accept it, though I accept that he did not record the juror’s answer and that he may not have used precisely the words said to him by the juror. Even so, this was no casual conversation. Mr Murray is a senior officer of his department. He was called out in an emergency. He had to unlock the courthouse at Darlinghurst and gain access to the safe in order to telephone each juror. He knew that the conversations he was going to have with those jurors were important and more than casual. He is likely in those circumstances, I think, to have an accurate recollection of anything significant said to him by any juror. I listened carefully to his evidence and was impressed by it. 
     
      
    23 I am satisfied that the juror told him that she had heard in the jury room some conversation about jurors having a private visit to Watsons Bay. The Crown invited me to conclude that whatever the juror said to Mr Murray must have referred only to a later inspection by the whole jury, a matter I had foreshadowed to all the jury during the view at Watsons Bay. I do not accept that submission. I accept that the words spoken to each juror by Mr Murray, including this juror, made it clear that he was asking about any intended private visit. The context makes that inescapable because he was telling each juror that that was not to take place on that night. It would not have been possible for all 12 jurors to go to Watsons Bay as a jury under the auspices of the Court on the night of Thursday 31 July.  
     
      
    24 This evidence satisfies me that things were said in the jury room about jurors returning privately to Watsons Bay. Moreover, there are two reasons why I think that the juror was not being frank with the Court when she added to the answer relaid by Mr Murray that she thought it was a joke. First, she did not say so to Mr Murray. I accept his evidence that she did not, and I reject her evidence that she did. Secondly, there is an internal inconsistency in a portion of the juror’s evidence. I will extract a small portion of it again, viz - 
     
      
       
        
         Q  
        Did you respond to him? 
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I think initially I went, ""What?"" And then I said, ""Really? They kind of joked about that, but not seriously."" 
         
         
        Q. Would you mind repeating that answer please? 
         
        A. I said, ""What? Really? They kind of joked about that, but I don't think so."" 
         
          
           
            
            But the joke was more about going back. I never thought that they were doing it on their own. It was more of a - ""We should go back"", you know, but, no, I didn't think they were doing it on their own, no. 
            
           
          
         
         
        Q. Did you say these words, or something close to them, ""Oh, yes, I heard something - I heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room""? 
         
        A. Ah, I think I said more along the lines of, ""I thought they were joking"". But I don't think it was ever regarding a private visit, no. 
        
       
      
    25 It makes no sense to me that the juror should have thought that her fellow jurors were having a joke but not about a private visit. If it were not a private visit they were talking about, where would the joke lie? What would be the joke in having all members of the jury travel as a Court to The Gap for a further inspection in the manner I had foreshadowed? 
     
      
    26 I conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to Watsons Bay. I do not believe that such discussions were had only as a joke. 
     
      
    27 It would be an enormous coincidence if a stranger to the jury room happened, in concocting a story to tell Mr Morrison, to invent a conversation that actually took place. I am far from satisfied that the caller was an impostor who had the mischievous intent of trying to stop the trial. I think that the caller was a member of the jury. 
     
      
    28 The evidence does not enable me to say who the caller was. The evidence does not enable me to say which jurors spoke about having a private visit to Watsons Bay. The evidence does not establish, nor did I enquire, whether any juror actually went to Watsons Bay on a private visit after the commencement of the trial. 
     
      
    29 I listened carefully to the evidence of Mr Morrison. It was not attacked. I accept his evidence of what the caller said to him. The statement that there was a woman on the jury who was quite a bully, had already decided that the accused was guilty and was telling members of the jury that they should have a private visit to Watsons Bay against my express instructions concerns me. I doubt whether the accused could receive a fair trial at the hands of a jury which had such a person as a member. 
     
      
    30 The evidence shows that one or more jurors probably misconducted themselves but, as I have explained, I am unable to identify any such juror. I have no reason to believe that all the members of the jury misconducted themselves, although I have found that one of the jurors was less than frank in answering the Court’s questions. Although I believe that one or more others were less than frank I have no way of knowing how many. My judgment should not be taken as implying that all the members of the jury have given less than completely truthful answers. This has the unfortunate result that I am unable publicly to vindicate those jurors who have throughout acted properly. They know who they are. The Court thanks them for their service.  
     
      
    31 The exercise of a trial judge’s discretion to discharge a jury when some incident occurs during a trial which may adversely affect its fairness depends upon the principle of necessity stated in Winsor v R (1866) LR 1 QB 390. There must be evident ""a high degree of need for such discharge … such as in the wider sense of the word might be denoted by necessity"" per Erle CJ at 394. This principle was adopted by the Victorian Supreme Court in R v Boland [1974] VR 849 at 866-867; the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v George, Harris and Hilton (1987) 9 NSWLR 527 at 533 and the High Court in Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427.32 The test to be applied for determining whether any irregular incident involving a juror warrants the discharge of the juror or the jury as a whole is whether or not the incident is such that, notwithstanding any proposed direction of the trial judge, it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of a fair-minded and informed member of the public that a juror or jury will not discharge its tasks impartially. Webb and Hay v R (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 46-47.33 One of the overriding factors to keep in mind is that the appearance as well as the fact of impartiality is necessary to retain confidence in the administration of justice. Both the parties to the case and the general public must be satisfied that justice has not only been done but that it has been seen to be done. Webb and Hay v R at 50.34 The High Court in Crofts v R (per Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 440) held that no rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury, however factors to be considered include the seriousness of the incident in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the incident occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome any apprehended impact. Much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial.35 Mason P and I emphasised the criterion of fairness in Bartle and Ors [2003] NSWCCA 329 and indicated that in exercising the discretion, the trial judge could take into account all that had happened and all that was likely thereafter to happen (at [80]-[81]).36 In Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53, Beazley JA (Hislop J agreeing) found that when an irregularity has occurred in the course of the jury’s deliberations a court must ask itself whether it can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred. This question is to be answered in light of the direction which the trial judge gave when the irregularity came to the judge’s attention. Hulme J referred to the notion which criminal appeal courts have developed, namely that in exceptional cases, no direction to the jury could have cured the damage. Implicit in this is the recognition that there are occasions when the legal system accepts that a jury will not, or cannot, be expected to comply with the directions of the trial judge. 
     
      
    37 I apply these principles. Ordinarily a trial judge is entitled to expect that jurors will obey the Court’s directions. There is evidence before me that at least one member of this jury is not prepared to do so. There is evidence to suggest that one member of the jury may be prepared to decide the case without regard to the evidence. That person cannot be identified and therefore cannot be removed from the jury. It becomes necessary for the whole jury to be discharged and for the trial to begin before a jury selected from a panel which does not contain any of the present jurors. 
     
      
    38 The jury is discharged. The accused is remanded for trial on a date to be fixed.

    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: On 14 December 2007 Alexios Mouscas, the applicant, was sentenced in the District Court for one count of possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year 3 months. As the sentence commenced on the day of sentence, the applicant will be released to parole on 13 June 2009. The overall sentence expires on 13 September 2010. Pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 an offence of using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (Cth) had been placed on a certificate. 
     
      
    4 A plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court and adhered to in the District Court. The sentencing Judge allowed a discount of twenty per cent for the plea about which the applicant does not complain. 
     
      
    5 An offence contrary to s 91H(3) is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years.  
     
      
    6 The applicant appeals against the severity of the sentence on two grounds which are: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the offence was in the “upper-end” of the range of objective seriousness. 
       
      
     Ground 2: The sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    7 The facts of the offence were not in dispute and an agreed statement of facts was handed to the sentencing Judge which his Honour adopted in his sentencing remarks. The facts disclosed that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation in July 2006 commenced an investigation into the distribution of child pornography using the Internet. The investigation conducted by the FBI led them to identify numerous persons located in Australia who had attempted to download child pornography images from an FBI monitored website. One of those persons was the applicant and a search warrant was executed at his home on 8 March 2007. The police were escorted by the applicant to his bedroom where he removed a concealed computer hard drive and a concealed spindle of compact disks. At the time of the seizure, Australian Federal Police Computer Forensic Team Members examined the computer and found approximately three gigabytes of child pornography images. Subsequent examination by police of the seized hard drive and disks revealed 41,923 graphic files and 251 video files classified as child pornography. Due to the large number of the files that had been seized that required classification, Australia Federal Police limited the classification of child pornography to prepubescent males and females in at least a semi-nude state.  
     
      
    8 At the time of commission of the offence the applicant was 39 years old. He was a single man who had obtained his Higher School Certificate and had been working as a security guard for 12 years as well as performing other jobs to supplement his income. He had no previous criminal record and resided with his parents in suburban Sydney. 
     
      
    9 The principal contention for the applicant so far as concerns the first ground of appeal was that the level of objective seriousness of his offending was at the mid-range or just below the mid-range and was not at the “upper-end” as found by the sentencing Judge. Counsel for the applicant submitted that there was no evidence that he was motivated by profit or intended to distribute the images and that his collection was only for private viewing. In accordance with the typology of online child pornography offending as defined by Dr Tony Krone in a paper entitled “A Typology of Online Child Pornography Offending” (Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice No 279 July 2004), counsel submitted the applicant was essentially a “Trawler” or more accurately an “intense Trawler”. 
     
      
    10 It was further submitted that the applicant’s level of culpability was not at the “upper-end” on the basis that the nature of the abuse towards children was “indirect” in the sense that the applicant did not “directly” abuse children by attempting to cultivate an online relationship with them, nor did he actually physically abuse them, produce his own images or those of others or distribute the images. In accordance with the typology used by Dr Krone, the applicant was not a “Secure Collector”, “Groomer”, “Physical Abuser”, “Producer” or “Distributor”. 
     
      
    11 The Crown, however, objected to the paper by Dr Krone being before this Court. The paper was not before the sentencing Judge nor was it referred to in any of the expert material tendered for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence. The Crown argued that the paper did not relate to matters going to the commission of the offence or to the applicant’s personal circumstances and was, therefore, not “evidence” within the meaning of s 12(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In response, counsel for the applicant said that the article was not evidence but merely intended to be of assistance to this Court in terms of research done in the area of child pornography.  
     
      
    12 In view of that concession, it is unnecessary to consider whether the academic paper is evidence within s 12(1)(c). I did not find in any event the article to be of assistance in considering the present appeal and, in my view, it is not material to which the Court ought to have regard. In particular, the determination of seriousness of offending by classifying offenders within particular groups is of limited use in individual cases. 13 In the present case, the sentencing Judge was invited to view a sample of the images that had been seized. During his remarks on sentence, his Honour said (ROS at 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “…I viewed a sample of the forty-odd thousand images that had been retained by the offender. In short, those images depicted the basest kind of sexual maltreatment of children. Some of the images might be described as art style photos of semi-naked and naked young girls, but there were also images of adult men having oral, anal and vaginal sex with young female children. Some of the children appeared to be as young as four or five. Many appeared to come from disadvantaged circumstances, appearing to be malnourished. In addition, there are even more disturbing photos of children being bound, gagged and blindfolded. Some of the images leave one to doubt as to whether the children were also drugged, as in some of the photographs the children appear to be asleep. There are yet further images of children involved in sexual acts with animals and one where the child was also tied up. In my view these images fall within the most serious category of possible material that could be described as child pornography. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the sheer number of photos may not itself be a reliable guide to the seriousness of the offence, it is plain here that many hundreds, if not thousands, of victims are involved in the production of these photographs. Every one of those children can legitimately be seen as a victim of this crime.” 
        
       
      
    14 And further (ROS at 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the range and number of photographs depicting sexually repulsive and depraved acts on young children, in this case, puts this offence in the upper-end of the range of seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    15 In cross-examination before the sentencing Judge the applicant agreed that much of the material involved “quite graphic sexual activities involving children, mostly girls under the age of 12”. 
     
      
    16 His Honour’s findings of fact about the nature of the material he viewed is not challenged. What is challenged is his Honour’s characterisation of the offence being in the upper-end of the range of seriousness. It is evident that this characterisation was founded upon the nature, content and number of the pornographic images.  
     
      
    17 The sentencing Judge had earlier referred to what was said by Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed) in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370, at [99] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…a range of factors bear upon the objective seriousness of an offence of possession or importation of child pornography. These factors include: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the nature and content of the pornographic material – including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) whether the offender will profit from the offence. 
           
           
          It might be worth noting, however, that the number of images as such may not be the real point. In a case of possession of child pornography for personal use only, the significance of quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 It was not suggested that the applicant had the child pornography in his possession for the purpose of sale or further distribution or that he would profit from the offence. The absence of these factors, however, did not preclude the sentencing Judge from coming to the conclusion that the applicant’s offending was at the “upper-end” of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    19 The nature and content of the images that were in the applicant’s possession involved the abuse, violation and degradation of children of a most serious kind. Whilst it is true that the nature of the applicant’s abuse towards children was indirect, it has been frequently said that possession of child pornography for private purposes provides a market for those who produce and distribute this material: see for example Liddington (1997) 97 A Crim R 400 per Ipp J at 409. There were, as the sentencing Judge remarked, “many hundreds, if not thousands” of children who were subjected to this shameful sexual exploitation. They were the innocent victims of the depravity depicted on the images which his Honour vividly described. In my view, it was open to the sentencing Judge to characterise the offence as being at the upper-end of the range of seriousness.  
     
      
    20 The first ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    21 The sentencing Judge’s finding that there was a real chance of the applicant re-offending was challenged in this Court. It was submitted for the applicant that Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist, had not said that and it was upon Dr Allnutt’s report that the sentencing Judge relied.  
     
      
    22 The subjective material before his Honour included reports from Dr Allnutt, and Marcelo Rodriguez, a psychologist. There was also a Probation and Parole report. The applicant gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence as did his sister and brother-in-law. The sentencing Judge was told by the applicant’s sister that she had three young children and she had no concern at all with her brother having contact with them. Her husband gave evidence in similar terms. The applicant testified that it was his intention “never to surf the net again” for child pornography. He had, the applicant said, a continuing intimate relationship with a lady whom he had met in 2004.  
     
      
    23 Julian Goldschmidt in the Probation and Parole report expressed the opinion that “it remains difficult to tell whether the offender’s confidence in his ability to refrain from future offending is speculative”. Mr Rodriguez opined that the applicant “who does not self-report an interest in children, who has not previously sexually offended against children, and who is not anti-social, is a low risk for contact offences against children” (italics added). He, however, pointed out that there were a number of risk factors associated with future sexual recidivism present in the applicant’s case. The applicant, Mr Rodriguez found, manifested personality traits usually found in obsessive compulsive disorder.  
     
      
    24 Dr Allnut regarded the applicant “as having deviant sexual interests” and manifesting “obsessive compulsive personality traits”. Whether or not the applicant was driven by “a primary broad underlying paraphiliac disorder with secondary sexual addiction to Internet pornography or is [sic] primary non-paraphiliac sexual addiction to pornography with secondary exposure to paraphiliac material” remained unclear.  
     
      
    25 Dr Allnutt wrote:  
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the information provided, in my opinion your client would fall into a group of individuals with a low risk of  
        contact  
        sexual offending. If he did re-offend it would most likely involve possession. It is difficult to determine the probability for future sexual recidivism with regard to possession of child pornography in the absence [sic] research in this area. My clinical experience suggests that this group of offenders might have different predictive factors associated with risk for future possession. Internet activity is relatively difficult to monitor which makes supervision difficult. It would probably be best to state what sort of interventions might reduce, whatever risk exists.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    26 Both Mr Rodriguez and Dr Allnutt acknowledged an absence of research in determining risk of future sexual recidivism in individuals who had been charged with possession of child pornography.  
     
      
    27 During his remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge compendiously dealt with the subjective material that had been placed before him. His Honour paid close regard to Dr Allnutt’s report and passages from it were quoted including the passage at paragraph 25 above.  
     
      
    28 His Honour said (ROS at 9):  
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst the offender has the continuing support of his parents and siblings, none of that support seems to me to significantly affect the prospects of him re-offending. When previously he offended he had their support but he kept his offending secret. The offender himself in his evidence before me undertook not to re-offend, but, with respect, I prefer the evidence of the expert psychiatrist as to this likelihood. In my view the prospect remains a real possibility and therefore there remains an aspect of specific deterrence in this sentence.” 
        
       
      
    29 It is plain, in my view, that his Honour was not there referring to the possibility of the applicant committing offences of a contact sexual nature, but was referring to the real possibility that the applicant might re-offend by possessing child pornography. This was a finding which was open to the sentencing Judge, who had seen and heard the applicant give evidence, on all of the material before him.  
     
      
    30 Another complaint made for the applicant was that his Honour “seemed to take a dim view” about the fact that the applicant did not allow other people to see the child pornography. It was argued that this should have been regarded by the sentencing Judge as a positive rather than a negative.  
     
      
    31 His Honour observed during his sentencing remarks that “…the offender hid his activities from those who were close around him” (ROS at 5) and in the passage quoted at 28 above that “he kept his offending secret”. The secrecy within which an offence of this nature is often committed creates difficulties for detection and prevention. In my view, the observations which his Honour made were open to him and his remarks disclose no error.  
     
      
    32 During oral submissions, it was contended for the applicant that the sentencing Judge did not give sufficient weight to the applicant’s prior good character. Counsel for the applicant referred to R v Fowler [2007] ACTCA 4 where the Court of Appeal of the Australian Capital Territory considered at [18] that the respondent in that case who was charged with a single count of possessing child pornography was entitled to have his lack of prior offending favourably taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    33 In the present case, the sentencing Judge said [ROS at 6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is a person of prior good character; I take that into account on sentence. But again, I note the words of Johnson J in the case of  
        Gent  
        with respect to this issue. There his Honour said at para 64: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “There is a foundation for the approach that less weight should be attached to evidence of prior good character on sentences for offences of importing child pornography. It appears that such offences are committed frequently by persons of otherwise good character. General deterrence has been referred to as the “ 
          paramount consideration 
          ” on sentence for this class of offence. The fact that the offence is, in a sense, committed in secret is also relevant to this issue.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 It seems from these remarks that less weight was given by the Judge to the finding of prior good character as the applicant was charged with possession of child pornography. 
     
      
    35 Johnson J in Gent, however, went on to say at [65 – 66]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rationale for this approach to prior good character of child sex offenders and drug couriers does not seem to apply to the present offence. The concept of breach of trust is not applicable. Although a clear and egregious breach of trust is involved on the part of those who perpetrate acts of abuse upon children which are filmed and also by those who have direct responsibility for such action, a person who accesses such images via the Internet or obtains material in printed form containing such images cannot be said to be in a relationship of trust with the children involved. However, the public interest in stifling the possession and use of such material as a means of protecting children has been advanced to emphasise the significance of general deterrence on sentence.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It cannot be said that the existence of good character places this class of offender in a position where they are more able to commit an offence (as with a white-collar offender) or more likely to be selected to commit an offence (as with a drug courier). It appears that pornographic material is available generally on the Internet to any person who is minded to access it, irrespective of the good character or otherwise of the person. Indeed, the ready availability of the material is a further factor pointing to the significance of general deterrence on sentence.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    36 What was said by Johnson J in Gent at [66] was substantially quoted in Fowler at [14] although the ready availability of pornographic material being a further factor relevant to general deterrence was not mentioned. Fowler was a Crown appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    37 For the offence of possession of child pornography where general deterrence is necessarily of importance and is frequently committed by persons of prior good character, it is legitimate for a court to give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. The sentencing Judge clearly recognised the significance of general deterrence when he said (ROS at 11): 
     
      
       
        
        “The penalty here must properly reflect the level of seriousness of the offence and the need for this sentence to demonstrate general deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    38 I am not satisfied that his Honour erred in the weight given by him to the applicant’s prior good character.  
     
      
       
      
    39 The parties in submissions referred to sentences imposed in other cases. Particular reference to Fowler was made for the applicant. Fowler, however, was concerned with manifest inadequacy and not manifest excess. The offender in that case had been sentenced to 12 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention and placed on a good behaviour order for three years. A Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed.  
     
      
    40 None of the cases referred to persuade me that the sentence in this case is manifestly excessive. In my opinion, the sentence imposed does not manifest error and is within the range of an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    41 The second ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    42 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    3 FULLERTON J: On 2 April 2007 Neil Andrew Crawford pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing six counts. Each offence was alleged to have been committed on 2 April 2006 consequent upon the police responding to a “000” call placed by a member of a household in Chippendale. The gravamen of the complaint to police was that the appellant was outside the house behaving in a verbally aggressive manner towards the occupants.  
     
      
    4 The first count on the indictment charged a malicious wounding of Constable Warren in the execution of duty causing him grievous bodily harm contrary to s 60(3)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 and the second, an alternate count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the same named officer contrary to s 60(2) of the Crimes Act. The injury in each of counts 1 and 2 was multiple undisplaced fractures to the jaw. The third and fourth counts were also cast in the alternative and alleged an assault of a different police officer. The remaining counts alleged that the appellant resisted arrest and maliciously damaged a door.  
     
      
    5 On 19 April 2007 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of the second count and verdicts of not guilty in respect of the balance of the charges on the indictment.  
     
      
    6 On 27 April 2007 the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on the date of sentence with the balance of term of 18 months to expire on 26 July 2010. The earliest date for release to parole was specified as 26 January 2009.  
     
      
    7 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately in accordance with the applicable law on the issue of self-defence as provided for in Part 11 Division 3 of the Crimes Act in circumstances where the alleged victim of the assault was a police officer. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that the sentencing judge failed to properly take into account his mental state and, that having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Since I am of the view that the appeal against conviction should be allowed and a new trial ordered the question of leave to appeal against sentence does not arise.  
     
      
    Relevant facts8 For the purposes of the appeal it is not necessary to recount the facts in any detail since the single ground of appeal is directed to the adequacy of her Honour’s direction on the issue of self-defence in the context of the single count on the indictment in respect of which the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
     
      
    9 It was common ground on the appeal that the offence was committed against the background of breakdown of the appellant’s relationship with Ms Charles, a relationship that predated the offence by about a year. It was also common ground that the relationship had only very recently terminated when Ms Charles left the residence she was sharing with the appellant at his request and took up temporary residence at the house in Chippendale. It would also appear that the appellant and Ms Charles had been in telephone contact on the morning of 2 April 2006 and that his reason for going to Chippendale was so they could have a face-to-face discussion about the relationship. Despite an arrangement to that end, the appellant’s former girlfriend did not come out of the house to meet with him on his arrival. He waited for about half an hour before he commenced calling out for her and banging on the front door. It was in those circumstances that the call was placed to the police.  
     
      
    10 Constable Warren and a probationary constable attended the scene in response to that call. It would appear that they had some difficulty finding the house and that it was the appellant who inquired whether they were there because of his behaviour. It was common ground that at this time he behaved cooperatively and calmly and led the police to the front door of the house. From that point in time however the account of the police and the appellant diverged dramatically. Although there were a number of witness who each gave evidence as to what they saw or heard occur at the doorway of the premises, by far the most comprehensive version of those events was in the evidence of Constable Warren and the appellant.  
     
      
    11 According to Constable Warren, the appellant’s demeanour changed dramatically when the door was opened and a man and a woman were visible inside. He was said to have become aggressive, issuing several insults directed at the female and generally conducting himself in a threatening manner. Constable Warren told the applicant to settle down so as to allow police to gain an appreciation of what was in issue. The police officer said that the appellant then tried to make his way past the people and into the house and that he pushed the appellant in the chest with his left arm to bar his approach. He said he again sought to subdue the appellant by encouraging him to allow the police to sort out the source of the conflict. Constable Warren said the appellant did not desist and that it was necessary for him to push him back a second time. At this time he placed a radio call for back-up. He said the appellant was becoming increasingly aggressive and that he stepped in front of him and held out his left arm, telling the appellant to stay away. On a further attempt to make his way past police and into the house, Constable Warren threatened to spray the appellant with OC spray. When this threat did not serve to subdue the appellant, Constable Warren formed the view that his behaviour was hindering the investigation, that he was in breach of the peace and, in circumstances where he considered the appellant might assault someone, he grabbed him by the right arm intending to arrest him. Before he was able to issue the words of arrest he said he felt a heavy blow to the right side of his jaw and what he described as a loud bang. He said he stepped back and the appellant ran off. The appellant was apprehended a short distance later with the assistance of other police. 
     
      
    12 The appellant gave a different account of the confrontation at the doorway in his evidence. Save for the fact that he makes no reference to being pushed against a wall and hitting his head, his evidence is said to be generally consistent with the account he gave to the police in a recorded interview after his arrest.  
     
      
    13 He agreed that he was repeatedly calling out the name of his former girlfriend and that Constable Warren told him to be quiet and to allow the police to deal with the situation. The appellant also agreed that when he continued to call out his girlfriend’s name Constable Warren turned around and pushed him in the chest, while issuing the direction that he stay back and be quiet. He says the push was forceful into his chest, knocking him off balance. The appellant responded by saying “there is no need for that” and for the police officer to “keep his hands to himself”.  
     
      
    14 The appellant said he continued to call out whereupon Constable Warren grabbed him by the shirt and proceeded to push or ram him against a wall. The appellant described his head hitting the wall under the force of the push and that the police officer was hitting him in the chest and on the chin at the same time. He said that he was struggling to wrest himself from the police officer’s grip and yelling loudly at the police officer to keep his hands off him.  
     
      
    15 The appellant said he first struck at the officer’s arms in order to try and break free from his grip and that he used his left arm which was clenched in a fist. He said that this had no effect so he then had a “second go at it” and that strike caused the police officer to let go. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I thought we were fighting. I thought for no reason we were in a fight situation. I was being attacked.”  
        
       
      
    He said that his aggression escalated when his head hit the wall. He went on to say: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “It was going from where we were talking fine just a few minuted ago and the next thing I’m getting smashed against the wall by this guy”.  
        
       
      
    16 The appellant says he did not see where the second blow struck the police officer but that he did not intend to strike at his head or to deliver the blow in any particular way. He said his intention was the same as that which accompanied the first swing, namely to break the officer’s grip because he was being “pinned and pushed and jabbed” against the wall. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I didn’t even feel like it was a police officer who was attacking me it was just it wasn’t right it didn’t seem right”.  
        
       
      
    The relevant facts in the context of the issues at trial 
     
      
    17 The conflict between the evidence of the police officer and the appellant raised squarely for the jury’s consideration whether an essential element in count 1 on the indictment (an element common to count 2 on the indictment), namely whether Constable Warren was acting in the execution of his duty at the time that he sustained the multiple fracture to his jaw, could be established to the criminal standard. While her Honour indicated that it was not relevantly in dispute that Constable Warren was a serving police officer and that he was acting in the execution of his duty in responding to the “000” call and in his initial dealing with the appellant, the jury were clearly directed that were they satisfied that the appellant’s version of what occurred at the door was reasonably possible, it would be open to them to find that the police officer exceeded the scope or limit of his duty and, as a consequence, that he would have ceased to be acting in the execution of his duty. In these circumstances the jury were directed that the appellant was entitled to be acquitted.  
     
      
    18 It was the Crown case that the appellant’s account of the confrontation at the door was untrue and that he simply lost his temper and violently struck the police officer who was at all times acting within the proper limits of his duty as he perceived them at the time. It was the appellant’s case that although the police officer was initially endeavouring to quell or calm the situation, he used excessive physical force thereafter in dealing with him, either as a result of impatience, intemperance or a misapprehension as to the appellant’s actual intentions. Having regard to the jury verdict, the resolution of that question must have been in the Crown’s favour. 
     
      
    19 There was however an additional basis upon which the appellant sought to persuade the jury that he was entitled to be acquitted of counts 1 and 2 (irrespective of whether the harm that resulted was established to the jury’s satisfaction to be grievous bodily harm or actual bodily harm and irrespective of the jury finding that the police officer acted lawfully) namely that he believed that his conduct in assaulting the police officer was necessary in order to defend himself and that his response was reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them to be at the time and, that if the Crown could not exclude this as a reasonable possibility, he should be acquitted.  
     
      
    20 The issue of self-defence was squarely raised by the appellant in the evidence that he gave at trial as reflected in the summary of his evidence above. Given that the primary basis upon which his case was put to the jury was that Constable Warren was acting outside of the scope of his duty and, that if the jury regarded that as a reasonable possibility he was entitled to be acquitted without the jury considering self-defence, it may have been accurate for her Honour to direct the jury that it was “no part or no large part of the accused’s case that he was acting in self-defence”. Nevertheless the jury were entitled to clear directions as to how they should approach their task if they were satisfied that the police officer acted aggressively, albeit within the scope of his duty, but not satisfied that he acted in the extreme way that the appellant contended for. In my view, no direction or no sufficiently clear directions were given to ensure the jury appreciated the legal framework in which they should approach the issue of self-defence if it arose that way. In fact, where in the summing up her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…It is no part of the Crown case that that accused was acting in self-defence  
        because  
        you would accept Constable Warren’s evidence that he was acting in the execution of his duty…” 
        
       
      
    and later, when dealing with the reasonableness of the appellant’s response to the police officer’s actions, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…your fact finding in respect of this element will of course be influenced by your earlier findings. To be considering whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the blow was struck with lawful excuse, means that you have already found that Constable Warren was acting in the execution of his duty…” 
        
       
      
    served in my view to dilute an essential feature of the direction on self-defence in this case. 
     
      
    Relevant law  
     
      
    21 Section 422 of the Crimes Act makes it patent that the offence provided for in section 418 of the Act is not excluded where the response by way of self-defence is to lawful conduct: 
     
      
       
        
        “418 Self-defence—when available 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:  
         
          
          (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
           
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
           
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
           
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass’ 
          
         
        and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.” 
         
         
        “422 Self-defence—response to lawful conduct 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        This Division is not excluded merely because:  
         
          
          (a) the conduct to which the person responds is lawful, or 
           
          (b) the other person carrying out the conduct to which the person responds is not criminally responsible for it.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 In R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613, Howie J considered the effect of Part 11 Div 3 of the Crimes Act on the issue of self-defence at common law. His Honour emphasised that s 418(2) is concerned not with the state of mind of a reasonable person but with the reasonableness of the conduct of the accused having regard to his or her state of mind. As applied to the facts of this case, it was sufficient if the appellant satisfied the jury that there was a reasonable possibility that he believed his conduct was necessary in order to defend himself, and a reasonable possibility that what he did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them.  
     
      
    23 Although Howie J did not have occasion to consider the operation of s 422, in my view having regard to the express terms of the section, the appellant was also entitled to have the jury directed that they could consider those questions even if they were otherwise satisfied that the police officer was acting lawfully (or was not otherwise criminally responsible for misconducting himself relative to the appellant), whatever particular factual findings they made about the degree and nature of force used.  
     
      
    24 Her Honour’s directions on the issue of self-defence were strictly in accordance with s 418(2) and were otherwise without error save for the fact that she refused a request by trial counsel that the jury be directed that the issue of self-defence fell to be resolved by them even if they were satisfied that the police officer’s behaviour was both reasonable and lawful as provided for in s 422. Trial counsel urged her Honour to augment her directions to the jury so as to draw that matter squarely to their attention in circumstances where, as he submitted, the dispute on the evidence may have left room for the accused’s genuine belief that it was reasonable to defend himself to be afforded weight. For reasons that are both unpersuasive and ultimately misguided, the Crown opposed her Honour directing the jury in the way defence counsel proposed.25 In my opinion her Honour was in error in refusing to direct the jury in accordance with s 422 of the Crimes Act, given the issues that presented for the jury’s consideration in the particular facts of this case. 
     
      
    26 I am also of the view that this is not a case where it is proper to apply the proviso, since the questions posed by the application of s 418 and s 422 are discretely jury questions and in those circumstances this Court could not be otherwise satisfied of the guilt beyond reasonable doubt such as to be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has resulted. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    27 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1. The appeal against conviction in respect of count 2 on the indictment be allowed. 
       
      2. The conviction in respect of count 2 on the indictment be quashed. 
       
      3. There be a retrial on count 2 on the indictment.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: By notice dated 2 November 2007, the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth of Australia gave notice of his desire to appeal the sentence pronounced in the District Court on 5 October 2007 when the respondent appeared for sentence on one charge of attempting to possess a substance, the substance having been unlawfully imported, being a border controlled drug within the meaning of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), namely, 3, 4–methylenedioxymethamphetamine, in a quantity attempted to be possessed being a commercial quantity contrary to s.11.1(1) and s.307.5(1) of the Code. 
     
      
    4 On 20 June 2007, the respondent stood trial before a jury charged with the above offence, that between 27 June 2006 and about 30 June 2006 he did attempt to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported substance, namely, the abovementioned drug. 
     
      
    5 On 6 July 2007, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    6 On 5 October 2007, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    7 Two co-accused, Johnson Au and Minh Cheun, had earlier pleaded guilty to the same offence. 
     
      
       
      The co-offenders’ sentences 
       
      
    8 On 7 March 2008, the respondent’s co-offenders, Minh Cheun and Johnson Au, were sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Johnson Au 
       
      
    9 Sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 14 years and six months with a non-parole period of nine years following a plea of guilty. An allowance of 15% was made for the plea of guilty and 20% discount was allowed for assistance. But for the plea and the assistance, the total sentence would have been 21 years. 
     
      
       
      (2) Minh Cheun 
       
      
    10 Sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 17 years and six months with a non-parole period of 11 years. A discount of 10% was allowed for the guilty plea (entered on the day the trial was listed for hearing) and a discount of 20% was allowed for assistance. But for the plea of guilty and past and future assistance, the total sentence would have been 25 years. 
     
      
       
      The co-offender, Johnson Au 
       
      
    11 In the course of sentencing Au, the sentencing judge, who also sentenced the respondent, observed that, in relation to an enterprise involving the importation of illicit drugs into Australia, this case was in the worst category in terms of the volume of the drugs involved, their potential value to the importers and distributors and the potential harm that could have been done to consumers of the drugs within the Australian community. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge found in relation to Au that his role was inferior to that of Cheun in terms of the length of involvement in the enterprise and the particular tasks he was required to perform in relation to Cheun. From the time of his involvement with the contact person referred to as “David”, he knew from that early stage that he was being asked to involve himself in serious criminality in relation to drugs. The sentencing judge further observed in relation to Au, that a significant matter in relation to his role was that it was he who recruited the respondent into the enterprise in order to permit the important step of transporting the drugs away from the person Huang’s place and temporarily warehousing them in the respondent’s garage. Au was also found to be responsible for the purchase of some equipment and then willingly returning to the respondent’s home with the intention of assisting in the recovery and then proposed delivery of the drugs. The sentencing judge observed that Au was an active participant in the ill-fated recovery process. Au also acted as driver for Cheun, the man who he understood was the person actively and locally responsible for that aspect of the enterprise. He admitted that $20,000 to $30,000 had been mentioned by “David” to be the split between himself and the respondent. Au’s knowledge and participation in the enterprise was over a relatively short period but, as the sentencing judge observed, that was not determinative of the gravity of the offence. 
     
      
       
      The co-offender, Minh Cheun 
       
      
    13 In the course of his remarks on sentence (p.18), the sentencing judge accepted the general statement of Cheun’s role as recorded in the Crown’s written submissions as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This was a well planned importation with the MDMA expertly concealed in containers of ink. The offender was recruited to travel to Australia for the sole purpose of overseeing the retrieval of the drugs from their concealment once the shipment of ink had been sent to Sydney and the drugs initial distribution. The offender was furnished with a list of the box numbers which contained the drugs and utilised the services of an innocent courier to assist him in taking the relevant boxes to a place of safety from where the drugs could then be accessed. The offender also actively assisted in the unpacking of the drugs and from the intercepted phone calls was to have also divided the various types of pills of on distribution.” 
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge observed that Cheun’s role (remarks on sentence, p.18):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… was pivotal to the success of the enterprise after the drugs had arrived in Australia. I accept that he was not a principal. He was following instructions. The intercepted telephone conversations generally make that clear enough. However, he was involving in making decisions akin to that of a middle manager, such as the recruitment of Mr Huang and other tasks necessary for the implementation of the instructions that he was given by telephone from abroad. In short, while he was an employee of the principal, he played an significant and crucial role. He did not become involved in the enterprise at short notice as were the offenders Au and Zeng, but he came to Australia specifically to carry out the tasks designated to him.” 
        
       
      
    15 In sentencing Cheun, the sentencing judge observed under the heading “parity” (remarks on sentence, p.18):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I sentenced Zeng to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of six years. I found that his role was subservient and relatively short-lived compared to all other known and unknown offenders. He was conscripted to the enterprise somewhat unwittingly but then went on to provide assistance in a very short time frame. His sentence was not reduced for a plea of guilty or for assistance to authorities. 
        
       
       
        
        In comparing the roles played by the present offender, Au and Zeng, it is clear that Zeng’s was significantly less than the other two and that Au’s was somewhat less than the role of the present offender. Their respective subjective features are different and pull in different directions in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. For example, Zeng did not plead guilty but he had a more favourable subjective case. 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons, no question of direct parity arises but it is important that sentences be imposed that bear an appropriate proportion to the sentences imposed upon the others.” 
        
       
       
      The Criminal Code 
       
      
    16 Section 11.1 in Part 2.4 – Extensions of criminal responsibility – provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “11.1 Attempt 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) involves a person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         …” 
        
       
      
    17 Section 307.5 is contained within Division 307 – Import – export offences. It falls within subdivision (B) of that Part – Possessing unlawfully imported border controlled drugs or border controlled plants. Section 307.5 is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “307.5 Possessing commercial quantities of unlawfully imported border control drugs or border control drugs

    18 The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence under s.307.5(1) of the Criminal Code is life imprisonment or a fine of $825,000 or both.

    19 On 5 June 2006, a container arrived on a ship in Melbourne, having been sent from Canada. Customs officers in Melbourne detected over 1.29 million MDMA or ecstasy tablets concealed in the consignment of ink containers. Analysis revealed that the tablets comprised over 371 kilograms of MDMA. The pure MDMA was over 74 kilograms with an estimated street value between $38 million to $77 million. 
     
      
    20 The consignment was made of 180 cardboard boxes, each containing 20 litre plastic bottles of ink. A total of 67 of 180 ink containers had plastic bags of ecstasy within them. The Australian Federal Police Forensic Section substituted harmless tablets for the ecstasy and the consignment was then returned to the Melbourne docks. 
     
      
    21 On 8 June 2006, the shipping container was collected by an innocent agent and taken to a storage unit in Melbourne. The same agent received instructions whereby he unloaded the 180 boxes from the shipping container at the Melbourne storage unit and arranged for their transportation to a storage facility in Blacktown, Sydney. 
     
      
    22 On 28 June 2006, Cheun engaged the services of a courier driver, Huang, to collect the consignment from the Storage King facility at Blacktown. 
     
      
    23 The courier driver, Huang (who had no knowledge of the drugs), picked Cheun up outside a warehouse in Campsie and travelled to the Storage King at Blacktown. They there loaded Huang’s van with the specific number of boxes containing the tablets. 
     
      
    24 Huang was instructed initially by Cheun to return to the Campsie address to off-load the boxes. Cheun, however, changed his delivery instructions to Huang and eventually persuaded him to temporarily store the 65 boxes in Huang’s garage. 
     
      
    25 Events of 28 June 2006 were subject to police monitoring and surveillance. On 28 June 2006, Cheun telephoned Huang and advised him that other men were on their way to collect the boxes from his garage. 
     
      
    26 Police observed the respondent and Cheun arrive at Huang’s premises in the respondent’s truck. The boxes were removed from the garage and loaded onto the truck. Au travelled in his own car just ahead of the respondent’s truck. 
     
      
    27 After loading the boxes, police then followed the truck and Au’s vehicle to the respondent’s home in Yagoona where the boxes were unloaded into the respondent’s garage. Au and Cheun left in the early hours of 29 June 2006. The respondent remained at the house with the boxes. 
     
      
    28 The respondent left the house at about 6.00 am to go to work and returned at 1.00 pm. Au and Cheun then returned and the three men commenced to remove what they thought were ecstasy packages from the ink bottles. 
     
      
    29 A listening device was in place and recorded conversations in the garage between the three men during the process of removing the ecstasy packages. 
     
      
    30 It was the respondent who suggested that the men use post-it notes to keep a record of the number of tablets extracted from each bottle. He then left the premises to purchase some additional items needed to complete the extraction process. He was then arrested. 
     
      
    31 Inside the house and garage, police located 65 of the boxes from the original consignment. A total of five of the boxes had been opened. 
     
      
    32 The respondent participated in an interview with the Australian Federal Police. 
     
      
    33 The sentencing judge observed that it was apparent from the conversation in the garage that the respondent was a knowing participant in the enterprise and that he only intended to depart the premises temporarily in order to purchase some additional items that would assist with the unpacking and sorting of the tablets. 
     
      
    34 The Crown case, as the sentencing judge observed, was that the respondent was a knowing participant in what was anticipated to be the successful conclusion of a large drug importation. 
     
      
    35 The importation and concealment, the sentencing judge further observed, was “… sophisticated and executed with a great deal of patience and a large number of participants. The object of the enterprise was to have available in Australia an enormous number of ecstasy tablets worth a great deal of money …”. 
     
      
    36 The remarks on sentence record that, although the respondent was only involved for a short time before the police revealed their knowledge of the scheme, “… his role was integral and, but for the intervention of the authorities, would have resulted in the ecstasy being distributed …”. 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
      
    37 The Crown contended that the sentence imposed, a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of six years, was manifestly inadequate. Reliance was placed on the fact that the enterprise was a well-planned importation with the MDMA or ecstasy expertly concealed in containers of ink. This, it was said, involved a large investment of time and money and the involvement of many participations internationally and in Australia. 
     
      
    38 The Crown submitted that (paragraph 31 of the Crown’s written submissions):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the respondent’s contribution was critical at a time when difficulties had arisen in bringing the scheme to fruition. In association with Au and Cheun, he provided transportation, security of the boxes, a safe house where the lengthy and complicated extraction of the ecstasy tablets could be achieved and participated in that work. He was trusted with possession of the boxes until the extraction process could begin. He was trusted by Cheun and Au to leave the premises during the extraction process, apparently with no fear that he would expose them …” 
        
       
      
    39 The Crown observed in its submissions that the sentencing judge was satisfied that:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The respondent was not only aware of the content of the boxes during the time they were still in his home, but also that it was a large quantity of illegal drugs.  
       
       
      (2) That the respondent had been a knowing participant in the extraction process and was intending to continue his role but for the intervention of the police. 
       
      
    40 The sentencing judge had regard to the fact that the respondent had no relevant prior convictions and generally had been previously a person of good character. 
     
      
    41 The Crown emphasised that the offence involved over 74 kilograms of pure MDMA for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    42 In relation to the findings made, the Crown’s submissions stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “30. His Honour’s remarks on sentence commence at AB 253. His Honour found:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that this drug importation was in the worst case category (AB 260). In particular his Honour noted the large volume of tablets involved, their potential value to the importers and distributors and the potential harm to the Australian community;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) as to the Respondent’s role, his Honour found that Cheun and Au had roles in taking the drugs from a point of safety in Sydney and having them available for ultimate distribution – the offender was used by them in an important step in that process (AB 8); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the Respondent was willing to allow himself and his home to be used as an important link in the distribution process on 28 and 29 June 2006; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the process of extracting the drugs from the ink containers was a crucial one and the relative brevity of his involvement was not of great importance in the assessment of the objective gravity of his criminality; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) as to when the Respondent became aware that drugs were involved, his Honour noted the conflict in the Respondent’s evidence regarding the precise time and potential interpreting difficulties and found, in effect, that it was some time before the unloading of pills became  
          [sic] 
           in the early afternoon of 29 June; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) the listening device evidence clearly indicated that during the extraction process the Respondent was well aware that it was a significant quantity of illegally imported drugs involved (AB 9); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) there was nothing to indicate in the garage that the Respondent was unwilling and only involved because he had been imposed on by the other 2 men – he was not directing proceedings but was making suggestions to the others as the recovery of tablets continued (AB 10); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the Respondent was not aware of the precise amount of drugs involved but because of the $10,000 payment and the number of containers involved was aware that it was substantial; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) his Honour found that when leaving the garage before his arrest the Respondent intended to continued  
          [sic] 
           his involvement as he was purchasing items to help with the extraction process; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) the Respondent knew that illicit drugs were going to find there  
          [sic] 
           way into the community if the extraction process succeeded; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (k) it was an extremely serious criminal enterprise and while the Respondent’s role was subservient to others it was a critical role nonetheless; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (l) condign punishment should be imposed upon anyone having even the slightest role in an importation of these dimensions (AB 12). His Honour considered the comparative cases referred to during the sentence proceedings and the fact that no discount was available in this case for a plea of guilty or assistance to the authorities; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (m) because of the Respondent’s prior good character and the need for lengthy period of parole supervision his Honour set the non-parole period at the bottom of the range of 60% to 66%; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (n) his Honour considered the matters referred to in s.16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (o) his Honour also considered the subjective features of the Respondent in a detailed summary at AB 6 to 7.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 The Crown submitted (paragraph 35):- 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour referred to many of the relevant matters in his remarks on sentence but in the final sentence imposed, the Crown submits, that there does not appear to have been enough consideration of the need for deterrence. The sentence does not reflect either the objective seriousness nor the respondent’s culpability. His Honour identified the importation as falling into the worst case category in respect of the volume of drugs and the potential harm of the community. The respondent’s role was ‘critical’ and his relatively brief participation was not of great importance in fixing an appropriate sentence. His Honour found that the respondent was involved in the transportation, storage and extraction for distribution of the large quantity of MDMA tablets. His Honour found that the offender was involved for reasons of greed, rather than need …” 
        
       
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    44 It was contended for the respondent that it was significant that the sentencing judge found that the respondent had only become aware of the presence of the drug filled ink containers once he had returned to his house at or about lunchtime on 29 June 2006 when the extraction process had commenced. Emphasis was given to the times at which the respondent was involved in the storing and extraction of the drugs contending that his involvement in the entire project was limited to a period of approximately one hour. 
     
      
    45 The respondent’s submissions also emphasise the fact that the sentencing judge found that the respondent was an unwitting dupe. It was contended that the respondent’s involvement up to the time the extraction process commenced was no more culpable than that of the driver, Huang, who initially assisted in the removal from Blacktown of the stored boxes and who assisted Cheun by storing the boxes in his own garage. 
     
      
    46 It was further argued for the respondent that he only became aware of the contents of some of the boxes after 1.00 pm on 29 June 2006 and it was after that time that he was prepared to allow them to stay on his property for a period of time, probably no later than 5.00 pm on the same day. It was contended that the sentencing judge could not have found that the respondent was involved in the transportation, storage and extraction for distribution of a large quantity of MDMA tablets and that the finding must be limited to his involvement in the “extraction for distribution” and that that lesser involvement reflects a substantially diminished level of criminality. 
     
      
    47 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the findings of fact were consistent with the conclusion that the respondent’s involvement was “on the periphery and less than a courier”. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    48 It is apparent from the findings made by the sentencing judge, as summarised in paragraph 30 of the Crown’s submissions, they correctly identified the objective circumstances relating to the offence. The critical findings in that respect were those referred to in paragraphs 30(a), (c), (d), (f) and (i) as set out in the Crown’s submissions (paragraph 30). Further, it was not suggested by the Crown that the sentencing judge had failed to take account of any other relevant circumstance or that there had been any particular incorrect application of sentencing principles. 
     
      
    49 In that respect, it is a fundamental importance, as the High Court has observed, that with prosecution appeals where specific error of sentencing principle is not demonstrated and the complaint is one of manifest inadequacy of the sentence, it is only where it is shown that the “sentencing is definitely outside the appropriate range that (a court) is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence”: Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 306; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 340 to 341 and Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ and at 624 per Kirby J. 
     
      
    50 The joint judgment in Wong (supra) included the following observations (at pp.605 to 606):- 
     
      
       
        
        “So much is, or should be seen as, no more than a statement of elementary principle. If, however, further elucidation of the principle is necessary, it is evident in cases like  
        House v The King 
         … and the discussion of when an appellate court may conclude that a trial judge’s exercise of discretion has miscarried.  
        
       
       
        
        Reference is made in  
        House 
         to two kinds of error. First, there are cases of specific error of principle. Secondly, there is the residuary category of error which, in the field of sentencing appeals, is usually described as manifest excess or manifest inadequacy. In this second kind of case, appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases.  
        Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons. 
         It follows that for a court to state what  
        should  
        be the range within which some or all future exercises of discretion should fall, must carry with it a set of implicit or explicit assumptions about what is, or should be regarded as, the kind of case which would justify a sentence within the specified range. It is those assumptions that may reflect or embody relevant principle, not the result.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    51 The Crown relied upon Regina v Kevenaar (2004) 148 A Crim R 155, [2004] NSWCCA 210 (Hulme J, with who Simpson and Howie JJ agreed) and the judgment of Hulme J in Regina v Schofield (2003) 138 A Crim R 119, [2003] NSWCCA3 and the judgments in Regina v To (2007) 172 A Crim R 121, [2007] NSWCCA 200, Regina v Nguyen, Pham, Vu & To (2005) 157 A Crim R 80, [2005] NSWCCA 362, Regina v Moore [2005] NSWCCA 212 and Regina v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54. 
     
      
    52 However, as also stated by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong (supra):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Similarly, recording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are seen to be seen as the unifying principles which this disparate sentences may reveal …” 
        
       
      
    53 In Sukkar (supra), the importation of narcotic drugs in that case, namely, ecstasy tablets, was recorded as having a value of between $7.2 million and $12 million. 
     
      
    54 The appellant, Sukkar, was convicted on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of the ecstasy tablets and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 14 years and a non-parole period of nine years. The tablets had been concealed in 48 columns in a shipping containers which was transported in a ship from Belgium. 
     
      
    55 The appellant appealed against conviction and also sought leave to appeal against sentence. The Crown appealed against the leniency of the sentence. 
     
      
    56 The Crown case was that the appellant’s knowing concern was demonstrated by his participation in the unloading of the columns after they were delivered to premises in Sydney owned by him, in the examination of the columns and the sorting of tablets removed in a search for genuine ecstasy among the inert tablets. His involvement also included the making of extensive inquiries as to the whereabouts of the balance of the consignment which he, and his brothers, suspected had been stolen either by those involved at the European end of the shipment, or by associates who had been responsible for the clearance and initial delivery of the container into a warehouse in Brisbane. 
     
      
    57 The appellant in that case contended that he was innocently unaware of, and had no knowledge of, the importation until 1 December when his brothers came to him for advice, by which time, it was contended, the importation process had ended. The case involved 34.401 kilograms of pure ecstasy. He was arrested on 5 December 2003. 
     
      
    58 Wood CJ at CL, in dismissing the Crown appeal against sentence, observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “151. Upon my assessment, absent any evidence of the appellant having been knowingly concerned in the venture before 24 November, of him standing to gain any financial benefit from it, his objective criminality needed to be assessed upon the basis of the active assistance which he provided to his brothers, in permitting the cool room and tablets to remain on his premises, in assisting physically in the attempts to recover drugs from them, and in pursuing various inquiries aimed at discovering where the missing drugs were so as to retrieve them for his brothers.” 
        
       
      
    59 The Court, in Sukkar (supra), determined that his role was that of a knowing assistant to his brothers rather than as a principal, or accomplice, who expected monetary reward. It was emphasised that that was not to say that it was an insignificant role. By the time he had become deeply involved from 1 December, he clearly knew, it was held, that the venture was one of considerable substance, which potentially involved very large sums of money. Wood CJ at CL further observed (at [152]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… despite his prior good character, he became enthusiastically involved and his objective criminality was high, although not as high as that of those who stood to gain financially from it.” 
        
       
      
    60 In the present case, it was observed that the respondent had previously been a person of good character and had not been convicted of a previous criminal offence. The amount of drugs in the present case was almost double that in Sukkar (supra) and there are some similarities in the role performed by the appellant in Sukkar at least insofar as it involved the storage in premises controlled by him and his physically assistance in the attempts to recover the drugs similarly to the activity of the respondent in the present case.  
     
      
    61 On the findings in Sukkar (supra), the appellant had been involved in the enterprise from about 24 November through until just before his arrest. Accordingly, the period of time was approximately five days. This is in contrast to the respondent’s participation in the present proceedings of something less than a day. The Crown in oral submissions emphasised that one might readily infer that, but for the intervention of the police and the respondent’s arrest, he would have continued to participate in activities associated with the extraction of the drugs. That inference is certainly open although how long he would have continued cannot, of course, be precisely known. 
     
      
    62 The sentence has not, in my opinion, been established as one that is outside the appropriate range of sentences, having regard to all of the relevant objective and subjective circumstances which the sentencing judge identified and evaluated. His Honour’s later sentencing remarks in relation to the co-offenders, Cheun and Au, do not, of course, in themselves, provide or constitute a basis for determining whether the sentence imposed on the applicant fell inside or outside the relevant range of sentencing in his case. They, nonetheless, provide a context in which his criminality was assessed, by reference to this subservient and relatively short-lived role in contrast to that of his co-offenders. 
     
      
    63 Whilst the respondent’s role was similar to that of the appellant in Sukkar, in the respects earlier discussed (although not quite as extensive either in terms of the duration or scope of the participation), taking account of the quantity of pure MDMA (74 kilograms) involved in the consignment of ink containers delivered to the respondent’s premises, I do not consider that the Crown has established a basis for contending that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Technical error in the commencement date for the sentence 
       
      
    64 The respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of six years. The sentence was backdated so as to commence on 29 June 2006 with the non-parole period, accordingly, expiring on 28 June 2012 and the balance of term ending on 28 June 2016. 
     
      
    65 The sentencing judge stated that as the respondent had been in custody since his arrest on 29 June 2006, it was “appropriate” that his sentence be backdated to this date (Sentencing Remarks, p.13). 
     
      
    66 On appeal, the Crown submitted that in stipulating the commencement date for the sentence, the learned sentencing judge had “failed to take into account the fact that the respondent’s pre-sentence custody had been broken by a period on bail” (Crown Submissions on Appeal at [50]).  
     
      
    67 The Crown, in its written submissions, stated that the respondent had been released on bail for the period 9 January 2007 to 6 February 2007 (Crown Submissions on Appeal at [51]; see also transcript of sentencing proceedings before the District Court, 21 September 2007, at p.7). 
     
      
    68 In essence, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in backdating the sentence for a period equal to the period served in custody and the period for which the respondent was on bail. The Crown contended that the sentencing judge had made allowance for the respondent’s pre-sentence custody by way of backdating the sentence but that this allowance incorrectly included the time in which the respondent was on bail.  
     
      
    69 In order to remedy this oversight, the Crown submitted that this Court should re-sentence the respondent, backdating the sentence to commence on 6 February 2007 (this being the date that bail was revoked and the respondent was returned to custody) and “with the actual length of sentence reduced to reflect the six months 11 days of earlier custody”: Crown Submissions on Appeal at [51]. 
     
      
    70 The Crown’s submission that the respondent’s pre-sentence custody totalled six months and 11 days does not appear to be supported by the materials before this Court. The transcript of the sentencing proceedings before the District Court records the following exchange:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[CROWN]: Thank you, your Honour … Mr Zeng was arrested on 29 June. He was granted bail on 14 December 2006 but not released until 9 January 2007. A bail review occurred on 6 February 2007 and his bail was revoked.  
        So the additional information should be that he was not in custody from 9 January 2007 for about a month or a little over a month until 6 February 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s 28 days, so the sentence should date from 27 July 06. 
        
       
       
        
        CHAPPLE: As we understand it, it would date from the date of revocation, 6 February, but your Honour would take into account the fact that he was in custody from 29 June 2006 until 9 January 2007...” 
         (emphasis added): transcript of sentencing proceedings, 21 September 2007, at p. 7. 
        
       
      
    71 The written submissions of the Crown referred to only one short period of bail of 28 days.  
     
      
    72 On the basis of the respondent having been in custody from the date of his arrest, 29 June 2006, until the date of sentencing, 5 October 2007, except for the brief 28 days on bail, the respondent’s pre-sentence custody totals around 14 months and eight days.  
     
      
    73 In sentencing offenders for Commonwealth offences, s.16E(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) relevantly provide:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the law of a State or Territory relating to the commencement of sentences and of non-parole periods applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a federal offence in the same way as it applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a State or Territory offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where the law of a State or Territory has the effect that a sentence imposed on a person for an offence against the law of that State or Territory or a non-parole period fixed in respect of that sentence:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) may be reduced by the period that the person has been in custody for the offence; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) is to commence on the day on which the person was taken into custody for the offence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the law applies in the same way to a federal sentence imposed on a person in that State or Territory or to a non-parole period fixed in respect of that sentence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    74 In Assafiri v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 159 at [11], Howie J (with Basten JA and Grove J concurring) observed that courts exercising the sentencing discretion under s.16E(1) of the Commonwealth Act should adopt practices already established in respect of sentencing for State matters.  
     
      
    75 It is uncontroversial that a sentencing court must take into account the period served in pre-sentence custody where that period is referrable to the offence for which sentence is being passed: Regina v Newman (2004) 145 A Crim R 361, [2004] NSWCCA 102 at [24].  
     
      
    76 Where the offender has had a pre-sentence custody broken up by periods on bail, the sentencing court should preferably backdate the sentence for a period equal to the period served in custody: Assafiri v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 159 at [11]; Regina v Newman (2004) 145 A Crim R 361, [2004] NSWCCA 102 at [26] and [32]. The date to which a sentence should be backdated is not necessarily the date upon which the offender was returned to custody (after having had bail revoked). Rather, on this approach, it is the length of the pre-sentence custody that dictates the relevant commencement date. 
     
      
    77 I should observe that, whilst not the preferred approach, the sentencing court can simply state that the pre-sentence custody has been taken into account and then reduce the sentence accordingly: Regina v Newman (2004) 145 A Crim R 361, [2004] NSWCCA 102 at [26]. 
     
      
    78 The sentencing judge in the present matter, with respect, appropriately adopted the preferred backdating approach. However, in doing so there was a technical error in backdating the sentence to a period equal to the time spent in custody and the time during which the respondent was on bail.  
     
      
    79 It is necessary for this Court to correct the error by re-sentencing the respondent with the sentence to commence on 27 July 2006 (reflecting the approximate 14 months and eight days of pre-sentence custody), the effect of which will be to extend the respondent’s non-parole period by 28 days to allow for the period on which he was on bail. Accordingly, the non-parole period will expire on 26 July 2012 and not on 28 June 2012, which latter date marked the expiration of the non-parole period under the sentencing order made by the District Court. 
     
      
    80 Accordingly, the Crown appeal should be allowed, in part, in order for the technical error to which I have referred above to be corrected. 
     
      
    81 The orders I propose are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) That the appeal be allowed, in part. 
       
       
      (3) The respondent be re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of six years commencing on 27 July 2006 and expiring on 26 July 2012, and with the balance of the term ending on 26 July 2016. 
       
       
      (4) Accordingly, the first date upon which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole will be 26 July 2012.  
       
       
      (5) The appeal is otherwise dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    3 FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by His Honour Judge Williams on 1 June 2007 after he entered a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and after inviting his Honour to take into account one offence of possessing child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act, on a Form 1.  
     
      
    4 His Honour imposed a sentence of 18 months to commence from 1 June 2007 with a balance of term of 12 months. His Honour specified that the applicant was to be released to parole on 31 December 2008 with the balance of the term to expire on 31 December 2009. It is obvious that his Honour miscalculated the expiration dates of both the total sentence and the non-parole period having regard to the specified length of both the non-parole period and the balance of the term. Despite the fact that the Department of Corrective Services have apparently corrected the error in their custodial records, the Crown conceded that this Court should nevertheless intervene to the limited extent of specifying that the applicant is to be released on parole on the 30 November 2008 and that the total term should expire on 30 November 2009.  
     
      
    5 In fixing a non-parole period of 18 months against a term of 2 years and 6 months his Honour took into account, in the applicant’s favour, that it would be his first time in custody and that the sentence was likely to be served in some form of protection thereby justifying a departure from the statutory ratio otherwise fixed by s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour also properly recognised that the offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. While his Honour did not regard the offending as within the mid-range of objective seriousness, he regarded the fact that the legislature had provided a standard non-parole period as a reflection of community concern in regard to offending of the kind in question and, after taking into account the offence in the Form 1, that no other penalty other than a sentence of imprisonment could be justified.  
     
      
    Relevant facts 
     
      
    6 The agreed facts were shortly summarised in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. For the purposes of the application for leave to appeal it is sufficient that they are recited in the same terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence occurred on 21 November 2005, the victim being Mr M’s 12 year old son. Mr M separated from his wife and on that day the child was staying with Mr M. They slept in the same bed. At 4am the complainant woke and found Mr M touching his penis and testicles, having undone his boxer shorts. The complainant rolled away but could not sleep. The next morning he has told his mother.  
         
         
        When speaking to the police the complainant additionally said that he had seen pictures of young boys in Mr M’s computer. The computer was then seized. On three hard drives 2,346 picture images were found and 67 short films of child pornography involving young boys, many of the images being in the deleted files directory…” 
        
       
       
      
    The proceedings on sentence and his Honour’s findings 
     
      
    7 The applicant was represented by counsel in the sentence proceedings but appears on his own behalf in this Court.  
     
      
    8 The applicant did not give evidence on sentence but relied upon a report by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, and various testimonials provided by the applicant’s family and friends. His Honour also had available to him a victim impact statement, a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service and the offender’s criminal antecedents which recorded traffic offences related to his driving with a prescribed content of alcohol. Although his Honour appears to have wrongly counted the number of driving offences, he did not regard the criminal record as bearing relevantly upon the sentence to be imposed. Accordingly, it has no bearing on the challenge to the sentence that the applicant seeks to mount in this Court.  
     
      
    9 His Honour referred to the report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service in the context of considering the extent to which the applicant acknowledged responsibility for his criminal offending with a view to his Honour assessing the applicant’s willingness to engage in offence-specific treatment in a sex offenders program in custody. He expressed concern at the applicant’s inadequate level of disclosure, not only in regards to the indecent assault on his son but his possession of significant quantities of child pornography. His Honour also set out in a summary form what he considered to be the relevant matters in Dr Westmore’s lengthy report. He emphasised, in particular, the explanation the applicant offered for the assault on his son and his possession of the child pornography, again as an indication of his preparedness to acknowledge and accept the extent of his offending. In that regard his Honour noted that the applicant claimed that when he touched his son’s genitals he was intent on treating what he considered to be a problem with his son’s foreskin and that he decided to examine it when his son was sleeping with him in order to save the young boy from embarrassment. He denied that his actions were sexually motivated. In regards to his possession of the child pornography, he claimed that the images were for comparative purposes so as to better understand his son’s condition and not for his own sexual stimulation. Against that background Dr Westmore noted:  
     
      
       
        
        “…I am not in a position to dispute the voracity of his account and in the absence of any other relevant history while his account is unusual I am unable to diagnose him as having a psycho-sexual disturbance.... Again, based on the reliability of his history his risks of re-offending are probably low to non-existent. It is likely he had been significantly stressed by the charges against him and that of itself will act as a powerful deterrent toward any further inappropriate sexual behaviour towards his children.”  
        
       
      
    10 The sentencing judge, noting that the applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings, concluded that he was unable to accept the account the applicant gave to Dr Westmore. The applicant challenges that finding. In that connection I note that the officer who prepared the pre-sentence report also regarded the offender’s account of his behaviour as highly implausible, a view it would seem that also commended itself to his Honour.  11 Although his Honour rejected the applicant’s explanation he did not find that the offending could properly be classified as being within the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour did, however, regard the moral culpability of the offence on indictment as serious given that the victim was the applicant’s son. On the other hand, his Honour gave the applicant the benefit of a finding that since he has been otherwise a good parent some leniency would be afforded him.  
     
      
    12 In addition, and despite the fact that his Honour considered that the issue of re-offending, rehabilitation and remorse had been only equivocally resolved having regard to both the pre-sentence report and Dr Westmore’s report, he accepted that the applicant was a person of good character. He noted that he was aged 45 at the date of sentence and was the youngest of three children who had been brought up in a harmonious family setting. He married in 1990 and has three children ranging in age from 16 to 12 with the victim of the offence being the middle child. The marriage dissolved in 1999 after a year’s separation. At the time of sentence he was in a new relationship which was stable and supportive. His Honour also noted that the applicant had been in continuous employment although was at the time of sentence on stress leave, the result of attending an unrelated traffic fatality the previous year.  
     
      
    The grounds  
     
      
    13 The applicant relies on a number of matters which he claims his Honour either failed to give adequate weight to in the calculation of sentence, or wrongly took into account in calculation of sentence such as to justify this court imposing a lesser penalty. 14 He claims he has been recently diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, namely Asperger’s Syndrome, and that this provides an explanation for his criminal behaviour. There is no evidence of any kind verifying that the applicant suffers from that condition. In fact it appears as if the condition is self-diagnosed. I note that despite Dr. Westmore’s recitation of the applicant’s medical history, family history and personal history, and a focused mental state examination, he did not diagnose the applicant as suffering from a psychiatric condition of any kind. In circumstances where there is nothing even remotely substantiating the applicant’s claim that he suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome, I do not regard his claim as having any bearing on the sentence imposed at first instance or on this appeal.  
     
      
    15 The applicant next complains that the victim impact statement was incorrect in a particular respect, namely the claim by the young boy that his grandparents do not believe him, reflected by the fact that he does not receive their telephone calls or Christmas gifts in contrast to his siblings, and further that this is hurtful because he feels mistreated by them. The error is said to be revealed in a statement from the child’s grandmother to the effect that she has made repeated attempts to make contact with her grandchildren, including the victim, and to send them presents. She considers that these attempts are being frustrated deliberately by applicant’s former wife. This, it is said by the applicant, should render the victim impact statement an unreliable source of information for the sentencing court.  
     
      
    16 His Honour set out the victim impact statement in full and concluded that the boy had suffered significantly from his father’s offending. This was a conclusion open to him quite independent of the boy’s claim to feel alienated from his grandparents, and irrespective of whether that is the true position or not. I am not satisfied that his Honour gave unnecessary emphasis to the victim impact statement or that it was unduly weighted in sentencing terms. 17 The applicant complains that the pre-sentence report did not reflect the entirety of the interview with the Probation and Parole officer. This is to be expected when the reason a sentencing judge orders a pre-sentence report is to receive the insights of the Probation and Parole Service, not a verbatim account of the course of interview with an offender. The applicant also complains that his Honour deliberately skewed the content of the report so as to reflect negatively on him because his Honour did not give sufficient weight to that part of the report where the officer considered that the applicant did not display any significant issues of sexual deviancy. The weight to be given to the reports of both the Probation and Parole Service and Dr Westmore were matters for his Honour’s assessment. I do not consider that he has given undue weight to the opinions expressed in the reports or to have failed, in any material respect, to fairly reflect the reported findings in his reasons for sentence.  
     
      
    18 As I have already emphasised, in circumstances where the applicant neither gave evidence in the sentence proceedings nor objected to the tender of the pre-sentence report, his Honour’s rejection of the applicant’s explanation for his offending (which I note has some resemblance to an attempt to traverse his plea) was a finding well open to him and in no way reflective of error. I note that in the applicant’s oral submissions to this Court he attempted to explain his criminal offending innocently by way of various unconvincing analogies but did not submit that his behaviour was anything other than criminal, a clear concession that is reflected in the plea of guilty and his express request that his Honour take into account the equally serious offending constituted by the offence on the Form 1.  
     
      
    19 In his written submissions the applicant complained that his Honour did not approach the offence in the Form 1 in the way mandated by Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. In support of that submission he extracted the following passage which appears at [9]:  
     
      
       
        
        “5. A sentencing court should normally specify the increase in penalty flowing from the taking into account of an offence or offences on a Form 1. Ordinarily a sentencing court should indicate whether or not a significant discount has been accorded because of the use of the Form 1 procedure but need not ordinarily specify more precisely the size of the discount.""  
        
       
      
    20 Reference to the judgment reveals that this extract was one of the eight guidelines proposed by the Attorney General which the Court did not adopt (see [44] and [45]). I am satisfied that his Honour’s approach to the offence on the Form 1 was in accordance with the guideline judgment. Whilst he was unaware of the precise nature of the images, he regarded their very considerable number, together with the existence of an equally considerable number of short films, as revealing a serious level of offending over a period of time which of itself warranted a sentence of full-time imprisonment. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…The collection of such material is likely to encourage those who are actively involved in corrupting the children involved in the sexual activities depicted and who recruit and use those children for the purpose of recording and distributing the results. The offence of possessing child pornography cannot be characterised as a victimless crime. The children in the end are the victims, see  
        R v Jones 
         (1999) 108 A Crim R at p.50…” 
        
       
      
    21 He considered that an appropriate penalty, reflecting the totality of the offending constituted by the indecent assault and the possession of child pornography, was one of 3 years imprisonment which he reduced to 2 years and 6 months for the plea of guilty. For my part, I can discern no error in his Honour approach or in the result. Orders22 The orders I propose are:

      2008/5871 R v JOHN WILLIAM MILLINGTON 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 21 September 2007 John William Millington was charged with the murder of Hille-Heidrun Ellicott. On 20 September 2007 the deceased was found by her husband in the family home at Maitland having sustained fatal gun shot wounds to her chest and head.  
     
      
    2 On 3 June 2008, with the consent of the Crown, Mr Millington's trial was set down without a jury pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    3 On 1 August 2008 he was arraigned before me and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Hille-Heidrun Ellicott on the grounds of mental illness as provided for in s 22 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the “Mental Health Act”).  
     
      
    4 The sole issue in the trial before me was whether I was satisfied he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health Act. No oral evidence was called in the proceedings by either the Crown or Mr Millington.  
     
      
    5 By consent and without objection their respective cases were the subject of the joint documentary tender of a volume of material comprising the statements of investigating police, including a recorded interview with Mr Millington conducted on 21 September 2007, various forensic and scientific evidence and statements from family members and friends of Mr Millington and the deceased. Given the nature of the proceedings, however, the critical documents were the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 4 March 2008 and 24 July 2008, tendered on behalf of Mr Millington, and the report of Dr Greg Steele dated 29 May 2008, tendered on the Crown's behalf. 
     
      
    6 These reports reflect a uniformity of opinion that when Mr Millington shot and killed the deceased, he was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour.  
     
      
    7 Consequently, as provided for in s 38 of the Mental Health Act, I found him not guilty of the murder of Hille-Heidrun Ellicott by reason of mental illness and ordered his detention at the Parklea Correctional Centre, or such other place as he may be detained in accordance with Part 5 Division B of the Mental Health Act until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    8 After entering the verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, I indicated that I would publish reasons in support of that finding. The balance of this judgment constitutes those reasons. 
     
      
    The events of 20 September 2007 
     
      
    9 According to the account Mr Millington gave to police when he voluntarily presented at the Maitland Police Station on 21 September 2007 and admitted to shooting the deceased earlier that evening, he had returned to Maitland from Dunedoo in Queensland earlier that day. He had apparently been residing in Queensland for a few months as was his pattern over some years. A short time after his arrival, he decided to retrieve a rifle which he bought a year earlier for the express purpose of killing the deceased and her husband, and which he had hidden in the ceiling of a shed where he had been residing before leaving for Queensland, in order to see whether it was still in functioning order. After confirming that it was he drove to the deceased’s home, with the loaded rifle with the intention of killing either the deceased’s husband, Raymond Ellicott, or the deceased, and then hanging himself. He drove past the Ellicott’s house and parked his car close by. He entered the house through the back door using the key which the Ellicotts were known to leave in the door, and believing no one was at home, waited for approximately ten to fifteen minutes for them to arrive.  
     
      
    10 Mr Millington was not aware that Mr Ellicott was asleep in the master bedroom. The deceased was at the Maitland Public School Concert which was being held at the Maitland Town Hall. When she arrived home she apparently did not notice Mr Millington despite passing within a short distance of where he was standing. However, on noticing him, according to Mr Millington, she walked up to him and said “Hello”. He did not respond but aimed and fired the rifle striking her in the chest. The force of the gunshot threw her onto her back. Believing that the shot was not fatal, he then shot her a second time, this time in the head. He then dragged her away from the back door and into the dining room and left through the back door.  
     
      
    11 On realising that he was not wearing gloves and that he would have left his fingerprints within the house, he panicked and tried to re-enter the house by smashing through a glass panel adjacent to the back door. Once inside the house he wiped down the walls with his Drizabone coat and then left a second time.12 Mr Millington then drove to a neighbouring town where he left the rifle lying in grass near a bridge. He scattered the remaining bullets nearby. A 30-30 Winchester lever action rifle and three rounds of ammunition were located by police at this location on the morning of 21 September 2007. A ballistics examination of the weapon, and a comparison with the shells recovered at the deceased’s home, confirmed that this was the murder weapon.  
     
      
    13 After abandoning the rifle and the ammunition Mr Millington told police he smoked some marijuana in order to try and calm down and then lay in his truck for some time before he drove to the Maitland Police Station where he confessed to the murder. Before being formally interviewed, but after indicating that he wanted to confess to the deceased’s murder, he gave this account to police as to his motives for the killing:  
     
      
       
        
        “I’ve known them since I was 14 years old. They have abused me, mentally tortured you know. Ray always said to me what do you do with your enemies? Make them your best friend. That’s what he said. Ray has done this to me for years. Hille did it too. They always run me down. They were always putting me down. My mum and dad too. They abused me like that all the time. This abuse went on for years."" 
        
       
      
    14 He went on to give an account of the Ellicotts feeding him putrefied food of various forms and detailed, in explicit terms, firing the rifle at the deceased at close range to her chest and then her head. He then provided police with a diagram as to where he had deposited the rifle and ammunition and informed police that the clothes he was wearing were the clothes he was wearing when he committed the murder except for a Drizabone coat which he had hung in the shower at his home because it had blood on it. 
     
      
    15 I pause to emphasise that there is absolutely no substance or foundation of any kind for Mr Millington having suffered any mistreatment at the hands of either the deceased or her husband. To the contrary, there is abundant evidence that in their dealings with him as a young adolescent, and for some years thereafter, they were caring and generous people who provided sustenance, shelter and support for him in their home. As will be apparent from the assessments of both Dr Nielssen and Dr Steele, to which I will refer later, Mr Millington’s delusional beliefs for a period of time leading up to the murder, at the time of the murder and to a lesser extent, still present today, source from a recognised and entrenched mental illness from which he suffers. 16 After speaking with the police informally in the way I have summarised, Mr Millington participated in a lengthy and formally recorded interview where he gave a further explanation for why he killed the deceased and a detailed account of his thoughts and actions immediately before, during and after the shooting.  
     
      
    17 Having viewed the recorded interview at counsel’s invitation, and giving full weight to the expert views of the forensic psychiatrists who have also reviewed it as part of their assessment of Mr Millington for the purposes of these proceedings, I am left in no doubt that he was in a floridly psychotic state on the night of 20 September 2007 despite being capable of reliably recounting the events of the evening and openly confessing to a murder.  
     
      
    Mr Millington’s relationship with the deceased18 The deceased, Hille-Heidrun Ellicott, was 65 years of age and resided at her matrimonial home at Maitland at the time of the murder. She had lived at this address with her husband, Raymond Ellicott, for the past 45 years. The deceased and her husband had four children.  
     
      
    19 Mr Millington was 42 years of age at the time of the offence. Up until a few months prior to September 2007 he resided in Maitland with his parents and his son.  
     
      
    20 According to the statements of his sisters, Ms Wendy Franklin and Ms Carolyn Wells, Mr Millington moved out of their family home at about the age of 14, and went to live with the Ellicott family. This was coincident with him leaving school and, it would appear, coincident with him coming into conflict with his parents as a result of what his sister described as a lifestyle which “was not in tune with the rest of the family”. Apparently his parents did not drink or smoke and Mr Millington constantly rebelled against the discipline his parents sought to impose on him. This was a source of conflict in the family and provides the context in which he left home, and became included as an extra member of the Ellicott’s household.  
     
      
    21 Ray Ellicott described Mr Millington as a young boy playing with his four sons and progressively becoming included as one of the family to the point where he effectively moved in, camping out in the shed. He said he even gave him pocket money when he went to town with his sons. After Mr Millington left school Mr Ellicott employed him as a grave-digger in the district. He could not recall any enmity of any kind in the course of employing him or otherwise. 22 Mr Millington started smoking cannabis from about age 14. His drug use escalated uninterrupted from that time and has graduated to include the regular use of amphetamines from about age 19 which intensified during a relationship with a woman in late 1989 when his dependence on the drug required intervention. The concerted efforts of members of his family to have him admitted to a rehabilitation centre failed, as did his own attempts to address his poly-substance abuse and commit to a course of residence-based rehabilitation. It would appear that he also regularly abused alcohol, drinking on a daily basis and on regular occasions in copious quantities. 23 Mr Millington has worked in a number of jobs after moving in with the Ellicotts and working with Mr Ellicott as a grave-digger. He then left Maitland and in about 1985 he worked as a fisherman on a trawler at South West Rocks. Before returning to his parents’ home he commenced working in his father’s bee-keeping business in Thargomindah, Queensland. While he was regarded as a hard worker, he had a reputation as a loner and a drug user. In 2002 a fellow apiarist was concerned enough about what he described as Mr Millington’s strange behaviour that he contacted Mr Millington’s family. Mr Millington was later flown by the Royal Flying Doctor Service from Thargomindah to Toowoomba Hospital where he was diagnosed with a drug-induced psychosis. I will return to consider the results of that hospital admission when dealing with Mr Millington’s psychiatric profile. 24 I have already referred to the evidence of Ray Ellicott to the effect that Mr Millington was regarded as “one of the family”. He went on to say that the deceased cared for him “like he was her own son”. Mr Millington's sisters also confirmed their understanding that the deceased had maternal feelings for their brother, particularly during the years when he resided with her and her husband and sons, and that their brother, as a teenager, had expressed affection and respect for Mrs Ellicott. 
     
      
    25 It appears however that since the mid 1980’s Mr Millington was not in regular contact with any member of the Ellicott family having drifted away from the district and having been, to an extent, reunited with his own family. Mr Ellicott’s last recollection of spending time with him was some time in 1999 or 2000 when they met accidentally in the Metropolitan Hotel in Maitland. According to Mr Ellicott, Mr Millington did not seem to hold any animosity towards him or his wife, as they drank together and spoke casually about their lives. Although Mr Millington gave a strikingly different impression of that meeting, again quite clearly explained by his illness, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Millington had any contact with Mrs Ellicott for a considerable number of years before September 2007.Mr Millington's mental health 
     
      
    26 It would appear that issues relating to Mr Millington’s mental health first surfaced in 2001-2002 when, according to his sister, Ms Franklin, he seemed to her to suffer a mental breakdown. As I have already noted, in May 2002 he was flown by the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Toowoomba Hospital where he was diagnosed with a drug-induced psychosis.  
     
      
    27 Following his release, according to his sister, Mr Millington expressed a range of paranoid beliefs, including that he was wanted by the police, that he was being followed, that his car was implanted with a tracking device and that the fuel and oil in his petrol tank had been tampered with. On one occasion, when he agreed to meet with his sister, he issued her with very specific instructions that she must park within 27 steps of the intersection. On that occasion he arrived wearing sunglasses and with a hood over his head despite the fact that it was evening. In June 2002, upon being urged by his sister and his parents to seek help, Mr Millington checked into the psychiatric unit of the Maitland Hospital. The hospital notes record that he presented in a psychotic state. 
     
      
    28 From 2002 up to the commission of the offence in September 2007 Mr Millington was admitted to various hospitals in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. The admission in the ACT was as a result of Mr Millington presenting himself to police complaining that he was being followed. He was admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act but absconded from the ward.  
     
      
    29 According to Dr Nielssen’s report he spent ten days at the James Fletcher Hospital near Maitland between 13 April 2004 and 23 April 2004 after developing a belief that the woman he was living with at the time was secretly filming him. 30 Mr Millington was again presented to hospital in June and July 2006 following the self-amputation of his right ring finger. He remained hospitalised for three weeks. He told doctors that he cut his finger off with an angle grinder in order to make amends to his sister whom he felt he had wronged in some way and to indicate to his family how sorry he was for his behaviour. During that admission it would appear that he voiced, for the first time, his beliefs and suspicions about the Ellicotts as well as his desire to kill them. During one hospital visit from his sister Mr Millington stated that Ray Ellicott ruined his life, got him to use drugs, and fed him undigested peas and corn they retrieved from their faeces. Mr Millington also told his sister that the hospital staff told him that if he wanted to be released from hospital he had to stop saying that he wanted to murder Mr and Mrs Ellicott. He was released back into his parents’ care. It would appear that with their best intentions and the commitment of his sisters that he was difficult to manage and resistant to medical treatment.31 In October 2006 Mr Millington was again admitted to hospital. On this admission a Community Treatment Order was imposed which continued until 17 April 2007. Pursuant to this order Mr Millington received injections of an antipsychotic medication, intended to address his illness. The Community Treatment Order was renewed to take effect from 17 April 2007, however he voluntarily moved to Queensland and his treatment was discontinued. Dr Nielssen also noted that the Hunter Valley Mental Health records reveal that Mr Millington was receiving injections of a relatively low dose of an antipsychotic medication by injection fortnightly and orally on a daily basis at this time (and it would seem intermittently in the past although he was apparently not always compliant with this regime). The last injection was given in May 2007.  
     
      
    Psychiatric assessments for the purposes of trial 32 On 7 December 2007, at the request of Mr Millington’s legal representatives, Dr Olav Nielssen interviewed him on the question of his fitness to enter a plea to the charge of murder. During the course of that interview he denied being mentally ill or experiencing symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as experiencing visual or auditory hallucinations, believing that his thoughts were being broadcast or being able to communicate by telepathy. Dr Nielssen found his responses inconsistent with the statements he made at other times during the interview, and at stark variance with his various hospital admissions and the information supplied by his family.33 When asked about the offence Mr Millington informed Dr Nielssen that “there were reasons I did it…it goes back a long way…it took me 25 years to work out what was going on”. He further stated, “I didn’t intend to murder her… I was there to murder Ray… I’m sorry I shot Hille even though she was in on it.” He told Dr Nielssen that “I didn’t realise he was feeding me shit on hamburgers… he thought it was a big joke. They cut a cancerous growth off a dead man and fed it to me.” According to Mr Millington, Mr Ellicott had a “master plan” pursuant to which he, Mr Millington, would commit suicide. He also told Dr Nielssen that on the last occasion that he met with Mr Ellicott at the Maitland Hotel in 1999 or 2000, Mr Ellicott said strange things to him after which he worked out Mr Ellicott’s master plan.  
     
      
    34 Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Millington with chronic schizophrenia of a paranoid type together with a substance abuse disorder and, in light of Mr Millington’s denial of having a mental illness or appreciation for what he has done, deemed him unfit for trial. This report was served on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP). 
     
      
    35 On 29 May 2008, Mr Millington was interviewed by Dr Greg Steele at the request of the ODPP. He was asked to address the question of whether Mr Millington was fit to be tried and, if so, whether the defence of mental illness under the Mental Health Act was available to him. During that interview Dr Steele found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s mood was an amalgam of boredom with gaol, apprehension about the future, regret, and remorse for the crime he had committed and he was particularly sorry that Hille Ellicott had suffered the way she did, but was also appropriately castigating himself for his own behaviour”. 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Millington also readily admitted to shooting Hille Ellicott, but said that he was insane at the time for having the beliefs he had about her and Ray Ellicott. 
     
      
    37 In Dr Steele’s view Mr Millington was fit to be tried, a view with which Dr Nielssen, in a later report, did not disagree.  
     
      
    38 That said, as I have made clear, both doctors were of the independent but shared view that Mr Millington had available to him a defence of mental illness under the Mental Health Act. On that basis I found Mr Millington to not be criminally responsible for the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    39 In Dr Nielssen’s view the diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is firmly based on Mr Millington’s presentation at interview, his fixed delusional beliefs regarding the Ellicotts, corroborative information from medical records and his sister’s observation of his symptoms since 2001. In doctor’s view, the diagnosis of a substance abuse disorder as a secondary diagnosis is based on Mr Millington’s account of hazardous drinking and long standing abuse of drugs well recognised in the literature as having harmful psychological effects. According to Dr Nielssen, as part of his chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness in the 12 months or so preceding the shooting, he developed delusional beliefs that Mr and Mrs Ellicott were involved in a conspiracy lasting almost 30 years which had as its aim both to motivate him to commit suicide but also to “set him up so that others would hate him”. This delusional belief, which was held with strong conviction, eventually compelled Mr Millington to act on these beliefs because of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Whilst he was aware of the nature and quality of his act in firing the rifle at the deceased at close range, as a result of his fixed delusional belief and impaired capacity for logical thinking, he was unable to recognise that his actions were wrong. 40 Whilst noting a good response to antipsychotic treatment and an improvement in his mental health, Dr Steele was of the view that a number of Mr Millington's delusional beliefs were not amenable to psychotropic medication. He also diagnosed him as suffering from a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness. Thus it would appear that because this is the first time in Mr Millington's psychiatric history that he has been drug free, adequately medicated and his behaviour controlled because of the custodial environment in which he is housed, he has a growing insight into the fact that he has a mental illness and that his mental illness will benefit from medication. While he also regards himself as having been mentally unsound at the time he committed the offence he still harbours the belief that the Ellicotts had conspired against him. Dr Steele reports that the conviction with which he holds those beliefs has reduced but a number of delusional beliefs have not as yet proved amenable to psychotropic medication. For that reason he is likely to be treated as a forensic patient in the foreseeable future.  
     
      
    41 I well appreciate that these remarks do little to ameliorate the unimaginable grief that the Ellicott family has suffered as a result of the senseless death of a beloved wife, mother and grandmother. I accept that anger and even a desire for revenge may surface from time to time. Were Mr Millington to have been responsible as a matter of law for his conduct on the night of 20 September 2007 he would have been punished as a criminal offender. However, because of his mental state at the time he discharged the rifle, and because in our system of justice only the mentally sound are punished, he will instead be subject to the control of a tribunal constituted under the Mental Health Act, a body that is charged with the statutory task of seeking to achieve a balance between an individual’s right to treatment, protection and care when they suffer from mental illness, and the interests and rights of the community to safety and protection.  
     
      
    42 In the special facts of this case that is the way that I am satisfied that justice has been done under the law.

      JUDGMENT - On application by accused Baladjam 
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) Motion to exclude evidence of items found during execution of search warrant 
           
          
         
        
       
       
       (b) Application for further particulars 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application brought on behalf of Omar Baladjam. Mr Buscombe and Mr Pontello represent the accused. Counsel have provided the Court with written submissions, copy authorities and other material. There are two aspects to the present application. They are quite separate and may be dealt with separately. 
     
      
       
       
       
      First order sought 
       
      
    2 Mr Buscombe seeks to have excluded from the evidence to be led at trial five partially burnt pieces of paper that were located in a baby's bag situated in the lounge room of 1 Merriwa Street, Hoxton Park. These items were found during the course of the execution of a search warrant carried out on 8 November 2005 at Mr Baladjam's house. Mr Baladjam was not there at the time.  
     
      
    3 Mr Buscombe frankly conceded that three of the pieces of paper have an unusual flavour about them in relation to their contents. Nevertheless, he submitted that it was simply impossible to infer that the pages amounted to directions to do something consistent with the alleged conspiratorial agreement.  
     
      
    4 In my view, the material is relevant to facts at issue in the trial. I have in an earlier decision given today set out a repetition of the principles that apply in relation to both the tests of relevance and admissibility. The subject material satisfies me as to its relevance and, as there is no basis demonstrated for its exclusion, it is admissible.  
     
      
    5 There is material before the Court to show that a document examiner, Raymond Salmon, would be able to suggest at trial that two of the pages (Q 2 and Q 3) contain handwritten entries made by Mr Baladjam. This extends also to a third page, Q 6. The examiner was not able to form any conclusive view about Q 5, this being a page that has mainly figures and numbers on it. Similarly, there is writing on page Q 3 which the examiner was able to suggest may have been written by Mr Baladjam's wife, Maryam.  
     
      
    6 There is no need for me to set out the full details of the documents in this decision, a few examples will suffice. Q 2 appears to be a written instruction from Mr Baladjam to his wife as to how she is to behave when she goes to the Neeta Shopping Centre at Fairfield. The instructions contain the following (which gives the appropriate flavour): 
     
      
       
        
        “Drive up and down everywhere until you see Abdullah's bike (silver).  
        
       
       
        
        You'll see him parked in a spot. 
        
       
       
        
        Then stop - he'll pull out of the spot and you reverse in.  
        
       
       
        
        Unlock the boot, leave the key in...take the kids into Neeta Shopping Centre and buy something.  
        
       
       
        
        (You need to have a cover story as to why your there and what your buying. It may be something that you can't buy from around here like perhaps a top or skirt. You don't have to actually buy anything. Just pop into a shop as though that's the reason your there. Just in case your followed.)” 
        
       
      
    7 The instructions continue on Q 3 and contain the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “If your being followed 100 percent then leave your headlights on when you enter the car park, but don't stop at us, just keep going around.” 
        
       
      
    8 This page concludes: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now you write what you are to do.” 
        
       
      
    9 There is a diagram of this car showing where the car is to be driven and where it is to wait. It also shows the headlights on. Mr Baladjam's wife apparently has written on this page: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can I get in from here. When I reverse in the space, will he be waiting near his bike at another spot or near me and kids? They'll say 'Oh, that looks like Uncle Abdullah's.'“ 
        
       
      
    10 On page Q 4 there appears to be handwritten entries by Mr Baladjam's wife repeating in her own words the instructions she has been given. It finishes: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pretend to drop handbag near wheel to pick up the key - not obvious. 
        
       
       
        
        Get in, go home.” 
        
       
      
    11 Q5 is a sheet mainly with calculations and figures on it. It includes a reference to ""bags"" and ""pipes"". The final document (Q6) is headed ""lose my tails"" and appears to be in the nature of a ""to do"" list although what the ""stuff"" is that is referred to in several places on the page is not made clear.  
     
      
    12 The Crown accepts that it cannot precisely prove from the documents itself the ultimate task set by the instructions given by Mr Baladjam to his wife. I accept the Crown submission that it is not necessary that this be manifest from the documents. It may be that they are instructions related to Mr Baladjam's wife purchasing something secretly. It may be that the purchase had been made by Mr Baladjam and was to be secreted into the car while his wife was shopping. There may have been other activities of a covert nature contemplated by the instructions.  
     
      
    13 The Crown case makes it clear, in a very detailed fashion, that at trial will be a significant number of activities engaged in by Baladjam that are said to be in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. Secondly, there will be evidence of a number of actions carried out by Baladjam which allegedly reflect covert behaviour in an endeavour to avoid surveillance. These include, for example, his activities on 22 September 2005 at Pendle Hill (CCS paras 200 and 202). There are examples of Baladjam warning others about surveillance (CCS para 305). Indeed, when he was arrested there was a notebook in his backpack which had the registration numbers of cars which had been carrying out surveillance on him (CCS 364). There were also a considerable number of instances where, according to the Crown case, Baladjam was using a code which in reality related to the covert purchase of items in connection with the conspiracy.  
     
      
    14 The Crown case does not assert that Mr Baladjam's wife is a conspirator. The Crown case, however, does include a paragraph (CCS 348) where it is alleged that she has purchased “end caps” in early November 2005. The Crown case suggests that material of this kind was being sought by Baladjam and others at the time to conceal and secrete ammunition and other items acquired in connection with the conspiracy.  
     
      
    15 In my opinion, the Crown is entitled to go to the jury on the basis that the handwritten material is relevant as part of its circumstantial case from which, together with other material in the Crown case, an inference can be drawn that covert activities were being directed by Baladjam in connection with the conspiracy. This is so even where the Crown cannot precisely identify what the subject matter of the covert instructions was. At the very least the material is relevant to place alongside other material in the Crown case to rebut a suggestion that other activities of Baladjam were innocent and had nothing to do with the alleged conspiracy.  
     
      
    16 Q 5 may also go before the jury on the basis that it relates in some way to the secretion of weapons in a pipe or pipes. Q 6 is very opaque, as the Crown concedes, but, again, it may be seen as a ""to do"" list in connection, in a non-specific way, with the conspiracy.  
     
      
    17 With all due respect, I do not accept Mr Buscombe's submission that the Crown must identify precisely the relationship of any document found in the possession of the accused with a precisely identified and specific aspect of the conspiracy revealed in its full colour by material within the document or item itself. The pages, burnt and partly destroyed, are plainly relevant to the Crown circumstantial case and to the defence likely to be raised by Mr Baladjam. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Second order sought 
       
      
    18 Mr Buscombe has filed by leave a notice of motion dated 21 July 2008. In it, the following order is sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown, within 14 days, advise the legal representatives of the accused Mr Baladjam whether it alleges that any or all of the following persons were members of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment: Talal Hamdan, Youseff Rahman, Bilal Awad, Rodney Avioni and Daniel Baladjam.” 
        
       
      
    19 On 12 May 2008, Mr Baladjam's legal representatives had written to the Crown requesting that they be informed whether any of those persons were involved in the conspiracy. The Crown replied on 26 May 2008 indicating that, in its view, the Crown was not required to identify those persons who may or may not fall into the category of unnamed co-conspirators. Where persons other than the accused had been identified by name, and their actions detailed, the Crown, it was submitted, was not further obliged to categorise their role.  
     
      
    20 This correspondence sufficiently identifies the dispute between the parties. Mr Buscombe placed particular reliance on the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Danny Mok (1987) 27 A Crim R 438. In that case, the appellant and the accused were jointly tried on a charge of conspiring ""with each other and with divers other persons"" to supply heroin. Particulars of the alleged conspiracy were not supplied prior to the trial, nor was the precise membership of the conspiracy identified by the Prosecutor in his opening address. It appeared, however, that the Crown was essentially relying on a conspiracy between the appellant and one accused only. There was evidence of participation by a third person, but in terms which related to a two-person conspiracy. However, when it came to closing address, the Prosecutor purported to rely upon a three-person conspiracy involving the identified third person. (There was in fact a substantial difference between the two conspiracies, and this may well have called for different defences.) The trial judge, over objection, left “the three-person conspiracy” to the jury as the Crown case.  
     
      
    21 The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial had miscarried and that a new trial should be ordered. The Court held that the Crown should identify with precision the transaction upon which it relies. The accused “should be informed of the overt acts alleged as well as the legal nature of the charge and the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge”. The appellant had been denied the right to particulars of the charge against him. At 441-442 Hunt J, with whom McInerney and Allen JJ agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a conspiracy case, each accused is entitled to precise particulars of the persons with whom it is going to be alleged that he conspired and as to the specific scope of the conspiracy alleged. Even where particulars are not sought, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the Crown Prosecutor to give those particulars in the course of his opening address - at the latest. He is not entitled simply to open the overt acts of which particulars have been given, leaving it to the end of the evidence to select from that evidence the conspiracy which seems to be the strongest. The trial judge and the accused are left in an impossible position if the precise nature of the Crown case is not made clear from the beginning of the trial. The present case is a very good example of the sorry consequences of the Crown's failure to give proper particulars.” 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Buscombe also made reference to the appeal of Sydney Thomas Harrison (1995) 79 A Crim R 149. In that case the Crown presented an indictment which alleged that the appellant conspired with ""an unknown person or persons"". The appellant argued that the indictment should be quashed and the proceedings stayed. The Court held the common law does not prohibit an unknown person being particularised as a co-conspirator in an indictment for conspiracy, and that an accused person may be convicted for conspiring with a person or persons unknown. The Court also held that s 393 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (as it then stood) did not abrogate this common law principle. It was in that context that Mahoney JA said at 152: 
     
      
       
        
        “The courts have long been conscious of the possibility of abuse of the charge of conspiracy and care has been taken to ensure that it is not used in a manner which is oppressive to an accused person. The possibility of abuse by a charge which does not nominate any person with whom the accused is said to have conspired is apparent: It is obviously desirable that, if the name of a conspirator be known, the conspirator be named. If this be not done, a charge may be pressed the proof of which cannot readily be tested by examination and investigation of the other party to the conspiracy.” 
        
       
      
    23 (I should add that I had cause to consider these two authorities in my earlier decision in R v Baladjam [No 9] of 15 April 2008, albeit in a slightly different context to the present disputation). 
     
      
    24 Against the background of these two authorities, Mr Buscombe submitted that the particulars were necessary for the accused to know the scope of the conspiracy that is alleged. Secondly, it was necessary to enable a proper forensic decision to be made as to whether to adduce evidence in the accused's case. This latter argument was a reference to the possibility that the accused might wish to call one or other of the men named in the order sought in the notice of motion. How could this be done, Mr Buscombe asked, if it were unknown whether the Crown was alleging that they, or any of them, were members of the alleged conspiracy?  
     
      
    25 In my opinion, in the present circumstances of this matter, the Crown is not obliged to provide ""particulars"" as sought in the notice of motion. First, the Crown has provided the accused with a Crown case statement. This is 182 pages long and contains in excess of 400 paragraphs. In addition, it contains approximately 720 detailed footnotes. Secondly, the Crown brief contains the statements referred to in the footnotes and paragraphs of the Crown case statement. Thirdly, the defence have been separately supplied with a voluminous volume of telephone intercepts, listening device material and other material.  
     
      
    26 From all this material, the actual role played by each of the men in the alleged conspiracy or in events related to the alleged conspiracy is perfectly apparent. For example, there are two precise telephone intercepts on 1 and 7 November 2005 relating to Daniel Baladjam, the accused's brother. Similarly, paras 330 and 331 of the Crown case statement demonstrate that the Crown will allege that Daniel Baladjam and another man were involved in moving boxes of material from the premises of the accused Mulahalilovic on 4 November 2005. Later in the day, Daniel Baladjam drove the van which had been used from Hoxton Park towards Liverpool. In this regard, the Crown case is that Daniel Baladjam used his own registered vehicle in connection with an action in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Crown, however, is not able to say whether Daniel Baladjam was a member of the conspiracy. The particulars of his involvement are made clear by the material to which I have referred, but the Crown is simply unable to say, for example, whether he was acting as an innocent agent or whether he was paid to assist. The Crown cannot say, on the information it has, that he necessarily shared the alleged conspiratorial intentions of his brother.  
     
      
    27 It is sufficient to say that the defence are in possession of every single assertion made in relation each of the men named in the order sought in the notice of motion. There is no need for me to provide all the details in this decision.  
     
      
    28 One further example will suffice. It is somewhat at the other end of the extreme than the illustration involving Daniel Baladjam. On 20 September 2005, Baladjam had a telephone conversation with Bilal Awad in which they discussed the purchase of surveillance equipment. Baladjam asked Awad, ""How did you go, bro"" to which Awad replied ""Brother...It's very expensive man, to be honest...cause proper surveillance like proper CCTV system is not cheap...I was quoted $800 a camera man."" Baladjam then thanked Mr Awad and the conversation ended.  
     
      
    29 As far as I can see, this is the only reference to Mr Awad in the Crown case statement and the other material I have mentioned. That being so, it seems to me that the defence have been made well aware of the precise ""involvement"" (small though it is) of Mr Awad. The Crown has not asserted that Mr Awad was a member of the conspiracy. He has not been charged or indicted as a member of the conspiracy. The Crown is unable to say anything more about his relationship with Mr Baladjam, other than that which is revealed in the telephone intercept.  
     
      
    30 In my opinion, the principle of fairness stated in Mok’s case, when applied, has no adverse application for the present Crown position. Indeed, the situation in that case was a highly unusual one and bears no relationship to the situation in the present trial. In my opinion, it is not authority for the broad proposition advanced here by Mr Buscombe. 
     
      
    31 Finally, it should be noted that the indictment, in summary form, charges each of the accused in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation of a terrorist act (or acts).” 
        
       
      
    32 The indictment contains particulars of the terrorist act or acts alleged by the Crown. The Crown case statement and other documents to which I have made reference give the fullest possible information to the defence as to the nature of the case they will have to meet. In my opinion, none of the authorities to which Mr Buscombe has referred me require, in the circumstances of this matter, that the Crown be obliged to state whether it alleges that any of the five named persons were members of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. In my opinion, the position taken in this regard by the Crown, in the light of the voluminous particulars of material supplied, are sufficient at this stage to satisfy the principles of fairness. Whether Mr Buscombe, or any of the other defendants, wish to call any of the five named persons in the trial is entirely a matter for them. It is obvious enough, however, that if the defence were to call, for example, Daniel Baladjam to give evidence that his activities on 4 November 2005 were innocent and unconnected with any alleged conspiracy, the Crown could legitimately cross-examine him to suggest to the contrary. To do so would not alter the nature of the Crown case as particularised nor would it enlarge or alter the scope of the conspiracy alleged by the Crown. If such a situation were to arise, improbable as it might presently seem, the Court would be in a position to intervene, even if, at worst, that had drastic consequences for the continuation of the trial.  
     
      
    33 For these reasons, I am not satisfied that Mr Buscombe has presently made good his claim to the orders sought in the notice of motion.  
     
      
    34 The order I make is that each application is refused and the notice of motion is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT - Application by Hasan to exclude evidence relating to items found at his premises on 8 November 2005 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application to exclude certain evidence the Crown proposes to adduce at trial. Originally, there were four categories of evidence. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Two pistol grips which were found in a motor vehicle UOZ 851 located outside Hasan's residence. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) A pistol holster found in the accused's residence at 117 Sproule Street, Lakemba.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) Three Daily Telegraph articles dated 2 June 2004, 23 June 2005 and 4 November 2005.  
        
       
       
        
        (d) A twelve page typed document in letter form dated 9 July 2005. 
        
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 As I have indicated, the various items were found during the execution of a search warrant. This search warrant was executed on 8 November 2005 at the home of Hasan. During the course of that search a large amount of items, including computers, software, media and other items, were taken either from the home or from the Toyota Tarago motor vehicle UOZ 851. The pistol shoulder holster was located in a box in the lounge room of the residence. (There were other items in the box, including electrical components, watches, multi-tools, cable ties, camouflage gear, plastic containers, city maps, a 12-volt 230-240 volt inverter, a 24-hour program timer and a gas cartridge.) One pistol grip was located in the centre console of the Tarago and a second was located in the glove box. The newspapers and other documents were found in the house 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of Mr Hasan 
       
      
    3 Ms Yehia made the submissions on behalf of Mr Hasan. Counsel argued that none of the evidence identified was relevant in the trial. Alternatively, it was submitted that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under s 137 of the Evidence Act. Ms Yehia's principal concern in relation to the twelve-page document was that the Crown might wish to assert that this apparently extremist ""letter"" was addressed to, or intended to be received by, Mr Hasan as the recipient. The Crown made it clear, however, that this would not be the basis on which the material would be led. Rather, the Crown would submit simply that it was material in his possession that reflected upon the state of mind of Mr Hasan, and that such state of mind was a matter relevant to the charge. In the light of the Crown concession, there was no further argument regarding this item.  
     
      
    4 Ms Yehia took strong exception, however, to the admission of the remaining material. Conveniently, counsel dealt with the two pistol grips and the holster as one category. In that regard, counsel submitted that there was no evidence in the Crown case that would fix those particular items with any connection to the charged conspiracy. In particular, there was no evidence identifying those items as part of the sourcing, or attempted sourcing, of firearms in furtherance of any preparation for a terrorist act.  
     
      
    5 Ms Yehia contrasted the nature of these items found, ostensibly in Mr Hasan's possession, with items such as the weaponry found in the possession of another of the accused, Mr Baladjam (see my earlier decision R v Baladjam & Ors [No 9], 15 April 2008). Whilst acknowledging that a different charge was involved, Ms Yehia placed reliance on two decisions by Bongiorno J in the Melbourne terrorism trial of R v Benbrika. These decisions were rulings 16 and 17 where his Honour had excluded evidence of two shotguns having been found in the possession of one of the accused. His Honour also excluded the finding of a .22 rifle found in the possession of another of the accused and excluded as well the possession by a third accused of a knife. In R v Benbrika (ruling 17) Bongiorno J excluded evidence of the possession by one of the accused of a loaded .45 Colt semiautomatic pistol. This latter piece of evidence was excluded on a discretionary basis.  
     
      
    6 In relation to the newspaper articles, they fell into two separate categories. The first was an article published in the Daily Telegraph on 2 June 2004. The lead article contains a picture of Jack Roche, who had been convicted of a serious terrorism offence the day before the article was published. I will not set out the whole of the article. It will be convenient, however, to refer to the principal headlines.  
     
      
    7 The main headline is in the following terms: ""What a joke"". The subsidiary headline refers to the conviction of Mr Roche. It continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “He shared a meal with Osama, he met the Bali mastermind, he learnt to use explosives, he plotted a deadly attack...he could be out of gaol in three years!"" 
        
       
      
    8 There was also a reference to the Telegraph editorial for 2 June 2004 complaining about the fact that the ""judiciary lets the nation down"", referring in that regard to a judicial ""lack of backbone"".  
     
      
    9 The second and third articles fell into a different category. As I have indicated, one is dated 23 June and the other is dated 4 November 2005. The first article refers to ""ASIO terror raids"" and to ""extreme group plotting attack on Australians"". 
     
      
    10 The first article deals with a series of raids conducted by ASIO on 22 June 2005. It asserts that the raids were conducted by ASIO ""after receiving intelligence that a radical Islamic group was plotting a terrorist attack on Australia"". The article continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Daily Telegraph has learned that extremist cells in Sydney and Melbourne have been liaising on plans to carry out a terror assault...the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House were named as targets but sources said the group intended to strike first in Melbourne.” 
        
       
      
    11 In reference to what was described as the Sydney group, the article continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Sydney group has been observed using small boats to spy on the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.” 
        
       
      
    12 The article contains photographs of both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge with the word ""target"" splashed across the top of each photograph in bold.  
     
      
    13 The November 4 article is headed ""Harbour Bridge and Kurnell are high risk targets"". Once again, there were photographs of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. This time there are also photographs of two Sydney oil refineries, the Melbourne Stock Exchange and Melbourne's Flinders Street Station. The body of the article contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Kurnell oil refinery are the top two targets of a suspected terrorist cell being tracked by spy agencies and police. The shadowy group of Islamic militants has been investigated by ASIO and State and Federal Police for more than a year but moved closer to an attack last weekend. The extremists are part of a Sydney-Melbourne alliance which planned to launch attacks in the country's two biggest cities...ASIO and AFP agents raided a string of homes in Sydney and Melbourne as part of Operation Pendennis in June. Last night police were poised for another set of raids as urgent law changes were rushed through Federal Parliament.” 
        
       
      
    14 The article also refers to the fact that “two Sydney men” were questioned in June after spy agencies observed them “taking video footage of the Harbour Bridge and the oil refinery at Kurnell from small boats on the Harbour”. The article also asserts that the men were believed to be working “in tandem” with a terror cell in Melbourne.  
     
      
    15 Ms Yehia submitted that there was nothing in the Crown case to suggest that there would be any evidence that the accused in the present matter had any plans to “target” either the Sydney Opera House or the Harbour Bridge. There would be no evidence to suggest that ""the Sydney group"" had been observed using small boats to spy on the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. In other words, Ms Yehia submitted that the two articles were an irresponsible and sensationalist beat-up, at least so far as their principal focus was concerned. In these circumstances, Ms Yehia submitted that the articles were not relevant to any issue in the trial. On the other hand, counsel submitted that their sensational nature would inevitably carry with it a considerable amount of unfair prejudice and would be likely to be used unfairly to convict the accused in relation to matters not the subject of the Crown case.  
     
      
    16 Ms Yehia also made the obvious point that the Crown case here did not assert that there was a Sydney and Melbourne group ""working in tandem"" with a joint aim for the carrying out of a local terrorist act.  
     
      
    17 In response, the Crown argued that the holster and gun grips were items that were relevant to the Crown case. Mr Hasan's possession of these, the Crown argued, might be seen as similar to the possession by Baladjam, and other accused, of items the kind dealt with in R v Baladjam [No 9]. The Crown submitted there was no real distinction between the subject items and other items, including weaponry, which had been the subject of earlier rulings allowing their presentation as evidence at trial. The Crown accepted, however, that its case posited that Hasan was particularly interested in the purchase of laboratory equipment and chemicals rather than weaponry.  
     
      
    18 It argued, however, that the true scope of the conspiracy meant that the reach of the evidence, so far as Hasan was concerned, could legitimately extend to items of the kind now under debate. Hasan, for example, had attended at camping trips at Curranyalpa and Mulga Creek. Weaponry and ammunition had been used at each of those camps in what was described by the Crown as a training camp in preparation and readiness for carrying out the objects of the conspiracy. The conspiracy, the Crown repeated, was a broad one, namely, an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It involved the accused equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It was not confined to being either an agreement to obtain weaponry and ammunition, or one to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used in the construction of an explosive device.  
     
      
    19 The Crown case is that, although matters of that kind were plainly and obviously contemplated by the agreement, the agreement itself was of a wider kind as particularised in the Crown case statement. Consequently, the agreement involved, for example, individual preparation of a physical, mental and spiritual kind. It extended to a wider preparation on the part of individual conspirators in the cause of jihad.  
     
      
    20 The Crown argued that when the scope of the conspiracy was examined in this way, the possession by Mr Hasan of the holster and gun grips could be readily seen to be relevant to the issues postulated by the charge in the indictment. For the same reason, the decisions of Bongiorno J in R v Benbrika (rulings 16 and 17) were plainly distinguishable. In that trial, the accused had simply been charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation.  
     
      
    21 In relation to the newspaper articles, the Crown adhered to the proposition that they were relevant for the purposes of the trial. The Jack Roche article was relevant as to the accused's state of mind. The other two articles, although it was conceded they were highly sensational and inaccurate, were again relevant as they demonstrated Mr Hasan's concern with concealment and with counter-surveillance to avoid the attention of the authorities. Ultimately, the Crown accepted that it might be necessary to edit parts of the material in the two later newspaper items because of their prejudicial effect. This ""concession"" by the Crown carried with it the notion that the Crown tacitly accepted that, in a number of respects, not only were the articles prejudicial, but they might be seen as unfairly so.  
     
      
    22 In reply, Ms Yehia made a number of points. There is no need to detail all the points argued in reply. Principally, however, Ms Yehia suggested that there was ample evidence in the Crown case on which it could place reliance to show that the accused generally were aware that they were being monitored and that, consequently, the newspaper articles were, in any event, unnecessary for the Crown case. Ms Yehia made specific reference to the extensive range of material gathered together under paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Crown case statement, including the material contained in the extensive footnote references to those paragraphs. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    23 This is the first of the arguments that seeks exclusion of material found during the November 2005 search warrant procedures. It is likely that there will be a number of other similar applications. It is appropriate, therefore, that I take the opportunity, at the outset of this decision, to repeat well-established principles relating to relevance, admissibility, and exclusion of evidence where the real prospect of unfair prejudice may be said to outweigh the level of probative value.  
     
      
       
      Relevance 
       
      
    24 The first question to be asked when an issue of the present kind arises is whether the evidence is relevant (Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650 at 653). Although questions of relevance may raise ""nice questions of judgment"", no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is either relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. The simple fact is that irrelevant evidence may not be received. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well established.  
     
      
    25 In determining relevance in a criminal trial, it is important and necessary to identify the ultimate issues. These will ordinarily be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged in the light of the defence, if known. Section 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 is in very broad terms. It states that evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. Behind these ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. (Smith at 654; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 307; 312 and 321-322.) 
     
      
    26 In its terms, s 55 clearly intends that a broad scope be given to the identification of evidence that may be relevant in a criminal trial. In particular, it is the capacity of the evidence to affect rationally, whether directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Concepts such as “capacity”, “assessment” and “probability” emphasise the width of the approach, although the exercise is curtailed and governed by the dictate that at all times it is to be performed by the application of a “rational” process of thought. The touchstone of the process will relate to the issues at trial, identified by the ingredients of the offence in the light of the defence. The language emphasises that it is the capacity of evidence to rationally have a bearing, even if it be an indirect one, upon the assessment of the probability of the very existence of a fact in issue that is important. Section 56 itself has been described (in Odgers' Uniform Evidence Law, 5th Edition, page 114) as ""the key provision regarding the admissibility of evidence"" in Chapter 3. The section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “56(1) Except as otherwise provided by this  
        Act 
        , evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    27 This section makes it plain that the relevance of evidence is not a question of degree. Evidence is either relevant or it is not.  
     
      
    28 I have set out at paras 18 and 19 above, in the most general of terms, the nature of the Crown case against Mr Hasan and the other accused. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Hasan entered into the agreement alleged by the Crown with one or more other persons. (This is the physical element required by the Criminal Code Act 1995). Secondly, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Hasan did so intentionally (this is the fault element). Thirdly, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Hasan and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement (this reflects the intention required by s 11.5(b) of the Criminal Code Act 1995). Finally, Hasan or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement (s 11.5(c) of the Criminal Code Act 1995). (The “ingredients” of a terrorist act have been identified and explicated by the Court in earlier decisions). 
     
      
    29 Mr Hasan's defence of “not guilty” to the charge puts in issue each of the essential elements of the offence that I have identified. As a consequence, there are likely to be a considerable number of facts relevant to facts in issue involved in the proof of the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. In that circumstance, the net cast by s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 is likely to be very wide indeed. In a theoretical sense, it does not permit (on the issue of relevance) a distinction to be drawn, in this trial, between the possession by an alleged conspirator of a weapon and the possession by another conspirator of an item such as a pistol holster or pistol grips. Nor, having regard to the broad nature of the alleged conspiracy, does it allow (in assessing relevance) the placement of individual conspirators into separate boxes or compartments where, for example, one is said to be involved in the purchase of laboratory equipment and chemicals, and another is said to be involved in obtaining or attempting to obtain weaponry or ammunition. There is likely to be a broad crossover between such activities and functions, particularly where it is alleged that surveillance and counter-surveillance were actively and frequently involved.  
     
      
    30 Further, distinctions of this kind will be markedly eroded at the edges, especially in relation to the establishment of the necessary fault and mental elements required in the establishment of the charge. Again, even further blurring of such distinctions will occur when the broad nature of the agreement charged is sought to be established at a practical level.  
     
      
    31 Let me move from a theoretical consideration of these aspects of the charge and defence to a consideration, in practical terms, of other evidence likely to be led in the Crown case. It is true, as Ms Yehia has said, that the Crown case particularly focuses on Mr Hasan's involvement with the purchase of laboratory equipment and the like. But the Crown case is that Mr Hasan, like the others, has a mindset that relates to his common belief with the others, focusing on their common interpretation of the Muslim faith. The Crown case is that this common belief is deep seated and fundamental in a general sense. It focuses on an acceptance that a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of their individual religious obligations is the cause of violent jihad. This is a concept, not being merely one of political disagreement, but one which may involve, where necessary, the application of force and violence, including, in certain circumstances, the killing of non-believers, the doing of damage to the property of non-believers, and the infliction of violence to bring about a radical political change through the consequences of, and fear engendered by, terror.  
     
      
    32 According to the Crown case, the common belief of all the alleged conspirators, including Mr Hasan, carried with it the need to be prepared for jihad; to be prepared to accept surveillance and interference from the authorities, and, if necessary, to counter that interference in whatever way would most efficaciously enable the continued fulfilment of the alleged conspiracy.  
     
      
    33 Mr Hasan was, for example, according to the Crown case, involved in two training camps. These camps were at remote locations. They were booked under a false name, and were booked using mobile telephones obtained in a false name. The participants, despite requests to do so, failed to complete the necessary paperwork which would have required the provision of the names and addresses of those camping. Other material in the Crown case shows the interest of a number of the accused in obtaining camping equipment, maps and other items which could be used at remote camping locations. As I have said, each of the camping trips involved weaponry and ammunition. A number of the accused were found to have weapons, ammunition or similar materials in their possession on or about 8 November 2005 when the arrests were made. (Some examples of this are to be found in R v Baladjam [No 9] at paragraphs 20 and 21.) In particular, for present purposes, Baladjam had a pistol holster and Touma was found with one in his possession. The fact that Hasan had a pistol holster and pistol grips, but no pistol, does not obliterate the relevance of the items he in fact possessed. 
     
      
    34 Finally, it might be mentioned that, as the Crown pointed out, one of the documents located commonly on the computers of eight of the accused, including Hasan, was a document headed ""mission preparation"". It refers to “basics” that will be required for a mission, including a water bottle, compass and, relevantly for the present argument, a pistol holster.  
     
      
    35 In my view, the broad test of relevance in the Evidence Act, coupled with the range of issues involved in the trial in the present matter, makes it quite clear that Hasan's possession of these items is relevant in the trial. I consider that the decisions of Bongiorno J, dealing as they do with a completely different charge, are clearly distinguishable from the present case. I can well understand why it was that Bongiorno J suggested that circular reasoning might be involved in relation to the possession of weaponry in that trial. That is not the case here, however, where possession of the items in question plainly has a relevance to the establishment by the Crown of the physical and fault elements I have identified.  
     
      
       
      Section 137 of the Evidence Act – Principles of exclusion 
       
      
    36 I turn now to consider s 137 and the suggested exclusion of the evidence on this basis.  
     
      
    37 Ms Yehia has argued that the evidence should be excluded under s 137. This section of the Evidence Act is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [137] Exclusion of Prejudicial Evidence in Criminal Proceedings 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the Prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant"". 
        
       
      
    38 Section 137 requires a balancing by the trial judge of the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. If that balancing process results in a finding that the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the Court is constrained to refuse to admit the evidence. No element of discretion applies. 
     
      
    39 The section requires the Court to consider, first, the probative value of the evidence in this case of the items found in Hasan’s home and car. Secondly, the Court must examine the probative value of the evidence relative to its prejudicial effect to the extent that it could or would be unfair. (See R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101; Papakosmas v R; R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; R v E M (2003) NSWCCA 374; R v Yates (2002) NSWCCA 520 at (252)). 
     
      
    40 Counsel for the accused has argued that in this matter, the probative value of the evidence, whatever it be, is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused by its admission. The unfair prejudice is said to arise in a number of ways, all of which are detailed in the written and oral submissions.  
     
      
    41 In my view, however, the evidence in the present matter has a reasonable level of probative value. Probative value is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    42 (It is now accepted that it is not, in general terms, open to a trial judge, in assessing the probative value of any piece of evidence, to take into account an evaluation of its reliability or, for that matter, the credibility of the witness who gave the evidence (R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at 47-65; R v Lodhi (2007) NSWCCA 360 at 174-177; R v Mundine (2008) NSWCCA 55 at 33; R v Sood (2007) NSWCCA 214 at 26-43.) 
     
      
    43 This definition of ""probative value"" (and indeed the terms of s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 itself) makes it plain that, at least in jurisdictions involving the Evidence Act, relevance is not a question of degree. On the other hand, an assessment of the probative value of any piece of evidence does require an analysis of the capacity of the evidence to affect rationally the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Questions of degree do arise. Here, as I have said, the evidence seems to me to possess a reasonable level of probative value, in the sense postulated by the terms of the Evidence Act and its Dictionary.  
     
      
    44 I am not satisfied, however, that the evidence is likely to be misused by the jury, or that the jury would be likely to give it undue weight. At para 25 of my decision R v Baladjam [No 9] I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the reasons I have given, I conclude that the evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown is admissible not only against Mr Baladjam, but also against the other accused. It is evidence that has a high probative value and it is consistent with the Crown case generally against all of the accused. I am not satisfied that there is any danger of unfair prejudice if the evidence were to be admitted. Of course, it may be true that the community does not look favourably upon the possession of loaded guns in a public place. But neither does it look any more favourably upon the type of activities that the Crown alleges the co-conspirators were engaged in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy. Nor, for that matter, does the community look particularly favourably upon acts being carried out in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. As I have said in other decisions, provided appropriate directions are given to a jury so that they understand how evidence may be used and, more importantly, not be used, I do not think that any question of unfair prejudice is likely to arise. That point of view applies equally to the present evidence.”  
        
       
      
    45 Those observations have even greater weight in the present context. Would the jury look especially unfavourably upon Hasan's possession of two gun grips and a holster? I think not. After all, the possession of those items, if that be accepted, is but one circumstantial factor in the Crown case. It is not a particularly alarming factor. As Ms Yehia pointed out, possession of items of those kind is not illegal. It is not dangerous, and it says nothing that is necessarily adverse to the person who possesses them. Indeed, possession of items of that kind may be explained innocently and readily. A direction could be given to the jury, of course, so that they comprehend how the evidence may be used and so that they comprehend, more importantly, how it is not to be used. I do not suggest that such a direction would be necessary in relation to these items, but the capacity to give a direction of that kind is plainly there, if the defence consider it is needed.  
     
      
    46 In any event, I do not think that any question of unfair prejudice is likely to arise.  
     
      
    47 I turn now to the newspaper items. The first article relating to the conviction of Jack Roche is, in my view, relevant. The fact that Mr Hasan has retained the item in his possession, presumably for a period of time, is capable of reflecting on his mindset and on his attitudes that are relevant to the issues in the trial. I do not consider that there is any aspect of unfair prejudice involved in the contents of the article.  
     
      
    48 It is otherwise, however, with the later Telegraph articles dealing with the ASIO raids. As I indicated during argument, I think that they are ""over the top"" and they should not be presented to the jury in the form in which they appear as exhibits on this application.  
     
      
    49 I would be prepared to allow the Crown to indicate, in bland form, that Mr Hasan had in his possession (or they were found at his home if that be preferred) two articles appearing in the Daily Telegraph, one being dated 23 June 2005 and the second 4 November 2005. The Crown could indicate that the first article related to ASIO undertaking ""secret raids"" and indicating, in general terms, where the raids took place. So far as the contents of the second article is concerned, the statement could simply refer to the fact that ASIO and the AFP agents had raided a number of homes in Sydney and Melbourne as part of a joint operation in June and that the police were poised for another set of raids as urgent law changes were being rushed through Federal Parliament. The precise terms of any such statement should be agreed between the parties. I will intervene if necessary.  
     
      
    50 In these circumstances, I will simply order that the motion be dismissed. It may be revived before me if agreement is not able to be reached in relation to the two newspaper articles.

      2007 / 3677 REGINA v SADATIA ANNE FERGUSON 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Sadatia Anne Ferguson, is to be sentenced for the manslaughter of Tae Simon at Forster on 19 November 2006. She was charged with murder and was committed to this Court for trial. She first appeared on 5 October 2007. She asked not to be arraigned and her trial date was fixed to begin 21 April 2008. She was arraigned on 7 December and pleaded not guilty of Mr Simon’s murder but guilty of his manslaughter. The Crown declined to accept that plea in discharge of the indictment and the trial date was confirmed. The trial was held in due course but the jury were unable to agree. The Crown reconsidered its position. The offender was arraigned again and pleaded as she had before. This time the Crown accepted the plea in discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    2 At the time of the deceased’s death he was 22 years old and the offender was 36 years old. They had known one another all their joint lives. The deceased’s mother and the offender’s father were first cousins. In October 2005 the deceased, who was in need of accommodation, moved into a spare room at the offender’s house. Early in 2006 a sexual relationship developed. It was not a happy one, however. The offender was not unacquainted with illegal drugs, but had never taken them in any great quantity. She substantially increased her use of them under the influence and encouragement of the deceased. Their preferred drug was amphetamine and he taught her to inject it. She began taking very high doses. Their relationship was unsatisfactory for other reasons as well. The deceased was sexually very demanding and seemed to enjoy humiliating the offender. He used to accuse her of having sexual relations with others. He made offensive remarks about having sexual intercourse with her and her 17 year old daughter. She became depressed. She saw her general practitioner, who prescribed an anti-depressant drug, Fluvoxamine. The deceased, who was also thought to be depressed, was prescribed an anti-depressant. They stopped taking their medicines about two months before the death of the deceased partly, it seems, because they had resumed using amphetamine.  
     
      
    3 Their drug abuse resumed and the offender was taking increasingly large amounts by injection, sometimes for several days on end. They would go for days without sleep during which the deceased would “drill” the offender with questions about her other relationships. The accusations about affairs continued. The deceased began hitting the offender and threatened to kill her. There were several weapons at the house, including a samurai sword and baseball bats. The deceased told the offender that if she ever tried to leave him he would kill her. He said that he had friends upon whom he could call to do such a thing. 
     
      
    4 On the Friday before his death, the offender finally decided to leave the deceased. An aunt gave her a lift to Lismore. Over the weekend she spoke to the deceased on the telephone and he begged her to return. He seemed distressed and she was afraid that he would attempt suicide. She did not wish to feel responsible for his death. The bus was the only way she could return but it did not enter Forster. She needed transport from a point on the Pacific Highway into Forster itself. Following her conversations with the deceased she understood that he would pick her up, using her car, which she had left behind, and take her home. She took the bus accordingly but the deceased did not collect her. She managed to make her way home by other means. The deceased accused her of sleeping with other men during the days that she had been away. They went to a dealer’s house to try to buy drugs. The deceased drove off in her car, leaving her there. She made her way home. The deceased was there. He accused her of sleeping with the drug dealer and told her to go elsewhere if she wanted anything to eat. She went to her room to pack her belongings, intending to leave again. The deceased followed her to the bedroom door, criticising and threatening her. She felt that he had “set her up”. He had got her to return from Lismore thinking that he wanted and needed her. The last words she remembered him saying were, “you will always have to look over your shoulder”. She thought that that meant that if she left he would come after her. She took a knife and stabbed him. She inflicted a number of wounds, at least three of them to the chest or shoulder. One of them penetrated about nine or ten centimetres, damaging the heart and ultimately entering the abdominal cavity. It was the wound that caused death. There were several, other knife wounds on the body, some of them defence wounds.  
     
      
    5 There was evidence at the trial which, if accepted, might support a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, either by substantial impairment by abnormality of mind or by provocation. When accepting the offender’s plea, the Crown acknowledged that, and the parties agree that, when she killed the deceased the offender’s capacity to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    6 The offender was raised in Taree. Her parents gave her a stable upbringing. However, the husband of one of her aunts sexually abused her for nine years, beginning when she was about five years of age and ending when she was 14 years of age. She kept the abuse to herself during all that time. Although she finally exposed the man, he was never charged. 
     
      
    7 There is a history of depression in the offender’s family. One of her sisters was treated for that disease. In 2000, after her two children had left her to live with their estranged father, the offender attempted suicide. She was admitted to hospital at Taree and came under the care of a psychiatrist. She underwent counselling and took anti-depressant medicine for about 12 months. She began using amphetamine in the same year. About one year before the deceased’s death there was the second referral, mentioned above, for psychiatric treatment. The offender was arrested on the day of her offence and has remained in custody. She has been treated for depression during that time. 
     
      
    8 Three consulting psychiatrists gave evidence, Dr Nielssen, Dr Westmore and Dr Allnutt. All agree that when she killed the deceased the offender was suffering from a major depressive illness. It is apparent that she was also suffering from amphetamine abuse disorder. Her depression was an abnormality of mind. I am satisfied that it impaired her ability to control herself. 
     
      
    9 I am satisfied that so provocative was the deceased’s abuse of the offender that she finally and suddenly lost the ability to control herself. Although she intended to kill the deceased, she formed that intention suddenly, a very short time before she committed the act causing death. Afterwards she was just as quickly overcome by remorse. 
     
      
    10 The offender continues to be remorseful. Consistently with that attitude, she offered a plea of guilty of manslaughter at an early stage of the proceedings in this Court. Her early plea entitles her to a substantial discount from her sentence. 
     
      
    11 The offender is a person of prior good character. She is unlikely to offend again. She has a history of employment in the health profession and has, I think, reasonable prospects of gaining employment again upon her release from custody and living a useful life in the community. 
     
      
    12 The offender continues to run the risk of lapsing again into depression and I think that she will need therapy to head off that eventuality. She also needs help in staying off the use of illegal drugs, particularly amphetamine and methamphetamine. Those special needs justify my fixing a parole period which exceeds one third of the non-parole period I have in mind. 
     
      
    13 A victim impact statement was tendered on behalf of members of the deceased’s family. They held him in very high regard and have suffered as a result of his death. The sympathy of the Court goes out to them. 
     
      
    14 Sadatia Anne Ferguson, you are convicted of the manslaughter of Tae Simon. I sentence you to imprisonment. I fix a non-parole period of four years, which will be taken to have commenced on the day of your arrest, 19 November 2006 and which will expire on 18 November 2010. There will be a balance of sentence of three years. Your sentence will expire on 18 November 2013. The first day upon which you will become eligible for release on parole will be 18 November 2010.

     JUDGMENT  
    1. These are the sentence proceedings of Codie Waters, Shannon Waters and Grant Waters. During a period between 7 February and 28 July 2006, Codie Waters was subject to close monitoring by police investigating unlawful supply of amphetamine and cannabis in and around the south coast. A special strike force named Ravensworth was established for this purpose. Codie Waters’ mobile phone was monitored from 7 February 2006. On five occasions over this six and a half month period, Codie received a total of nine ounces of amphetamine, approximately 252 grams, with an agreement to be supplied another four ounces (112 grams) which was in the possession of his supplier towards the end of this period when the supplier was arrested. As to the other 252 grams, he either supplied or, with his father and brother, used some of the amphetamines. 2. Grant Waters, Codie’s father, and Shannon Waters, a younger brother, lived with Codie. All three were amphetamine abusers. They had been knowingly concerned with the supply of some 252 grams of amphetamine that had made it to their home from the Canberra supplier. Today, each is to be held accountable for his role in the distribution of amphetamines into the South Coast community situated at or around Moruya. Each offender has asked that when sentencing for the relevant charge he faces in the indictment, I take into account further admitted criminality pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989. I shall deal with that criminality as I review each of the offender’s cases.3. As sentencing judge, it falls to me then to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine an appropriate sentence for these offences before this Court committed by these offenders, harming in the way in which it did the community in which they lived. My initial task requires an assessment of what is called the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each of the offenders.4. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offenders. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in this case in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. Tender of agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his or her fact-finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.5. Each offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made, there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, the impact of the Form 1 matters, whether any of these offences attracts a standard non-parole period and the length of the relevant parole period to be imposed in respect of each offender and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of that can be done until the primary facts have been determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, also needs to be determined. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.6. The brothers lived in premises on Araluen Road, Moruya. Neither electricity nor sewerage was supplied to these premises. The supplier of amphetamine was identified as MJW. He lived at an address in the ACT. Police discovered that Codie Waters would meet MJW in Canberra to buy amphetamine from him. Intercepted mobile telephone conversations and text messages revealed the amounts of amphetamine purchased by Waters ranged between one ounce (twenty-eight grams) and four ounces (112 grams). When Waters returned to Moruya, he would distribute the amphetamine to his associates who in turn would supply to other drug users. At different times the co-accused, Shannon and Grant Waters, knowingly assisted Codie Waters in the distribution of drugs.The supplies 14-15 February7. On 9 February 2006, Codie Waters sent MJW a text message to arrange to meet in Canberra to buy amphetamine. Text messages were exchanged on 10 February 2006. On 12 February 2006, Waters received a text message from Williams. In response to it, Waters travelled to Canberra on Monday 13 February 2006. On Tuesday 14 February 2006, Waters met MJW in Canberra and bought two ounces of amphetamine. Shortly after this meeting, Waters sent MJW a text message asking, “I will grab those other two flower bunches off you tonight if that’s all right”. MJW replied, “Okay”. On 15 February 2006, Waters sent MJW a text message asking, “Hey mate, how are you?”. MJW replied, “Organising it now, bro”. Waters and MJW then arranged to meet at a service station. During the meeting, Waters was supplied with a further two ounces of amphetamine. 8. Following this supply, Waters spoke to a number of people in New South Wales by phone arranging suitable places and times to supply them with amphetamine. He drove back into New South Wales with the four ounces of amphetamine.9. On 16 February 2006, MJW contacted Waters arranging a meeting to discuss his concerns that they were being investigated by police. On 25 February 2006, police recorded a phone call between Waters and a man named Jamie. Towards the end of that call Jamie said, “Fuck, you could have given me some...” and Waters told him, “Already gone”, by which I understood Jamie to mean that he was looking for some amphetamine in circumstances where this investigation was ongoing and Waters was indicating that the amphetamine had “already gone”.10. On Wednesday 1 March, Waters and MJW exchanged text messages and arranged to meet in Canberra. MJW asked Waters, “Same?”, and Waters replied, “Yes please”. Waters then hired a rental car and booked a room at a motel in Canberra. He travelled to Canberra with his girlfriend. Waters notified MJW on his arrival and shortly MJW told Waters he was ready. Waters and MJW met and Waters was supplied with four ounces (112 grams) of amphetamine. There was some negotiation in price, MJW claiming $10,800 was the negotiated price for the four ounces of amphetamine. He rang Waters to complain that he was $500 short of the agreed price and Waters agreed to fix MJW up on the difference on the occasion of the next supply of drugs. Waters returned to New South Wales with four ounces of amphetamine.11. On 14 March 2006, Waters and MJW exchanged text messages agreeing to meet in Canberra on 17 March. On St Patrick’s Day, Waters drove to Canberra and met with MJW. During the meeting, MJW supplied Waters with an ounce (twenty-eight grams) of amphetamine. Waters received a telephone call from a man by the name of Matt O’Shea. There was a conversation. Waters was indicating that he was on his way, that he had had a bad night and O’Shea said, “No good eh?”. Waters was complaining that he wanted to come home but he only had to come back in a day or so, that, “All I’m waiting on now is just--“ and O’Shea asked “The second one?” and Waters replied, “Yeah, or the fourth, mate. Whatever, it doesn’t matter”. Waters complained that he was unhappy. “I got one, I got one, I usually get four, man. That’ll last me a fucking day, maybe two days”. This was in another call to a man by the name of McCurley. McCurley told Waters, “Dead set I’ve got people waiting everywhere, man. All right, ring me when you get back here”. I am satisfied both O’Shea and McCurley were customers of Codie Waters and were seeking to maintain their level of supply with him.12. On 21 March 2006, Waters sent MJW a text message seeking a further meeting. Codie Waters met with MJW in Canberra on three further occasions, 24 March, 1 April and 15 June. On 1 April 2006, Waters and MJW met at the university gym in Belconnen. During that meeting they were surveilled by police and photographed. On 11 April, MJW phoned Waters and told him “Just talking to me mate and you should shut up shop, bro”. The accused Codie Waters replied, “Okay” and was told by MJW, “Because...photos and everything”. Codie Waters replied, “Yeah, no worries”. Waters concluded that conversation, “I’m due for a holiday anyway, man”.13. Shortly after that call, Codie Waters telephoned his brother Shannon telling him of MJW’s concerns. Codie Waters then directed Shannon to remove some amphetamines hidden under a tarp and to move it “Up the hill”. 14. On 15 June 2006, Codie Waters travelled to Canberra to meet MJW to buy amphetamine. On 16 June 2006, police intercepted a telephone conversation between Waters and an unidentified male in which Waters told that male, “I’m just fucking waiting for a phone call and then I should be home”. Waters returned to Moruya at about 5.08 on 16 June 2006. 15. Police intercepted a telephone call between Waters and a man by the name of Craig Cameron in which Waters complained about the quality of drugs that MJW had offered him and that he, Codie Waters, had refused to buy. That conversation concluded,  
     
      
      Waters: So, yeah, hopefully in the next day or two.  
       
      Cameron: You haven’t even got a baggie there?  
       
      Waters: Yeah, probably two, two days, bro.  
       
      Cameron: Oh yeah, no baggie there?  
       
      Waters: I’ll give you a ring.” 
      
    16. On 24 June, MJW called Waters and said “I’m sorry bro, I’m going to bring it to you, you know...” and Waters said “Are you sure?”. MJW said “Yeah man. Fuck, I’m not going to make you drive you know”. He continued “This is better, yeah. You’ll be happy with this one I think”. That call ended and another call shortly afterwards where MJW asked if Waters had seen any police around the Batemans Bay area and asked the accused Codie Waters if he could arrange for someone to have a look around shortly before he, MJW, drove through. Waters indicated that he could do that.17. On 28 July, that is more than a month later, MJW telephoned Waters and told him that he would drive down with his girlfriend to see Waters and to supply him with four ounces of amphetamine. At about 6.30pm, police stopped and searched a car in Bungendore New South Wales driven by MJW. There were two people in that car, MJW and his girlfriend CK. As a result of the search, police found a plastic bag containing 114.6 grams of amphetamine with a purity of 21.5%. I have assumed from the way things thereafter unfolded that MJW at least was arrested.18. On 29 July 2006, police intercepted a call between Codie Waters and one Tim Gottaas. In that conversation Waters said, “I’m fucking waiting for this...to turn up last night. I stayed up ‘til 2:00. He was supposed to come”. There was further conversation and Waters said, “I organise things right and then I’ve got to let you guys down you know”. Waters elsewhere said in the same conversation, “Hopefully [he’ll] be here this morning”. Gottaas said “Just let me know anyway”, Waters, “I’ll contact you straight away”. I am satisfied that Gottaas was a customer supplied by Waters.19. In another intercepted telephone call, Waters again complained to an unidentified male about MJW’s failure to arrive. He said, “I don’t know what’s going on” and elsewhere, “It was supposed to be by last night” and elsewhere, “he was just waiting on a phone call”. I have not identified MJW because I understand that he was charged with possession and his case was dismissed; in which case notwithstanding his involvement in this case he is entitled to the benefits of a presumption of innocence, one of which is to have his name withheld.Cultivate and supply of cannabis (the form one matter)20. Between 1 March and 30 April 2006, police intercepted a number of phone calls, which showed that all three accused knowingly took part in the cultivation of cannabis plants in the Moruya area. There are at least ten cannabis plants yielding, it would seem, a total of somewhere between ten and twenty pounds, that is four and a half to nine kilograms of cannabis leaf. The plants were harvested over the weekend of 1 April. While some of that cannabis leaf was personally used by each of the accused, Codie Waters also supplied some of the leaf to paying customers. 21. At about 8.30am on 31 July, police attended Codie Waters’ premises. All three accused were present. They were arrested and a search warrant was executed. Police located 60 grams of cannabis, a number of fake cans with screw top lids used to conceal prohibited drugs, several plastic bags matching the packaging of the prohibited drug found during the search of the MJW vehicle on 28 July, further resealable bags and twelve mobile telephones, some of which had been monitored by investigators. All three accused were returned to Moruya police station and have been in custody since their arrest.Receiving stolen property, also a form one matter22. During the search, police found and seized a red Honda XR 650 motorcycle earlier stolen from an ACT address in 2002. Analysis of a phone call intercepted on 4 March 2006 revealed that the motorcycle had been offered to the accused Codie Waters for $400. During the call, Waters was told that the motorcycle was stolen property.McCurley23 McCurley was arrested by police on 1 August 2006. He told investigators that he was a user of amphetamine and had commenced buying drugs from Waters and selling it to other users to support his own habit. In late 2005 he said, Codie Waters asked him if he knew anyone that he, McCurley, could sell amphetamines to. Between 9 February 2006 and 5 May 2006, McCurley claimed to be supplied between five to seven grams of amphetamine each week by either Codie, Shannon or Grant Waters for cash. Throughout this time, he regularly purchased an average of two grams of amphetamine at a cost of $560. On each occasion, McCurley arranged to meet either Codie or Shannon Waters. McCurley said that he would then on-supply to approximately eight regular customers in the area.Craig Cameron24. Craig Cameron was also arrested. His arrest was on 31 July 2006. On 12 December 2006, Cameron attended Batemans Bay police station. He told police he had known Codie Waters for about 18 months and that over the last 12 months Waters had supplied him with amphetamines. The amount he purchased varied from four grams down to a point (0.1 gram). Waters supplied him on average with at least a gram a week over this period. Cameron said he would pick up the drugs from Waters’ house but on some occasions Waters would deliver it to him. When Cameron collected it from Codie Waters, Shannon and Grant Waters would often be present. On about ten occasions, Shannon Waters delivered amphetamine to him. Grant Waters delivered the drug to him “once or twice”.Gottaas25. Gottaas was arrested on 3 August 2006. Gottaas told police he had known the Waters family for many years, having been to their property at Moruya on a number of occasions. He told police that for the past 12 months on a regular basis, weekly to monthly, Codie Waters supplied him with amphetamine in amounts varying from one gram to three and a half grams. Gottaas said he would then on supply this drug to four other people.Objective criminality26. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence or offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offenders. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the case before the Court with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing.27. Courts and the legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to the impression many offenders may initially entertain, supplying drugs is not a social but rather an antisocial behaviour. Courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to the drug’s potential for harm. True it is, harm is done by drugs. Inescapable as it is, harm is done by drugs. That is what makes it antisocial.28. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else must be antisocial. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs and by its indirect impact on the community at large. For some, if not most, drugs such as the ones I am concerned with here, cannabis and amphetamine, can be addictive. Some are also, and indeed both of those, destructive, sometimes causing or contributing to mental health problems, to aggression, to paranoia. Supplying drugs can lead to, create or sustain drug addicts. The description Perrin gave to me in his evidence of the three of these offenders was a description of drug addicts. Nobody could say that they were in the prime of health when he saw them.29. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and other effects of drugs. That is the real essence of the criminal harm done by suppliers of drugs. That is, that in a greater or lesser way they are contributing to the disenabling of other human beings. It is in that sense that drug supplying undermines public health. Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crime such as armed robbery, break and enter and steals. That is a loss of property to an owner usually arising from that owner’s productive efforts in the community. Associated with robbery and break and enter offences is trauma; emotional and psychological damage to victims caused by violence and/or by intrusion and the invasion of their privacy as people trample uncaringly, unfeelingly and intrusively about their homes. The spending of money on drugs by addicts without corresponding productivity by the drug dealer amounts to a monumental transference of wealth, usually from the already poor, without any corresponding economic gain in the community. At every level then drug dealing is criminal conduct because of its corrosive effect upon society as a whole.30. Although given in another context, I note remarks by Hume J in R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120, his Honour referring to earlier remarks he had made in Kalache [2007] NSWCCA 2 para 13: 
     
      
      “Other things being equal, doubling the quantity [of drugs supplied] is calculated to double the illegal profits for those engaged in such enterprises and if not to double, at least to substantially increase the harm. When an offender knows the quantity in which he is participating, even more so when his earnings and profit are proportional to or vary with that quantity, considerable weight must be given to it in assessing his criminality”. 
      
    31. The background of this offence establishes that Codie Waters was the principal of a drug distribution network where he on-supplied to others who would in turn on-supply probably to end users. He supplied to others. That he supplied to others who in turn would on-supply, aggravates his criminality. The particular supplies I am dealing with must be understood against a background that this offender had been supplying amphetamines at some level at least some time prior to 1 January 2006. Put another way, the supplying forming the centrepiece of the charge he now faces was not his first venture into supplying amphetamine.32. The operation came to an end with Codie Waters’ arrest on 31 July 2006. His supplier had been arrested three days earlier seeking to deliver four ounces of amphetamine to him. I have looked at the definition of supply. His intended purchase of the undelivered amphetamine does not come into the definition of supply, thus his dealing with MJW is this context does not constitute a supply within the structure of this offence. However, the conversation with Gottaas on 29 July indicates an agreement to supply some of the expected delivery to him. Likewise, his phone call with the unidentified male can only be consistent with an agreement to supply that man with some amphetamine yet to be delivered.33. There are then three periods during which amphetamine from Canberra made its way to drug purchases in and about Moruya, 15 February, 1 March, 19 March. In all, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that 252 grams of amphetamine was brought to Moruya by Codie Waters and some was used by himself and his two co-offenders. 34. On what basis amphetamine was distributed to Grant and Shannon Waters is not disclosed in evidence. I cannot be satisfied whether it was for reward or for services rendered, but I am satisfied it was for one or the other and not for payment of money.35. On one occasion Codie Waters paid $10,800 for 112 grams. It is likely he paid $10,300 for the earlier four ounces delivered to him. It is likely he paid somewhere between $2,600 and $3,000 for the single ounce. I would estimate the value of the amphetamine to him from the seller was something in the order of about $24,000. 36. I am satisfied the dealing between Codie Waters and his supplier was stopped for a number of weeks because of fears of police detection. I cannot be satisfied any dealing was done on 24 March or 1 April or in any of the meetings in April or May, if there were any. I do note, however, McCurley claims to have been in receipt of a regular supply of five to seven grams of amphetamine up to 5 May and others of his customers claim to have been in regular supply of lesser amounts during the same period. Whether that was from stocks already held or not, I am unable to say.37. While the offenders are not punished for the period when Codie Waters did not receive supplies from Canberra, it has significance in understanding the flow of money against the desired flow of money. The desired flow of money is important in assessing that Codie Waters was dealing in amphetamine for financial gain, although the financial gain was not as much as he would have desired. Had all of the amphetamine been supplied at the price paid by McCurley for the two grams, that is at a cost of $560 for the two, the return to Codie Waters on his investment would have been $70,560, hence the significance of my comment about the transfer of wealth from the poor to others. I should pause there to say I do not believe he received that sum of money. In fact, I know he did not, because of his own use. And invariably when you sell more than two grams you reduce your prices per gram also. But it does satisfy me that my finding of financial gain is a correct one. Notwithstanding his own use and the use by his brother, I am satisfied he trafficked in amphetamine for personal financial gain. 38. The defence case was that the offender was living in impoverished circumstances, that is to say in the absence of electricity and sewerage. It may also be, if I have understood the tenor of the evidence correctly, he was without town water supply. Clearly, However, he had a motor vehicle and was able to hire motor vehicles.39. I have already noted the offender sold to others knowing they were on supplying to their own customer base who were likely to have been end users.40. Codie Waters admits to his criminality in respect of three matters; receiving for $400 a stolen Honda XR 650 motorcycle initially stolen in the A.C.T, knowing it was stolen. He acknowledges his criminality in supplying of cannabis leaf, some of a product of cannabis plant and something in the order of 4.5 to 9 kilograms of cannabis. I have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the base quantity from which the supply came and I could not be satisfied it was more than 4 ½ kilos because that is the bottom limit of the agreed facts.The objective criminality of Shannon Waters41. At different times he knowingly assisted for a seven-month period, including up to his arrest on 31 July, in the distribution of the amphetamine to Craig Cameron. Craig Cameron came to be supplied amphetamine by Codie Waters in circumstances where Shannon Waters was present. By his plea of guilty I , I accept his presence there was in some capacity, possibly to provide security to Codie Waters when the deal was consummated or possibly to be able to support Codie Waters if there was any dispute about transfers of drugs or of money. On some ten occasions he delivered amphetamine to Cameron. McCurley was delivered amphetamine between 9 February and 5 May, something in the order of 5 to 7 grams on a number of occasions by Shannon Waters. It would seem on these occasions cash was passed from McCurley to Shannon Waters. In April of 2006, Codie discussed his concerns regarding possible detection and instructed Shannon Waters to transfer some amphetamine from one hiding place to another more secure hiding place away from the house or car. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt Shannon did as he was instructed. There is no evidence of any negotiation being done by Shannon Waters. 42. Shannon Waters also asks that his knowingly taking part in the cultivation of ten cannabis plants be taken into account when I deal with him on the substantive charge in the indictment.Grant Waters43. Grant Waters appears to have the least criminal culpability of these three. At different times he knowingly assisted Codie Waters with the distribution of the drug. Between 9 February and 5 May 2006, Grant Waters would deliver amphetamine to McCurley for cash and return the cash as I understand it to Codie Waters. Grant Waters was often present when Craig Cameron collected his supply of amphetamine. Likewise, I take the same inference from the plea of guilt in his case as I did in Shannon Waters’ case. Grant Waters also admits his guilt and criminality in respect of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plant and possessing cannabis leaf. When I come to sentence him for the substantive charge in the indictment, he asks that I take those two matters into account.Does a Standard Non-Parole Period Apply44. Although all offenders have been charged with offences created by s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the back of the indictment makes it clear there is a difference in the essential elements of each of these offences. Section 54A and B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the relevant offence in the Table. Item 18 only provides a standard non-parole period of 10 years for the offence describe as (25)(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, (supplying commercial quantity of prohibited drug), not cannabis leaf, involving less than a large commercial quantity of that prohibited drug. Only Codie Waters is charged with an offence then carrying a standard non-parole period. 45. For an offence falling in the mid range of seriousness, he is the only one of the three charged with supplying. To determine whether his offence falls within the mid-range of seriousness, the Court is required to have regard to aggravating and mitigating factors set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168). I have already observed that supplying drugs is an offence against public health and in that sense against public safety (21A(2)(i)). However, danger to the public safety is an inherent feature of this offending. There is nothing in the evidence before me that raises this inherent feature to a point of aggravation.46. I am satisfied the offence was part of an organised criminal activity and that he was the principal person involved in much of that organisation. This offender secured his illicit drugs in Canberra, thereby reducing the risk of detection by New South Wales police at the point of supply. He had a network of regular purchasers who on-supplied to others. He used his brother and father to assist in delivery and collection of funds and to remove or diminish his risk of detection at the point of transfer of drugs and collection of money. At one point he directed his brother to better secrete drugs when in fear of detection, satisfying me that he was always conscious that detection was something to be avoided at all costs.47. Part of the organisation involved the possession and presumably the use of a number of mobile phones. The Crown also seeks to rely upon the ongoing activity as a matter of aggravation. There were four discrete collections of amphetamine and a fifth one frustrated. His actual supplies were regular, at least to some customers, throughout the period. However, the prosecution cannot have it both ways. Each supply was in itself a discrete offence in its own right, but would have been far less than a commercial quantity actually charged. There is (already) an inbuilt feature of aggravation built into the charge that is only achieved by aggregating the quantities supplied. The consequence of the aggregating is that the offender is exposed to the prospects of an increased maximum penalty and the prospects of a standard non-parole period. To take account of a series of criminal acts, (s 21A(3)(m)) constitutes a double counting. 48. My point is emphasised particularly in this case by recognising that the totality of amphetamine is 252 grams. The lower threshold for commercial quantity is 250 grams, thus this supply only just qualifies as a commercial quantity by three grams. Way’s case makes it clear that normally a plea of guilty, being a mitigating factor, s 21(A)(3)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act places the case outside cases normally attracting a standard non-parole period. 49. In this case, Codie Waters is also entitled to rely upon his prior good character as a mitigating matter that would support the setting of a shorter non-parole period than the standard non-parole period. Of course the impact of the accused’s good character as a mitigating feature is to some extent counterbalanced by the fact that this offence of supply is not to be viewed as an isolated incident. 50. There is evidence that Codie Waters was involved in supplying amphetamine prior to the charge period. I have taken into account the network and duration of offending conduct, but I would not classify this offence as falling within a mid-range. What saves it from so doing is the closeness of the total quantity supplied to the lower threshold of commercial quantity as provided by the schedule in the Act. Accepting as I do that some of the amphetamine was for own use, the amphetamine actually supplied as distinct from held for supply into the community may fall somewhere, and probably does fall somewhere, below the commercial quantity. The measure of harm to the extent that it can be gauged only by quantities supplied (see Kalache) is less than it would be in the bulk of cases caught by Item 18 in the table.Subjective features 51. The subjective features of the three offenders came from evidence of Jason Perrin, half brother to Codie, Shannon and stepson to Grant Waters. Codie Waters also gave evidence covering all three. There was no pre-sentence report or psychiatric/psychological profile on any offender. 52. Jason Perrin lives in the ACT. His past included a substantial period as a heavy drug user. He had turned his life around and is now involved in drug counselling. He is reputable, at least I take it to be so, because he is employed by the ACT Education Department. Prior to their incarceration, he had not seen the offenders for some years. However, since their arrest he has been a regular visitor to the Goulburn gaol where they are housed. 53. His first impressions were that their appearances were drawn, there was chalky residue on their lips consistent with drug withdrawal, blotched and pimpled skin and a strong evidence of an absence of personal hygiene. I should note; as the offenders presented in court after nearly two years in custody, each now looks well nourished, clear of eye, clear healthy skin and reasonably well groomed. Perrin gave evidence that he had noted a change in their appearance and personal hygiene. 54. His mother, Jessie Perrin, who he shares with Codie and Shannon, is also a reformed addict of some two years. Her relationship with Grant Waters is long finished. Perrin gave evidence that Sarah Porter, Codie’s partner, gave no indication of drug involvement, an important matter when assessing Codie Water’s rehabilitation prospects. 55. A feature of the case of each offender was the level of community-based support available to each. Perrin indicated a willingness to monitor the progress of each of the offenders in the community. He gave an undertaking to the Court to report to Probation and Parole any breach of parole rehabilitation conditions. That was done after he had heard conditions proposed by Mr Levet, counsel for the offenders, in respect of Grant and Shannon Waters. It was indicated by Mr Levet that Codie Waters was also willing to subscribe to and be bound by the same conditions upon his release. I note I was impressed by Perrin. Provided the offenders were prepared to cooperate with him and be mentored by him, their prospects for rehabilitation appear promising.56. While Perrin has the expertise in drug rehabilitation, his chances of impacting upon any of the offenders depends upon their commitment, not his. In the absence of any commitment by the user, the healer will have absolutely no power. Whilst the men have been in custody there has been some progress. I have referred to changes noticed by Perrin. Codie Waters gave evidence indicating a desire by all three to change their lifestyles. Grant Waters has attended an alcohol and other drug program focused on cannabis use reduction and tendered a certificate of completion. The relevant alcohol and other drug worker noted that the other two had also participated in a program when they first arrived, whatever that may mean. There is a difference I note, maybe just technical, between participated and completed. Grant and Shannon Waters are employed in the prison laundry and have been so for eight months. In respect of Grant and Shannon Waters, each has through his counsel indicated a willingness to accept the following parole conditions: 
     
     1. To reside at 32 Cole Street, Downer ACT or such other place as may be approved by probation and parole. That I am told is the residence of Grant’s mother and Shannon’s grandmother. There is apparently room there. 
      
     2. Attend not less than four meetings per week of the 12-step fellowship. (Narcotics Anonymous is such an organisation that follows the 12-step fellowship). 
      
     3. Accept the supervision of Probation and Parole or such other service as Probation and Parole directs. 
      
     4. Seek within three days to do all each can to maintain full-time employment with Radkon Constructions, 7 Brooke Street, Queanbeyan. The Court has been informed that Conrad Ward of this firm is willing to offer each full-time employment. I am assuming that that was something that had been checked out by the legal representatives. 
      
     5. Each is to accept random urine testing not less than four times monthly during the parole period. A failure to provide a sample of urine or the supplying of a fraudulent sample of urine is to be deemed a breach of the parole conditions. I note that the purpose of providing the random urine is for the purposes of testing the presence or absence of illicit drugs. The Crown did not seek to be heard when Mr Levet advised the Court that the Crown was agreeable to the overall sentence of three years with a two year non-parole period in respect of Grant and Shannon Waters. 
    57. The court does not have longitudinal details of the drug or alcohol history of any of the offenders, nor of the education, employment or general skills of the various offenders. In these circumstances, it becomes more difficult to attempt any meaningful assessment of these offenders’ rehabilitation prospects other than to accept there is a willingness by the offenders to rehabilitate and there is support from the family. Neither, Codie Waters, aged 28, nor Shannon Waters, aged 25, have any prior criminal history.58. Grant Waters, aged 51, has a variety of summary offences: common assault (1995), cultivate prohibited plant (1992), offensive behaviour x 3 (1990). There are driving and related offences in 1982, 1985, 1989, 1990 and 1979. There are also two charges dealt with in the Children’s Court in 1972 and 75. His total criminality through the years has been punished by fines totalling $1,160. He was placed on 12 months recognisance in 1995, which he appears to have kept. His record does not disentitle him to some leniency on this matter.Plea status59. Each offender was committed for trial. The defence case is that the DPP was not in a position to have meaningful discussions in respect of the plea until 9,000 tapped telephone calls were sorted out. I interpolate here the 9,000 calls did not involve just Codie Waters and MJW. The Crown desired to have transcripts of these calls and to sort out those involving these offenders. When each accused was arraigned in this Court the task had not yet been completed. Post-arraignment and well before the trial date there were ongoing discussions in respect of the plea. Well before the scheduled trial date, the Crown was aware there was to be a plea. It is not clear whether the Court was told in advance. I am told no Crown witnesses were required to attend on the trial date. Whether subpoenas were issued is not disclosed. The Court allows a discount usually between 10 and 25% for pleas of guilty. The quantum of discount is based upon the measure of its utilitarian value to the administration of criminal justice.60. The utilitarian value is not only measured by days of court time saved, estimated at two to three months, or the freeing up of Crown or defence resources for other cases. There is a utility also because the criminal justice system is served by guilty persons acknowledging their guilt. That sustains the community’s confidence in the administration of justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable.61. While these were not pleas from the outset, they did have significant utilitarian value. For example, I note that the case against MJW was dismissed. I have determined a 20% discount for the plea as appropriate in the case of Codie Waters. The transcript of this hearing will record that the plea discount did not figure in any overt way in the sentencing outcome that has ultimately been reached for Grant and Shannon Waters. Rather, it is because an alternative method of reaching a result I was seriously considering, namely s 11 bail, was proposed by the sentences suggested.62. My preliminary proposed outcome was predicated, among other things, by giving a benefit for the plea of guilty to each of Grant and Shannon Waters by the extension of the bail I was anticipating giving. At the end of the day it seems to me they still can say they have received the benefit of a plea.Deterrence63. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliament is to deter persons tempted to breach the provisions of the criminal law. Parliament does that by prescribing penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. Consequently when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In each case here it is 20 years’ imprisonment. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind those maximum penalties and their deterrent purpose. I should also mention there of course the standard non-parole period for the offence Codie Waters committed and its deterrent purpose. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals like-minded to each offender who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which the offenders are being sentenced. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to deterring him or her from re-offending.The impact of the guideline judgment64. The Attorney General’s reference 1 of 2002 requires a court, when taking into account a Form 1 matter in respect of an offence, to drive that sentence upwards from what otherwise may have been the appropriate sentence. That driving upward is on account of the additional criminality reflected in the Form 1 offences. All of the offences on each of the Form 1, had it stood on its own, would have been dealt with in the Local Court. The most serious of the offences is the receiving stolen property charge. None of the others, I am satisfied, would have resulted in a custodial sentence in the circumstances of each of these offenders. Had the receiving charge resulted in a custodial sentence, it would have been measured in months rather than anything else. Had the offence been on the indictment, the principle of totality would have then required taking all criminality reflected by the offending into account. That would have had the effect of driving down any sentence on the receiving charge. Thus the impact in this case of the Form 1 offences is to drive the sentences upward, but only in a very modest way.Parity65. The principles of parity do apply between Grant and Shannon Waters. Although Grant’s criminality is marginally less, he does have some past offences although I have noted their impact is very minor. For reasons I have explained, different offences, greater role and the impact of the standard non-parole period, parity does not apply between Codie Waters and the other two. HIS HONOR: Mr Crown you can’t help, but Mr Levet is there any significant matter I’ve left out before I go to the formal part of the sentencing?LEVET: No, your Honour. Save and except that this is on transcript. Your Honour made a comment in which your Honour presumed that inquiries had been made by legal representatives in relation to the jobs on offer and your Honour will recall on Friday of last week I advised you that those inquiries had been made and indeed that I had required to speak to the proposer of the employment.HIS HONOUR: That’s right. I’d forgotten that. Thank you very much for that.I will deal with Shannon and Grant Waters first if I may. Would you two gentlemen please stand up. Shannon Waters and Grant Waters, you are each convicted of the offence that you, between 1 January 2006 and 21 July 2006 at Moruya in the state of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine, being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. I set a non-parole period of two years to commence from 31 July 2006 and to expire on 30 July 2008. I find special circumstances. The basis upon my finding of special circumstances in each of your cases is that this represents your first time in full-time custody. You have a rehabilitation plan in place and the rehabilitation of each of you is better achieved and better tested by your being in the community rather than in the artificial environment of a gaol. I set a non-parole period in your case, Grant Waters, of nine months and in your case Shannon Waters of 12 months. Pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I set as conditions of your parole, as I am entitled to do, the conditions that I mentioned in my remarks on sentence. I w ill not repeat them. You may both sit down.66. Codie Waters, would you stand up please. Codie Waters, but for your plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of six years’ imprisonment for this offence. I should say in respect of all of you I have taken into account the offences on the Form 1. I discount that, as I said I would, by 20%, which amounts to a discount of 1.2 years. I round that out to fourteen and a half months. That gives an overall sentence of four years, nine months and fifteen days. I find special circumstances. The basis upon my finding is identical to the remarks I made in respect of Shannon and Grant Waters. I set a non-parole period of two years nine months and fifteen days to commence from 31 July 2006 and to expire on 15 April 2009. I set a balance of term of two years. Sit down.BHASIN: Your Honour, the Crown seeks a drug destruction order.HIS HONOUR: Not opposed?LEVET: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The drugs are to be destroyed in the usual way. I order a copy of these remarks taken out as the sentence imposed on Codie Waters is more than four years, but I will need a copy of the orders sent to the probation and parole people. What’s to happen there Mr Levet?LEVET: Will your Honour direct that they be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period?HIS HONOUR: Yes, they are both entitled to that and I do so direct. Each of the accused is to be released from custody on 30 July next week.LEVET: That’s in relation to Shannon and Grant?HIS HONOUR: Yes. Stop smiling, Codie Waters, that was a mistake. Each of the two accused, yes.LEVET: Will your Honour make an ultimate direction for date of parole in respect of Codie Waters?HIS HONOUR: I can’t. All I can do is recommend that he be seriously considered for parole. I can’t order his parole. Your sentence is more than three years and I can’t order the Parole Board. Your parole will be determined by the progress you make whist in prison and if Mr Perrin is accurate and you are accurate you ought to look forward to your release, but it is the Parole Board that makes the decision on what you deliver to them. I’ve ordered the judgment so there won’t be any need for them to pause looking for a judgment, it will be there.

      16189/07 Director of Public Prosecutions v Kailahi  
       
       
       
      REASONS 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Ms Lupe Kailahi was charged with the offence of driving whilst disqualified from holding a licence. She was driving a motor vehicle at the time that she was stopped by police for the purpose of a random breath test. The test proved negative. At the time of the test, the police officer asked Ms Kailahi if she had her driver’s licence with her, to which she replied in the negative. When asked if she actually held a driver’s licence, she again answered in the negative.  
     
      
    2 Ms Kailahi was, at that time, subject to an order disqualifying her from driving. The order was apparently made in her absence and while she was overseas. She told the learned Magistrate, who believed her (as do I), that she was unaware of the disqualification. Ms Kailahi was charged with the currently relevant offence.  
     
      
    3 When the charge was heard, his Honour Magistrate Brydon dismissed the charge on the basis that the prosecutor had not proved that Ms Kailahi knew that she had been disqualified from driving. As a consequence of that absence of proof, the learned Magistrate held that the prosecutor had not discharged its onus. The learned Magistrate held that, in the case of a charge of driving whilst disqualified from holding a licence, a necessary element, which the prosecution was required to prove, was that the person charged was aware of the disqualification.  
     
      
    4 From that judgment, the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals pursuant to the terms of s 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and seeks orders quashing and/or setting aside the aforesaid dismissal of the charge.  
     
      
    The Offence 
     
      
    5 Section 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who is disqualified by or under any Act from holding or obtaining a driver licence must not:  
         
          
          (a) drive a motor vehicle on a road or road related area during the period of disqualification, … 
           
          Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    Mens Rea and Mistake 
     
      
    6 The offence of driving whilst disqualified (or permitting same) was discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Vlahos [1975] 2 NSWLR 580. His Honour Chief Justice Street discussed the tests for determining whether mens rea must be proved as an ingredient of an offence and concluded that it was unnecessary for the Crown, or prosecuting authority, to prove mens rea to establish the offence in question (then a breach of s 7A of the Motor Traffic Act 1909).  
     
      
    7 While the presumption that mens rea is required is not easily displaced (He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 523), nothing in the recent adumbration of principle qualifies the application of the judgment in Vlahos. A fortiori, is that the case in circumstances where the provision, in identical terms, has been re-enacted after Vlahos and after He Kaw Teh.  
     
      
    8 The only other matter that requires attention is the question of whether there exists an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. That, too, is the subject of discussion in Vlahos and He Kaw Teh. In He Kaw Teh, the High Court clarified that, in statutory offences containing no mental element as an ingredient of the offence, except in the case of absolute liability, honest and reasonable mistake survives as a basis of exculpation. It is, notwithstanding common usage, strictly not a defence. Once raised by the accused upon evidence adduced, it is for the prosecuting authority to dispel any doubt that may have been raised by the evidence that the acts performed were the result of an honest and reasonable mistake.  
     
      
    9 However, that does not mean that the mere fact that, in this case, the driver was unaware of the disqualification, is sufficient to raise reasonable and honest mistake. Mens rea, if it were to exist, for the offence of driving whilst disqualified, would be satisfied by an intention to do an act prohibited by the legislature. In this case, the prohibition is upon driving if, as a matter of fact, the driver be disqualified.  
     
      
    10 However, the defence of honest and reasonable mistake applies only in circumstances where, were the facts believed by the accused to be true, the accused would have been guilty of no offence: Bergin v Stack [1953] HCA 53; (1953) 88 CLR 248 (per Fullagar J).  
     
      
    11 In the instant proceedings, even if the Crown were required to negative honest and reasonable mistake as to the existence of a disqualification, such a requirement would only apply in circumstances where, but for the mistake of fact, Ms Kailahi would be entitled to drive. As Ms Kailahi concedes, and as is clear from the conversation with the police officer, Ms Kailahi was aware that she was unlicensed and not permitted to drive. As a consequence, the “mistake of fact”, if it be one, is a mistake as to which offence was being committed.  
     
      
    12 In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for the prosecuting authority to negative or preclude the existence of such a mistake, however reasonable or honest it be.  
     
      
    Comments 
     
      
    13 It should be made clear that the matters raised by the learned Magistrate below, while not providing a basis upon which the charge could be dismissed as not proved, do give rise to matters that the Magistrate is entitled to take into account in assessing whether to record a conviction for that offence, or in determining, if a conviction were recorded, what, if any, sentence should be imposed.  
     
      
    14 I should emphasise that Ms Kailahi, who was, and remains, self-represented, was not called upon before the learned Magistrate below and has not, in these proceedings, sought to put submissions to the contrary of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Further, at all stages, Ms Kailahi has not denied the factual circumstance that she did not have a licence at the time that she was driving the vehicle and that, as a matter of fact, albeit without her knowledge, there was a period of disqualification, which included the period during which this offence occurred. In those circumstances, the parties will bear their own costs of these proceedings.  
     
      
    15 For the foregoing reasons, the Court made orders in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      (i) Pursuant to s 59(2)(a) of the  
      Crimes (Appeals and Review) Act 
       2001, the order of his Honour Mr W Brydon, Magistrate, made at Burwood Local Court on 17 August 2007, dismissing a charge against the defendant of driving while disqualified from holding a licence: s 25A(1)(a) of the  
      Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act  
      1998, be set aside.  
       
       
      (ii) The matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with in accordance with orders and reasons for judgment of this Court.  
       
       
      (iii) No order for costs.

      2007/00002620 REGINA v Ashraf KAMHA 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Ashraf Kamha, you have pleaded guilty to a charge of being privy to the fraudulent alteration of the books of FAI General Insurance Limited (FAIG) for which the maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for two years and/or a fine of $100,000. You have also asked, with the requisite consent of the Prosecutor, that there be taken into account an offence of failing to act honestly in the discharge of your duties, in substance, by permitting the fraudulent alteration to deceive external actuaries. I shall do this. 
     
      
    2 A somewhat unusual situation has arisen in that a submission on behalf of the Crown began and ended with a proposition that, in the circumstances, a sentence of imprisonment but fully suspended would be within the range of the proper exercise of sentencing discretion, and, your counsel effectively joined in support of it. Mr Richter QC who appeared with Ms Hinchey for you candidly stated that the Crown submission was fully accepted as appropriate to this case. I state at the outset that I propose to impose sentence substantially in accordance with the submission. There was some mild debate between counsel on matters which I regard as peripheral and, as leading counsel for the Crown observed, they are not matters which will, in the event, make any difference. 
     
      
    3 The central occurrence giving rise to the charge was the reduction on 2 January 1998 in the claims estimates recorded in the AEGIS database maintained by FAIG in respect of some 81 insurance files in a relevant total of about $24m. Ultimately this reduction flowed into publication by the holding company of a proclaimed trading profit of over $3m for the half year ending 31 December 1997 whereas, without the improper reductions, there should have been revealed a loss of just under $8m. 
     
      
    4 It was not your decision to implement these reductions, indeed it was made during a period of your leave which extended after 2 January 1998. However, you had been telephoned by a superior Wilkie who directed you to ensure that the person responsible for processing reductions did so in time for them to have effect in the half yearly accounts that I have mentioned. As a result you telephoned an employee Shorter and passed on the instruction which you had received to him. In turn, Shorter ensured that the appropriate person entered the reductions into the computer base. There were a couple that, within her authority, she could not make but this detail is now unimportant.  
     
      
    5 I accept that when you conveyed the instructions you were unaware that the ordered reductions were improper. They were improper because they did not emerge from any review or analysis of claims exposure nor, in the instances of inwards reinsurance, from any information received from lead insurers. 
     
      
    6 You returned to work on 5 January 1998. Other employees spoke to you raising queries about movements in claims reserves. One of them, McKay referred to a particular portfolio and you told him that the figures were the result of regular claims reviews and not expected to be permanent. You must have known by then that there had been no regular review leading to the reductions.  
     
      
    7 It is conceded by your plea of guilty that you came to know of the impropriety and became privy to it. You failed to bring it to the attention of authorities, however, I accept that you found yourself in something of a quandary. Previously when you had raised another matter of concern with Adler, who was, if I may put it this way, the holder of the highest rank in the FAI corporate structure, you perceived that as a consequence there was implemented a restructure by one aspect of which you were effectively demoted by being required to report to Wilkie. You considered this a humiliating removal of your former operating independence and discretion and I would assess that perception as reasonable. An attempt, if oblique, to raise with Wilkie the issue which has become the subject of charge was rebuffed by him. 
     
      
    8 Certainly by 21 January when you received an email containing updated estimates by Coopers & Lybrand, the external actuaries, you were aware of the improper nature of the reduction that had been made on 2 January. It is convenient to note at this point, in relation to the scheduled offence, that you were then aware that the fraudulently entered data relied upon by those actuaries was incomplete and inaccurate and that that would impact upon the half year results which would in due course be published.  
     
      
    9 Although the force of your circumstances is recognized, so also should be recognized the seriousness of offences by those like you who are vested with the powers and responsibilities of corporate governance. An expression in the insurance industry refers to “long tail” risks and that same expression could apply to the potential effects of a deception such as was elemental to your offending by observing that damage can flow along an extensive path affecting creditors, shareholders and indirect investors through unit and superannuation funds. 
     
      
    10 I turn to some subjective matters. You have no prior convictions and have previously led an unblemished life. The testimonials bear witness to this which is beyond the simple observation of an absence of prior conviction. I do not dwell upon the matter but I regard it as of considerable significance that at the time of the commission of offence you were not only suffering the pain of your perceived demotion in the company but the grief of the grave and ultimately fatal illness of your wife, during which you needed to cope with caring for your then young two sons. There was some minor contradiction in submissions as to whether your plea of guilty was timely. It suffices to find that on balance I consider that it was but importantly in this case it enhances a real remorse which I am satisfied that you harbour for having offended. The evidence demonstrates, to the extent that it may have been required, that rehabilitation has been achieved and it can be predicted with some confidence that you are unlikely to reoffend.  
     
      
    11 That opinion is confirmed by your agreement to give evidence in the forthcoming trial of Wilkie. I note also the statement by counsel of your intention to assist in civil proceedings brought by a liquidator who is seeking to recover damages from those responsible in order to try to assuage some of the financial losses which have been suffered. Legislation requires me to assess the value of your agreement and I will do so in due course.  
     
      
    12 Some submissions were directed to the outcome of proceedings against one Boulden another former officer of FAIG. These remarks are not an occasion for comparative analysis but in response to the submissions I record that I am satisfied that both objectively and subjectively you are entitled to greater leniency than he received.  
     
      
    13 No detailed submission was made concerning the possible penalty of a fine and I have no evidence of your present financial circumstances. Some statements were made by counsel concerning opportunities which you have lost by reason of inhibitions flowing from your offence. In the circumstances I turn my attention to the primarily available form of penalty. I am satisfied that imprisonment would represent an appropriate penalty in this case. I record that I have considered other available impositions, home or periodic detention and community service. 
     
      
    14 It has frequently been observed that an element of general deterrence is important in marking the consequences of a failure in the duty of executives to act honestly and responsibly, particularly as offences of that nature are often difficult to detect and prosecute. 
     
      
    15 Bearing in mind that a maximum penalty is generally reserved for the worst offence or the worst offender, against a maximum prescribed penalty of imprisonment for two years, I would assess an appropriate penalty reflecting the present offence and taking into account the matter on the schedule at a period of 12 months. In making that assessment I have given particular weight to an element of general deterrence. 
     
      
    16 I have borne in mind, as above indicated, that you were not the instigator of the misconduct. Counsel submitted that your offending emerged out of a failure of will, that is, to bring to the attention of authority that of which you had become aware. I would describe you as having adopted a position of wilful blindness to the fraudulent entries into the data base but that does not differ in substance from the submission which I accept as correct. 
     
      
    17 The expressed assessment has not taken into account the value of your anticipated evidence in the pending trial and represents what I would have assessed but for your agreement to testify. In the light of it I would assess an appropriate term to be 6 months imprisonment. In reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked the terms of the Crown submission that it would be within range to impose a sentence of imprisonment which might not have been fully suspended but for the offer of future assistance. 
     
      
    18 I consider that the overall circumstances, both objective and subjective, are such that an effective order should be made fully suspending that term of imprisonment of 6 months. I am conscious that such a period of imprisonment does not oblige the making of a recognizance release order but in this case I consider it should be made and that it should operate forthwith. 
     
      
    19 You should be aware that any breach of the recognizance to be of good behaviour which I will require you to enter may lead to the requirement that you serve all or part of the sentence which is now to be suspended. You have no doubt also been informed by your legal representatives of the possible consequences of failure to fully cooperate in accordance with your undertaking. 
     
      
    20 Ashraf Kamha, for the offence of being privy to the fraudulent alteration of the books of FAIG, and, taking into account the scheduled offence of failing to act honestly in the discharge of your duties as an officer of that company, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 months dating from today. I direct that you be released forthwith upon entering a recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months, also dating from today.

      2007/2621 R v Raymon YOUMARAN 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Shortly after midnight, in the early hours of Friday 13 December 2002, Raymon Youmaran shot and killed Mr Dimitri Debaz. For that act, Mr Youmaran has been charged with murder and has pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    2 Mr Debaz, the victim, was 28 at the time of his death. Mr Youmaran was 24 at the time that he shot Mr Debaz.  
     
      
    3 The crime of murder is regarded as the most serious of crimes because it involves the felonious taking of human life. The maximum sentence for the crime is life imprisonment, which penalty is imposed in the worst category of murder. Because the offence occurred in 2002, Mr Youmaran is required to be sentenced in accordance with the law as it then existed and there is no standard non-parole period for the offence.  
     
      
    4 The introduction of a standard non-parole period for the crime of murder had a significant effect in increasing the range of sentences generally imposed for the crime of murder and it is necessary to bear in mind the range of sentences that were imposed at the time that the conduct occurred, rather than at present.  
     
      
    5 Even within the crime of murder, a crime perceived as the most serious because of society’s view of the sanctity of human life, there is a range of culpability associated with the crime. In order to determine the objective features, which measure the culpability of Mr Youmaran and deal with his subjective circumstances, it is necessary to set out the circumstances of the offence. Before doing so, I briefly set out the purpose of sentencing in a case such as this.  
     
      
    Sentencing Principles 
     
      
    6 The purpose in sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. Each of these factors, particularly the protective nature of sentencing, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. These point most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation, in turn, impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is no single correct sentence and the often complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions.  
     
      
    Circumstances of this Offence 
     
      
    7 On 13 December 2002, Mr Youmaran shot Mr Debaz. It occurred in the following circumstances, which are taken largely from the agreed statement of facts tendered in the sentence proceedings. 
     
      
    8 At about 10.40pm on Thursday 12 December 2002, Mr Debaz, in the company of two friends, arrived at the Sefton “Playhouse” Hotel. On arrival, Mr Debaz met his brother Aleck and approximately 15-20 other friends, all of whom were there to celebrate Aleck’s birthday.  
     
      
    9 As one would expect, the group of people, of which Mr Debaz and his brother Aleck formed part, drank at the Hotel. They also watched a regular show performed by exotic dancers.  
     
      
    10 At about 12.25am on Friday 13 December 2002, Mr Youmaran arrived in the car park of the Hotel. He was with co-offenders Mr Rafael Joseph, Mr Sandro Mirad, Mr Sahir Marcus and Mr Samir Tiyadors. They arrived in a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    11 In the motor vehicle were two loaded firearms. Mr Youmaran was aware of at least one of them, being a Glock pistol. An inference is available that he had relevant possession of the pistol at this time, and perhaps exclusive possession. All five men, including Mr Youmaran, alighted the vehicle and walked towards the main entrance of the Hotel. They were filmed on a closed circuit television camera at the front door of the Hotel.  
     
      
    12 Within a matter of seconds after the five persons (hereinafter called “the second group”), including Mr Youmaran, entered the Hotel, they were involved in a fight with Mr Debaz, his brother Aleck and their large party of male friends (hereinafter called “the first group”). The fight was observed by a number of patrons inside the Hotel.  
     
      
    13 It is accepted that the second group, including Mr Youmaran, were not aware that the first group of men (including the victim, Mr Debaz) were inside the Hotel at the time that they planned to go there, parked there, or went inside. The first time, it seems, that they were aware of the first group being in the Hotel was on their entry. Likewise, it seems clear that the first group, including Mr Debaz, were not aware that the second group would be attending the Hotel later that night.  
     
      
    14 As is probably obvious from the short time between the second group entering the Hotel and the commencement of the altercation, there was some history of dispute between one or more of the second group and one or more of the first group. In particular, it seems that there was a history of dispute between Mr Rafael Joseph and Mr Sandro Mirad and members of the Debaz family. This history led to the fight, almost instantaneously, between them. It is not suggested (and there is no evidence that could be accepted) that Mr Youmaran had a history of animosity towards the victim, Mr Debaz, or his brother. The history with Mr Joseph and Mr Mirad related to an incident at a nightclub in October of 2002.  
     
      
    15 During the fight, Mr Tiyadors, a member of the second group, was being assaulted by the first group. When he was on the ground, it seems being punched and kicked, Mr Youmaran, together with Messrs Joseph, Mirad and Marcus ran from the Hotel. The fight inside the Hotel did not involve the use of weapons, except that a chair and a bottle were seen to have been picked-up and used during the fight.  
     
      
    16 The closed circuit television cameras captured the four persons running from the Hotel front door and heading back towards their car. Shortly thereafter, the victim, Mr Dimitri Debaz, is seen on the cameras to walk from the Hotel and into the car park. 
     
      
    17 The four men, including Mr Youmaran, ran from the Hotel towards the car and once there Mr Youmaran and his co-offender Mr Joseph have each obtained a nine-millimetre Glock handgun (from a position in the back of the seat) and started to walk back through the car park towards the front door of the Hotel.  
     
      
    18 Mr Marcus and Mr Mirad had entered the car, Mr Mirad in the driver’s seat, and slowly driven through the car park towards its exit, stopping just before the driveway.  
     
      
    19 In the meantime, Mr Youmaran and Mr Joseph, having walked towards the Hotel, fired 15 rounds of ammunition towards the Hotel. Ballistics evidence, together with the admissions of Mr Youmaran, establish that the gun he was firing was responsible for 10 bullets and Mr Joseph was responsible for 5 bullets.  
     
      
    20 Six bullets have struck and killed Mr Debaz who was, at that time, seeking to take cover behind other vehicles in the car park. The bullets that struck Mr Debaz came from the pistol used by Mr Youmaran.  
     
      
    21 Mr Youmaran’s co-offender, Mr Joseph, fired towards the front door of the Hotel from which, it seems, Mr Aleck Debaz and a Mr Mohammed Khalil were wounded in the leg. A number of bullets went into the front of the Hotel, striking targets, and these were predominantly, but not solely, fired from the gun of Mr Joseph. Mr Aleck Debaz and Mr Mohammed Khalil have, it seems, refused to assist police with the investigation of their shootings.  
     
      
    22 After the shooting, Mr Youmaran and Mr Joseph ran towards the waiting car, the near side doors of which were open, which was then driven from the Hotel.  
     
      
    23 Mr Tiyadors gave statements to the police and identified his companions on the evening. There were a number of meetings between members of the second group, at which the events of the night were discussed and at which some admissions were made.  
     
      
    24 On 11 March 2003, Mr Mirad was arrested. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, for which he was sentenced by his Honour Justice Barr on 6 August 2004 to two years and six months with a non-parole period of one year and six months: R v Mirad [2004] NSWSC 701.  
     
      
    25 Mr Marcus was interviewed by police and confirmed much that Mr Tiyadors had said. He has not been charged with any offence. Nor, as might be obvious from the above, was Mr Tiyadors. Mr Youmaran became aware that he was required by the police for questioning and/or would be subject to charge. On 16 April 2003 a warrant was issued for both him and Mr Joseph in relation to the charge of murder of Mr Debaz. Mr Joseph fled overseas and remained overseas for a significant period. While there is no suggestion that Mr Youmaran fled overseas, it is accepted that, while fully aware that he was wanted by police for his involvement in the murder of Mr Debaz, Mr Youmaran had continually avoided detection by police.  
     
      
    26 On the evening of Wednesday 31 May 2006, the police arrested Mr Youmaran. The information as to his whereabouts was obtained through police intelligence. The police, including a Tactical Operations Unit, went to his premises. Mr Youmaran came out of the premises and was arrested. He was taken to Fairfield Police Station and charged.  
     
      
    27 Mr Youmaran was interviewed by the police and made substantial admissions involving all of the matters relating to his direct involvement in the murder of Mr Debaz. It is accepted that the statement made by Mr Youmaran, in that interview, was a full and complete statement of his involvement in the offence. The interview given by Mr Youmaran included his cooperation in drawing a basic sketch of the crime scene and indicating relevant matters on that plan. He also identified a number of people in the CCTV footage and admitted that he was of the belief that the firearm was loaded at the time of the shooting and that the shooting would result in Mr Debaz’s demise.  
     
      
    28 Mr Joseph, the co-offender, had sought to evade detection by travelling overseas and was recently extradited from the United States of America. He is currently awaiting committal proceedings.  
     
      
    29 Notwithstanding the full and complete admission as to the events in the early morning of 13 December 2002, Mr Youmaran initially pleaded not guilty. It seems, and I accept, that the plea of not guilty was a result of acceptance of advice given to him by his then legal advisers that he had available to him issues associated with either or both self defence and provocation.  
     
      
    30 The previous advice relating to the availability of self defence and provocation has been seen by the Crown, but is not in evidence before the Court. It is not unreasonable for Mr Youmaran to rely upon an advice of legal practitioners as to the availability of a defence. It is, however, important, that Mr Youmaran, at no stage, resiled from the admissions of fact that give rise to the offence before the Court. When legal advice was given, which advice reflected the true state of the law on the facts, there was a change in plea, which Mr Youmaran, through his legal advisers, indicated to the Crown, a couple of weeks prior to the trial date.  
     
      
    31 The plea was entered (with an earlier indication to the Court) on the day first set down for the trial. The discount for a plea of guilty for which the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides is an assessment of the utilitarian value of the plea. I have recited the circumstances of his prior legal advice solely for the purpose of its effect, if any, on the decision to plead not guilty and, as a consequence, on what otherwise may be classified as remorse on Mr Youmaran’s part.  
     
      
    Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    32 It is clear that Mr Youmaran did not instigate the altercation in the Hotel. It is also clear that the attack on the deceased was not premeditated in the sense of the implementation of a premeditated and calculated plan to kill either Mr Debaz or anyone on that night. However, what is admitted by Mr Youmaran, in his record of interview, but is not clear on the agreed facts, is that three shots were fired into Mr Debaz, at close range, while he was on the ground. Even allowing for the degree of panic that, at that stage, may have engulfed Mr Youmaran, at least at or immediately before those shots, Mr Youmaran intended to kill this member of the group, which was fighting his friends.  
     
      
    33 However, it is also clear from the evidence before the Court that Mr Youmaran was not in any way the instigator of, or the cause of, the initial altercation in the Hotel. It was not Mr Youmaran who had a history of animosity, or feelings of animosity, towards anyone in the first group in the Hotel, including the deceased, Mr Debaz.  
     
      
    34 There is also evidence that Mr Youmaran did not fire shots until he had heard other shots fired. It is not clear whether Mr Youmaran had a view that these shots were from anyone other than Mr Joseph who was his co-offender.  
     
      
    35 Mr Youmaran has one prior offence for possession of a prohibited drug. The offence is neither an offence of violence nor an offence involving organised criminal activity and is wholly irrelevant to the murder charge for which he must now be sentenced. Mr Youmaran received a fine for his earlier drug offence and his arrest on this murder charge and his current imprisonment, since 31 May 2006, is the first time that he has been in gaol. 
     
      
    36 He was held in segregation for approximately 23 months until about 20 April 2007 due to fears for his safety. During that time, he experienced the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) he was not able to associate with other inmates; 
       
       
      (b) when he attended visits, he was handcuffed and wore orange overalls, which distinguished him from other inmates housed in the general population; 
       
       
      (c) he would be handcuffed when permitted to use the telephone to contact family or legal representatives; 
       
       
      (d) he would be handcuffed on each occasion he would leave the confines of his cell; 
       
       
      (e) he had limited access, if any, to education facilities; 
       
       
      (f) he could remain in his cell for up to 23 hours at any one time; 
       
       
      (g) when not in his cell, he was allowed to walk in the exercise yard which was approximately two metres by three metres with only limited sunlight.  
       
      
    37 Since being released from segregation, Mr Youmaran has commenced a Bible study course and, since his incarceration at Long Bay, has been attending a drug and alcohol counsellor.  
     
      
    38 During his incarceration, Mr Youmaran has also attended anger management classes, which are one-on-one counselling sessions.  
     
      
    39 From the certificates tendered through the affidavit of Mr Youmaran, it is clear he has, in relation to the Bible class, completed a number of the courses and has embarked upon supplementary courses, “The Christian Life”, which he completed on 12 June 2007. Further courses were undertaken and he has continued the courses that are available in that area until shortly before the sentence hearing.  
     
      
    40 Mr Youmaran was not cross-examined on his affidavit. Prior to, and at the time of, the offence in question, Mr Youmaran lived at home with his parents and siblings. He has one sister and one brother. In evidence adduced through Mr Youmaran’s sister, it seems that there have been reprisal attacks, occasioning damage to the home of Mr Youmaran’s parents as a consequence of this incident.  
     
      
    41 Other than the incident in question, Mr Youmaran seems to have been well liked and had a good sense of humour. He was, it seems, liked by his teachers at school and, as is displayed by his record or absence of it, has not been involved in criminal activity or displayed a propensity to violence. Mr Youmaran, in his letter to the Court tendered on the sentencing proceedings, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I made the interview [with police] to explain that I never intended to kill Dimitri Debaz and to show my remorse, I hope you have carefully viewed my interview and accept that I am very remorseful for the pain I have caused to the victim’s entire family, especially the mother who I believe is suffering the most. I know what happened was reckless, but the reckless behaviour was not deliberate but rather out of me panicking and discharging the firearm without thinking of what I was doing and not even knowing who I had shot at. I never knew the victim personally and on the night I had no idea as to who our attackers were or what was the reason behind their vicious assault on our group…. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Since the night of the murder, I have become very depressed and under extreme stress, not only have I ruined the lives of the victim’s family but my family as well. My parents, brother and sister have had to move to another home after their family home was attacked on two occasions.” 
        
       
      
    42 Mr Youmaran comes from a relatively good family, none of whom, it seems, have been involved in criminal activity. It is a religious family with whom Mr Youmaran enjoys a positive relationship.  
     
      
    43 Mr Youmaran is of Assyrian descent. He has never married and has no children. He had been in a serious relationship, for about 12 months, with a woman who was 2 years his junior. He has had no contact with her since the murder.  
     
      
    44 Mr Youmaran was apprenticed as a spray painter but did not conclude the apprenticeship. Prior to the murder, he had established his own business, buying cars at auction and restoring them at home.  
     
      
    45 Mr Youmaran had a long-standing substance abuse disorder, dating back to his teenage years, commencing with the drinking of beer and spirits at about the age of 14 years. He “graduated” to smoking marijuana at the age of 15 and his drug abuse escalated, at the age of 17, to the use of amphetamines and cocaine. It was for the possession of amphetamines that he was convicted at the age of 20. The report of Consultant Forensic Psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro, recounts much of this history. It also recites: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Youmaran stated that between the time of the offence and his arrest some three-and-a-half years later, his drug use dramatically escalated with him tending in particular to binge on cocaine. At his peak he was using in excess of seven grams with others over a one to two-day period. Attendant to his addiction he described intense paranoia, hypervigilance to danger and ongoing states of anxiety. During the ‘crash’ phase of his bingeing he would experience a severe recrudescence of symptoms of depression, with him then tending to self-medicate through further drug abuse. Mr Youmaran denied auditory hallucinations but conceded at times he would experience visual hallucinations and be overwhelmed with confusing chatter in his head. Against this backdrop he would abuse alcohol and cannabis in order to offset his symptoms.” 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Youmaran’s drug use ceased when he was arrested. The report of Mr Watson-Munro notes, consistent with a plethora of research findings, that Mr Youmaran stated that his use of drugs, cocaine in particular, made him reckless and “played havoc with his cognition particularly in relation to decision making, impulse control and his capacity to fully think through the consequences of his actions”. 
     
      
    47 Mr Watson-Munro repeats some of the history of Mr Youmaran and comments: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Youmaran described longstanding symptoms of depression and anxiety which I would trace back to his formative adolescent years. This offers some explanation into his early foray into drug abuse which paradoxically then attenuated his symptoms. He acknowledged that since the time of the offence his symptomatology has become exponentially worse adding ‘since this happened I feel dead’. To closer history taking, Mr Youmaran reports substantial anxiety, intense depression, a sense of despair regarding the future and a substantial reduction in his self-worth…. 
        
       
       
       
        
        … It is apparent however that Mr Youmaran remains subjective in his outlook in the context of his considerable psychogenic problems impacting upon his capacity to critically evaluate problem situations.” 
        
       
      
    48 Mr Watson-Munro’s opinion is to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “He [Mr Youmaran] describes a complex clinical history dating back to his adolescent years in the context of him experiencing some symptoms of depression and anxiety, which in turn led to an early introduction to substance abuse involving alcohol and initially cannabis. During his later teenage years Mr Youmaran commenced using stimulant drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine and I suspect that this in turn may have had some bearing upon his failure to complete his trade training as a spray painter.  
        
       
       
        
        In association with his symptoms Mr Youmaran has experienced questioning self-esteem over the years with all of his symptoms being dramatically intensified as a consequence of the current offence. Mr Youmaran expressed profound regret and remorse for what occurred which appears to be genuine.” 
        
       
      
    Mr Watson-Munro opines that Mr Youmaran, having detoxified in prison, and becoming involved in working with a drug and alcohol counsellor and anger management counsellor, has developed an insight into his problems, although he remains highly vulnerable at a psychological level. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    49 Murder is the most serious of offences and causes the most serious of consequences. This particular crime is objectively serious. It involves Mr Youmaran shooting-off a number of rounds and shooting Mr Debaz at close range, while he was on the ground.  
     
      
    50 The circumstances were not only dangerous to Mr Debaz, but generally a threat to public safety. The Court takes this into account in dealing with the seriousness of the offence. It is also an aggravating feature under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, it is impermissible to double-count that factor.  
     
      
    51 This was a murder in which a weapon was used and was committed in company. Mr Youmaran escalated the fracas by obtaining the weapon and using it. The effect on the deceased, Mr Debaz, and the effect on Mr Debaz’s family, was of the most serious kind.  
     
      
    52 At the same time, as is clear from the foregoing, the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, there was some level of provocation, in the sense that it arose out of an altercation, which was both unexpected and not at the instigation of Mr Youmaran.  
     
      
    53 Relevantly, the offender does not have any, or any significant, record.  
     
      
    54 Mr Youmaran has some prospects of rehabilitation. His success at detoxification and his education program, whilst in gaol, tend to suggest that there may be some prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    55 Mr Youmaran, as has been outlined already, provided statements and evidence of his involvement in the offence and, apart from the period during which he followed legal advice as to defences that were available, has acknowledged his criminal responsibility for the actions. Even during the time that he pleaded not guilty to murder, either on the basis of self defence or provocation lessening the offence, he accepted responsibility for his actions, in that he accepted that it was his act that caused the death and that its effect on the victim and his family has been devastating.  
     
      
    56 The offender has, as already stated, pleaded guilty. For that plea he is entitled to a discount, pursuant to the terms of s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which discount must reflect both the plea and the timing of the plea and its utilitarian value. The trial would not, otherwise, have been a long trial, but the plea obviated the trauma that, no doubt, the family of Mr Debaz would have suffered in observing or hearing about the events of the night. The range of discount is between 10 and 25 per cent for a plea of guilty. Given the timing of the plea, its utilitarian value, I accept the range available to me in this situation is at the low end, and I fix 12½ per cent discount for plea.  
     
      
    57 I am also urged by Ms Francis to allow further discount for assistance and remorse. I certainly take into account as a subjective feature the full disclosures that were made, albeit belatedly, in terms of the timing of the offence. I also accept that a degree of remorse has been displayed by Mr Youmaran.  
     
      
    58 While I have been invited to adopt a percentage discount that encompasses the plea of guilty, assistance and remorse, it is an approach that I do not favour.  
     
      
    59 However, the full and complete admissions significantly assisted the prosecution. While much of what was said was known, Mr Youmaran’s admissions enabled clear identification of Mr Youmaran as the person who fatally shot Mr Debaz.  
     
      
    60 Further, it evidences remorse, which has also been expressed by Mr Youmaran before the Court, and which, while deprecated by the Crown, is not challenged. 
     
      
    61 I do not find special circumstances. The ordinary ratio provides a sufficient period of supervised liberty at the conclusion of the imprisonment.  
     
      
    62 The more difficult task is determining a range of sentence for a murder committed in 2002.  
     
      
    63 I have had regard to the statistics from the Bureau of Crime Statistics & Research for the offence of murder. It is with great care that one must deal with statistics. Both the Crown and Ms Francis, for Mr Youmaran, acknowledge the difficulty in determining an appropriate range. Each of them refer particularly to the judgment of Bell J in R v Bassam Hamzy [2002] NSWSC 128. Counsel referred to a number of other judgments of the Court, in particular Regina v Cakovski [2003] NSWSC 1 a judgment of O’Keefe J.  
     
      
    64 In Cakovski, O’Keefe J sentenced a person to a term of imprisonment of just over 17 years, of which 11 years was the non-parole period. That sentence included a credit of just over 1 year’s incarceration. There are also significant differences between the offences in question in Cakovski and that with which the Court must here deal.  
     
      
    65 In Hamzy, Bell J sentenced the offender to a total sentence of 21 years’ imprisonment, of which the non-parole period was 15 years and 9 months.  
     
      
    66 While in Hamzy, the offender was charged with other offences, the sentence on the murder is, expressly, not set on the basis of taking into account any other matter. The sentence in Hamzy was imposed after a trial and conviction by jury. Hamzy, together with other sentences to which I was referred, evidences a range of sentences. The sentence now imposed, as already stated, takes account of the discount for plea, and allows for a degree of remorse, the full disclosure and the assistance associated with it. 
     
      
    Conviction and Sentence 
     
      
    67 Raymon Youmaran, you are convicted of murder in that on 13 December 2002, at Sefton in the State of New South Wales you did murder Dimitri Debaz.  
     
      
    I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 17 years and 4 months to date from 31 May 2006. That sentence will expire on 29 September 2023. In relation to that sentence, I specify a non-parole period of 13 years. That non-parole period will expire on 30 May 2019. 30 May 2019 will be the first date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Simpson J in draft. I agree with her Honour’s reasons and the orders she proposes. I wish to add a few observations with respect to the sentencing principle her Honour identifies to the effect that amelioration of the effects of a crime can be taken into account as a matter of mitigation on sentence. 
     
      
    2 Her Honour refers to the observation of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 448 to the effect that it is not the case that “an offender is able to purchase mitigation”. However, his Honour went on immediately to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where there has been a substantial degree of sacrifice involved in the repayment, that is a matter which may properly be taken into account by way of mitigation.” 
        
       
      
    3 These observations have been subsequently applied in cases in which there has been fraudulent misappropriation of monies. (See most recently Stratford v R [2007] NSWCCA 279 at [22]-[24].) 
     
      
    4 The reasons in Phelan were clearly appropriate in the context of a crime involving the loss of money. They, however, emphasise that something special is required for ameliorative conduct to result in mitigation of sentence. Merely taking a step to redress the effect of a crime on victims is not of itself enough.  
     
      
    5 In the present case that special additional element is to be found in the fact that it does appear that the applicant’s immediate recognition of his wrongful act played a significant, and quite possibly decisive role, in saving the victim’s life.  
     
      
    6 I agree with Simpson J that this is a circumstance of the present case that deserves recognition in the sentence. 
     
      
    7 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 27 April 2007 by Morgan DCJ, following his pleas of guilty to one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, and one count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 each charge carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; pursuant to Pt 3 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), a standard non-parole period of 7 years is prescribed in respect of each offence. 
     
      
    8 On the second count (malicious wounding) Morgan DCJ sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years, commencing on 2 July 2006; on the first count (maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm) she sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 4 years, commencing on 2 July 2007 – that is, cumulative upon the earlier commencing sentence by 1 year. The overall effect of the combined sentences is a total term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years. In reaching these sentences Judge Morgan gave effect to a finding that special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act existed justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    9 Both offences were committed in the early hours of 2 July 2006. The victims were Ms Lisa Hodgson, who was a recently estranged de facto/fiancé of the applicant; and Mr Glen Hanks, a friend of the applicant with whom Ms Hodgson had begun a relationship. Ms Hodgson was the victim of the first count; Mr Hanks was the victim of the second. 
     
      
    10 Although a statement of facts was in evidence, there was some dispute about its detail. On the facts as found or accepted by her Honour, late in June Mr Hanks moved into new rented accommodation, in the same street as, and very close to, the applicant’s home. Ms Hodgson assisted him in moving and unpacking, and stayed with him on the night of 1 – 2 July. At about midnight they were in bed. At that time the applicant knocked on the door, telling Mr Hanks that he had come around to check out his new premises, and have a beer with him. There is a significant discrepancy in the evidence with respect to his knowledge or suspicion that Ms Hodgson was present. According to Mr Hanks, he attempted to divert the applicant from the bedroom, where Ms Hodgson remained, by taking him to a room at the opposite end of the house. The applicant’s evidence was that he was initially unaware of Ms Hodgson’s presence, and became aware of that fact only after being told of it by Mr Hanks. The issue is relevant to the degree (if any) of pre-meditation involved in the offences. In any event, the applicant then produced a knife with which he struck Mr Hanks firstly in the left arm, and then in the right arm. He then ran into the bedroom where Ms Hodgson was, and swung the knife towards her. Mr Hanks followed, attempting to prevent the applicant from stabbing her; the applicant pushed him into a sofa, held his left arm, and stabbed him in the rib cage. (Again, a discrepancy can be discerned. According to the statement of facts, which, in this respect, must have been derived from Mr Hanks, the applicant produced the knife from the pocket of his jacket, suggesting that he had had it in his possession when he went to the premises; both in his statement to police, made immediately after the incident and in his evidence, the applicant maintained that he had picked up the knife, opportunistically, from a tray in the front room of the house, and that he had done so only after Mr Hanks told him that Ms Hodgson was going to move in with him. Morgan DCJ accepted the applicant’s account on this issue.) 
     
      
    11 Mr Hanks then ran from the house to seek assistance. During his absence the applicant continued to use the knife to stab Ms Hodgson repeatedly. During the course of the attack the knife broke. Mr Hanks returned and attended to Ms Hodgson, who was bleeding from the mouth and other wounds, and was apparently losing consciousness. The evidence is unclear as to the result of Mr Hanks’ attempt to obtain assistance; as will become clear below, this is of some significance. 
     
      
    12 The applicant left the house and went immediately to the home of the next door neighbours, Mr and Mrs Larkin, whom he asked to contact emergency services. He told Mr Larkin that he had stabbed Ms Hodgson in the chest. Having ensured that an ambulance was on its way, the applicant returned to Mr Hanks’ house, in the company of Mr and Mrs Larkin. There they remained until police arrived. The applicant told police that there had been “a bit of a domestic incident”, that he had been on anti-depressants, that it (the “domestic incident”) had “got out of hand”, and that he had stabbed Ms Hodgson. He also admitted having stabbed Mr Hanks. 
     
      
    13 Ms Hodgson was taken to hospital, showing signs of impending cardiac arrest. She underwent emergency surgery. Although her injuries were life threatening, she has made a good recovery and has a favourable prognosis. The outcome is principally due to prompt and efficient medical treatment.  
     
      
    14 The applicant gave evidence, disputing certain aspects of the prosecution’s version of the events. Most significantly, he maintained that he had not taken a knife to Mr Hanks’ house, but had picked up a knife from a kitchen table, when Mr Hanks told him that Ms Hodgson was present in the house and that the two were engaged in a sexual relationship. He also disputed an account given by the prosecution concerning the circumstances of the breakdown of his relationship with Ms Hodgson, saying that Ms Hodgson had in fact taken a large amount of money from his bank account.15 The dispute concerning the circumstances of the breakdown of the relationship, is, in my opinion, of little, if any, moment. It could not be suggested that theft of money by Ms Hodgson from the applicant in any way justified or mitigated his crimes. It is unnecessary to resolve this factual issue, and, in any event, the evidence does not permit any findings of fact to be comfortably made. 
     
      
    16 Also before the Court was a Victim Impact Statement by Ms Hodgson. She was 22 or 23 years of age at the time of the offences. Initially she did not recall the offence, but as her recall returned, she began to suffer nightmares which continued to the time of her statement, January 2007. She has a scar from her chest to her hips, and three stab wounds that, she said, served as a reminder to her what had happened. She has some permanent damage to her face, and some broken teeth. She suffers from headaches and toothache and was unable to drink cold drinks because they caused pain to her. She has some damage to, and numbness in, the left hand. She said that she feels afraid all the time, dislikes crowds and is suspicious about other people. She finds the attention given to her by others who know what happened difficult to deal with. 
     
      
    17 Mr Hanks was treated for stab wounds to the left arm and chest. Medical opinion was that while the injuries were “significant”, they were not life threatening. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was interviewed by police at the scene and again, later, in a formally recorded interview. On each occasion he fully admitted what he had done. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    19 In evidence were a pre-sentence report, and a psychiatric report provided by Dr Michael Giuffrida. As well, the applicant gave evidence. He was 45 years of age at the time of the offences. He said that, prior to visiting Mr Hanks, he had been in “a fairly depressed state”, and had consumed several beers, had slept in front of the television and, on waking, had gone to Mr Hanks’ home without looking at the time. 
     
      
    20 He expressed regret for his conduct, directly addressing Mr Hanks, who was present in court, and seeking forgiveness. 
     
      
    21 He had no prior convictions and had an impressive history of stable employment. Indeed, he referred to himself as a “workaholic”, a condition that he believed he had inherited from his father. His mother died of cancer when he was 5 years of age. He and his father and three siblings maintained close bonds. 
     
      
    22 Dr Giuffrida recounted some psychiatric history which involved an anxiety disorder with, perhaps, agoraphobia and/or panic disorder. This dated from about early 2004. There was also a suggestion of a family history of haemochromatosis, which is excessive iron concentration. The applicant appears to have inherited this condition and it may be that it has caused some liver impairment. The applicant was, at the time of the offences, taking prescribed medication for his psychological problems. Dr Giuffrida was of the view that that medication may have magnified the effects of the alcohol that the applicant had consumed prior to committing the offences. Dr Giuffrida, however, expressly disclaimed any finding that, for this reason, the applicant did not bear responsibility for his conduct. 
     
      
    23 Also in evidence was a pharmacological report, outlining the effects of the medication, particularly when taken in combination with alcohol. In short, Dr Starmer, who provided the report, said that the combination of the two was “more than additive”: - that is, that each interacts with the other in such a way as to produce an effect “greater than would be expected from the sum of the component parts”. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    24 Judge Morgan set out the facts in some detail (drawing heavily upon the statement of facts that had been put before her), together with the subjective matters disclosed in the two reports. She considered that the offence committed against Ms Hodgson (maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm), for the purposes of Pt 3 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, “certainly falls in the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind”. However, she considered that the offence against Mr Hanks came within “the lower end of objective seriousness for such offences”. She did not explain why she drew this distinction; it may be inferred that the number of stab wounds, the ferocity of the attack, and the very serious consequences to Ms Hodgson provide the explanation. 
     
      
    25 Her Honour expressly accepted the applicant’s account of how he came to be armed with the knife, and his evidence that he was unaware of Ms Hodgson’s presence in the house before his arrival. She considered it likely that the revelation of this fact, and the actual relationship between Ms Hodgson and Mr Hanks caused the applicant to lose control and pick up the knife. She considered it likely that the effect of the combination of the alcohol he had consumed and his use of medication was a contributing factor to his loss of control. 
     
      
    26 She accepted that he was “generally (sic - ? genuinely) remorseful and contrite for the commission of the offences …”. 
     
      
    27 She noted the pleas of guilty, and accepted that they were entered at the earliest opportunity and in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and allowed a discount of twenty-five percent. 
     
      
    28 She dealt, in accordance with s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, with both aggravating and mitigating features of the offences. She identified only one aggravating factor – the use of the knife. She identified a number of mitigating factors:· that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b)). In this respect she took into account the applicant’s evidence, that she accepted, that until his arrival at Mr Hanks’ house he was unaware of Ms Hodgson’s presence; and also his evidence, which she again accepted, that he had not been armed with the knife when he went to the premises; 
     
      
    · that the applicant had no record of previous convictions and was a person of good character (s 21A(3)(e) and (f)); 
     
      
    · that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)); 
     
      
    · that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and contrite (s 21A(3)(i)); 
     
      
    · that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the charges (s 21A(3)(k)); and that he had done so at the earliest opportunity (and that the pleas had “considerable utilitarian value”). 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    29 Two grounds of appeal were pleaded. They are expressed as: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentences are manifestly excessive, as is the effective sentence.” 
        
       
      
    30 The two grounds can conveniently be dealt with together. On behalf of the applicant it was contended that her Honour failed to take into account the evidence of the effect of the combination of alcohol and prescribed medication on the applicant. I do not accept that this is so. As I have already indicated, towards the conclusion of her Remarks on Sentence Judge Morgan said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may well be that his loss of control was contributed to by the effects of alcohol and medication. However it is apparent to me that he was fully aware of what he had done.” 
        
       
      
    31 It is true, as was pointed out on behalf of the applicant, that this appears towards the end of the Remarks on Sentence, and after the finding that the offence against Ms Hodgson fell into the mid range of objective seriousness. But that does not mean that it was not in her Honour’s mind at the time she made that evaluation. In fact, it came immediately after that finding and in the context of the matters her Honour considered to be mitigating factors. The sequence in which relevant matters are mentioned is not necessarily indicative of the relative importance given to those matters, nor of the various aspects of sentencing in relation to which they have been taken into account. What is important is that the offender, and the prosecution (and, indeed, the victims) are able to discern that the sentencing judge is seized of all relevant factual matters. I am quite satisfied that Judge Morgan was well aware of all relevant facts, including the one under present consideration, in making her evaluation. 
     
      
    32 It was also contended on behalf of the applicant that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the emotional impact of [the applicant’s] discovery of the relationship between the victims, his loss of control due to the effects of the combination of alcohol and [medication], which was accepted by her Honour, the spontaneous nature of his actions, and the fact that Ms Hodgson had recovered well from her physical injuries, …” 
        
       
       
      dictated a conclusion that the offence against Ms Hodgson, like the offence against Mr Hanks, fell below the mid range of seriousness for a s 33 offence. 
       
      
    33 These were all matters that were well known to Morgan DCJ, and taken into account by her. The fact remains that the offence against Ms Hodgson was extremely serious, and resulted in life threatening injuries, even though prompt medical attention saved her life. Not only do I not accept that the offence against Ms Hodgson was less than in the mid range of objective seriousness – in my opinion it would have been well open to her Honour to have found that it was considerably graver than such an offence.  
     
      
    34 Nor have I overlooked the applicant’s conduct immediately following the offences, in raising the alarm, ensuring that an ambulance (and police) were called, and making prompt admissions. But this goes to mitigation rather than the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence against Ms Hodgson. It will be necessary to return to this circumstance. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    35 The second ground is that the sentences, individually and in total, are manifestly excessive. Reference was made to the applicant’s prior clear history, and his immediate remorse, demonstrated by alerting the neighbours to what he had done and ensuring that an ambulance was despatched. Reference was also made to a number of precedential cases. Each of these involved attacks upon a single victim. It is true that some resulted in sentences significantly lower than the total sentence imposed upon the applicant. However, it is well established that there exists a range of sentences appropriate to any individual offence (or set of offences) and that a sentencing judge is entitled to sentence within that range. The individual cases referred to do not establish at all that either of the individual sentences, or the two in their combined effect, are outside the range legitimately available to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion, it must not be overlooked that the standard non-parole period for each of these offences is 7 years. True it is that, the applicant having pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period did not strictly apply (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168), but it nevertheless operates as a guidepost or benchmark. And the applicant was being sentenced for two offences, not one.  
     
      
    37 There is, however, one additional circumstance to which I now return. That concerns the applicant’s conduct in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In a dramatic reversal, he almost instantaneously sought the help of neighbours, disclosed what he had done, insisted on an ambulance being called, and waited until it had arrived. Given that the results of Mr Hanks’ efforts to secure assistance are uncertain, it may well be that it was the applicant’s conduct in so doing that ensured the prompt medical attention that possibly saved Ms Hodgson’s life. 
     
      
    38 This is not a circumstance that goes to the evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offences, which, by this time were complete. Nor is it an instance of conduct of the kind explained in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, (voluntary disclosure of otherwise undetected guilt) warranting leniency in sentence for the reasons there set out. And it goes well beyond throwing light on remorse or contrition, which were also well established. It goes to amelioration of the effects of the applicant’s criminal conduct. 
     
      
    39 This was an unusual case, in that the applicant took immediate, almost instantaneous, steps to ameliorate the consequences of his crimes; and, further, that, in the case of Ms Hodgson, those steps may well have had substantial beneficial, and ameliorative, effects. 
     
      
    40 Although reference was made, both in the facts and submissions, to this circumstance, Morgan DCJ was not asked to take it into account in this way. It appears to me that she did not. But it is something which, I have concluded, the applicant was entitled to have taken into account not as a mitigating factor catalogued in s 21A(3), but as a particular, and unusual, circumstance which may be called ameliorative conduct, justifying a measure of leniency on that particular basis. 
     
      
    41 The notion is not unique. There have been cases, such as property crimes, where leniency is justified because reparation has been voluntarily made prior to any charges being brought or anticipated. That is an appropriate analogy. 
     
      
    42 My researches have yielded no explicit statement of principle to the effect that voluntary rectification can operate in mitigation of sentence. Indeed, in respect of property crimes, it has been held that voluntary repayment of the proceeds of the criminality cannot be used to “purchase mitigation”: R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 448, per Hunt CJ at CL. But that very circumstance was accepted on a relevant sentencing factor in R v Conway [2001] NSWCCA 51; 121 A Crim R 177, per Heydon JA, in R v Berlinsky [2005] SASC 316, and in Dowling v Phillips, Supreme Court of WA, 15 August 1995 per Heenan J. (And these were, in contrast to the present, cases where the ameliorative conduct occurred after the offender was charged, or when aware that he or she was to be charged. (That is not here of great importance: there could have been no doubt that the applicant would have been identified as the perpetrator of the attacks, and charged.) 
     
      
    43 In my opinion it ought now be accepted that, in an appropriate case – and, it may be said, there are few examples of appropriate cases, at least that came before this Court – conduct of the kind engaged in by the applicant warrants some consideration in mitigation of sentence. (I stress that I have twice referenced to “mitigation of sentence”. That is different from, and not to be confused with, mitigation of the offence: the latter concept is concerned with the evaluation of objective gravity.) 
     
      
    44 Although, on an objective analysis, the applicant’s criminality did warrant a total sentence of the magnitude imposed, to my mind his immediate post crime ameliorative conduct (and its significant consequences) entitle him to some reduction in the totality of those sentences. 
     
      
    45 I propose that both the head sentence and the non-parole period be reduced by 1 year. The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) leave to appeal granted; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) in respect of the sentence imposed for count 1, appeal allowed, sentence quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) on that count the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 2 July 2007 and expiring on 1 July 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring on 1 July 2013. 
        
       
      
    46 PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J. I also agree with the observations made by Spigelman CJ.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I have the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Hall J and I agree generally with the reasons given by his Honour for the decision by the Court, which was announced at the conclusion of the hearing on 23 May 2008, that the appeal against conviction should be allowed and a new trial ordered. I wish, however, to make some remarks of my own on two matters.  
     
      
       
      (1) Non-compliance with s.55F(2) of the Jury Act 
       
      
    2 The condition in par (a) of sub-s 2 of s.55F of the Jury Act, which must be satisfied before a majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings is that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      The condition is not simply that the jurors have deliberated for a period of not less than 8 hours. 
       
      
    3 In the present case the transcript of the trial proceedings on 22 May 2007 shows that, after the jury sent the note to the effect that the jury had been unable to reach agreement on two counts, the trial judge, in her discussion with counsel in the absence of the jury, explicitly referred to a period of 8 hours having elapsed since the jury commenced deliberating but made no explicit reference to whether her Honour considered that the period of time for which the jury had been deliberating was reasonable, having regard to the nature and complexity of the proceedings. Her Honour made no explicit reference to matters which should have been regarded as relevant to a determination of whether a reasonable period of time had elapsed, including that the trial had been a joint trial of two accused, that there were as many as eight counts in the indictment, that at least four different kinds of offences had been charged and that the trial had lasted more than a month.  
     
      
    4 On this appeal it was submitted by counsel for the Crown that it could be inferred, particularly from her Honour’s rejection of the submissions made to her by counsel for the two accused, that her Honour had tacitly considered the question of whether a reasonable period had elapsed and had tacitly made a determination that the period for which the jury had been deliberating was a reasonable period.  
     
      
    5 I do not consider that this inference could properly be drawn. In my opinion, a fair reading of the transcript of the discussion between the trial judge and counsel on 22 May 2007 is that throughout the discussion the trial judge remained of the view that what mattered was that the jury had been deliberating for not less than 8 hours and that her Honour gave no consideration to whether the period for which the jury had been deliberating was a reasonable time. I note that after the discussion had concluded and her Honour gave her directions to the jury, she said in a part of those directions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You having now been deliberating for eight hours, the law provides that I can accept a majority verdict…” 
        
       
      
    6 In any event, I consider that it is necessary for a trial judge, before directing a jury that a majority verdict may be returned, to clearly demonstrate that he or she has considered s.55F(2) and inter alia has found that the full terms of paragraph (a) are satisfied. 
     
      
       
      (2) The directions given by the trial judge 
       
      
    7 Parts of the directions given by the trial judge on the morning of 22 May 2007 are set out in Hall J’s judgment. However, I consider that there is utility in setting out the directions in full. Her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Member of the jury, you sent a note to say that you have stalemated on two of the counts that you are considering and so there are some further directions of law that I am going to give you. 
        
       
       
        
        I do have the power to discharge you from giving a verdict. I am not going to do, so, at this stage, I should only do so if I am satisfied that there is no likelihood of a genuine agreement being reached among you after further deliberation. 
        
       
       
        
        But I should say to you that you having now been deliberating for eight hours, the law provides that I can accept a majority verdict which would require eleven of you of the twelve to agree if you cannot reach unanimous verdict. But I would emphasise to you that it is preferable that you continue to deliberate and try and reach a unanimous verdict. A unanimous verdict is preferable to a majority verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        The courts’ experiences over the years have shown that if juries are given more time to consider and discuss the issue, they can, they often will come to an agreement. But if after calmly considering the evidence and listening to what each of you have to say, you cannot honestly agree with the conclusions of other jurors, then you must give effect to you own view of the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Each of you swore an oath, or affirmed at the start of the trial to give a true verdict according to the evidence. That is an important responsibility and it involves that you judge the evidence fairly and impartially in the light of that oath. You also have a duty to listen carefully and objectively to the views of every one of your fellow jurors. You should calmly weigh up one another’s opinions about the evidence and test them by discussion. A calm and objective discussion of the evidence often leads to a better understanding of the differences of opinion between you and may convince you to change your original opinion. That is not, however, to suggest that you can consistently with your oath or affirmation as a juror join a verdict if you do not honestly and genuinely think that it is the correct one. 
        
       
       
        
        But because experience has shown that often jurors are able to agree if they are given more time to consider and discuss the evidence, I am going to request you to continue deliberating on the matters about which you are in disagreement and to make a further attempt to reach a verdict. I am going to ask you to continue deliberations with a view to reaching a unanimous verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        If, after you have deliberated for some more time, you come to the view that it is impossible for you to reach a unanimous verdict, then you can consider whether you are able to return a majority verdict on these two counts, that is, eleven of you, of the twelve. 
        
       
       
        
        They are the only options available, a unanimous verdict, or a majority verdict by eleven of you agreeing. So, I am going to ask you to go out in the light of those directions and ask you to deliberate further, please.” 
        
       
      
    8 Almost immediately afterwards the trial judge directed the jury that there was a third option or possibility, that the jury would be unable to reach either a unanimous verdict or a majority verdict. 
     
      
    9 The second, fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of these directions followed, not absolutely precisely but very closely, the model direction in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and McHugh JJ in Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44 at 49. In the third and seventh paragraph of the directions the trial judge directed the jury that a majority verdict of 11 to 1 could be accepted, if the jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, but that it was preferable that the jury should continue to try and reach a unanimous verdict.  
     
      
    10 The directions that a majority verdict could be accepted were incorrect, in that the condition in par (a) of s.55F(2) had not been fulfilled and for this reason by itself the ground of appeal against conviction, that the trial judge erred in the directions she gave the jury about the availability of a majority verdict, should be upheld.  
     
      
    11 A further submission was made by counsel for the appellant that by directing the jury that a majority verdict could be accepted, at the same time as giving a Black direction, the trial judge had undermined the Black direction. An important purpose of a Black direction is to encourage jurors to attempt to resolve their differences and to seek to come to an agreement. It was submitted that it undermines or at least derogates from the fulfilment of this purpose for the jury to be told that a majority verdict can immediately be returned.  
     
      
    12 Both counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Crown referred to the decision of this Court in RJS v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 100. In RJS the principal judgment was given by Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed.  
     
      
    13 In RJS, as in the present case, the trial judge had failed to determine what period of time for the jury’s deliberations was reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the proceedings. In RJS the trial judge made a further error of not complying with par (b) of s.55F(2), by not having one or more of the jurors examined on oath, with the consequence that the trial judge could not have the state of satisfaction required by s.55F(2)(b).  
     
      
    14 A further ground of appeal in RJS was that the trial judge had erred in directing the jury, by combining a Black direction with a direction about the availability of a majority verdict. 
     
      
    15 In RJS the jury, after they had been retired for some hours, had sent a note to the trial judge to the effect that no more progress could be made towards reaching a unanimous verdict. In a discussion between the trial judge and counsel in the absence of the jury as to what further directions should be given to the jury, it was agreed that by 2:30 that afternoon eight hours would have elapsed and a majority verdict could be accepted.  
     
      
    16 At 2:15 pm the trial judge gave his further directions to the jury. The trial judge gave a Black direction in similar terms to the Black direction given by the trial judge in the present case. However, the trial judge also gave the following direction:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If, in fact, after further discussion you are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, then there is now in New South Wales as of very recently a provision whereby if eleven of you agree then a verdict can be returned. I have not mentioned that to you before because the law provides that that can only happen if the jury have been deliberating for eight hours. We have kept a note of the times and certainly by 2.30 today you will have been deliberating for eight hours. If 2.30 came and you were unable to reach a unanimous decision but eleven of you agreed, then you would be entitled to return a verdict at that time.” 
        
       
      
    17 At 2:45 pm the jury returned with a verdict of guilty, stating in a note to the trial judge that the verdict was a majority verdict.  
     
      
    18 It was submitted on the appeal in RJS that the effect of the Black direction had been undermined by the fact that at the same time as giving the Black direction the trial judge had directed the jury that in about 15 minutes’ time they could return a verdict of guilty with a majority of 11.  
     
      
    19 The Chief Justice held in par 22 of his judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, his Honour did undermine the effect of the  
        Black 
         direction. No further direction should have been given at this time.” 
        
       
      
    20 A distinction between RJS and the present case is that in RJS the time at which a majority verdict could be accepted, according to the trial judge’s directions, had not yet arrived, although it was only a few minutes away, whereas in the present case the jury were told that the time at which a majority verdict could be accepted had already arrived. On this appeal counsel for the Crown submitted that this distinction between the two cases was in favour of the Crown.  
     
      
    21 There is, however, a contrary argument that this distinction favours the appellant. If it undermines a Black direction for a trial judge to tell a jury that a majority verdict could be accepted in a few minutes time, it would undermine a Black direction even more for a trial judge to tell a jury that a majority verdict is immediately available. 
     
      
    22 The directions given by the trial judge were generally in accordance with suggested directions in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. However, suggested directions in the Bench Book have no special status. The Bench Book does not contain an authoritative statement of the law R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at 15 (73). Suggested directions in the Bench Book are not immune from appellate review R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at (93). The suggested directions presently in question first appeared in the Bench Book before RJS was decided and, although RJS is now referred to in notes in the Bench Book, no change has been made to the original suggested directions.  
     
      
    23 I have concluded that, because it is unnecessary to make a decision on whether the further submission by counsel for the appellant should be accepted, in order to determine the appeal or to determine that both grounds of the appeal should be upheld and because the directions given by her Honour followed suggested directions in the Bench Book and because argument on this aspect of the appeal was fairly brief, I should not make a final determination on whether the submission should be accepted. It does appear to me that in the present case it might have been a preferable course for the trial judge to have given a Black direction without referring to the possibility of a majority verdict, to have allowed the jury some further time in which to endeavour to reach a unanimous verdict and only then, if the jury was still unable to reach a unanimous verdict, to have put into effect s.55F of the Jury Act.  
     
      
    24 HOEBEN J: I agree with the reasons of James J and Hall J that there was non compliance with s.55F(2) of the Jury Act and that consequently the appeal against conviction should be allowed and a new trial ordered.25 For the reasons set out by Hall J and discussed by James J, I am inclined to the view that the effect of the Black direction was undermined by the fact that at the same time as giving the Black direction the trial judge directed the jury that they could return a verdict of guilty with a majority of eleven. 26 It is unnecessary to reach a final decision on that issue since the failure by the trial judge to comply with s.55F(2) of the Jury Act is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. Accordingly, I leave open for a future occasion whether her Honour’s directions as a whole undermined the Black direction so as to entitle the appellant to succeed on the appeal. 
     
      
    27 HALL J: On 18 April 2007, the appellant, Roger Hanna, and his co-accused, Ali Issa, were jointly indicted and tried in the Sydney District Court on a number of charges, the particulars of which appear below. 
     
      
    28 On 22 May 2007, the jury returned its verdicts. The appellant was found guilty on Count 1, but not guilty on Count 2, Count 3 and Count 8. The appellant’s co-accused was found guilty on Count 1 but not guilty on Counts 2 to 8 inclusive. 
     
      
    29 On 15 June 2007, the appellant was sentenced on Count 1 to imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years and three months to commence on 13 August 2005 and to expire on 12 November 2008 with an additional term of three years to expire on 12 February 2012.

    31 A notice of appeal against conviction and a document entitled “Grounds of Appeal” both dated 19 December 2007 were filed on behalf of the appellant. There were two grounds as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in the directions she gave to the jury as to the availability of a majority verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2: Section 55F of the Jury Act 1977 was invoked in circumstances where it was not permissible to do so and in the result the appellant did not get a trial according to law.” 
        
       
      
    32 The appeal was heard by this Court on 23 May 2008. On that date, the appeal against conviction was allowed and a new trial was ordered. 
     
      
    33 The appeal was allowed upon the basis that the trial judge had erred in invoking the majority verdict provisions in s.55F of the Jury Act 1977. On the last-mentioned date, the Court stated that it would publish its reasons at a later date. These are those reasons. 
     
      
       
      Summary of facts 
       
      
    34 The written submissions for the appellant contained a brief summary of the events that led to the appellant and his co-offender being charged with the above offences. That summary, in part, is reproduced below:- 
     
      
       
        
        “4. The case involves the culmination of events occurring between 10 and 14 April 2005 relating to a drug transaction involving 500 g of methamphetamine. … The alleged offenders were Kriangsak Khieopan (known as Jack), Ali Issa and Roger Hanna. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Kriangsak Khieopan gave evidence for the Crown at Mr Hanna’s trial. 
        
       
       
        
        6. It was alleged that the adult victims and the alleged offenders were involved in a transaction to procure the methamphetamine for a group of bikies. In the process of dealing with the drug it was said that different grades of the drug were mixed and another ingredient added which spoiled it. Ultimately the bikies were unhappy about the product and wanted their money back. 
        
       
       
        
        7. It was alleged that Mr Issa and Mr Hanna became involved in finding the money to repay the bikies and believed  
        [one of the victims] 
         may be holding the money. Evidence was given that the men went to the residence of  
        [the victim]  
        where he lived with his de facto wife, … and their child, …. It was alleged, amongst other things, that Mr Hanna was involved in detaining  
        [the victim] 
        , occasioning actual bodily harm … and taking money.” 
        
       
       
      Trial events 
       
      
    35 The trial commenced on 18 April 2007 and continued until 22 May 2007. 
     
      
    36 On 18 May 2007, the trial judge commenced and completed the summing up. The jury retired to consider its verdicts at 1.10 pm on Friday 18 May 2007. 
     
      
    37 The jury continued its deliberations on Monday 21 May 2007. On two occasions that day, the jury sent questions by note to the trial judge and those questions were in turn dealt with following which the jury resumed its deliberations. 
     
      
       
      The majority verdict direction 
       
      
    38 On 22 May 2007, the jury advised the trial judge by note that they were stalemated on two counts. The trial judge then discussed the note with counsel, in the absence of the jury. 
     
      
    39 On the basis of the jury having retired to consider its verdicts at 2.00 pm on Friday 18 May 2007, the time spent deliberating on Monday 21 May 2007 (omitting the lunch adjournment) and the one hour spent deliberating that morning, the trial judge stated that “eight hours has just elapsed” (T.22 May 2007, p.1). As the jury had failed to reach unanimous verdicts after eight hours of deliberations, the trial judge informed counsel of an intention to bring back the jury for the purpose of a perseverance direction (a Black direction in accordance with the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and McHugh JJ in Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44 at 49) and to additionally inform the members of the jury of the option of a majority verdict (T.22 May 2007, p.1). 
     
      
    40 The trial judge then observed and proposed that, as eight hours had elapsed, she would give a Black direction and urge the jury to continue to reach a unanimous verdict.  
     
      
    41 The trial judge then inquired as to whether the Crown agreed with what was proposed. The Crown Prosecutor responded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “No, your Honour, I think the act allows that after eight hours your Honour, I think, does have a discretion not to allow, or give them the opportunity of a majority verdict at this stage depending on the length of the trial etc, but your Honour, I don’t really know how complicated this trial was, or those types of matters so …” 
        
       
      
    42 The trial judge, at that point, emphasised that the jury had been deliberating since two o’clock on the previous Friday and then added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: So, I think given that the legislation says that eight hours is the time, I’m minded to tell them that it’s open to them. I can’t see any reason why I should hide from them … 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: -- hide it from – I suspect, well, it may be that they’re stalemated, their numbers were broad, that they won’t be able to reach even a majority verdict, but I should tell them that and I think then give them a short time to consider their position before – or for them to come back and say whether they will or not. Mr Williams?” 
        
       
      
    43 Counsel for the co-accused then responded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “WILLIAMS: I’d ask your Honour, rather than give a direction as to a majority verdict, first of all, give them a Black direction then wait some time and see what happens then, and then if they still come back and say they can’t resolve it, having been given a Black direction, then to give them a direction about majority verdicts. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Why do you say I should wait, given that the time has arrived when a majority verdict is available to them? 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS: Well, it is your Honour, but one has to take into account the length of the trial, I would have thought, that it’s been a five week trial. The evidence is fairly detailed evidence. There’s a lot of evidence and, in my submission, your Honour, it would not be appropriate at this stage, seemed  
        [sic] 
         that it’s only, it would just be an eight hours, I think your Honour, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … and the eight hours is the minimum period before one can give that direction. In my submission, as I said, given the length of the trial, the issues in the trial, the number of issues they’ve had to consider, eight, I think, there are seven or eight counts on the indictment, that it would be appropriate not to give that direction at this stage, but rather to give a Black direction at this stage. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well, I was proposing to give a Black direction first and say, a unanimous verdict is preferable but if they can’t reach a unanimous verdict, a majority verdict is open to them. 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Send them away to consider it further. I mean the position always is a unanimous verdict should be reached if it can. 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS. Yes, well perhaps after a Black direction they may well reach a unanimous verdict but if they come back some time later and say, well, we’re still deadlocked, it might then be the appropriate time to give them a direction as to a majority verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: How long do you say would be the minimum time before -- 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS: Well, I would have thought at least 15 hours or so, given the length of the trial.” 
         (T.22 May 2007, pp.2-3) 
        
       
      
    44 Counsel for the appellant then addressed the trial judge and stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “CARROLL: Your Honour, I would have to support Mr Williams’ submission. I would have thought the length of the trial and that really even though we had the odd day where we didn’t sit, there was a lot of evidence, a lot of evidence. I mean, I just found that simply in preparing my closing address and there’s eight counts and two accused -- 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: But they say there are two counts that they’re stalemated. 
        
       
       
        
        CARROLL: Certainly it may – I mean, we don’t know how they’re deliberations have gone. It may be that they have spent the whole time on those two counts, or – I mean, we don’t know the proportionality. They seem to be working efficiently, if one looks at their questions, and I think, considering the length of the trial, considering the number of different witnesses and the contradictions in evidence and I would be in support of simply a Black direction but no mention of a majority verdict at this stage. Give them some more hours, may be the end of the day see if a resolve comes of that and if it doesn’t then I would submit it would be appropriate for a majority verdict direction. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Alright, thank you. Alright, well, I note what you both say, but I am going to mention the majority verdict given the time has elapsed and I’ll emphasise to them that they ought to first of all try and reach a unanimous verdict, but I am not going to hide from them the legislative provision. Bring the jury in, please.”  
        (T.22 May 2007, p.3) 
        
       
      
    45 The jury returned to court at 11.15 am. The transcript then records at pp.3 to 4 the further directions given to the jury in response to the question raised. After referring to the trial judge’s power to discharge the jury from giving a verdict but stating that the power would not be exercised at that stage, the trial judge proceeded to then address and instruct the jury about the matter. The trial judge, in part, stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But I should say to you that you having now been deliberating for eight hours, the law provides that I can accept a majority verdict which would require 11 of you of the 12 to agree if you cannot reach unanimous verdict. But I would emphasise to you that it is preferable that you continue to deliberate and try and reach a unanimous verdict. A unanimous verdict is preferable to a majority verdict.” 
        
       
      
    46 The trial judge then gave the jury a Black direction, following which she stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If, after you have deliberated for some time, you come to the view that it is impossible for you to reach a unanimous verdict, then you can consider whether you are able to return a majority verdict on these two counts, that is, 11 of you of the 12. 
        
       
       
        
        They are the only options available, a unanimous verdict, or a majority verdict by 11 of you agreeing. So, I’m going to ask you to go out in light of those directions and ask you to deliberate further, please.” 
        
       
      
    47 The jury then retired at 11.19 am. 
     
      
    48 The jury were recalled at 11.20 am. The trial judge clarified what she had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When I said to you the only options are unanimous verdicts, or as a second option, a majority verdict, if you come to a time where you decide among yourself that you cannot reach either of those verdicts, then you can tell me that you cannot reach a verdict. But the point of my bringing you in here was to urge you to go out and consider the matter further and try to reach a unanimous verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        If you find after considering the evidence closely and discussing amongst yourselves you cannot do that, then you consider a majority verdict, if, after having giving it a reasonable time and discuss it to the point where you find that, or you come to the view that you will not be able to return a majority verdict, then you will tell me that. So, in saying that those are the only two options, I do not mean to say to you that you cannot come and say that you will not be able to reach a majority verdict if that is the case, but I am encouraging you to consider the matter further amongst yourselves. Alright, thanks, you can go.” 
        
       
      
    49 The jury then retired at 11.21 am. 
     
      
    50 A further jury note was received by the trial judge. The transcript recorded the trial judge as stating:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury have sought some clarification that when I said I have the power to discharge them if they could not reach a unanimous decision, whether that means all the verdicts that you have agreed upon, or just those they have not agreed upon, so I better bring them back in and clarify that.” 
        
       
      
    51 The jury then returned at 11.58 am and further directions were given by the trial judge. The jury then retired to further consider its verdict at 12.00 noon. 
     
      
    52 A further jury note was received and the trial judge recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury have sent a note to say that on two counts, they have reached a majority verdict, 11 to 1, that one juror is adamant that their verdict will not change, nor will that of the remaining 11 jurors. On all other counts they have reached a unanimous decision, so, I’m inclined to bring them back in and take the verdicts without having the foreman in the witness box, but if anyone requires me to have evidence from him on oath, if that is their position, I will do that. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I think that the Act requires – could I just have that copy back, I just had a copy of the Act this morning – s.55F of the Jury Act referring to majority verdicts, subsection 2  
        ‘A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if’, and then it goes through the eight hours, that’s (a) and ‘(b) The Court is satisfied after examination on oath of one or  
        [sic]  
        more the jurors that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation’. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Thanks, alright, well, I’ll have the foreman examined on oath. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, perhaps that’s advisable, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    53 The transcript recorded that the jury returned to Court at 3.05 pm. The jury foreperson was sworn at 3.06 pm and the trial judge then put questions to him. In particular, the trial judge inquired, whether, if the jury had more time in relation to the two counts in question, they would be able to reach a unanimous verdict on them. The foreman indicated in the negative. 
     
      
    54 The jury soon after returned with the verdicts referred to in paragraph [28]. 
     
      
       
      The statutory provisions 
       
      
    55 Section 55F of the Jury Act 1977 provided for the taking of majority verdicts from a jury in criminal proceedings in New South Wales. This legislative provision commenced on 25 May 2006, providing that:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) This section applies in respect of a verdict in criminal proceedings where the jury consists of not less than 11 persons. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than eight hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) In this section:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          majority verdict  
          means:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a verdict agreed to by 11 jurors where the jury consists of 12 persons at the time the verdict is returned, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          unanimous verdict 
            
          means a verdict agreed to by all members of the jury.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The appellant’s submissions 
       
      
    56 In the appellant’s written submissions, it was submitted that the learned trial judge erred in informing the jury of the availability of a majority verdict at the same time as giving the Black direction. It was contended that counsel for both accused made strenuous objection and submitted that the Black direction be given first and the option of a majority verdict given at a later stage. 
     
      
    57 It was further submitted that the learned trial judge erred in not taking account of the length and complexity of the trial before informing the jury of the availability of a majority verdict. Both counsel, it was submitted, argued that, as the trial had taken five weeks, the issues were complex and that insufficient time had elapsed for the trial judge to inform the jury of the availability of a majority verdict. 
     
      
    58 It was submitted for the appellant that the directions given in RJS v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 241 are analogous to the directions given to the jury by the trial judge in the appellant’s case. In RJS (supra), Spigelman CJ stated (at [5]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The first basis for the Appellant’s challenge is that s.55F was invoked in circumstances where it was not permissible to do so. Accordingly, the majority verdict was either a nullity or involved such a failure of compliance with the procedural requirements of a trial as to constitute a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the Appellant did not get a trial according to law. On this appeal the Crown accepted the latter characterisation and it is unnecessary to choose between them.” 
        
       
      
    59 The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in RJS was delivered after the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
    60 In oral submissions, Ms Hickleton of counsel, who appeared with Ms Watson of counsel for the appellant, stated that, whether or not eight hours had elapsed, the trial judge failed to give consideration to whether the jury had deliberated for a reasonable period of time, or at least did not make any finding that a reasonable period of time had elapsed, having regard to the nature and complexity of the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
      
    61 The Crown, in written submissions, contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “28. The learned trial judge held that the jury had been deliberating for more than eight (8) hours (T 22 May 2007, p.22) and there was no demurrer to that proposition by either defence counsel. 
        
       
       
        
        29. The finding that a period in excess of eight hours had elapsed was entirely open on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        30. Accordingly, the first prerequisite of s.55F(2)(a) was present. 
        
       
       
        
        31. By necessary implication, the observations that the learned trial judge then made are indicative that her Honour regarded the period of time for which the jury had by then been deliberating was reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the trial, particularly given the circumstance that the jury note (MFI #50) apparently limited the stalemate to only two (2) of the counts: T 22 May 2007, p.3.13). 
        
       
       
        
        32. The finding that a reasonable period had elapsed was entirely open on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        33. Accordingly, the second prerequisite of s.55(2)(a) was present. 
        
       
       
        
        34. Once both the prerequisites specified in s.55F(2)(a) were present, there was no further requirement prescribed by the section or otherwise that required the postponement of majority verdict directions until after perseverance directions (the  
        Black 
         direction) had been given and the jury had then been permitted to retire to deliberate for some further time. 
        
       
       
        
        35. It is a corollary of the presence of both the prerequisites prescribed by s.55F(2)(a) that there is no miscarriage of justice occasioned by a trial judge directing a jury simultaneously in relation to their continued perseverance towards a unanimous verdict (the  
        Black 
         direction) and the principles relevant to the return of a majority verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        36. Indeed, the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales provides suggested directions to be given in precisely such circumstances: Op. cit. at [8-090]. 
        
       
       
        
        37. The directions given by the learned trial judge in the trial presently under appeal reflect in all material respects the terms of those suggested directions: T 22 May 2007, p.3.39 to 6.10,. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        41. Ultimately, her Honour indicated that account had been taken of the submissions made by the parties and determined that the jury would be directed in relation to the majority verdicts: T 22 May 2007, p.3.30. 
        
       
       
        
        42. It is implicit from the observations made by the learned trial judge during the course of those submissions and the terms of the decision to direct the jury as to majority verdicts that her Honour had considered whether the jury had been deliberating for a time that was both in excess of eight (8) hours and reasonable having regard to the length and complexity of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        43. Therefore, contrary to the submission here made on behalf of the Appellant, the learned trial judge did take into account the length and complexity of the trial before determining to direct the jury in relation to majority verdicts.” 
        
       
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    62 In RJS (supra), the Court dealt with the contention by the appellant that s.55F was invoked in circumstances where it was not permissible to do so. It was there submitted the majority verdict was either a nullity or involved such a failure of compliance with the procedural requirements of a trial as to constitute a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the appellant did not get a trial according to law. 
     
      
    63 Spigelman CJ at [5] observed that the Crown accepted the latter characterisation and, accordingly, the Chief Justice stated it was unnecessary to choose between the suggested legal consequences referred to in the paragraph above. However, as noted below, it was ultimately determined in RJS (supra) that there had been a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    64 In RJS (supra), the first criticism was that the trial judge did not, in fact, determine what “period of time” for deliberation was “reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings”. The circumstances in that case were such that the trial judge did appear to have proceeded upon the basis that the only pre-condition for the return of a majority verdict was whether eight hours had elapsed: see judgment in Spigelman CJ at [14]. 
     
      
    65 The second criticism was that the trial judge in RJS (supra) had failed to examine any juror on oath and, accordingly, could not have been “satisfied … that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict under further deliberation”. 
     
      
    66 The Chief Justice in RJS (supra) at [18] observed that when Parliament modified the long-standing principle underpinning the requirement of unanimity of a jury in a criminal case, it did so by inserting two significant qualifications expressly requiring the attention of the trial judge. The first was that the trial judge had to make a judgment as to whether or not a “reasonable” period had elapsed in all of the circumstances of the trial. The second was to require a formal procedure for examining at least one juror, perhaps more, to satisfy the judge that it was unlikely that a unanimous verdict would be reached. 
     
      
    67 Spigelman CJ then observed at [19]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “19. These two matters are essential pre-conditions which Parliament required to be met. Each precondition involves a judgment by the trial judge of a character with which this court is reluctant to intervene. In the present case, however, on the materials before the Court, the trial judge failed to address either matter. Either would, in my opinion, be sufficient to vitiate the trial. In my opinion, a miscarriage of justice has occurred in the sense that the Appellant had not received a trial according to law.” 
        
       
      
    68 In relation to the second ground of appeal in RJS, which focused on the timing of the directions given, the Chief Justice observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “21. His Honour gave the jury a direction in accordance with  
        Black v The Queen 
         (1993) 179 CLR 44 urging them to continue to attempt to reach a unanimous verdict. However, the effect of that direction was, the Appellant submitted, undermined by the fact that at the same time his Honour directed the jury that in 15 minutes they could in fact resolve upon guilt with a majority of 11. This invitation to just wait, the Appellant submitted, was compounded by his Honour’s statement to the jury that they ‘need not worry’ because the Court ‘will not be keeping you here beyond a day’. 
        
       
       
        
        22. In my opinion, his Honour did undermine the effect of the  
        Black 
         direction. No further direction should have been given at this time.” 
        
       
      
    69 From the transcript in the present proceedings, it can be seen that the trial judge placed considerable emphasis upon the time factor of eight hours referred to in s.55F(2) but did not indicate that attention or consideration had been given to the concept of the time the Court considered to be reasonable “… having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings …”: s.55F(2)(a). 
     
      
    70 The transcript records the submissions made by both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for both accused by which counsel indicated their opposition to the course proposed by the trial judge. 
     
      
    71 I do not consider, as the Crown submitted, that the statements made by the trial judge indicate, by necessary implication, that the trial judge had considered the question as to whether or not the period of time that the jury deliberated was “reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings” within the meaning of s.55F(2)(a). There was no indication that that matter had been considered by the trial judge and no indication that a determination or judgment on that precondition had, in fact, been made as the Act requires. 
     
      
    72 In those circumstances, I am of the opinion the precondition in that respect set out in s.55F(2)(a) was not complied with. That is a sufficient basis for concluding that the trial was not one according to law. 
     
      
    73 Although the circumstances in which the jury were also given a Black direction was somewhat different from the circumstances that arose in RJS (supra), there is a question as to whether the trial judge ought to have first given a Black direction and not, at the same time, to have made reference to the fact or the circumstances in which a majority verdict may be returned by the jury. 
     
      
    74 Whilst it is, in my opinion, arguable that, by giving a Black direction followed immediately by a reference to the possibility of a majority verdict in respect of the two counts in question the force of the Black direction was thereby undermined, it is not necessary for that question to be finally resolved for the purposes of the present appeal. 
     
      
    75 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that by reason of the failure to comply with the precondition in s.55F(2)(a) to which I have referred, there was a miscarriage of justice and that it was upon that basis that the Court, on 23 May 2008, allowed the appeal against conviction, quashed the conviction in the District Court and ordered that there be a new trial.

   JUDGMENT1. Mr Graziano I am going to sentence you now. You can stay seated. First I give my reasons for sentencing which will take ten minutes or so and at the end I will impose my sentence. I am going to give my reasons because it is a public process and everybody needs to know why I am sentencing you. Do you understand that? All right. 2. I am sentencing David Julian Graziano for two crimes. They are both drug offences. Both were committed against s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. The first was an offence of supplying five and a half grams of ecstasy. The second was an offence of supplying 6.8 grams of cocaine. 3. Briefly the circumstances were these. The offences occurred on 16 February 2008. Mr Graziano was pulled over by the police, because of a random breath test. For various reasons police thought it fit to search his car. They found a bum bag in the car. In the bum bag and in other parts of the car, they found the drugs. The cocaine was distributed over some ten small bags containing white powder which was the cocaine. The ecstasy was in the form of nineteen pink tablets contained in its own plastic bag. Police also found cash which included $775 and a separate amount of $290. 4. Mr Graziano was committed for sentence on 1 May 2008, having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Mr Higgins, who appears for Mr Graziano, called his client to give evidence in the witness box. He confirmed other evidence which is in the form of medical reports which were consistent with him having suffered serious injuries in a motor car accident some years ago. This resulted in significant pain and discomfort for Mr Graziano. Various efforts at pain relief had limited success. Mr Graziano turned to the use of cocaine in order to alleviate his pain. 5. He was charged in 2007 with possession of cocaine. He received a bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for that offence. That bond was imposed on 28 November 2007. It follows that when he committed these offences, some three months later, he was still subject to the bond which had been imposed upon him by the court. 6. Mr Graziano explained that he had the drugs because he was supplying them on behalf of a friend. The friend arranged for Mr Graziano to deliver drugs to other people. The person from whom he obtained the drugs, as I said, was a friend. The person to whom he delivered the drugs were friends. They all mixed in the same social circles. Mr Graziano described the drugs as for recreational purposes.7. Also found in the car at the same time were a set of scales, a knife, two mobile phones and two pairs of scissors and, as I said, cash. Mr Graziano explained that he needed the scales to measure out his own drugs. The arrangement between him and his supplier was that for his delivery services he, Mr Graziano, would be paid in kind, that is in an allowance of cocaine. 8. The plastic bags I did not mention. He had a large number of unused, sealed plastic bags. They were, Mr Graziano said, for his own use to measure out his own amounts of the drug. 9. One issue which I ventilated and which is one of the issues I need to determine, is whether Mr Graziano was in fact the dealer in these drugs or merely the courier. He claims that he was a courier. The evidence points against this. I have a strong suspicion that he was in fact the supplier himself. However I am not satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt. I am persuaded by Mr Higgins that various factors which he points to are inconsistent with that conclusion. One is the medical evidence which clearly supports that he is in need of pain relief. That in turn supports Mr Graziano’s account that he used the drugs for that purpose. The other is a certain frankness and candour exhibited in his evidence. As Mr Higgins said, he made certain admissions against his own interests. There was I observed, a certain candour about the way he gave his evidence. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was in fact the dealer. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, which is consistent with his admission, that he had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of supplying and the role in which he was doing that was as a delivery person.10. The $775 which he had in his possession I accept was payment for a job which he had done as a plumber and the $290 was the money which he had obtained from one of the persons to whom he supplied drugs, and he was taking that money or due to deliver it back to his own supplier of drugs.11. Mr Graziano has signed a form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which enables me to take into account two charges. Those two charges are having goods in custody, that is the amount of $290 and possessing a prohibited drug, namely .3 grams of cocaine. That was an amount found separately in Mr Graziano’s wallet. I here record that I propose to take into account those two offences when I am sentencing Mr Graziano for the offence of supplying the prohibited drug of cocaine. 12. As I said, on the personal side Mr Graziano has suffered a serious injury and the circumstances of his using, or rather supplying these drugs was in order to maintain his own drug usage which was rendered, so far as he was concerned, necessary as a form of pain relief. 13. I propose to fix sentences which will run concurrently and they will both date from 16 February 2008 when Mr Graziano was arrested. I do so because in this case, both drugs were destined for the same person and the two offences were, in truth part of one overall transaction. In this regard I accept Mr Higgins’ submission.14. On the other hand, there are two factors which need to be taken into account which make this crime or these crimes serious. One is quite specific. That is that when he committed these offences Mr Graziano was on a bond. That means that when he came before the courts before, the courts entrusted him with his freedom. The court which sentenced him previously released him back into the community on condition that he be of good behaviour. Instead of doing that, Mr Graziano has assumed the liberty which the court gave him, to distribute drugs within the community. 15. That brings me to the second serious factor which is by way of a general observation about these sorts of crimes, rather than a specific aggravating factor for these two crimes. What Mr Graziano did is against the law, that is to state the obvious. But what is more important to observe is the reason for the law. These prohibited drugs everybody knows, are not only highly addictive but extremely dangerous. There is the potential for people to put their own health at serious risk. They put their health at serious risk by reason of the addiction, and also because they are ingesting into their bodies powerful, illicit drugs. This is a highly dangerous activity. What Mr Graziano was doing was facilitating the process whereby people - I accept that he knew those involved - were able to use these drugs. He was facilitating the process of distributing within the community, although to known people, who, he said, were experienced in taking them, dangerous and prohibited drugs. I accept the submission of Ms Fitzpatrick who appears for the prosecution that this was not an insignificant transaction. Nevertheless I accept that they were transactions which are towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness. 16. I should add that I do not propose to increase the sentence by way of taking into account the form 1 matters because of the fact that the form 1 matters both arose out of the same transaction. However I do propose to take into account the fact that these offences were committed on conditional liberty, although I also take into account Mr Higgins’ submission that his client, because of the impact of the car accident, had is rational decision making processes seriously affected. 17. I take into account and will allow a discount for Mr Graziano’s plea of guilty. In respect of the cocaine offence, just to elaborate on that last remark I had proposed to sentence Mr Graziano to a penalty of some forty months imprisonment. That is three years and four months. Instead I propose to reduce that by twenty-five per cent and the overall sentence that I will impose for the cocaine offence will be thirty months. Similarly, I had intended to impose for the ecstasy offence a penalty of some two years which I will reduce to eighteen months.18. Would you stand up Mr Graziano? Mr Graziano for the offence of supplying cocaine I sentence you to two and a half years, that is thirty months imprisonment to commence on 16 February 2008 and to expire on 15 August 2010. I fix a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence on 16 February 2008 and to expire on 15 August 2009. In respect of the supply of cocaine I sentence you to eighteen months imprisonment to commence on 16 February 2008 and to expire on 15 August 2009 and I fix a non-parole period of one year to commence on 16 February 2008 and to expire on 15 February 2009. HIGGINS: Your Honour I actually think you mentioned the cocaine twice.HIS HONOUR: Did I? The second offence is ecstasy. Yes.HIGGINS: So he got the eighteen month non-parole period for the cocaine?HIS HONOUR: Correct.HIGGINS: Which takes into account the form 1 matters. HIS HONOUR: Correct.HIGGINS: And he got the other sentence for the--HIS HONOUR: Correct. So for the cocaine, it is two and a half years with an eighteen month non-parole period taking into account the form 1 matters and for the ecstasy, it is eighteen months head sentence with a twelve month non-parole period. Does that sound right?HIGGINS: Yes thank you.19. And I direct that you be released on parole on 15 February 2009. Have a seat Mr Graziano. Before I discharge my statutory obligation to explain that to Mr Graziano - direct his release on parole on 15 August 2009, thank you yes - is there anything Ms Fitzpatrick that I need to correct or add? FITZPATRICK: Not--HIS HONOUR: And the figures? FITZPATRICK: Not with respect to the figures your Honour. Just looking at the ratio, has your Honour varied the ratio?20. Yes, and I should have added that had I found special circumstances, thank you. I should add that in fixing the ratio that the non-parole period bears to the overall sentence, I have decided that there are special circumstances for varying that from the statutory norm, those being Mr Graziano’s age and the fact that this is his first period of custody and a need for drug rehabilitation. I might also ask you both for any recommendations that I should make for the conditions of parole. But before I do that are there any formal orders that I need to make or correct? I will come to the confiscation separately. FITZPATRICK: Not with respect to that, but I will be seeking a drug destruction order.HIS HONOUR: Thank you that is under section--FITZPATRICK: I’m told 18 your Honour. HIS HONOUR: All right if you look up that Ms Fitzpatrick. Anything else apart from that? I’ll just leave you to look that up.FITZPATRICK: Then I’ll be withdrawing or seeking to withdraw the backups. HIS HONOUR: I will attend to that, good. But the orders itself, the sentence, no corrections or formalities I have not yet observed.FITZPATRICK: No.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, now Mr Higgins are there any orders I need to make? HIGGINS: No. HIS HONOUR: Because the sentence is less than three years I have directed that he be released to parole on 15 August 2009. What kinds of conditions should I fix to that parole?HIGGINS: That he obeys all the reasonable directions of the probation service. HIS HONOUR: So put him under supervision?HIGGINS: Yes.HIS HONOUR: And obey directions and--HIGGINS: That covers issues such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation. It’s less problematic if it comes before the Parole Authority that’s all. HIS HONOUR: Yes. Ms Fitzpatrick, any suggested conditions?FITZPATRICK: No your Honour. 21. It is a condition of his release to parole on 15 August 2009 that he subject himself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for the balance of his parole and accept any reasonable recommendations or directions from them, in particular as such recommendations or directions may relate to drug rehabilitation. I direct the destruction of the drugs pursuant to s 39 P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. You can thank my associate for that. What do I do with these? You were just about to tell me about these backup and related offences, I know you’ve told me before, what do you want me to do with them Ms Fitzpatrick?FITZPATRICK: Seeking to withdraw sequence 5, possess prohibited drug backup offence, sequence 6 backup offence--HIS HONOUR: So you seek to withdraw both of those? I assume that’s not opposed Mr Higgins?HIGGINS: No your Honour. 22. I note and grant leave to the prosecution to withdraw sequence 5 and sequence 6, the two possess prohibited drug offences, yes.FITZPATRICK: And also the related offence of sequence 4--HIS HONOUR: Yes you withdraw that number 4--FITZPATRICK: --goods in custody.23. In addition I grant leave to the prosecution to withdraw the related offence, sequence 4, goods in custody.HIS HONOUR: Anything else? We’ll come to that order in a minute. Anything else Mr--HIGGINS: No thank you your Honour.24. No. Now Mr Graziano, I have sentenced you to gaol for two and a half years for the cocaine supply, that’s the more serious offence. The two and a half years has a non-parole period of eighteen months. I’ve backdated it to 16 February which is when you were arrested and you’ve been in gaol since then is that right? Okay, so you were in gaol from 16 February and you will be released on 15 August 2009, that is in just over a years time. I have recommended or I haven't recommended, I have fixed as a condition of your release, that you are to take the advice of the Probation and Parole Service. You get into their supervision, if they make a recommendation or a direction and it’s reasonable, you follow it, particularly if it relates to drug use. 25. The other, the ecstasy offence I’ve also sentenced you to eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months, but that runs at the same time, so it’s really covered by the more serious offence, because I accepted Mr Higgins’ submission so far as that was concerned. Do you understand that? So your due date for release is 15 August 2009. HIS HONOUR: Now the notice of motion Ms Fitzpatrick, Mr Higgins thinks the Nokia should be not forfeited. I’m inclined to agree with him. I’m inclined to accept the sworn evidence from his client. So there’s a forfeiture order and there are short minutes of order for the forfeiture order. So if in signing the short minutes, I’m ordering the forfeiture of the cash of $290, and I’m going to put one mobile phone. So he’s forfeiting the $290, the Vodafone and the car. Is that right?HIGGINS: Correct.HIS HONOUR: Does anybody oppose that?HIGGINS: No your Honour.FITZPATRICK: No your Honour.26. Pursuant to the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989, I order pursuant to s 18(1) of that Act that cash in the sum of $290 found at Huntley’s Point in New South Wales on 16 February 2008 be forfeited to the State. Pursuant to the same section I order that one mobile phone, a black Vodafone phone, be forfeited to the State. Pursuant to the same section I order that the Daihatsu sedan registration number ZEV 143 be forfeited to the State. I consider that the value of the property is approximately $2,000 and I give leave pursuant to s 19 that the property forfeited be disposed of forthwith. The formal orders are those which I make in a document, short minutes of order which I have signed and dated today and which will be placed with the papers.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
      Non-publication order in relation to the name of the complainant and any matter that can identify the complainant.  
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Price J. 2 PRICE J: On 21 June 2006 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing two counts of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (counts 1 and 11), eight counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act (counts 2-4, 6-8, 10 and 12) and two counts of attempt sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61P of the Crimes Act (counts 5 and 9). The alleged offences occurred on 16 December 2005 and involved a single complainant.  
     
      
    3 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and a jury was empanelled. On 3 July 2006, the jury returned verdicts of guilty to counts 6 and 9. Verdicts of not guilty were returned on all other counts. 
     
      
    4 On 24 October 2006, the appellant was sentenced on count 6 to a term of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years to commence on 19 June 2006 and to expire on 18 June 2013 and to a parole period of 2 years 6 months to commence on 19 June 2013 and to expire on 18 December 2015. On count 9, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years to commence on 19 January 2006 and to expire on 18 January 2011. 
     
      
    5 The appellant now appeals against his convictions and the sentences imposed. The notice of appeal so far as the appellant’s convictions are concerned identifies one ground which is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “The verdicts on counts 6 and 9 cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    6 It is the appellant’s case that properly analysed there is no logical and reasonable basis for sustaining the differentiation that the jury drew between the counts upon which the appellant was acquitted by the jury and those upon which he was convicted. The appeal raises the issue of unreasonable verdicts and the ground of appeal is based on the first part of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which relevantly provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable…”  
        
       
      
    7 The test to be applied by this Court where the reasonableness of a verdict by the jury is challenged is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 where their Honours said (at 493): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.”  
        
       
      See also  
      MFA v The Queen 
       (2002) 213 CLR 606 (at 614 to 615).  
       
      
    8 The issue is whether this Court finds that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of counts 6 and 9. As was pointed out in MFA (at 618) the test established by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is unreasonableness, not inconsistency.  
     
      
    9 The approach to be taken by this Court when a jury returns verdicts of guilty and not guilty in relation to charges of sexual assault upon a single complainant by an accused was considered in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA. 
     
      
    10 Their Honours said: (at 617) 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury’s decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in  
        MacKenzie 
         [(1996) 190 CLR 348]. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, 
          
        of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant’s evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant’s evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in  
        R v Kirkham  
        [(1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593], and referred to in the later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.” 
        
       
      
    11 Different verdicts were also considered in the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA. Their Honours adopted what was said in MacKenzie that “if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will be generally accepted.” Their Honours recognised that juries will sometimes give effect to their innate sense of fairness and justice as well as to their sense of proportion and compassion. Their Honours stated (at 631): 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless, cases do arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent ‘an affront to logic and commonsense’ and suggest a compromise in the performance of the jury’s duty.” 
        
       
      
    12 In order to consider the first ground of appeal, it is necessary to refer to the trial and to the evidence in some detail. 
     
      
       
      The trial  
       
      
    13 The complainant’s evidence-in-chief may be summarised as follows: She and the appellant agreed to meet. They had not previously been out together. They went to a bar and grill and then to a club. Whilst at the club, the appellant drew a man playing a guitar and a woman beside him. The man had a largely exaggerated penis and the woman was performing oral sex and above the woman was the complainant’s name. The appellant pointed to the male playing the guitar and said “that’s me”. The complainant said “You’ve got a pretty vivid imagination” and he said “Yeah, the penis is pretty exaggerated isn’t it?” The complainant said “No, that is not going to happen, I am not going to do that.” The appellant replied “No, I don’t want to have sex either, you know I’ve had a great night, it’s been a great night, I can’t believe that you’re here and I’d just be happy with a little kiss you know. That’s all I need at the end of the night you know if you just gave me a kiss right now.” He leaned over to her and when she gave him a peck on the lips, he said “see I’m happy now”. 
     
      
    14 When they left the club, the appellant suggested they go to his house to listen to him play flamenco. She thought this was a good idea as she was concerned that if she was over the limit to drive she may be pulled over by police. She did not feel drunk at all but she wanted to be absolutely sure.  
     
      
    15 When she arrived at his unit, the complainant sat down on the lounge and asked for a cup of tea. As he came in, the appellant took his shirt off and then put the kettle on. She asked him to play some flamenco which he did. He then stopped and said “I’m too tweaked to play any more”. He then walked over to the complainant and kissed her on the mouth and then touched her crotch with his hand. The complainant got up and said “Whoa you move fast. How about that tea?” He said he would get it but then disappeared into a room and asked her to come in as he wanted to show her something. 
     
      
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offence constituting count 1 (Indecent Assault ) 
       
       
      The complainant walked to the room and saw that it was his bedroom. He grabbed her hand, pulled her forcefully onto the bed and straight away was on top of her. She said to him “I don’t want to have sex with you”. He said “Don’t worry, I don’t want to have sex either I just want to touch you”. He then put his hands all over her very quickly and pulled her shirtdress up to her armpits. He had his hands and mouth over her body. He grabbed her dress and pulled it off. She had a bra and three quarter pants and underpants on and she was struggling to keep them on.  
       
       
      He put his hands on her breasts and she said “Don’t touch me there” and she was guarding them with her hands. He tried to take down the straps of her bra from her shoulders and she grabbed there to guard that. He put his hands back on her breasts and she moved her hands back down. He said “Don’t worry I’m not interested in your titties”. Suddenly he pulled her hands away and ripped the middle of her bra in two and threw it away. He then immediately put his mouth and hands on her breasts.

      The complainant was completely shocked and she still tried to struggle. After that he took his shorts off so that he was naked. The complainant tried to sit up but he grabbed her by the ankles and pulled her across the bed. He pulled her three quarter pants off and undies off so that she was completely naked. He then started to perform oral sex on her. He put his tongue inside her vagina and his chin and lips. He frantically moved his face around so that in the end the complainant was very raw and scratched. She struggled and wriggled her hips to try and get away.  
       
       
      The appellant then turned around so that his anus was right next to her face and he said “Lick my arse”. His mouth was still on her vagina and then he started to bite and gnaw at her left thigh. She said “That really hurts” but he continued to do it and ultimately left a bruise on her leg. She was pinned down but was trying to keep her face away from his anus. During this he kept saying “God dammit you’re so hot. God dammit I love licking your pussy”.

      He then got off her, knelt down, grabbed her head and manoeuvred her so that she was facing him. His back was towards the bed head and he said “Suck my dick for me”. He grabbed her head then thrust his penis into her mouth causing her to gag and cough. He said “Look at me in the eyes as you’re doing this”. This was difficult because of the position she was in. She moved so that she was down further on the bed and she did try to look at him as she was afraid if she didn’t something worse would happen to her. When she was looking up he spat on her face and he did this a few times. Sometimes it would land on his penis and sometimes on her face but inevitably it would dribble down into her mouth and he said “I love it that you swallow my spit”. 
       
       
      The oral sex went on for a long time and at the end he let go of her head and she was exhausted. She said to the appellant “Could I have that tea now?” He said “Okay” and went off to the kitchen. The complainant got off the bed and scrambled to find her clothes. He came back in and said “What are you doing?” she replied “I’m trying to look for something. I want to get dressed now”. He said in a serious tone of voice “Oh no don’t get dressed”. 
       
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offence constituting count 4 (sexual intercourse without consent)  
       
       
      The complainant was standing at the foot of the bed and the appellant told her to bend over and he forced her upper back down so that she was face down on the bed. She felt a cold hard object enter her vagina and it was thrust in and out for about two minutes. She kept really still because it was big and hard and she thought that if she kept still it wouldn’t hurt so much. She thought that if she struggled he may do some serious damage.  
       
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offence constituting count 5 (attempt sexual intercourse without consent) 
       
       
      After a while he removed the object from her vagina and she felt pressure on her anus and he was attempting to put it in. The complainant said “That really hurts”. The appellant could not push it in. He fumbled with it and then gave up. He said to her “Get back on the bed”. She heard a thud and as she got onto the bed she saw on the floor at the foot of the bed a blue glass bottle and she guessed that it was what he used.  
       
       
       
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offence constituting count 6 (sexual intercourse without consent)  
       
       
      The appellant positioned her on the bed and forced her head and neck over to the end of the bed so that her shoulders and arms were down as well. The appellant was holding her hips up with his right hand and with his left hand held her head and hair. The appellant then penetrated her vagina with his penis. He was thrusting with his hips and this went on for about five minutes. The complainant said to him before he entered her vagina “I don’t want you to touch me. I don’t want you inside me. I don’t want your penis inside me”. He said “Don’t worry I don’t want to fuck you, I just want to touch you”. The complainant said that he was doing it anyway. 
       
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offences constituting counts 7 and 8 (sexual intercourse without consent) 
       
       
      After five minutes of him penetrating her with his penis she felt the hard pressure of his fist against her vagina. She told him that it hurt her. This continued for 30 or 40 seconds. She couldn’t struggle because he was holding her head down but she did manage to get her hand between her legs to try and move his hand away. When he stopped with his fist he then thrust his fingers into her vagina (count 7) for a few moments and then he took his fingers out and put them into her anus (count 8). He did this for a few moments.

      After that he turned her around so that she was on her back and he was on top of her. He tried to put his penis inside her. There was a struggle for a while and she said “I don’t want you to touch me, I don’t want you inside me. I don’t want your penis inside me”. He said “Don’t worry I’m not”. The complainant gave evidence that he said that he wasn’t doing it when he was. She said that this time he didn’t get his penis inside. She said they really struggled.

      After that he got on top of her. He was on his knees and he pinned her down so that his knees were on top of her forearms and under her armpits. He said “I want you to suck my dick for me”. He put his penis in her mouth for about 20 seconds and spat on her face (Count 10). He then took his penis out, started to masturbate himself with his right hand and said “I want to come on your face”. Sweat and spit fell on her face as he was doing this. He spat on his penis and on her face and it stung her eyes. He did this for about 10 minutes and said “Your pussy’s so hot, God damn it your arse is so hot I can’t believe it. I love licking your pussy”. Then he ejaculated onto her face (Count 11). It went into her left eye and in her hair. He lay down and looked exhausted.  
       
       
      The complainant got up and went to the bathroom. She washed the semen off her face and hair and then went back into the room to get dressed. The appellant said to her “What are you doing? Come and lie down next to me”. The complainant said “I don’t want to do that. I want to leave. I want to go home. Would you walk me to my car?”  
       
       
      The appellant said that he would walk her to the car in the little while. He said “Just lie down for a little while, just 10 minutes”. The complainant insisted that she wanted to go.  
       
       
      The appellant said “Okay I’ll take you in a little while”. The complainant went out to the lounge room and saw the time was 2.40am. She decided to leave herself. She went to the front door and tried to open it but the cover was missing from the deadlock and she could not work out how to turn the lock. She went back into the bedroom and waited for the appellant to wake up.  
       
      The complainant testified that it did not occur to her to call the Police. She said she was utterly tired, completely devastated and just wanted to get out of there. She waited in the bedroom until daylight which was about 5.30am. She went to the bathroom and when she came out she saw a male standing in the loungeroom. He had his back to her and she did not see his face. 
       
       
      The complainant’s evidence of the offence constituting count 12 (sexual intercourse without consent) 
       
       
      In the bedroom the appellant asked her to lie down next to him. She told him she wanted to go home. He grabbed her by the waist and said “Just stay here for a little while. I want to fuck you straight”. She said to him “I don’t want to. I don’t want to touch you. I want to go. I don’t want to be here. You’re not listening are you?” She moved away but he still had his hands on her waist. He said “I won’t fuck you I just want you to touch it and suck it, suck my dick for me”. She told him again that she did not want to and the appellant seemed edgy and very agitated and was stroking his penis with his hand. He said “I just want you to touch it. Just kiss it”. She thought he would not let her go so she gave his penis a peck and she said “Will you open the door now?” He asked her to close the bedroom door and he put his shorts on. Then he said “I love your pussy I want to fuck you” and he lifted her shirt dress and put his fingers down her pants and into her vagina. He thrust his fingers a few times and she was pinned against the wall.  
       
       
      The complainant said to him “Look if you want to see me again you will open the door and let me go now”. She gave evidence that she did not intend to see the appellant again. He asked when they would “hook up again”. The complainant said that she would ring him but said that she said this to him so that he would let her go. She then left and walked down the stairs. She quickly walked to her car and drove home.  
       
       
      She put her broken bra in the bin and had a shower. Her eight year old son was coming home from his father’s house and she had to work at midday that day. She tried to lie down to rest but not long afterwards she got a text message from the appellant. It said “I can’t wait to fuck you”. She was so disgusted to hear from him she deleted it straight away. She then received another text message that read “I love licking your arse”. She deleted that also. She then received another one that said “Are you feeling discombobulated?” She texted him back “I’m in an extreme state of discombobulation after last night” and then she deleted that as well. 
       
       
      The complainant gave evidence that soon afterwards her son came home and she tried to get on with the day as best she could and she tried to block out what had happened to her. She explained she felt she could not go to the police that day as she did not want to take her son and she did not want to explain to any of her family. She felt guilty, like it was her fault for going to his house. She just wanted to get through the day and she had Christmas coming up in a few days and family coming to her house.  
       
      
    16 On 22 December 2005 she met up with a friend, [JS]. She said she felt she had to tell someone so she told [JS] some of the things that happened on the date with the appellant. She told her that her bra was ripped and he groped her breast and that it was an awful night. She may have said other things but only parts of it. The complainant said she could not tell her the whole story as she still felt really humiliated. 
     
      
       
      On 27 December 2005 the complainant met up with a friend [MD] in Cronulla Mall. When she saw the appellant coming towards her, she got up and told her friend they had to leave. She then told her friend that he had molested her, ripped her bra but she did not tell her everything.  
       
       
      The complainant’s family left her house on 30 December 2005 and the following day she reported the offence to the police.  
       
       
      During cross-examination the complainant said that she did martial arts training. She had been training for the last 10 years and attended training 4 or 5 times a week. She was a black belt in Tae-Kwon-Do. She also did kick boxing and had participated in seven fights. She had won two state titles. She said she did not want to invite further assault on her by engaging the appellant in a violent way. She was closely cross-examined concerning her failure to leave the unit and to use her mobile phone to call police. She rejected the proposition that she did not do so because she was consenting to everything that happened that night. She denied that she consented to oral sex. She denied that the only issue she had with having penile/vaginal sex was her concern about the possibility of getting pregnant and the lack of a condom. She said that she was worried about getting a sexual disease or becoming pregnant but there was no consent on her part. 
       
      
    17 [JS] gave evidence that the complainant told her on 22 December 2005 that she had dinner with this man and had gone to his house to have a cup of tea and to listen to him play flamenco guitar. She told her that they got to his house, had a kiss and then he moved really fast. She said that he would do something to her, she struggled to get out of it, it would change and he would start all over again. He held her down a lot. At one point he got angry and ripped her bra. She kept struggling the whole night. Later that day, the complainant told her, [JS] said, that he pinned her down. She said no, then he would agree with her saying that he wasn’t going to do that but then he would keep doing it. The complainant said that it hurt and she asked him to stop but he would change to something else. He had used his fist and a bottle. She told [JS] that she wanted to get out of the unit but that it was deadlocked from the inside. In the morning, she said it started all over again. He put his hand inside her and she said no. The complainant said that she told the appellant that she would only see him again if he let her go and eventually he let her out. [JS] said that the complainant asked her if she thought that’s sexual assault to which she replied that what he had done was very, very wrong. The complainant told her that she had thought about ringing the Rape Crisis Centre and maybe she should go to the police.  
     
      
    18 [MD], who also gave evidence, said that she was sitting down with the complainant at the Cronulla mall on 27 December 2005 when the complainant said they had to get out of there straight away. After they moved from the mall, the complainant told her they had to leave as she had just seen the appellant. The complainant said that they had gone out for dinner and she had walked back to her car with the appellant. When she got to her car the appellant tried to grope her. She asked him to stop but he wouldn’t. The appellant said “don’t worry I’m not going to touch your titties”. He then got angry and ripped her bra but she kept telling him she didn’t want him. He didn’t seem to listen to her. The complainant told her she only got away because she bargained with the appellant and told him if he wanted to see her again he had to let her go.  
     
      
    19 [MD] saw the complainant in early January and they spoke further about what had happened. The complainant told her that she went back to his apartment for a cup of tea and once she got there she couldn’t get out because of the way the door lock worked. The complainant said that it was set up so that she couldn’t get out once she was in there and he sexually assaulted her.  
     
      
    20 The appellant’s flatmate, gave evidence that he initially thought that he had not been home on 15 December 2005 and gave a statement to that effect to police. He thought that he got home about 6.30am and had a conversation with the appellant about the date he had. The appellant told him that the complainant stayed the night and they had a mad night of sex. He had her number and they were going to hook up again. Mr [DC] said that he subsequently realised that what he told police about not being home that night was wrong. He recalled waking up at about 1am and hearing them coming in the door. He heard the appellant playing guitar and singing. He heard laughter and thought they sounded a bit drunk. After that he fell asleep and didn’t hear anything until the morning when his alarm went off. He then had the conversation with the appellant about the date he had. The appellant seemed pretty happy about it.  
     
      
    21 A search warrant was executed by police on the unit occupied by the appellant on 17 January 2006. The police located a number of items thought to be potentially relevant including a large blue bottle found in the bathroom. The bottle was sent for fingerprints and DNA testing but no fingerprints or DNA were found.  
     
      
    22 The appellant entered into an electronically recorded interview with police on 18 January 2006 during which he said that the complainant was totally willing and the whole thing was consensual. In the bedroom, she performed oral sex on him and he on her. At one point she was bent over the bed and he used the blue bottle like a vibrator or dildo. She enjoyed it and commented in the morning that she liked it. He said it was a consensual act. He said that because of the drinking he did not have an erection and he tried to put it in but was unable to. There was more oral sex and more touching. When they were first in the bedroom he took his clothes off or undid her blouse and took her clothes off. He said he grabbed her bra and it broke. It was very intimate and intense. He ripped her bra and they had a giggle about it. They fell asleep for a few hours in each others arms. The following morning he had an erection. The complainant performed oral sex on him again and then said she had to go. He walked her to the door, they hugged and kissed. He asked when he could see her again to which she replied “two weeks”. He later lost her mobile number and she didn’t call him.  
     
      
    23 The appellant did not give evidence at trial nor were any witnesses called.  
     
      
    24 As the intention of the jury was directed during closing addresses to the appellant’s answers to questions 345 to 349, 584 and 588 in the record of interview it is necessary to set them out: 
     
      
       
      Q345 All right. Now you’ve said that you don’t, you didn’t actually have penis and vaginal sex. Is that right? 
       
       
      A Yeah, I, I, I do remember that I did have difficulty having a full erection to have sex.  
       
      
     Q346 Mmm. 
     
      
       
      A And there were times where I’d sort of try to insert it a bit and, you know, it was just, it, it, it wasn’t really happening, you know. So I’d stop or [C] would say, No, I, you know, we’re doing everything else but I don’t want to have sex tonight. She said, you know, I’ve got children, we’re not wearing protection, Guy. And I couldn’t sort of get an erection anyway, but the few different times during the night where I would rub, like, my penis, even not fully erect against her vagina and yeah, I would say that there was no, like, prolonged periods of sex with my penis in her vagina, if, if any. Like, I might’ve tried to put it in a bit. There was contact there but I do remember her stating, Guy, well, you’ve got no protection, I’ve got children, anything could happen. I don’t want to have another baby, she said. I remember that as also saying it’s not, it’s not safe sex. But then we’ve, she performed the oral and everything else after and during times of that, and - - -  
       
       
      Q347 Did you, did [C] say anything other than she was just a bit worried about falling pregnant?  
       
       
      A She just, I, I, if I can think of the two things. I do vividly remember her saying it because my first thought was she’d, when she said, No, it’s, it’s not right that, I even thought she meant she’s uncomfortable having sex on the first night or it’s not right that there’s no protection, she’s worried about possible disease. So it sort of shocked me when she said, I don’t want to fall pregnant.  
       
      
     Q348 Hmm 
     
      
       
      A I sort of thought, oh, you know, like, I thought it would be more, like, oh, it’s, I don’t’ want to have sex the first night but we’ll do the rest or, I don’t know, you don’t have a condom, it could, there could be possible disease. 
       
      
     Q349 Hmm 
     
      
       
      A But she said, I remember her saying and it rang a bell in my head ‘cause she has two children, she’s, like I don’t want to fall pregnant, Guy.  
       
      ………… 
      
     Q584 Yeah  
     
      
       
      A And I said, I met [C]. She’s a top chick. We went to dinner. They go, Yeah, she’s cool. She’s got two children and her husband, so to me she was, like, a, a nice person. Whether you can say that when you have unprotected sex with someone, you just felt she was nice. And I was healthy, like - - -  
       
       
        
         
          
          - - - but there was a point when she actually did say, at those, those periods when we’re sort of nearly to have sex, that she’s like, Oh, God, I don’t think we should, I don’t want to fall pregnant. So - - -  
          
         
        
       
      ……………. 
      
     Q588 OK. 
     
      
       
      A - - - we were aware of those things but we had, had the night that I described.  
       
        
      
    25 At the commencement of her closing address, the Crown focussed the attention of the jurors on the issue of consent. She submitted that it was impossible to reconcile what the appellant had said generally in his record of interview about an evening of intimate consensual sex and the answers which he gave when the allegations were put to him one by one. She asked the jurors to carefully consider the appellant’s answers and suggested that if they did so, they would actually find that there was some support for what the complainant said she told the accused in his own version of events. The Crown then took the jury to answers 346 - 349, 584 and 588. The Crown put to the jury that the appellant knew that the complainant did not want to have sex but he went ahead anyway because he didn’t care whether she wanted to have sex or not.  
     
      
    26 Defence counsel addressed the Crown’s argument about the record of interview in his closing remarks. He suggested that when the answers were considered in the context of the record of interview, the appellant did not agree that he was told that she did not want to have sex. The appellant agreed that the complainant said that she did not want to fall pregnant and nothing more than that. She expressed concern about pregnancy, but it did not go anywhere near to amount to an absence of consent or a withdrawal of consent. He put to the jury that the complainant consented to everything.  
     
      
    27 The Judge, in his summing-up, instructed the members of the jury that they must consider each charge separately. He directed the jury that they were not obliged to accept the evidence of any one witness and may, if they thought fit, accept part and reject part of the same witness’s evidence. The jurors were further instructed that if they held a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, they must then take that into account in assessing the reliability of her evidence in relation to other counts. The Judge warned the jury that the complainant’s evidence must be scrutinised with great care. The jury was instructed that the complainant’s evidence must be accepted beyond reasonable doubt before a verdict of guilty could be returned on any of the charges.  
     
      
    28 The Judge carefully directed the jury on consent. The jury was instructed that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent and that the appellant knew that she was not consenting. He pointed out that it was not a guilty state of mind that the appellant honestly, though wrongly, believed that the complainant was consenting. The jury was directed that if the Crown had failed to prove that at the time of his acts the appellant did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting the offence had not been made out. The Judge provided directions on recklessness as to consent and emphasised as to counts 5 and 9 which were charges of attempting to have sexual intercourse, it was not sufficient for the Crown to prove merely that the appellant was reckless as to whether the intended crime would take place.  
     
      
    29 The principal matters for the jury’s determination were the issue of consent and if an absence of consent was found, the appellant’s knowledge of that lack of consent.  
     
      
      Decision  
      
    30 The appellant submits in this Court that the prosecution case relied almost entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. All of the counts upon which the appellant was indicted alleged a series of offences which were part of a single ongoing course of criminal conduct committed over a number of hours. The appellant argues that on the complainant’s account of the incident and the circumstances surrounding it there could be no room for ambiguity. According to the complainant, the entire incident from beginning to end was marked by force, the threat of very rough treatment from the appellant and the unambiguous rebuffing by the complainant of the appellant’s desires. There is, the appellant argues, no room for the drawing of a distinction between counts 6 and 9 and the other counts. The jury was not satisfied to the requisite standard about the complainant’s account and there is no logic in the jury’s approach. The argument of inconsistency, the appellant contends, is strengthened when the trial judge left recklessness with the jury. Whilst the appellant’s answers at 346 - 349 in the record of interview might have lent some general support for the complainant’s credibility, the appellant submits they could not corroborate counts 6 and 9 in the manner contended by the prosecution at trial. The appellant contends that the context of the account in the record of interview is entirely foreign to the account given by the complainant and there are real dangers in using it to support a conclusion that offences 6 and 9 were more likely, on that account, to have occurred. In the context of the very limited level of penile intercourse deposed to in answers 346-349, the highest that these answers could go is to show recklessness. The acquittals on counts 1, 4 and 5, the appellant says, are of particular significance not just because of the apparently more extreme nature of the allegations but also because in relation to those acts there was alleged support. There were many matters which emerged during cross-examination, it is said, which explain why the jury was unable to accept beyond reasonable doubt the substance of the complainant’s evidence.  
     
      
    31 The complainant was the only witness in the Crown case who gave evidence of the actual incidents alleged. The jury’s assessment of her evidence and of the appellant’s account to police was vital. The jury had the opportunity to carefully assess the complainant’s evidence by seeing and hearing that evidence given. The jury also had the advantage of viewing and hearing the appellant’s account of events when the record of interview was played. It is clear from the verdicts on counts 6 and 9 that the jury rejected the appellant’s account that all of the sexual activity was consensual.  
     
      
    32 The trial was conducted by the Crown upon the basis that the complainant had not consented to any of the acts alleged and the appellant’s case was that all acts were consensual. The sexual activity with the exception of count 12 followed in succession during the night. As it was open to the jury to accept the whole of the complainant’s evidence, the verdicts of guilty on counts 6 and 9 can only have two explanations. One is that the jury was not satisfied that the complainant did not consent to the sexual acts other than those two counts. The other is that the jury was satisfied that the complainant did not consent to all of the sexual acts but was not satisfied that the Crown had established that the appellant had a guilty state of mind.  
     
      
    33 There was, in my view, no rational basis upon which the jury could have been satisfied that the complainant did not consent in counts 6 and 9 whereas a reasonable doubt was entertained about her evidence on the issue of consent on all other counts. The question is whether a rational basis for the different verdicts may properly be found on the issue of the appellant’s state of mind.  
     
      
    34 The jury’s attention was directed to the appellant’s answers, in particular at 346-349, during final addresses which were also referred to by the Judge in his summing-up. It was not suggested by the Crown that the answers corroborated counts 6 and 9 or that they were admissions. Although it is true that in the context of the record of interview, these answers were different from the complainant’s evidence, they were relevant to the assessment by the jury of the honesty and reliability of her account and to the appellant’s state of mind. It was open to the jury to consider that they provided some support for her evidence that she told the appellant she did not want his penis inside her and further that the appellant actually knew that she did not consent to penile vaginal intercourse. These answers, in my opinion, were not confined to the issue of recklessness. 35 During the proceedings on sentence, the Crown’s submission was that the not guilty verdicts indicated that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting to the sexual acts the subject of those verdicts. Furthermore, the guilty verdicts indicated that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the acts the subject of counts 6 and 9 and that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting. 
     
      
    36 A useful consideration is the Judge’s observation in his remarks on sentence that the only factual basis for the verdict on count 9 was the jury found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had actual knowledge of the complainant’s lack of consent to the acts forming the subject of that count. This was plainly correct. The Judge accepted the Crown submission in respect to count 6 that there was clear evidence by the complainant that she expressed her lack of consent to the act committed by the appellant and that he went on and performed it anyway. He concluded that the acts the subject of the counts on which the appellant was found guilty were committed by him with actual knowledge on his part of her lack of consent.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion, there is a proper way by which this Court may reconcile the verdicts of guilty on counts 6 and 9 with the verdicts of not guilty on the other 10 counts. It is to be found in a combination of the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) There were directions to the members of the jury by the Judge that they must consider each charge separately and before they could return a verdict of guilty on any of the charges, they must accept the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. They were given a specific direction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part and a warning that the complainant’s evidence must be scrutinised with great care.  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) As the sole Judges of the facts, the members of the jury were entitled to accept beyond reasonable doubt the complainant’s account of counts 6 and 9. These were the only offences on the indictment which involved penile/vaginal intercourse. It was open to the jury to find that the complainant had, in plain terms, made it clear to the appellant that she did not consent to penile/vaginal intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) In making that finding, it was open to the jury to conclude that support for the complainant’s evidence of what she said and of the appellant’s actual knowledge of the absence of consent to penile/vaginal intercourse was to be found at Q 345- 349, 584, 865 and 869 of the record of interview. The jury was entitled to conclude in respect of counts 6 and 9 that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant did not know that the complainant was not consenting. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) In following the Judge’s direction to consider each count separately, the jury may not have been satisfied, other than for counts 1, 6 and 9, that the complainant had made it clear that she did not consent. The jury, acting reasonably, may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of his acts the subject of those counts the appellant did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting. The support to be found in the record of interview of the appellant’s knowledge of lack of consent was confined to counts 6 and 9.  
        
       
       
        
        (v) So far as count 1 was concerned, it was open to the jury to find that the complainant had made it plain to the appellant that she did not consent to being touched on the breasts and that her evidence was supported by his admission in the record of interview of tearing her bra. The jury was, however, required to consider Ms [MD’s] account of what she had been told by the complainant. The inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence and Ms [MD’s] account might have caused the jury to step back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt of guilt on that count. This does not mean that the complainant was disbelieved but reflects the diligence with which the jury approached its task.  
        
       
      
    38 These matters considered in combination could rationally have led the members of the jury to conclude that in all the circumstances the Crown had satisfied them beyond reasonable doubt that counts 6 and 9 had been established, whereas at the same time they entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt on all other counts. In my opinion, upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of counts 6 and 9. 
     
      
    39 Ground 1 of the appeal has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Sentence appeal  
       
      
    40 The notice of appeal identifies three grounds, namely:  
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge did not give proper regard to the limited basis on which the verdicts on counts 6 and 9 can be reconciled with the acquittals on the remaining 10 counts.  
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in applying the standard non-parole period to count 6. 
       
       
      3. The trial judge failed to give proper effect to his stated intention of finding special circumstances (beyond any necessary adjustment in relation to accumulation).  
       
      
    41 Count 4 is an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. Offences contrary to s 61I are punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applies: Pt 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    42 Count 9 is an offence of attempt sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act. Offences contrary to s 61L are punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole provisions do not apply to this offence.  
     
      
    43 Grounds 1 and 2 of the sentence appeal are related and may be dealt with together. The appellant complains that the finding made by the Judge involved an unqualified acceptance of what the complainant had to say in evidence-in-chief on the subject of counts 6 and 9 and in doing so he ignored the acquittals on all other counts which was inappropriate. The appellant submits that if his Honour had sentenced on the correct basis then the offences and sentences would have been at the absolute bottom of the appropriate range.  
     
      
    44 During the sentencing proceedings, various submissions were made by the appellant’s counsel as to the facts that should be found on sentence. The Judge was invited to find that for the balance of the offences of which the appellant was acquitted, the complainant did in fact consent or that the appellant actually believed that she was consenting to those acts. Either finding would, it was said, lessen the seriousness or mitigate the gravity of the acts for which he was convicted. The appellant’s counsel argued that if his Honour found that the appellant honestly though erroneously believed she was consenting there was a “blurry line” which he had crossed which was very different from a mid-range seriousness for the offence. It was further contended that the Judge should find in respect of count 6 that the appellant was reckless as to consent and should not find that he had actual knowledge.  
     
      
    45 The Judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts the subject of the counts on which the appellant was found guilty were committed by him with actual knowledge on his part of the lack of consent of the complainant, as opposed to recklessness. His Honour referred to the complainant’s account of those offences at page 81 of the trial transcript and regarded all of those matters as proven beyond reasonable doubt “firstly because the jury must have so found in order to convict on count six and nine and also because, as I recall it, the complainant struck me as a truthful witness in relation to those matters and I accept the truth of what she said beyond reasonable doubt”. 
     
      
    46 The submission that he should find that the complainant consented to the acts which were the subject of the remaining charges upon which the appellant was found not guilty was rejected by the Judge as were the submissions that there was a “blurry line” as to consent from the appellant’s point of view and the verdicts of acquittal made the offences of which he was convicted less serious. His Honour found that the appellant was faced with a very clear situation in which the complainant indicated in the plainest of terms that she did not consent to what the appellant was about to do and yet he went ahead and did it. Both offences fell, in the Judges’ view, at the mid-range of seriousness.  
     
      
    47 The Judge did not ignore the verdicts of not guilty on the other counts. The facts that he found against the appellant were arrived at beyond reasonable doubt and consistent with the jury’s verdicts on counts 6 and 9. He was not obliged to sentence the appellant upon the basis of a view of the facts, consistent with the verdicts, which was most favourable to the appellant: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 474, nor was he obliged to find that the appellant actually believed that the complainant was consenting to the sexual activity the subject of the not guilty counts.  
     
      
    48 His Honour’s finding that the offences fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness was essentially one of fact. I am not persuaded that the Judge overlooked a relevant consideration or that wrong principle was applied or that the finding was not open on the evidence: R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140, Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282. In my opinion, his Honour’s characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of the offences was open to him. 
     
      
    49 Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal on sentence have not been established.  
     
      
    50 Ground 3 of the appeal raises the issue of the non-parole period. Due to partial accumulation, the total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 7 years 5 months with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The appellant’s complaint is the Judge failed to give proper effect to his stated intention of finding special circumstances.  
     
      
    51 At the time of sentencing, there was a deal of discussion between the Judge and both counsel about special circumstances and the overall ratio between the non-parole and parole periods. His Honour found “special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on the basis of the principle of totality, the need to retain proportion between the sentences and the need of the offender for a greater than unusual [sic] degree of supervision during his parole period having regard to his criminogenic issues…” The balance of the term of the sentence imposed, however, slightly exceeds one third of the non-parole period. It is 33.7 % (round figures) of the non-parole period. His Honour, it is evident, inadvertently failed to adjust the statutory ratio to make proper allowance for the special circumstances which were found. This ground of appeal has been established. 
     
      
    52 The Court, in my opinion, should form as required by s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence …is warranted in law and should have been passed” and proceed to give effect to the Judge’s finding of special circumstances which appears to me to be well founded.  
     
      
    53 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted  
       
       
      (ii) The appeal against the convictions be dismissed 
      
      (iii) In relation to the sentence appeal, quash the sentence imposed by the Judge on count 6. 
     
      
       
      (iv) Sentence the appellant on count 6 to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 years 5 months to date from 19 June 2006 and expire on 18 November 2012 and a balance of term of 3 years 1 month expiring on 18 December 2015.  
       
      
    54 As a result of the sentence I propose for count 6, the overall effective sentence will be a non-parole period of 6 years 10 months to date from 19 January 2006 and expire on 18 November 2012 and a balance of term of 3 years 1 month expiring on 18 December 2015.  
     
      
       
      The earliest date on which the appellant will be eligible for release to parole is 18 November 2012.  
      
    55 McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

      2007/00002619 - REGINA v Daniel WILKIE 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (On application for permanent stay of proceedings) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 14 September 2007 Daniel Wilkie (the applicant) and Ashraf Kamha were arraigned upon an indictment containing six counts, three counts being charged against each accused. Pleas of not guilty were entered and a trial was fixed to commence on 7 July 2008. On that date a fresh indictment was presented against Kamha. The single count in that indictment repeated what had previously been count 3 and, upon arraignment, Kamha pleaded guilty. Pursuant to the procedure in s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 he asked that there be taken into account on sentence a further offence which was similar in terms (with some variation in the particulars) to what had been count 5 in the previous indictment. Kamha has been remanded for a sentencing hearing at a later date.  
     
      
    2 It has been indicated that a fresh indictment against Wilkie will simply repeat what were counts 2, 4 and 6 and they will now be numbered counts 1, 2 and 3. In brief, count 2 (1) charges that being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (FAIG) he knowingly failed to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and duties with the intention of deceiving the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Count 4 (2) charges that as such officer he was privy to the fraudulent altering of a book relating to the affairs of FAIG, namely the AEGIS database. AEGIS was an electronic record maintained by FAIG to process and record premiums, payments, insurance details and case estimates. Once the lastmentioned estimates were made they were entered into AEGIS by authorized staff. Count 6 (3) charges that he committed an offence similar to that charged in count 1, the party deceived being Cooper and Lybrand Actuarial Services Pty Limited which were FAIG’s external actuaries. For the purpose of a comparison I will later set out in full the terms of these counts.  
     
      
    3 Also on 7 July 2008 Wilkie moved the Court for a permanent stay of proceedings on the indictment and it is that with which I now deal. An alternative application for a separate trial from Kamha has become redundant. 
     
      
    4 The application is based upon a contention that the proceedings upon the indictment are an abuse of process. There is no doubt about the power of the Court to order such a stay where that is found to be the case. A perception of abuse may emerge from a variety of possible circumstances and situations: Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR at 60. Nevertheless it is a power that must be exercised with restraint and due recognition of the authority of a prosecutor to bring proceedings and have allegations determined by an appropriately constituted tribunal. In Walton v Gardiner (1992-3) 177 CLR 376 it was observed in the joint judgment (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ at 392) that a finding that continuation of proceedings would be “so unfair and unjustifiably oppressive” as to constitute an abuse of process was something of which a court would be satisfied only in an exceptional or extreme case. In R v Kite [1992] 60 A Crim R 226, Debelle J spoke to similar effect noting previous statements that the discretion would be exercised in rare cases. It is the nature of an order for stay that allegations do not proceed to determination. In testing whether continuation of proceedings would be unfair to an accused, his or her interests must be balanced against the right of the community to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial: Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 33. 
     
      
    5 It has not been disputed in this hearing that the power to order a stay should only be exercised in exceptional cases. The applicant submits that this is an exceptional case. It is accepted that what is involved is an appeal for the exercise of discretion but, if the grounds for it are made out, it should be exercised. I am content to approach the issues on that basis. 
     
      
    6 In a written submission counsel for Wilkie summarized their submission by contending that to require him to face these charges would be vexatious, oppressive and unfair, and, amount to bringing the administration into disrepute for these reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) in the first trial the Crown alleged that by 5 December 1997, the applicant was aware that FAIG was under reserved in the International Book (T57\27-36; T58\33 – 51; T59\2 – 16. The under reserving the subject of the first trial, was under reserving in the International Book); 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) in the first trial the Crown alleged that in June 1998 the applicant was at pains to ensure that the under reserving identified by a Mr Trahair in the International Book, was not disclosed to Coopers & Lybrand, because if it was disclosed to Coopers & Lybrand it would then have been disclosed to FAI’s auditor (T1812\7 – 10); 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) in this trial the Crown alleges that in December 1997 the applicant was aware of under reserving in the International Book. In this trial it is also alleged that the applicant took steps to ensure that the under reserving was not disclosed to Coopers & Lybrand (who at the time were involved in providing an actuarial assessment to be used for the FAI accounts for the six months ended 31 December 1997); 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) on the Crown case in this trial, the 2 January 1998 deductions (which are referred to below) brought about under reserving. The Crown alleges that the applicant knew of that under reserving and took steps to ensure that Coopers & Lybrand did not know of it; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) well before the commencement of the first trial, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Crown were aware of the case which the Crown seeks to make against the applicant in this trial concerning the reductions made on 2 January 1998, the under reserving brought about by those deductions and the under reserving in the International Book; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) the charges in this indictment arise out of facts which were before the Court in the first trial ( 
        R v Carroll 
         213 CLR 635 at [130] per McHugh J. See also Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [47]); 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) the charges the subject of the first trial alleged a series of offences of the same or similar character as the offences the subject of the indictment in this trial and the charges the subject of this trial should have been included in the indictment in the first trial ( 
        Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         [1964] AC 1254 at 1347 per Lord Devlin); 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) on 2 July and 27 August 2001 the applicant was privately examined pursuant to section 19 of the ASIC Law at the premises of ASIC. The section 19 notices referred to an investigation into HIH Insurance Limited and subsidiaries; 
        
       
       
        
        (ix) On 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 March and 23 and 24 April 2002, the applicant gave evidence before the HIH Royal Commission; 
        
       
       
        
        (x) the applicant ceased his employment after he gave evidence before the HIH Royal Commission on 12 March 2002 as a result of the publicity given to the Royal Commission and other than a short time in a family business, has remained unemployed since that time by reason of the Royal Commission, the first trial and this trial; and 
        
       
       
        
        (xi) in November 2005 the applicant was acquitted on all three charges the subject of the first trial.” 
        
       
      
    7 In a written response counsel for the Crown submitted that analysis would demonstrate that the applicant’s case for a stay essentially depended upon three contentions namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The charges in this indictment arise out of facts which were before the Court in the first trial involving the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The charges the subject of the first trial alleged a series of offences of the same or similar character as the offences the subject of the indictment in this trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The charges the subject of this trial could and should have been included in the indictment in the first trial.” 
        
       
      
    8 It is the Crown submission that none of these contentions is correct. In his oral submissions Mr Robberds QC for the applicant submitted that the proposed trial involved unacceptable unfairness or injustice for three main reasons, first that two trials arise out of the same series of alleged events; second this use of the court’s processes will bring the administration of justice into disrepute and, third, the applicant has been subjected to coercive powers of the State since 2001 as a result of which he has effectively remained unemployed. 
     
      
    9 It is therefore necessary to examine the issues at the first trial and to refer to some of the evidence therein for comparison with what is anticipated to be the case in the scheduled trial. It will also be necessary to refer to some of the sources of information concerning the alleged conduct of the applicant. 
     
      
    10 Beginning on 5 September 2005 the applicant (with others) stood trial (the first trial) upon an indictment charging, relevantly, three counts against him. Those counts were in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, charges in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 5th September 2005 that 
        
       
       
        
         DANIEL WILKIE 
        
       
       
        
        1. Between about 1 March 1998 and 6 May 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (‘FAIG’) knowingly did: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) fail to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his office; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) with the intention to deceive the auditors of FAI Insurances Limited; 
        
       
       
        
        in that he caused FAIG to enter into a transaction with General and Cologne Reinsurance Australasia Limited (‘GCRA’) the substance and effect of which was that FAIG agreed to pay premiums totalling $67.5 million to GCRA in order to obtain a maximum reinsurance recovery from GCRA of $65 million but which transaction was structured in such a way to conceal its true substance and effect. 
        
       
       
        
        And the said Director of Public Prosecutions further charges that 
        
       
       
        
         DANIEL WILKIE 
        
       
       
        
        2. Between about 23 June 1998 and 26 June 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (‘FAIG’) knowingly did: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) fail to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his office; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) with the intention to deceive the auditors of FAI Insurances Limited;  
        
       
       
        
        in that he caused FAIG to enter into a transaction with General and Cologne Reinsurance Australasia Limited (‘GCRA’) that amended and extended a transaction entered into between GCRA and FAIG in May 1998 and the substance and effect of which was that FAIG agreed to pay premiums totalling $89.75 million to GCRA in order to obtain a maximum reinsurance recovery from GCRA of $87 million but which transaction was structured in such a way as to conceal its true substance and effect. 
        
       
       
        
        And the said Director of Public Prosecutions further charges that 
        
       
       
        
         DANIEL WILKIE 
        
       
       
        
        3. Between about 26 June 1998 and 9 September 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (‘FAIG’) did permit the making available of information, namely information that FAIG had entered into a reinsurance contract with General and Cologne Reinsurance Australasia Limited (‘GCRA’) the terms of which were recorded in a document on GCRA letterhead and dated 26 June 1998 (the ‘Contract’), to the auditor of FAI Insurances Limited (‘FAI’), a company which controlled FAIG within the meaning of Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act, which related to the affairs of FAIG and which information to the knowledge of Daniel Wilkie omitted from it a matter or thing which rendered the information misleading in a material respect. 
        
       
       
        
          
        Particulars of the Omission 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the substance and effect of the reinsurance arrangements entered into between GCRA and FAIG was not fully recorded in the Contract; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the substance and effect of the reinsurance arrangements included that in addition to paying the premium specified in the Contract, FAIG would pay premiums totalling $12.5 million in relation to six other reinsurance contracts under which contracts FAIG would not seek reinsurance recoveries; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the substance and effect of the reinsurance arrangements entered into between FAIG and GCRA included that FAIG would not seek reinsurance recoveries under one of the sections of the Contract, namely section 6.” 
        
       
      
    11 By 14 November 2005 and by direction of the presiding Judge, Wilkie was found not guilty by the jury on each of those counts.  
     
      
    12 The present indictment charges (using the current numbering): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, charges in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 14 September 2007 that 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         DANIEL WILKIE 
        
       
       
        
        2 Between about 1 January 1998 and about 20 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (‘FAIG’) knowingly failed to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his office with the intention of deceiving the Australian Stock Exchange(‘ASX’). 
        
       
       
        
        Particulars 
        
       
       
        
        He permitted the accounts of FAIG to be consolidated with the accounts of FAI Insurances Limited (“FAI”) as at 31 December 1997, in circumstances where he knew that FAIG’s accounts had a falsely inflated profit figure, that this would falsely inflate the profit in the consolidated accounts of FAI and that the accounts of FAI were to be released to the ASX. 
        
       
       
       
       And the said Director of Public Prosecutions further charges that  
       
       
       DANIEL WILKIE 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4. Between about 1 January 1998 and about 20 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited (‘FAIG’), being a company to which section 590 of the Corporations Law applied, was within ten years before 27 August 2001, privy to the fraudulent altering of a book relating to the affairs of FAIG, namely the AEGIS database. 
        
       
       
        
        And the said Director of Public Prosecutions further charges that 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       DANIEL WILKIE 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        6. Between about 8 December 1997 and about 20 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales being an officer of FAI General Insurance Company Limited knowingly failed to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his office with the intention of deceiving Coopers & Lybrand Actuarial and Superannuation Services Pty Limited (‘Coopers & Lybrand’). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Particulars 
        
       
       
        
        He permitted Coopers & Lybrand to be provided with data relating to case estimates in circumstances where he knew, or had reason to believe, that the data was incomplete and/or inaccurate.” 
        
       
      
    13 It is significant to observe the contrast between the spans of time specified in respect of the counts in the two indictments, those in the present antedating those in the first trial indictment in which the earliest span has a commencement date of 1 March 1998. 
     
      
    14 At material times Wilkie was a director of FAIG which was a subsidiary within the corporate complex which can conveniently be called the FAI Group. He was described as the chief operating officer and head of general insurance operations of the Group. In turn, the FAI Group was part of the HIH Insurance Group. 
     
      
    15 The gravamen of the charges in the indictment presented at the first trial was the conduct of the applicant in the particularized transactions. In broad terms, which will suffice for present purposes, they were entered so as to appear as contracts for reinsurance by which part of the risk borne by FAIG was transferred to GCRA as reinsurer. Such would be calculated to appear to examiners such as auditors or actuarial supervisors as regular reinsurance activity, whereas it was the Crown contention that what was truly involved was not risk reinsurance but financial reinsurance, a transaction which has in essence the characteristics of a loan. If that true nature (financial reinsurance) had been disclosed, there would be a requirement for a debit in the balance sheets of FAIG which would, in due course, flow into the proclaimed trading results of the holding company. No equivalent debit would be raised for a risk reinsurance contract and the trading would then be made to appear more profitable than it was, or, disguise what was effectively a trading loss.  
     
      
    16 As can be seen in the specifications of the counts, the present intended trial has no allegation concerning any dealing with GCRA, the earliest date upon which misconduct was alleged in the first trial being 1 March 1998 in contrast with the latest date in which misconduct is alleged in the present indictment of 20 February 1998. 
     
      
    17 At the first trial it would have been obvious that evidence that Wilkie arranged financial reinsurance rather than conventional risk transfer reinsurance could not, in isolation, be expected to demonstrate a failure to act honestly which the Crown needed to prove. To fulfil this requirement there would have to be tendered evidence of background and other matters to give context, and ultimately if the prosecution was to succeed, requisite proof. 
     
      
    18 As a point of commencement, it was contended that in about late 1997 or early 1998 senior officers of FAIG realized that there were major shortfalls in reserves allocated to meet risks in a number of insurance portfolios. Included was the “international book” which will be particularly germane to the new indictment. Some calculations were made which suggested that if the under reserving were brought into account as should be done, the outcome would be something of a financial catastrophe for the FAI Group. In about late November or early December 1997 Wilkie commenced negotiations with a reinsurer, Willis Faber and Dumas Limited (Willis). A proposition was canvassed in broadly the same terms as were later entered into with GCRA. An executive of Willis described what was sought as accessing the balance sheet of a insurer/reinsurer but that the “deal” involved no risk transfer. The necessity of a payment of a premium was recognized but it was noted that the client (represented by Wilkie) “would like to see this wrapped up as a reinsurance product”. 
     
      
    19 In the event Willis declined any deal. In the meantime a like proposal was being canvassed with GCRA which culminated in the transactions mentioned in the particulars in the counts in the first indictment.  
     
      
    20 What is common between the allegations in support of each indictment is that evidence would show that, what the Crown asserts Wilkie to have done, was done in an attempt to forestall a feared disaster consequent upon the under reservation to meet claims. However, in respect of the present matter, the critical event occurred on 2 January 1998 when the case estimates (and hence required reserves) on about 80 insurance claim files were reduced by just under $24 million. It is the Crown case that there was no proper basis for those reductions which were in due course entered into the AEGIS database. The consequence of this change when consolidated into the holding company’s accounts proclaimed a profit when, if the reductions had not been made, a loss would have been revealed. 
     
      
    21 The counts for the proposed trial as above recited allege that Wilkie was privy to the fraudulent alteration in the estimates. He knew what the false result would cause to the half yearly report to the ASX for the period ended 31 December 1997 and he knowingly permitted the tainted data to be transmitted to the ASX and also that the same data would be used by Coopers & Lybrand in their actuarial task of seeking to provide some updated estimates in respect of some portfolios.  
     
      
    22 It is true that background evidence at the first trial canvassed the realization of the shortfall in reserves but it was not part of the case on any one of the counts that the reductions of estimates on 2 January 1998 were germane, indeed the Crown did not seek to tender evidence in respect of them. It was conceded that in some documents there was in fact a reference to “case estimate manipulation” which is accepted must refer to what happened on 2 January 1998 but to the extent that this incidental material was then before the Court it ceases to have significant weight now in the light of the Crown statement that it is not intended to tender these documents in the scheduled trial because they postdate the charge periods. 
     
      
    23 The case at the first trial was that the purported reinsurance arrangements were put in place to avoid accounting for under reserving with the consequence of inflated positive result for the consolidated accounts for the year ending 30 June 1998. This is in obvious contrast to manipulation of accounts for a different period being the half year ending 31 December 1997. It adds to the distinction between the activities which were the subject of the separate charges that it appears that after the December 1997 accounts were completed reserves attached to the 80 claim files were from time to time increased. Any restoration in the subsequent period would not, of course, extinguish any already executed deception based upon those accounts. 
     
      
    24 To the extent that there were incidental facts before the Court in the first trial which may emerge in the proposed trial I am not satisfied that there would be any duplication so as to lead to a conclusion that the proceedings being contemplated are unfair to the applicant. 
     
      
    25 As the sketches of the alleged offences above set out amply demonstrate, the series of offences in the first indictment are not of similar character to those in the second. The first relates to presenting a reinsurance transaction which was, in truth, a financial transaction whereas the second relates to as fraudulent reduction in risk estimates with consequent deceptive presentation of accounts. What may be said to be of the same or similar character was the apparent motive for the offences. That does not make the offences themselves of the same or similar character. 
     
      
    26 Reference was made to the fact that a witness statement served by the Crown for the first trial canvassed the deductions which had been made on 2 January 1998. The making of those deductions and the entry into the financial reinsurance arrangements were both directed to avoiding the ultimate consequences of the shortfall in reserves which the applicant was shown to have been aware, at least by December 1997. It was contended that these allegations were fundamental to the Crown case. I have referred to motive. Motive is not an ingredient of crime which requires proof but a prosecutor may, if in a position so to do, call evidence relevant to it. The elements of the crimes charged in the first trial included dishonest entry into the particular arrangements and the reason for so doing, that is cloaking the shortfall, was a matter of motive and not a “fundamental allegation”.  
     
      
    27 As the specifications of the counts in the indictment make obvious those in the new indictment are different from those presented at the first trial, however, it must be accepted that the absence of direct inconsistency between new and earlier charges does not inevitably demonstrate that the second prosecution is not oppressive or an abuse of process: In reaching my conclusion I have borne in mind the caution expressed by McHugh J in The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 at 673 that the double jeopardy rule may be infringed by prosecutorial harassment in substance but not in form. Having regard to the distinction abovementioned the current matter is in my view far short of any such infringement: at 673 and 650. 
     
      
    28 I am not satisfied that there is a similarity of character of the charges so as to constitute the presentation of the new indictment an abuse of process.  
     
      
    29 The fact that some evidence will be repeated at a second trial does not involve the reproduction of the evidence in a previous long trial in the sense that was mentioned in Kite at 230. It is plain that, to the extent that there may be repetition, it is to fulfil a need to demonstrate how the corporations operated, who reported to whom and who had what responsibility. There is no abuse of prosecutorial power which would amount to harassing the applicant by deliberate splitting of allegations into multiple indictments. It was not suggested, nor does the material show, that ASIC had some ulterior motive in bringing the present charges. 
     
      
    30 The applicant further argued that abuse of process should be perceived from the failure to charge the misconduct to be alleged in the new indictment in the first proceedings. In support of this submission attention was directed to a considerable amount of material including notes of interviews with witnesses by ASIC investigators, statements taken from witnesses for the purpose of their investigation and for the HIH Royal Commission, as well as evidence given to the Royal Commission. 
     
      
    31 Whether the applicant is being subjected to unfairness for oppression should not be determined by combing, with hindsight what were at the time uncoordinated items of information collected by investigators without taking into account a realistic assessment of the magnitude of the task upon which those investigators were engaged.  
     
      
    32 Particularly in relation to counts 2 and 4, a contest to the submissions of the Crown was presented by detailing the “evidence available” to ASIC at various times which were before the first trial proceedings. I do not consider it necessary to recapitulate that detail. Whether the applicant has been treated unfairly and the processes of the Court are being abused needs to be gauged upon a factual view of what was required of ASIC and the Director of Public Prosecutions to discharge their prosecutorial responsibilities. It is not helpful to assemble snippets of information which can now be pointed to, without bearing in mind that extensive and detailed examination of the complexities of the operations within a large corporate structure was being undertaken. 
     
      
    33 The evidence of Ms Balding provided a revealing description of what was involved. In May 2001 an investigation by ASIC into the affairs of the HIH Insurance Group was extended to include suspected breaches of the law in relation to FAI and its subsidiaries. FAI was at relevant times part of the HIH Group. The focus of investigation was initially directed to the purported reinsurance contracts which ultimately became the subject of charges at the first trial. 
     
      
    34 In August 2001 the Royal Commission was established and in April 2003 the report of the Royal Commissioner (Owen J of the Supreme Court of Western Australia) was tabled in the Federal Parliament. The applicant had been given leave to appear at the Royal Commission. In May 2003 charges were laid against him and others concerning the reinsurance arrangements which were litigated at the first trial. This trial took place between September and November 2005.  
     
      
    35 The Royal Commission had identified some 56 matters involving potential breaches of the law, and some 53 of these related to corporations law. These were referred to ASIC for investigation. They did not include a referral concerning reductions on 2 January 1998 but the report contained an important statement concerning them:  
     
      
       
        
        “The 2 January 1998 adjustments are (a) very serious matters. They are indicative of a manipulative approach to case estimates. But in the light of the dearth of evidence as to the provenance of the list, who directed its preparation and how it was dealt with, I am unable to apportion responsibility”. 
        
       
      
    36 Thus, as the content of the report was absorbed by ASIC investigators they would have become aware of the apparently improper reductions but further inquiries of their own would be required in order to identify who was responsible.  
     
      
    37 I earlier mentioned the magnitude of the tasks upon which ASIC became engaged. There was legislation in June 2003 to enable the transfer of the Royal Commission records from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to ASIC and this was done in the following month. Initially about 640 boxes of hardcopy material were delivered and subsequent additions increased this to a total of about 900 boxes. In the course of its own investigations, ASIC itself had accumulated some 2,350 hardcopy records.  
     
      
    38 It would be absurd to contemplate that the activities of the applicant which related to the 2 January 1998 reductions or, for that matter, the financial reinsurance arrangements were an exclusive target of inquiry. Nevertheless, from the mass of information there emerged a specific focus of investigation to be directed to the January 1998 reductions. This had occurred by April 2004. 
     
      
    39 Whilst ASIC had access to the Royal Commission documentation, it was necessary to be borne in mind that there existed an inhibition upon the use of such material otherwise pursuant to s 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act 1902.  
     
      
    40 Ms Balding’s affidavit affirmed 7 July 2008 set out a detailed summary of interviews and the taking of statements from a substantial number of possible witnesses whose evidence could cast light on the allocation of responsibility for the seemingly improper reductions in reserves on 2 January 1998. I do not recite that content but it presents a powerful demonstration of the size of the task. A submission by the applicant that the elements of the charges now sought to be brought are not complex raised a false issue. Complexity is not to be gauged simply upon the elements of the charge but must include considerations concerning, first, the gathering and then the capacity to present evidence to prove those elements. All of this is relevant to consider when abuse of process is alleged. 
     
      
    41 In accordance with an established procedure recorded in a Memorandum of Understanding ASIC submitted the results of its investigations and the anticipated evidence which it had collected to the Director of Public Prosecutions. This occurred in March 2005 but the investigations remained ongoing. Detail of the latter is also set out in Ms Balding’s affidavit.  
     
      
    42 Consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions led to the provision on 12 October 2005 of court attendance notices for service on the applicant (and Kamha and one Anthony Boulden. In December 2006 Boulden pleaded guilty and was dealt with for an offence concerning a reduction of estimates on 23 January 1998). As at 12 October 2005, the first trial was current and, I infer by arrangement with his lawyers, the court attendance notice was not served upon the applicant until after the termination of the trial. Service was effected on 15 November 2005. 
     
      
    43 Even assuming that ASIC was seized of all the snippets of information which would enable charges to be brought concerning the 2 January 1998 deductions, which is disputed by the Crown, it is the Crown contention that it is doubtful that the counts in the new indictment could have been joined with that presented at the first trial. I agree for the reason that I have already expressed, namely, that the two sets of offences are not of the same or similar character. Their commonality is limited to motive and, obviously, the corporate identity. Further, even if that be incorrect, it is predictable that the co-accused, if they chose, would have been successful in obtaining severance. It is not alleged that Kamha had anything to do with the financial reinsurance arrangements nor is it alleged that the co-accused at the first trial, Mainprize and Burroughs had anything to do with the 2 January 1998 reductions. 
     
      
    44 I am not satisfied that the bringing of separate proceedings constitutes an abuse of process. 
     
      
    45 This leads to the question of overall delay. It is self evidently more than ten years since the critical occurrence of the reductions, the half yearly report to ASX and the conveyance of information to Coopers & Lybrand. 
     
      
    46 The affidavit of Mr Scott reveals that, subject to some limited activity in a family business, the applicant has been unemployed since March 2002. He has had inquiries about the finality of proceedings from sources which may provide employment in the industry in which he has spent the greater part of his career.  
     
      
    47 Particular attention was directed to the adjournment of the committal proceedings which added a period of about ten months to the delay before the scheduled commencement of trial. There is no need to recapitulate the correspondence covering the adjournment and the reasons for it. I am not persuaded that there is a perceptible absence of bona fides nor that this element of delay should lead to the prevention of trial taking place. No complaint is made about any burden of the costs of litigation on the applicant: Wilkie v Gordian Runoff Limited (2005) 221 CLR 522. 
     
      
    48 In determining the balance noted above in reference to Jago, the community interest cannot be gauged without account being taken of the context in which offence is alleged to have been committed and that is, to say the least, a corporate collapse of such immensity that its repercussions led to a major royal commission of inquiry and express legislation and executive action to ameliorate some of the widespread losses of insurance protection in that community.  
     
      
    49 A volume of evidence was presented concerning a potential witness Mr Spratt. A statement by him had been served and he appeared on lists of intended witnesses supplied by the prosecution at the first trial. Some arrangements for his attendance from overseas were communicated. In the event, a decision was announced that he would not be called by the prosecution. Senior counsel for the applicant emphasized that no explanation for the decision accompanied the announcement and it was submitted that I should infer that the Crown was seeking to avoid him being cross examined on credit at that trial and, so to speak, “saving him up” for the purported second trial. 
     
      
    50 I do not draw that inference. Such statements relevant to Mr Spratt’s evidence which have been put before the Court on this motion would amply justify the decision not to call him at the first trial. I am not in a position to assess the atmosphere of that trial as it progressed to termination but the material tendered includes the rulings of the presiding judge which reveal the basis for the directed acquittals. It is entirely possible that the hurdle facing the prosecution was becoming apparent and the presence or absence of evidence from Mr Spratt could not vary the outcome. In making that observation, I stress that I do not seek to diminish the restoration of the presumption of innocence vested in the applicant in respect of the charges at the first trial consequent upon the verdicts of not guilty. 
     
      
    51 A somewhat speculative submission was made which postulated the possibility of the applicant being later charged with offences involving the same conduct but a different victim of deception or, at least, a victim in a different capacity. If something of the sort were to occur, it could no doubt be determined on its merits. That such speculation can be made does not make the case exceptional. 
     
      
    52 Senior counsel for the applicant contended that this was an exceptional case. Insofar as it might be, it is not in the sense that it is unfair or places an intolerable burden on the applicant, but exceptional in the vastness of the circumstances which needed to be examined in order to determine what charges should be brought and against whom. 
     
      
    53 Since the preparation of the foregoing, without objection by the Crown, the applicant’s motion was reopened and a further affidavit by Mr Scott dated 14 July 2008 has been read. It exhibits, inter alia, some exchange of correspondence regarding document production by the prosecution which, leaving aside the question of the justiciability of a notice to produce in addition to the pre-trial disclosures which have been directed, would seem to merit the description of “fishing” contained in it. 
     
      
    54 The particular matter raised upon reopening was focussed upon a remark by senior counsel for the Crown at the first trial (who is not appearing in the present proceedings although his former junior counsel continues to appear) which emerged in a discussion, in the absence of the jury, about the absence at that trial of Kamha as a witness. The remark was made on 3 November 2005 and the transcript (T1661) records: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: The prosecution of Mr Kamha has been charged has been on the cards for sometime. I could say myself and my junior involved in advising the Crown in relation to a very very complex matter, certain recommendations were made some time ago and decisions reached.” 
        
       
      
    55 In these proceedings the affidavit of Fiona Gayler affirmed 7 July 2008 attested that on 14 March 2005 ASIC sent a partial brief to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Some further material was later supplied. It is an agreed fact that the relevant date pertinent to par 33 of the affidavit was 3 August 2005. That paragraph reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “33. Some of this additional evidence included in the brief of evidence for evaluation was obtained by ASIC following discussions with the CDPP. Given the highly complex nature of the proposed prosecution the CDPP’s evaluation included obtaining and considering advice from Counsel.” 
        
       
      
    56 The thrust of the submission in relation to this material was that it reinforces the proposition that the applicant should have been charged with the present matter at the first trial. For the reasons and in the circumstances adumbrated above, I remain unpersuaded by this additional material that the current prosecution represents an abuse of process in any sense. 
     
      
    57 I am not satisfied that any cause has been shown for the exercise of the power of the Court to prevent the determination of the charges by trial. The motion for stay is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a trial by jury of one count under s 233B(1)(a)(iv) of the Customs Act 1901 and s 11.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth) being that, between about 28 and 30 September 2004, he attempted to possess goods that had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act, namely a trafficable quantity of methylamphetamine. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    2 On 19 September 2004 a package was consigned in Guangzhou, China for carriage by air to Sydney via the Express Mail Service. The package carried a consignment note indicating that it was addressed to “Ben Chan” at 86 Mercury Street, Narwee. The consignment note did not record, at least not in English, the nature and value of the goods. The package was given the bar code reference number EA473524526CN. The package arrived in Sydney on 21 September 2004 and was given the parcel post control reference number N239542. It was then taken to the International Mail Handling Unit at Clyde. 
     
      
    3 All packages imported into Australia by post must be cleared by the Australian Customs Service before being released to the recipient. If the value of the goods is less than $1,000 the Customs Service requires an invoice describing the nature and value of the goods and an informal clearance can be given. However, if the value of the goods cannot be ascertained from the accompanying documents, the package is referred to the commercial area of the Sydney Gateway Facility at Clyde and only released after proof of the value of the goods has been provided. 
     
      
    4 On 22 September 2004 the Customs Service prepared and posted a document known as a First Notice in respect of the package. The notice recorded the reference number: N239542, as well as the fact that the declared contents and the sender of the package were “not readable in Chinese”. It also recorded that the value of the goods was “not stated” and that demurrage in respect of the package would commence on 29 September 2004. 
     
      
    5 The First Notice was posted to 86 Mercury Street, Narwee. The evidence disclosed that a person using the name “Ben Chan” but whose correct name was Chan Wai Choeng had lived at the boarding house at that address until 23 September 2004 when he flew from Sydney to Melbourne and then to Hong Kong. 
     
      
    6 By 29 September 2004 the copy of the First Notice which had been mailed to 86 Mercury Street, Narwee was in the possession of the appellant. At 1.21 pm on that day, the appellant made a call from the vicinity of Chinatown on his mobile telephone. The call was made to a woman named Alice Guan. The police intercepted and recorded the call. The conversation was in Mandarin and the appellant said, inter alia, “No, I am right now in here where you guys are. Well, I want to ask you to make a phone call for me, is it okay?” and “No, you come down, you come downstairs to make a phone call for me. Is it okay? Now.” The appellant concluded, “Okay, I shall wait for you down here, okay?” 
     
      
    7 Guan left her premises and went downstairs where she met the appellant on the footpath. She asked the appellant what the call was about. The appellant said that some friends in China had sent a package to him or to his friends and that he did not receive it. The appellant asked her how he could obtain the package. Guan asked what the package contained. The appellant responded that it contained a belt that was filled with a traditional Chinese medicinal liquid that could be used for the treatment of sore backs. The appellant showed Guan the First Notice and asked her to make a telephone call and to enquire about how to obtain the package. The appellant told her that, if she was asked, she should state the value of the goods was about $200. The appellant told Guan that it was the last day on which the package could be obtained.  
     
      
    8 They went to a public telephone and, at 1.34 pm, in the presence of the appellant Guan dialled the telephone number that was printed on the First Notice. During the telephone call with a Customs Officer Guan said that she was calling on behalf of a friend who did not speak good English. To her question as to how the package could be retrieved, the Officer said that her friend should take identification to the post office. 
     
      
    9 After the call Guan repeated to the appellant the advice she had received. She told him that the appellant should take identification to the post office. The appellant said “It shouldn’t be like that”. Guan said “If you don’t believe me you can just make a phone call yourself and you can ask”. At 1.38 pm the appellant dialled the second number that was recorded on the First Notice (a 1800 number) and spoke to a Customs Officer by the name of Andrew Donnelly. 
     
      
    10 Mr Donnelly, in his evidence in chief, gave the following account of the conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: How did that conversation commence? 
         
        A: It commenced with me answering the phone and I said ‘Good morning, Australian Customs’. The voice on the other end said ‘I’m calling about my package’. I asked for – I said, ‘Do you have a reference number’? The person said ‘What is the reference number’? I indicated the reference number would begin with an N followed by six digits. They then said the reference number is N239542. I then asked to put them on hold so that I could go to the receptacle to collect the corresponding card to that reference number. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you refer to the corresponding card, do you refer to the remaining part of the document that was kept by Customs after the perforated slip was removed from it? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And did you locate that card in the receptacle? 
         
        A: I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you do then? 
         
        A: I then returned to the phone call and said ‘how can I help you with this’. The caller said ‘I want you to send me my package.’ I said ‘it must be cleared through Customs first’. They said ‘But you’ll send me my package’, and I said, ‘You will need to send us some documentation indicating what is in the parcel and how much it is worth’. He then said ‘I don’t have an invoice.’ I said, ‘We need to get something, you need to send something through either by fax or you have to attend the facility in person.’ They then said ‘I will get a friend to get an invoice’ and then terminated the phone call.” 
        
       
      
    11 At the conclusion of the conversation Mr Donnelly made a note on the Customs Service computer database that stated “going to get friend to get invoice”. On the following day he made a detailed note of the conversation and when cross-examined he gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You made it clear to the caller what it was Customs needed to clear the goods, correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When he was responding to what you were saying it was reasonably clear to you he did not understand precisely what you were saying, is that fair? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So you had to repeat yourself a number of times, correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: For you to understand him he had to repeat himself a number of items, is that correct? 
         
        A: I would say yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: The up shot of the conversation was to the effect it was clear to you who ever the caller was he did not appear to be aware of Customs procedures, is that right? 
         
        A: That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Whatever the up shot of the conversation that person, who ever the caller was, was asking questions as to how the goods could be released, is that correct? 
         
        A: They were not asking questions on how it was to be released. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Just saying he was calling about having the goods released? 
         
        A: He was requesting them to be released, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: If they had been released they would have been sent to 86 Mercury Street, Narwee wouldn’t they? 
         
        A: I presume so, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That was the address you had in front of you, correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When the person spoke to you about whatever the parcel was he was saying the parcel is for somebody at 86 Mercury Street, Narwee, is that correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And even when you tried to remember on the 30 September you were not able to tell Felicity Galvin whether the person was asking for the goods for themself or for a friend of his, is that fair? 
         
        A: Um, he only said ‘send the goods’, ‘ send me the goods’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But you tried because you were asked by Felicity Galvin to tell her in your note whether or not he was asking for the goods for himself or for a friend and you actually made a note that you were not confident to say which it was, correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Once you had conveyed to the person an invoice was required to indicate the value of the goods the person said words to the effect he would get his friend to get the invoice and he hung up, is that correct? 
         
        A: That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Well you are not confident to say whether or not he said he would get the invoice from the friend or get the friend to bring the invoice? 
         
        A: Yes, he said he would get his friend to get the invoice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Get his friend to get the invoice? 
         
        A: Yes.” 
        
       
      
    12 After the conversation with Customs the appellant joined Guan in a coffee shop. She asked him what had happened to which he answered “Nothing happened”. The appellant and Guan then drove to a shopping centre in Burwood. The appellant had asked Guan to accompany him to a home unit in Hurstville for the purpose of cleaning it. The appellant told Guan that the flat belonged to a friend. They went to the unit but left when Guan asked to be driven to Darling Harbour. 
     
      
    13 At approximately 4 pm on 29 September 2004 police obtained a warrant to search unit 904 at 600 Railway Parade, Hurstville. At that time the police were not aware that a package addressed to “Ben Chan” and containing methylamphetamine had been imported into Australia. The search warrant related to the home unit but not to the appellant or to methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    14 At about 7.30 pm that evening the appellant returned to the unit at Railway Parade. He arrived by car with a woman. The police observed their arrival and entry into the building. At 7.55 pm a group of police went to the door of the unit. Detective Johnston knocked and the door was opened by the appellant who was wearing only a towel. The woman was inside the unit, also wearing only a towel. The police explained that they had a warrant to search the premises and allowed the woman to get dressed. 
     
      
    15 The appellant then asked “Can I get dressed now?” Det Johnston and Det Watson escorted the appellant into the bedroom where he put on a top and a pair of jeans. The appellant then said “I need to go to the toilet”. He was escorted from the bedroom into the adjoining bathroom where the appellant approached the toilet bowl and faced the wall. He pulled down his jeans to just below his buttocks and then turned to face the detectives and bent forward. He held the waist band of his trousers with his left hand and moved his right hand from the waistband into the front right pocket. His right hand was in the pocket up to his wrist. He leaned forward, lowered the jeans to just below his knee, moved his buttocks towards the toilet bowl and said “Privacy please” and then bent down to sit on the toilet. 
     
      
    16 Det Watson said “Stop, I have not searched those pants yet”. He approached the appellant and put his left hand on the outside of the front right pocket of the jeans. The appellant’s right hand was still in the pocket. The appellant withdrew his hand from the pocket and presented an empty palm. Det Watson ordered the appellant to remove the jeans. The appellant kicked them off as he sat on the toilet. Det Watson said “You may go to the toilet now”. 
     
      
    17 Det Johnston searched the pockets of the jeans and located the First Notice. He also removed other items including a wad of bank notes from the left pocket. He placed these items on the floor. The appellant stood and faced the detective and once the items were removed from his jeans said “I don’t have to go [to the toilet] now”. The appellant put on the jeans and walked out of the bathroom without flushing the toilet. Det Watson inspected the bowl and found that the appellant had not used it. 
     
      
    18 The police carried out a search of the premises after which they told the appellant that he was free to go although they may need to speak to him later. Shortly after leaving the unit Det Watson rang the Customs Service and asked them to locate the package referred to in the First Notice. The police left the First Notice on the kitchen bench. 
     
      
    19 On the morning of 30 September 2004, at about 4 am, the appellant returned to his home at Northwood and spoke to his wife, Airi Kawata. She gave evidence that the appellant looked pale and was holding the First Notice. He told her that he had been in trouble with the police because of the First Notice. He said to her that the Notice was from the Australian Customs Service and asked her to translate it. Kawata read the document and asked the appellant who Chan was. The appellant said that he did not know. The appellant then told Kawata that he was going to China or Hong Kong and that he would call her later. He said that he was going because he was in trouble with the police. He put the First Notice into his pocket, packed some clothes and money into a bag and left. 
     
      
    20 At about 6.30 am on 30 September the package was located at the Customs Service premises at Clyde. It comprised a cardboard box in which there was a sealed Styrofoam box which contained 4 liquid-filled pillows as well as tassels, bamboo mats, wall hangings and cushion covers. A small amount of liquid from one of the pillows was tested and found to be methylamphetamine. The weight of pure methylamphetamine was calculated to be 6,127.9 grams. 
     
      
    21 By 7.36 am on that day the appellant arrived at the airport. He purchased a seat on a China Southern Airlines flight from Sydney to Guangzhou that was due to depart at 9.50 am. The ticket cost $2,043.86, which the appellant paid in cash. The ticket provided for a return journey. The appellant planned to travel to China using his Australian passport. It was a condition of travel to China that a person travelling on an Australian passport have a return or onward ticket. 
     
      
    22 Following the notification by the Customs Service about the contents of the package, the police went to the departure gate in the Sydney International Airport terminal where the appellant was waiting for his flight. The appellant was detained.  
     
      
    23 At about 5.50 pm on 30 September 2004 police officers went with officers of the Customs Service to the premises at 86 Mercury Street, Narwee. A resident named Wang Yun Long told them that a person named “Mr Chan” had stayed at the premises until 23 September 2004 but had departed for Hong Kong on that date. The evidence disclosed that a person by the name of Chan Wai Choeng had flown on that day from Sydney to Melbourne and boarded a flight to Hong Kong. The same person had arrived in Australia from Hong Kong at Cairns International Airport on 25 August 2004. 
     
      
    24 The Crown case relied on the evidence that the appellant had come into possession of the First Notice by 29 September 2004. It was the Crown case that the appellant intended that the package would be delivered to the Narwee address. It was submitted that when the appellant himself telephoned the Customs Service he did more than merely inquire but was requesting that the package be sent to the consignment address. It was submitted that these acts went beyond mere preparation to obtain the package but constituted an attempt to obtain possession of it. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1: the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the Crown case. 
       
      
    25 At the conclusion of the Crown case, an application was made on behalf of the appellant that there should be a directed verdict of acquittal. The application was rejected. The trial judge’s ruling was challenged by the appellant in this Court.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that the statements made by the appellant in his conversation with Mr Donnelly could not constitute an attempt but, at their highest, were indicative of an act by the appellant which was merely preparatory. Secondly, it was submitted that the conclusion by her Honour that the appellant’s words could be interpreted as a direction to “send it”, that is, to send the parcel was erroneous.  
     
      
    27 The foundation for the appellant’s submissions was that without express identification by the appellant of where he required the parcel to be sent and to whom it was to be addressed, the appellant’s exchange with Mr Donnelly could not constitute an attempt to commit the offence. It was submitted that there was nothing in the evidence to link the appellant with the premises at Narwee. It was further submitted that when the appellant said to Mr Donnelly “but you’ll send me my package” he should be understood to be merely making an enquiry with respect to a potential future outcome rather than making a request that Mr Donnelly send the package. 
     
      
    28 Before the appellant could be convicted of attempting to commit the relevant offence, the evidence was required to satisfy the test in s 11.1(2) of the Criminal Code (Cth) which provides that “the person’s conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence.” As the subsection indicates the question as to whether conduct is merely preparatory is one of fact. In the present case the appellant’s conversation with Mr Donnelly was capable of the inference that the appellant was requesting that the package be sent to the address recorded on the First Notice, namely 86 Mercury Street, Narwee. Had Mr Donnelly acted upon that request and arranged for the package to be released, having no other information, he could only have sent it to that address. Given that the appellant had possession of the First Notice which bore that address, there is reason to infer that he had sufficient contact with the Narwee premises to enable him to retrieve the package if it had been sent there. The appellant’s actions in engaging Guan to make contact with Customs are consistent with him endeavouring, at least initially, to separate himself from the request of Customs. To the extent that he spoke of the involvement of a friend with Mr Donnelly, the jury were entitled to conclude that this was a further attempt to disguise his involvement in the illegal activity. 
     
      
    29 The appellant challenged the evidence of Mr Donnelly and submitted that his recollections were unclear and his evidence was unsatisfactory. To my mind that challenge has little merit. Even if his recollection was not certain this would not have been a reason to direct a verdict of acquittal. It was for the jury to assess the reliability of Mr Donnelly’s evidence.  
     
      
    30 I would reject ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: the directions given by the judge in response to questions asked by the jury on the issue of possession, specifically on the issue of “control” of property, were erroneous having regard to the evidence and the circumstances of the case. 
       
      
    31 After the trial judge had completed summing up the jury asked two questions. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. If a person makes a request or demand for an item to be sent to another person, does this request constitute an attempt to gain control of the property? 
        
       
       
        
        B. Does the definition of attempt to possess include exercising control of the property on behalf of another.” 
        
       
      
    32 Her Honour discussed the matter with counsel and then gave further directions. With respect to the first question she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If A asks B to send a parcel to C, and at the time that A makes that request, he believes that the parcel contains drugs, and A’s role is simply to make that request, then A is not guilty of attempting to possess the drugs because it is not contemplated that A will, at any stage, himself actually exercise physical control of the drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        But there is a proviso to that. If you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that A asked B to send this parcel which A believed to contain drugs, to C, and the ultimate plan in A’s mind was that both that A and C would exercise physical control of the drugs at some time in the future, then that would be an attempt to possess because it would be an attempt to have joint possession at some future time. However, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was the plan. A plan in A’s mind to have joint possession at a future time.” 
        
       
      
    33 In response to the second question her Honour gave the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that is really a question about possession rather than attempt possession. 
        
       
       
        
        Just in relation to possession, if A or the accused whatever we want to say, if a person, let us say A, intentionally exercises physical control of the parcel, that is he exercises control of the parcel believing that it contains drugs, then A is in possession even though he plans at a future time to give the parcel to C. That would be an example of temporary possession. The issue is whether A was intentionally exercising physical control of the parcel. 
        
       
       
        
        I think that your questions, in a general sense, really come down to this. It is a question of whether the purpose of the accused’s act – the act which the Crown relied upon was the phone call to Donnelly – whether the purpose of that act was that, at some stage, the accused himself would actually exercise physical control of the drugs, either by himself or in conjunction with another person. So I think that perhaps what you should be asking yourselves is – are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the purpose of that call to Donnelly, in the accused’s mind, was that, at some stage in the future, he himself would actually exercise physical control of the parcel which he believe contained drug[s]? Whether it was his purpose in making that call that, at some stage, he would exercise actual physical control of the drugs, whether by himself or with another person? That is what you would have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    34 Following a request from the jury her Honour repeated the directions although not in identical terms. I refer to the differences in [35] below. No complaint was made by the representative of the appellant (who was not his advocate at the trial) with respect to the content of these directions, either in their original form or when repeated. 
     
      
    35 The appellant now has two complaints about these further directions. The first complaint is that in her initial response to the first question her Honour introduced the concept of whether a particular outcome was “contemplated” by the appellant when she should have referred to whether the outcome “was intended.” It was submitted that an outcome may be contemplated without being intended.  
     
      
    36 I reject the submission. Her Honour’s directions made clear that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant intended to exercise physical control over the narcotic drugs. Her Honour had already explained the concept of possession to the jury saying on three occasions that possession involves the circumstance that the “possessor intentionally has the ability to control” the relevant property. When her Honour first gave the direction she spoke of the ultimate plan in A’s mind by reference to the exercise of physical control of the drugs. However, of particular significance is that when she repeated the direction it was slightly reformulated and her Honour said “the proviso to that is that, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at some future time, A did intend to exercise actual physical control of the drugs …” Reference to intention is made on 2 further occasions. 
     
      
    37 In these circumstances I am satisfied that the jury would have understood that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to possess the narcotic goods. Rule 4 applies. I would refuse leave to raise this matter. 
     
      
    38 The second complaint made by the appellant is that the trial judge did not give directions which were related to the evidence in the case. It was submitted that, because there was no evidence of any intention on the part of the appellant to jointly possess the prohibited drugs with another, the directions should not have included reference to joint possession.  
     
      
    39 There is no substance in this complaint. To properly deal with the jury’s question it was appropriate for her Honour to deal with the circumstances where a request was made on behalf of another to send goods to the other person and contrast that with the circumstance where the request was to send goods to another person, but with the intention that the person making the request would also jointly with the other person, exercise physical control over the goods. Although her Honour made these remarks in response to the jury’s question, the Crown case was, and remained throughout, that the appellant himself sought to obtain possession of the narcotic goods. In cross-examination of Ms Guan and Mr Donnelly defence counsel had suggested that the appellant may have been seeking to obtain the package for a friend. In its closing address the prosecutor, anticipating the defence submission, submitted that no friend had been identified in the evidence and sought to counter any suggestion that the friend might have been “Ben Chan” (Chan Wai Choeng), Sam Guo Wei Ho or any person that the appellant might have met in Burwood on 29 September 2004. The Crown did not advance a case of joint possession but merely sought to maintain its case that the appellant sought possession of narcotic goods in its own right. 
     
      
    40 The manner in which her Honour’s directions were given did not open up the possibility of the Crown obtaining a conviction on a basis different to the manner in which the Crown case had been presented. Again rule 4 applies. I would refuse leave to raise this matter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    41 In relation to this ground of appeal the appellant in effect repeated his submissions with respect to the first and second grounds. 
     
      
    42 The appellant also drew attention to paras 40 and 43 of the summing up where her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] Of course, in this regard, the accused submits that the Crown case is based on Donnelly’s recollection and that Donnelly took dozens of calls that afternoon before he was asked to recall what was said by Ms Galvin. The accused submitted that the conversation on his part was in broken English and that Donnelly had difficulty understanding it. And Mr Jeffreys pointed you to the concession which Mr Donnelly made in cross-examination that, although the accused said, ‘Send me the goods’, he could not be sure if the accused was asking on behalf of himself or someone else. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] The accused submitted to you that, at the time he spoke to Ms Guan and his wife, he was trying to find out what was required, trying to understand the first notice, before he proceeded any further to try to obtain possession of the parcel. Consistent with that, the purpose of the conversation with Donnelly may also have been mere information – gathering, preparatory to an attempt to possess. Further, the accused submitted that, had the parcel been sent, it would have been sent to 86 Mercury Street, Narwee. That was not the accused’s address. So it could not necessarily be the case that the accused intended that he would obtain possession. The accused submitted that, on 29 September, at the time he spoke to Ms Guan, immediately before making the call to Donnelly, she was not clear whether the accused wanted the parcel for himself or a friend. At the time, she did not pay attention to whether it was for him or a friend, though he did mention a friend. She could not tell whether it was his parcel or his friend’s parcel.” 
        
       
      
    43 The appellant submitted that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt with respect to the appellant’s knowledge of or belief in the fact that the parcel contained prohibited drugs. It was further submitted that if there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant may have been seeking to have the parcel sent to another person, then the case against him was not made out. 
     
      
    44 The possession by the appellant of the First Notice, his engagement of Ms Guan to make the telephone call, his reluctance to collect the package from the mail facility, his effort to dispose of the First Notice after the police had arrived at the home unit, his admissions to his wife and his attempt to flee the country provided powerful evidence that he knew the package contained narcotic goods.  
     
      
    45 The further question which the jury had to determine was whether in his conversation with Mr Donnelly the appellant had attempted to obtain the package for himself. The appellant emphasised that Mr Donnelly, when cross-examined, said that he was not able to say with confidence whether the caller was asking for the goods for himself or a friend. 
     
      
    46 Mr Donnelly’s recollection was clear that the appellant had said “Send the goods”, “Send me the goods.” His hesitation was with respect to whether the appellant was asking for the goods for himself or a friend. Of course, this was not his concern and required him to interpret the appellant’s intention beyond his immediate request. Because the appellant had mentioned “a friend” his hesitation was understandable. However, the content of the conversation was clear and it was plainly open to the jury to conclude, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was requesting that the package be delivered to him. The jury were obliged to consider Mr Donnelly’s account of that conversation together with the other evidence of the steps which the appellant had taken to retrieve the package. In my opinion, and, having reviewed the entire record, this was a strong Crown case. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    48 JAMES J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    49 HOEBEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL and with the order he proposes.

    1 ALLSOP P: I agree.  
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Shane Francis O’Meara applied for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal and for leave to appeal with respect to sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Johnston on 15 December 1995 and orders made by his Honour on 4 April 1997. For a proper understanding of the issues which arose on the applications, it is necessary to state the background facts in some detail. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    3 On 17 February 1995 police executed a search warrant at premises in a Sydney suburb. The applicant was at the premises at the time the search warrant was executed.  
     
      
    4 In the course of executing the search warrant the police found a quantity of cannabis 6.6 grams, a quantity of methylamphetamine 7.6 grams and 5 cannabis plants. Police also found items connected with the supply of drugs, including a set of scales and resealable plastic bags. The applicant admitted to police that he had been dealing in cannabis for a period of four months. Police also found a credit card in the name of a person other than the applicant, a driver’s licence in the name of a person other than the applicant, a quantity of cash and an item of electronic equipment. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was charged with two offences of supplying a prohibited drug (deemed supply) and an offence of cultivating prohibited plants. He was granted bail and released on bail. 
     
      
    6 In April 1995 the applicant committed offences of breaking, entering and stealing, stealing a motor vehicle, attempting to break and enter premises with the intent to commit a serious indictable offence, driving in a dangerous manner and driving while unlicensed. The applicant was arrested and charged with these offences but was again granted bail and released on bail. 
     
      
    7 In September 1995 the applicant was dealt with in the Local Court for the April 1995 offences. He was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment totalling 12 months commencing on 22 September 1995 and he commenced serving those sentences. He brought an appeal to the District Court against the sentences. 
     
      
    8 On 16 November 1995 the applicant pleaded guilty before Judge Johnston to the charges of supplying a prohibited drug and the charge of cultivating prohibited plants. The applicant asked Judge Johnston to take into account in sentencing him, and Judge Johnston agreed to take into account, an offence of receiving and four offences of goods in custody, which were based on some of the items other than drugs which police had found during the execution of the search warrant. It would appear that on 16 November 1995 Judge Johnston conducted a hearing of both the sentencing of the applicant for the drug offences and the appeal by the applicant against the sentences for the April 1995 offences.  
     
      
    9 On 15 December 1995 Judge Johnston delivered a judgment containing his remarks on the sentencing of the applicant for the drug offences and his judgment on the appeal against the sentences for the April 1995 offences. For each of the two offences of supplying a prohibited drug Judge Johnston imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years commencing on 24 November 1995 to be served by way of periodic detention and for the offence of cultivating prohibited plants his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for one year commencing on the same date and also to be served by way of periodic detention. His Honour allowed the appeals against the sentences for the April 1995 offences, quashing the prison sentences which had been imposed and deferring passing sentences conditionally upon the applicant entering into recognizances. The applicant duly entered into recognizances. 
     
      
    10 The applicant served a total of 29 periods of periodic detention and incurred a further six penalty periods as a result of unauthorised absences. However, at some time in 1996 the applicant ceased complying at all with the periodic detention orders and absconded from Sydney.  
     
      
    11 An application was made on behalf of the Commissioner of Corrective Services for the cancellation of the periodic detention orders. On 4 April 1997, in the absence of the applicant, Judge Johnston cancelled the periodic detention orders pursuant to s 25(3A) of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981, which was the legislation relating to periodic detention orders which was then in force. His Honour issued a warrant for the apprehension and detention of the applicant to serve the unexpired portion of the sentences for the drug offences by way of full time imprisonment. The unexpired portion of the sentences including penalty periods was 2 years 6 months 26 days. 
     
      
    12 A direction was made for the applicant to be called up for breach of the recognizances he had entered into in relation to the April 1995 offences. On the date fixed for the call-up proceedings there was no appearance by the applicant and an order was made that a warrant issue for the arrest of the applicant.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was not arrested until 22 September 2007 when he was arrested by Queensland police at Mt Isa in Queensland. He has been continuously in custody since 22 September 2007. 
     
      
    14 On 18 October 2007 a District Court judge ordered that there be no action taken on the breaches by the applicant of the recognizances entered into by him in relation to the April 1995 offences. 
     
      
       
      Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 
       
      
    15 As I have already indicated, the legislation relating to periodic detention orders which was in force when the orders for periodic detention of the applicant were made and cancelled was the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 and was that Act before it was amended by the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Amendment Act No 43 of 1998, which commenced on 1 February 1999. Period detention orders which have been made since the commencement of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have, of course, been governed by the provisions of that Act, which are in some respects different from the provisions of the earlier legislation. It is convenient to summarise some of the provisions of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act, as it stood at the relevant times.  
     
      
    16 Section 25 of the Act provided that the Court that had made a periodic detention order could cancel the order. Section 25(3A) of the Act, which was the provision pursuant to which Judge Johnston cancelled the applicant’s periodic detention orders, provided that a court, on an application by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, was obliged to cancel a periodic detention order, if it was satisfied that the prisoner had failed to report for three or more detention periods, and the prisoner did not have the benefit of any leave of absence or exemption.  
     
      
    17 Section 27 of the Act stated the effect of cancellation of an order for periodic detention. Section 27(1)(c) provided that any unexpired portion of the sentence of imprisonment to which the order applied should be deemed to be a separate term of imprisonment imposed at the time of the cancellation and then contained further provisions about when the deemed term of imprisonment should commence. Section 27(4) provided that a court cancelling an order for periodic detention could in its discretion direct that any unexpired portion of the sentence be taken to consist of a minimum term and an additional term under the Sentencing Act 1989. In cancelling the orders for periodic detention Judge Johnston expressly declined to make any direction under s 27(4) of the Act.  
     
      
       
      Authorities 
       
      
    18 On these applications the Court was referred to a number of previous decisions of this Court on the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981, including the decisions of the Court in R v Sommerville (1995) 36 NSWLR 184 and R v Wilson (1997) 93 A Crim R 301. There are a number of passages in the judgment of Smart J, who delivered the leading judgment in Wilson, which it is convenient to quote.  
     
      
    19 At p 309 Smart J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In Sommerville (1995) 36 NSWLR 184 the Chief Justice and Barr AJ held that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision of a District Court judge cancelling an order for periodic detention ….  
         
         
        The Chief Justice further held that because s27(1)(c) deems the unexpired portion of the original sentence to be a separate term of imprisonment imposed at the time of the cancellation then some limited appellate consequences flow …. 
         
         
        The Chief Justice pointed out that questions may arise whether the judge was correct in deciding to set or not to set minimum and additional terms and the length of the terms which he set. These may be dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    20 At p 310 Smart J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In Sommerville the Chief Justice held that the cancellation of a periodic detention order and the making or refusal of an order under s27(4) did not quash or expunge the original sentence which itself remains subject to appeal or potential appeal in the ordinary way. The reasons given for that view are compelling…” 
        
       
      
    21 At p 311 Smart J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Usually the question which arises on an application for leave to appeal centres on whether the sentencing judge has made an error. However, in Sommerville the court pointed out that there were exceptional cases in which leave should be given by reason of what had happened following the original sentencing amounting to a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    22 In Wilson Smart J also stated that there were practical problems in a court making an order cancelling a periodic detention order in the absence of the detainee and the better course, where a detainee was not before the court on an application for the cancellation of a periodic detention order, was, not immediately to make an order cancelling the periodic detention order, but to issue a warrant for the arrest of the detainee so that he could be brought before the court for the hearing of the application for the cancellation of the order. In the present case, the applicant was not before the Court when Judge Johnston made the cancellation orders and declined to make any direction under s 27(4) of the Act.  
     
      
    23 On these applications the Court was also referred to a number of judgments in this Court where reference was made to the common practice of sentencing judges, when imposing a sentence of imprisonment and making an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention under the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act as it stood before the 1998 amendments, to make the sentence of imprisonment longer than the sentence would have been, if it was to be served in full-time custody. In R v Mikas (1996) 85 A Crim R 34 Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at 47-48:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well accepted now that, where it is intended to make an order that a sentence be served by way of periodic detention, the length of the sentence imposed will often be longer than one which would have been appropriate if the sentence were to be served by way of full-time custody. This is because of the recognition that periodic detention has a strong degree of leniency built into it and that it is outwardly less severe in its denunciation of the crime.” 
        
       
      
    24 This practice was not permissible under the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act after it had been amended by the 1998 amending Act (R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405) and is not permissible under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (R v Douar (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at 165 (69-72)). 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    25 On these applications counsel for the applicant submitted, as his primary submissions, that an extension of time should be granted, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed, with respect to the original sentences of 15 December 1995. The appeals against the original sentences were on the basis, not that the sentencing judge had made any error in sentencing the applicant, but on the basis permitted by the decisions of this Court in Sommerville and Wilson, that the present case was one of those exceptional cases in which events which had happened after the original sentencing had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    26 It was accepted by counsel for the applicant that there was no express statement in his Honour’s remarks on sentence of 15 December 1995 that his Honour in sentencing the applicant was following the then common practice of setting longer terms of imprisonment than would have been appropriate if the sentences were to be served by way of full-time custody because his Honour had in mind ordering that the sentences be served by way of periodic detention. However, counsel submitted, it could be inferred that his Honour had followed this practice, because at the time of the sentencing it was a practice commonly followed by sentencing judges, the terms of imprisonment of three years were the maximum term of imprisonment for which an order for periodic detention could be made under s 5 of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act and the sentences imposed by his Honour would have been manifestly excessive if they were to be served by way of full-time imprisonment.  
     
      
    27 After the applicant had been sentenced the orders that the terms of imprisonment be served by way of periodic detention had been cancelled and the unexpired portions of the terms of imprisonment had become terms of imprisonment to be served by way of full-time imprisonment. There would be a miscarriage of justice if the length of the sentences to be served by the applicant was not reduced. 
     
      
    28 It was further submitted by counsel for the applicant that this Court should re-sentence the applicant to sentences of imprisonment containing a non-parole period and a balance of the term of imprisonment and that, by some means, the applicant must be given credit for the periods of periodic detention which he had actually served and the period he has spent in full-time custody since September 2007.  
     
      
    29 An alternative submission was made by counsel for the applicant that an extension of time should be granted, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed, with respect to the orders made by Judge Johnston on 4 April 1997, by the setting of a minimum term or non-parole period for each sentence. On 4 April 1997 Judge Johnston had declined to make any direction under s 27(4) of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act that there be a minimum term and an additional term. However, his Honour, contrary to the practice which this Court held should be followed, had proceeded on 4 April 1997 in the absence of the applicant, not affording the applicant any opportunity to be heard.  
     
      
    30 In its written submissions the Crown, while not conceding that the sentences of three years would be manifestly excessive, if they were to be served by way of full-time imprisonment, conceded that “it would be open to this Court to find that the sentencing judge did in fact increase the applicant’s sentence to three years to reflect the fact that it was to be served by way of periodic detention”. The Crown also conceded that “this Court may find that the sentencing judge erred in proceeding in the absence of the applicant and in failing to set a minimum term or non-parole period on 4 April 1997”.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    31 In my opinion, counsel for the applicant’s primary submissions should be upheld.  
     
      
    32 For the reasons given by counsel for the applicant, it can be inferred that in sentencing the applicant Judge Johnston set longer terms of imprisonment than would have been appropriate if the sentences were to be served by way of full-time custody, because he intended ordering that the sentences be served by way of periodic detention. A further reason for drawing this inference is that his Honour in his remarks on sentence said that “the scales have tipped just in his balance to prevent a full-time custodial sentence being imposed”, a remark which would not be consistent with his Honour considering that a full-time custodial sentence for as long as three years would be appropriate. Consequently, by reason of what happened after the original sentencing, that is the cancellation of the periodic detention orders and the conversion of the sentences into sentences to be served by way of full-time imprisonment, a miscarriage of justice has arisen. An extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal should be granted, leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed and the original sentences of 15 December 1995 should be quashed.  
     
      
    33 As I have upheld counsel for the applicant’s primary submissions, it is unnecessary to deal with counsel’s alternative submissions. Had it been necessary to deal with the alternative submissions, I would have considered that the alternative submissions should be upheld.  
     
      
    34 Having decided that the appeal against the original sentences should be allowed, it is necessary for me to give consideration to the re-sentencing of the applicant by this Court. It was common ground between counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown that this Court should re-sentence the applicant in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    35 I have earlier in this judgment outlined the objective facts of the offences.  
     
      
    36 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge made a number of findings about the subjective circumstances of the applicant, some of which continue to be relevant and other of which are no longer relevant.  
     
      
    37 At the time he was sentenced by Judge Johnston the applicant was 21 years old. His Honour found that up to the time of committing the drug offences the applicant had led “a crime-free life”. His Honour found that the applicant had embarked upon a commercial venture in the supply of drugs but that this was “his first and only venture into the drug scene”. His Honour accepted an opinion by a psychologist that the applicant was “an immature and rather dependent individual”, who had found it difficult to cope with life and its problems, after he had left an apprenticeship as a jockey because of increasing weight. His Honour found that the applicant was genuinely contrite.  
     
      
    38 For the purposes of the re-sentencing of the applicant, the Court received recent affidavits by the applicant and by the applicant’s solicitor. 
     
      
    39 In his affidavit the applicant said that he had lived interstate after leaving Sydney in 1996. He was employed for most of the time between 1996 and 2007 in a number of occupations. During this period he committed a total of three minor offences for which he was fined or received a recognizance. In 2006 he was diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder, for which he has since been receiving medication. He is in a relationship with a woman which has lasted five years.  
     
      
    40 The applicant voluntarily disclosed to Queensland police at Mt Isa that he had absconded from periodic detention in New South Wales and it was this voluntary disclosure which eventually led to him being arrested at Mt Isa.  
     
      
    41 Annexures to the applicant’s solicitor’s affidavit include favourable references from former employers of the applicant.  
     
      
    42 Credit can be given to the applicant for the time he has already served in periodic detention or in full-time custody by backdating the commencement of the sentences this Court imposes. I do not, however, consider that the amount of the credit can be the subject of a precise mathematical calculation. I do not consider that the periods of periodic detention served by the applicant should, as was submitted by counsel for the applicant, be regarded as equivalent to the same number of weeks of full-time custody. I would backdate the commencement of the sentences to 1 July 2007 to allow for the time already served by the applicant in prison.  
     
      
    43 In my opinion, taking into account the objective facts of the offences and the applicant’s subjective features, the applicant should be sentenced to head sentences of 20 months for each of the two offences of supplying a prohibited drug, the sentences to be served concurrently. It was common ground between counsel that it is unnecessary now to deal with the sentence for cultivating prohibited plants. I do not consider that I should find that there are any special circumstances, particularly as the sentences I consider should be imposed are short and have little further time to run.  
     
      
    44 In my opinion, the following orders should be made:- 
     
      
     1. Extend the time for applying for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Johnston on 15 December 1995 to the date of the filing of these applications. 
      
     2. Leave to appeal granted. 
      
     3. Appeal allowed. 
      
     4. Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Johnston. 
      
     5. In lieu thereof sentence the applicant on each of the two charges of supplying a prohibited drug to a non-parole period of 15 months commencing 1 July 2007 and expiring on 30 September 2008 and a balance of the term of five months. 
      
     6. Order that the applicant be released on parole on 30 September 2008. 
      
    45 PRICE J: I agree with James J.

   DECISION: 
   1. Leave to appeal against the sentences is granted.2. The appeal allowed in part. The sentences imposed on 5 May 2006 in respect of counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 are quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows:(a) In respect of count 1 on the indictment, sentence is calculated from a starting point of 22 years. After applying a discount of 45 per cent, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years and 1 month. There being no basis to depart from the accepted ratio of 60 – 66 per cent between the term of imprisonment and the non-parole period in Commonwealth matters, a non-parole period of 8 years is imposed. I direct that the sentence commence on 28 June 2004 with the non-parole period commencing on that date and expiring on 27 June 2012 the date upon which the applicant is eligible for release on parole.(b) In respect of count 4 on the indictment (objectively the most serious of the three State offences and reflecting a degree of criminality relative to the first Commonwealth offence), I consider that in light of all of the circumstances in which the applicant came to supply Yona with the drugs in his possession, his offending is in the mid range. After taking into account the applicant’s previous record (s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and the fact that his activity was part of an organised criminal enterprise (s 21A(2)(n)) as aggravating factors and his assistance to the authorities (s 21A(3)(m)), his plea of guilty (21(A)(3)(k)) his remorse (s 21A(3)(i)) and the fact that he is unlikely to re-offend (s 21A(3)(g)) as mitigating factors, there are sound reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 15 years. The applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 5 years. I am satisfied that the conditions of the applicant’s custody warrant a finding of special circumstances such as to justify a departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term as specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. (c) In respect of count 3 on the indictment, and for the reasons specified when imposing the sentence on count 4 above and in addition for his disclosure of his offending to police, I impose a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 20 months. I have taken into account the offence on the Form 1 in the calculation of this sentence.(d) In respect of count 5 on the indictment, again for the reasons specified above as justifying a departure from the standard non-parole period of 15 years, I impose a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 2 years.3. The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 June 2013.

    3 FULLERTON J: On 6 May 2005 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing the following counts: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Between 25 June and 28 June 2004, at Sydney, possession of a commercial quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as MDMA or ecstasy), which was reasonably suspected of having been imported: s 233B(1)(ca) of the  
        Customs Act 1901  
        (Cth). (The first Commonwealth count) 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: On or about 28 June 2004, at The Entrance, possession of a commercial quantity of ecstasy, which was reasonably suspected of having been imported: s 233B(1)(ca) of the  
        Customs Act  
        (Cth). (The second Commonwealth count) 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: On or about 21 June 2004, at The Entrance, supply of a commercial quantity of ecstasy: s 25(2) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        1985. (The first State count) 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: On or about 26 June 2004, at Sydney, supply of a commercial quantity of ecstasy: s 25(2) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        . (The second State count) 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: On or about 27 June 2004, at Sydney, supply of a commercial quantity of ecstasy: s 25(2) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
        (The third State count) 
        
       
      
    4 The quantity of ecstasy the subject of count 1 was 16.863 kilograms and the quantity the subject of count 2 was 2.745 kilograms. Under Schedule IV to the Customs Act (Cth) a prohibited import is specified by reference to its purity. A commercial quantity of ecstasy is specified to be 0.5 kilograms pure. Under Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the weight of a prohibited drug is specified by reference to its gross weight. In Schedule 1 to the Act a commercial quantity of ecstasy is stipulated as 0.125 kilograms. 
     
      
    5 The 16.863 kilograms of ecstasy the applicant had in his possession between 25 and 28 June 2004 as provided for in count 1 was supplied on two separate occasions within that time frame, namely on 26 and 27 June 2004 as provided for in counts 4 and 5. In respect of count 4, the gross weight of the ecstasy supplied was estimated to be 20.8 kilograms and in respect of count 5 it was estimated to be 6.7 kilograms. These drugs were seized by police as were other drugs in the applicant’s possession on 28 June 2004 as provided for in count 2 on the indictment.  
     
      
    6 The ecstasy supplied by the applicant on 21 June 2004, the subject of count 3 on the indictment, was estimated to be between 10.7 and 12 kilograms by reference to the number of tablets the applicant admitted having supplied on that occasion. These drugs were not recovered.7 The street value of the drugs seized was estimated to be $9.4 million.  
     
      
    8 The applicant also asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of having in his possession property, namely cash in the amount of $3124.00, which was reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained contrary to s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900. It attracts a maximum sentence of 6 months imprisonment. 9 The maximum penalty for each of the Commonwealth offences is life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $825,000 or both: s 235(2)(c)(i). The maximum penalty for each of the State offences is life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $555,000 or both: s 33(3)(a).  
     
      
    10 On 5 May 2006 (almost a year after the pleas were entered) her Honour imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: A sentence of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 28 June 2004 (the date that the applicant was first taken into custody). 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months also commencing on 28 June 2004. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: A fixed term of imprisonment of 12 years and 2 months commencing on 28 June 2004. Her Honour took the offence on the Form 1 into account when imposing this sentence.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: A sentence of imprisonment of 22 years and 4 months, comprising a non-parole period of 14 years and an additional term of 8 years and 4 months commencing on 28 June 2004. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: A fixed term of imprisonment of 13 years and 4 months commencing on 28 June 2004. 
        
       
      
    11 As the sentences were ordered to be served wholly concurrently, the overall effective sentence was a term of imprisonment of 22 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 14 years, being the sentence imposed for the supply of 20.8 kilograms of ecstasy as provided for in count 4. 
     
      
    12 The Crown conceded, correctly, that in imposing fixed sentences for counts 3 and 5 (the first and third State offences) her Honour failed to comply with s 44(1) and s 45(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and, in addition, that she failed altogether to approach the sentencing for each of the State offences in accordance with the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Act, as stipulated by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [117]-[124]. Notwithstanding these errors the Crown submitted that the non-parole period imposed in respect of count 4 was within range such that the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are invoked and the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    13 The applicant, who was unrepresented on the appeal, did not identify or address these specific errors in either his written or oral submissions. His appeal was advanced on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The incompetence of his legal representation resulted in relevant evidence being withheld from the sentencing judge. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) The sentencing judge erred in finding the applicant’s level of participation in the criminal enterprise and the quantities of drugs involved put his level of offending at the highest end of the scale. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The sentences in all of the circumstances were manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) The sentencing judge erred in giving undue weight to the applicant’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) The sentencing judge erred in failing to give the applicant an appropriate discount for his assistance. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (6) The sentencing judge erred in miscalculating the appropriate sentences to give affect to her findings. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (7) The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by nature of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and those imposed upon his co-offender.  
        
       
      
    Matters of evidence on sentence and fresh evidence on the appeal 
     
      
    14 The facts upon which her Honour passed sentence were drawn from an agreed statement of facts, the applicant’s records of interview dated 30 June 2004 and 10 August 2005, and various transcripts of intercepted telephone calls. The facts themselves were not in contest although the inferences to be drawn from those facts were the subject of argument.  
     
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing of the circumstances in which, as a foreign national, he became involved in the possession and distribution of large quantities of ecstasy. He also gave evidence of the extent of his involvement in that enterprise relative to the asserted involvements of others, including, importantly, a person by the name of Doran Yona. Although that person was identified by a pseudonym in proceedings brought by way of a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 2 November 2005, since he is no longer a prisoner in this country there appears to be no further need for his identity to be protected. The Crown appeal was pending at the time the applicant was sentenced in May 2006. In October 2006 the Crown appeal was upheld and Yona was re-sentenced (see R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; (2006) 167 A Crim R 436).  
     
      
    16 Despite the fact that this Court increased the sentence of his co-offender, the applicant maintained the submission that he has a legitimate sense of grievance because of what is now an asserted disparity between his sentence and the sentence imposed on Yona by this Court after the successful Crown appeal. He sought to develop that submission by relying upon intercepted telephone calls that were neither tendered in his sentence proceedings nor otherwise summarised in the agreed statement of facts and which he claimed reveal Yona to have been involved in the possession and supply of the ecstasy at a more senior level than the position he occupied. In the interests of justice the Crown consented to the Court receiving this material as fresh evidence.  
     
      
    17 In effect this disposes of the first ground of appeal. The Crown maintained the submission however that the fresh evidence did not support a finding that the sentencing judge misapplied the parity principle or that she erred in her assessment of the applicant’s level of involvement in the criminal enterprise. Moreover, in the event that the clear error in her Honour’s sentencing for the three State offences requires this Court to re-sentence the applicant, the Crown does not concede that the fresh evidence would warrant this Court coming to any different view from that of the sentencing judge as to the relative involvement of the applicant and Yona. It will be necessary to consider the fresh evidence in some detail when considering grounds 2 and 7. 18 A pre-sentence report and some medical reports were also tendered on sentence. Her Honour regarded the unacceptable delay in the sentence proceedings being brought to finality (albeit with some of the delay being the applicant’s responsibility), coupled with the conditions of his remand custody and the medical conditions from which he suffered as matters in mitigation. The Crown does not contend otherwise. Although her Honour expressly referred to each of these matters and, in particular, that the conditions of his remand bore directly on the assessment of the discount for assistance, it is submitted by the applicant that her Honour failed to give them the weight they deserved. 19 Statements of Federal Agent Heather concerning the applicant’s assistance to the authorities and an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to give evidence against others were also tendered. The applicant challenges her Honour’s assessment of the extent to which his assistance operated to reduce his sentence. 20 On the appeal the applicant sought to elaborate upon this ground by furnishing to the Court various documents, including correspondence between himself and various agencies concerned with law enforcement in Australia and overseas and a judgment from a court in Belgium. The Crown did not oppose the Court receiving the material subject to relevance. In the result, this necessitated the Australian Federal Police (AFP) undertaking further enquiries with a view to clarifying the applicant’s position with respect to assistance to the Dutch Authorities and, in the same connection, the Crown undertook to assist the Court by arranging for various foreign language documents to be translated. Assembling this material has been productive of delay. In the interim, the Court has received supplementary submissions from the Crown in respect of the foreign language documents and their relevance to the matters raised by the applicant on appeal. After the appeal was heard the Court has also received correspondence from the applicant both in response to the Crown submissions and, more generally, with a view, it would seem, to bring to the Court’s attention the correspondence into which he has entered with the AFP, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General’s Department and the Department of Justice in Belgium. To the extent that it is relevant to the disposition of the appeal I will refer to the correspondence later in this judgment. The Crown case on sentence21 It was the Crown case on sentence that despite the fact that the applicant was not charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of the ecstasy he admitted possessing as a prohibited import and supplying as a prohibited drug, he was, nevertheless, a person who came to Australia for the express purpose of extracting the drugs from a safe imported from Belgium for that purpose, and that when he eventually arranged for and took possession of the safe in Australia he did so with the knowledge or belief that it would contain the drugs that he had agreed he would remove and distribute. The Crown submitted that this was an inference that should be drawn from the objective facts and that the applicant’s account to the contrary in his records of interview and in his sworn evidence should be rejected.  
     
      
    22 Her Honour was not satisfied that the Crown had discharged the burden of proving that the applicant’s knowledge of the drug enterprise preceded his arrival in Australia. Were her Honour to have accepted the Crown’s submission, she acknowledged that it would have aggravated the gravity of the offending otherwise revealed by the applicant’s admitted role in an enterprise in which wholesale quantities of imported drugs were supplied.  
     
      
    23 Her Honour accepted as truthful the applicant’s account to police (as attested to by him in evidence) that six weeks before his arrival in Australia a person named Koen, with whom he was acquainted in Belgium, offered him $20,000 to install a safe at the premises of one of Koen’s business associates in Australia trading under the name “Diana Jewellery Fashion Company”. He said he entered into a written contract to provide this service at the nominated fee and travelled to Australia for that purpose. He also said he took the opportunity to have a holiday in this country with his girlfriend and his brother. He said (and her Honour accepted) that he did not know of the existence of the drugs until it was disclosed to him by Koen after he had taken possession of the safe and after he had delivered it to an address in the Sydney CBD. It was the applicant’s case (also apparently accepted by her Honour) that although he collected the safe in a truck from the storage unit, he did not remove the secreted drugs from the safe and that he only became aware of the quantity of drugs involved when the truck was returned to him containing the opened safe and two sports bags in which drugs had been packed. It was at this time that he claimed he received a phone call from Koen in Belgium with instructions to deliver the drugs the following day for a fee in the amount of 150,000 euros. Her Honour also found that although he initially refused, he ultimately agreed to do what was asked of him, albeit under duress. That said, her Honour also found that after that time and continuing over a period of weeks he made the conscious choice to participate in the supply of substantial quantities of ecstasy for financial reward.  
     
      
    24 Her Honour also resolved other factual disputes bearing upon the question of the applicant’s role in his favour. For this reason, in the summary of the facts that follows, I have incorporated her Honour’s findings as to what the facts reveal about the applicant’s role so as to make patent the basis upon which she proceeded to sentence and to allow a fresh appraisal of the relative roles of the applicant and his co-offender in light of the fresh evidence.  
     
      
    The facts upon which sentence was passed 
     
      
    25 On 18 February 2004, a safe arrived at Sydney aboard P&O Nedloyd Palliser. Belgium was the country of dispatch. Secreted within the safe was a large quantity of ecstasy tablets. Upon being offloaded from the vessel the safe remained in storage at ABX Logistics at Botany.26 The bill of lading was addressed to Tom Kiebach, Diana Jewellery, 7 Palmer Lane, Darlinghurst. On 7 January 2004, a man using that name arrived in Sydney from overseas and took up residence at 7 Palmer Lane, Darlinghurst. The words “Diana Jewellery” were affixed to the top of the letterbox associated with that address.  
     
      
    27 On 23 March 2004, a person using the same name leased a unit at Storage King, Eastgardens. The safe was transported from ABX Logistics to the storage unit at Eastgardens where it remained until 9 June 2004 when it was collected by the applicant.  
     
      
    28 On 1 April 2004, a person using the name Tom Kiebach departed Australia on flight AQ222 to Singapore. There is no record of any person by that name returning to Australia. 
     
      
    29 Over six weeks later, on 29 May 2004, the applicant’s brother and the applicant’s girlfriend arrived in Sydney from Hong Kong. They booked into the Mercure Hotel in George Street, Sydney. The following day the applicant arrived in Australia from Hong Kong. He joined his brother and girlfriend at the hotel. Her Honour rejected the Crown submission that the applicant’s brother and girlfriend were complicit with the applicant and that they also travelled to Australia for the express purpose of obtaining access to the imported drugs. She accepted that the applicant’s arrival was delayed because of problems with his visa. She went on to observe that his brother and girlfriend both left Australia on 16 June 2004, the dates specified on their airline tickets as the date of their intended departure, and that this was after the applicant became aware of the drugs and of the role he was expected to play in their distribution. To the extent that his girlfriend came to learn of the applicant’s involvement with the ecstasy (as it appears she must have from the content of some of the intercepted telephone calls), her Honour did not regard this as impacting adversely on her assessment of the role that the applicant claimed he was forced to assume upon learning of the drug importation. 
     
      
    30 On 2 June 2004, the applicant obtained a mobile telephone in the name of Tim Mouton of 1 George Street, Sydney. The service was the subject of interception under warrant from 24 June 2004 when Yona, who had earlier come to police notice as a suspect in a money laundering syndicate upon his arrival in Australia, made contact with him. Her Honour appeared to accept that the applicant used his girlfriend’s surname rather than his own to acquire the telephone because he was suspicious that the safe may contain contraband. She also accepted that he acted on his suspicions by seeking the advice of a Sydney solicitor. While her Honour made no reference to the nature of the legal advice he received, the applicant gave evidence that the solicitor suggested that he open the safe in the presence of a witness. He claimed to have followed this advice and that he opened the safe in the presence of an employee at the Storage facility. As the safe was empty he claimed his suspicions were allayed.31 On 3 June 2004, a person using the name Tom Kiebach contacted Storage King at Eastgardens by facsimile and advised that his partner, Tim Kauwenberghs, would be attending to access the storage unit and to pay outstanding storage fees of $840. It is unclear whether the person who sent the facsimile was the person who had contracted with the storage facility or some other person. Nothing turns upon this on the appeal since her Honour proceeded to sentence on the basis that the applicant was not aware of the fact that the safe contained drugs until after he collected the safe at least a week later. Her Honour accepted that over the next week or so the applicant and his girlfriend and brother went sightseeing. 
     
      
    32 Evidence independent of the applicant established that on 9 June 2004 he rented a Toyota HiAce van and later that same day collected the safe from the storage facility. In the account he gave to police and in evidence he said he then drove to Pitt Street Sydney to meet with a person he knew as Tom Kiebach who was awaiting delivery of the safe. (I note that a person travelling on a passport in that name left Australia on 1 April 2004 after securing the safe in the storage facility).  
     
      
    33 After delivering the safe the applicant claimed he received a call from Kiebach informing him that the safe was defective and that he was to collect it and take it to an address affixed to the safe. However, after collecting the safe and whilst en route to the nominated address, he claimed he received a call from Koen in Belgium giving him different delivery instructions. He then claimed that as he was heading towards Blacktown Koen told him that “pills” had been removed from the safe and that they were in bags in the rear of the truck that he was driving. He was asked to hand 200,000 pills on to someone the following day for which he would be paid 150,000 euros. He said he reacted angrily to having been duped by Koen into becoming involved in a drug enterprise and gave an account (also accepted by her Honour) that after pulling over to confirm that there were in fact two sports bags in the rear of the truck, he decided to throw both bags into the bushland. He said that each of the bags weighed, in his estimation, 50 kilograms each. He also said that he was involved in a car accident in the area at about this time. The applicant gave evidence that it was only after he was repeatedly threatened by Koen that injury would be done to his family if he did not cooperate that he decided to retrieve one of the bags and to deal with it on Koen’s instructions. 
     
      
    34 It would seem that his explanation for leaving one bag in the bush was to reduce the quantity of drugs in his physical possession thereby reducing the risk of exposure. Her Honour rejected the Crown’s submission that the applicant stored the second bag of drugs, in effect as a secret source from which he could supply the drugs for his own financial gain, and accepted the applicant’s evidence that he went to great lengths (as corroborated by independent evidence) to try to recover the bag of drugs on 21 or 22 June 2004 only to discover that the bag was not where he had left it. 35 Her Honour accepted the applicant’s account as to how he came into possession of the drugs as truthful despite the fact that independent evidence established that it was on 10 June 2004 (the day after the safe was collected, also established by independent evidence) that the applicant hired a quick-cut saw, fuel and cutting disc from Matraville (on the applicant’s evidence hired by him to enable him to install the safe) and that it was between 11:45am and 12:25pm again on 10 June 2004, that cell sites for the mobile phone used by the applicant were traced to an area proximate to Lapstone, and that at 3:25pm on that day the applicant had an accident whilst driving the HiAce van on Governor’s Drive in Lapstone.  
     
      
    36 Three days later, on 12 June 2004, the applicant and his girlfriend rented a property at 17A Hargraves Street, The Entrance North in the name of Koen Van Pratt of 48 Arrolsenstraat, Leper, Belgium 8700 from a local real estate agency. One week’s rent was paid in advance. The applicant’s account was that since he received no instructions from Koen to deliver the drugs in the days following 9 June 2004 he decided to leave Sydney and store the drugs that he had in his possession at a more remote location. He said that he first put the drugs in the laundry of the rented premises but later buried them in nearby sand dunes. 
     
      
    37 In the early afternoon of 14 June 2004, the applicant attended the Hillsdale branch of National Hire and returned the quick-cut saw, cutting disc and fuel he had rented on 10 June 2004. The equipment appeared unused. 
     
      
    38 On 16 June 2004, the offender returned the rented HiAce van. The same day the applicant’s girlfriend departed Australia. His brother left Australia on 10 June 2004. Although Koen told the applicant the drugs were to be supplied the day after he learnt they were in his possession (9 June 2004 on the applicant’s evidence) by 16 June he had not supplied any of the drugs. Despite this the applicant elected to remain in Australia. On 17 June 2004, the applicant extended his stay in the rented unit for another week. 
     
      
    39 On 21 June 2004, the applicant supplied a man named “Dave” at The Entrance with between 80,000 and 90,000 ecstasy tablets from his storage place in the sand dunes (this offending is charged in Count 3 on the indictment). It is not clear how this supply was arranged although it would appear from the telephone intercepts after that date to have been at Koen’s direction. Suffice to say that the applicant informed police about it and supplied details concerning it on his arrest. Her Honour accepted that these were the first drugs he supplied after he came into possession of the two bags of ecstasy on 9 June 2004. 
     
      
    40 On 22 June 2004, Doran Yona arrived in Sydney from Israel. As I noted earlier, it would appear that at this time the police were not only unaware of the applicant’s illegal activities, they were equally unaware of any connection between Yona and the applicant or Yona’s connection with the supply of drugs. After his arrival Yona became the target of a money laundering investigation because of his association with a foreign exchange business in Kings Cross that had been under investigation for some time. 41 On 24 June 2004, Yona hired a Holden Commodore, registration number 8CA382, for three days. The same day the police commenced interception of the mobile telephone service used by the applicant.  
     
      
    42 At 10:50am on 24 June 2004, the offender received a telephone call from Koen. He advised the applicant, inter alia, that he should expect a call from a man in about an hour and a half, that he would be given the keys to a car and that he was to deliver 230,000 ecstasy tablets by placing them into the car. At 1:47pm the applicant received a call from Yona advising him that he was at Bondi Beach and would be standing next to a car with registration number 8CA. The applicant apparently took some time in making his way to the meeting prompting Koen to enquire why the applicant was taking so long. After the applicant collected the key from Yona (and apparently without telling him his intentions) he drove away in the Commodore and did not return until 26 June 2004 when he supplied the drugs the subject of Count 4 on the indictment. Although the statement of facts refers to phone calls between Yona and a person in Romania and various other people concerning the delay in his obtaining possession of drugs from the applicant, the summary does not detail Yona’s reaction to the situation. The fully transcribed telephone calls tendered as fresh evidence make it clear beyond any doubt that Yona and the Romanian, in particular, were infuriated and prepared to exact retribution in the event that the applicant failed to deliver the drugs. I will return to consider the significance of the fresh evidence later in this judgment. 
     
      
    43 After the applicant met with Yona on 24 June 2004, he drove the Commodore back to The Entrance. At 9:47pm that evening the applicant’s girlfriend telephoned and they discussed Yona, the ecstasy tablets, the value of the tablets and the applicant’s attempts to make arrangements to leave Australia via New Zealand. 
     
      
    44 On 26 June 2004, the applicant had a detailed conversation with an unidentified male about the ecstasy tablets where various quantities and prices were discussed using what appears to be a local mobile phone number. The applicant also revealed to that person that the tablets were buried in sand dunes. This is a most damaging phone call since it also indicates an apparent preparedness on the applicant’s part to take a position contrary to Koen’s instructions, and to enter into unilateral arrangements to supply the drugs on his own contractual conditions. On the other hand, the phone calls both before this call and after it reveal that the applicant was not only highly agitated and upset but that his mood was mercurial. 
     
      
    45 There were further intercepted telephone calls between the applicant, Yona and Koen in the course of that day in which it was ultimately agreed that the applicant would leave the Commodore containing what amounted to 16.863 kilograms of ecstasy in the hotel car park at Bondi for Yona to collect. The supply of the ecstasy by these means was the subject of count 4 in the indictment. 
     
      
    46 The following day Koen rang the applicant and asked him to supply a further 100,000 ecstasy tablets to Yona. The applicant said that if the purchasers required more they would have to come and get them as “he had done enough”. However, later that day the applicant left The Entrance to make his way to Bondi with the drugs in a hired car. He was later seen to enter the Swiss Grand Hotel at Bondi carrying a number of bags. It was the Crown case that the bags contained 6.7 kilograms of ecstasy tablets, the subject of count 5 on the indictment. The applicant was arrested at Sydney International Airport.47 A search warrant was executed at the premises occupied by the applicant at The Entrance where a piece of paper with names and amounts was located, a suitcase containing a scanner and binoculars and a safe in which the remnants of 14 ecstasy tablets were found in a constructed cavity inside the rear panel.48 On 28 June 2004 a search warrant was executed on the Commodore parked at the Swiss Grand Hotel. In the boot of the vehicle were a sports bag containing 24 large plastic bags and two smaller white plastic bags containing a large quantity of ecstasy tablets. There was a quantity of sand located on the base of the interior of the sports bag. The total weight of the drug seized was 27.5 kilograms. These are the tablets the applicant supplied Yona on 26 and 27 June 2004, the subject of counts 4 and 5. Later that night Yona was arrested.  
     
      
    49 In summary, the ecstasy tablets supplied by the applicant to Yona on 26 and 27 June 2004 (as provided for in counts 4 and 5 on the indictment) were in his possession at various times between 25 and 28 June 2004 both at The Entrance and in Sydney (as comprehended by Count 1 on the indictment). They were part of the original consignment taken into his physical custody on 9 June 2004 in the circumstances as her Honour found them. The balance of the consignment was retrieved by police from the sand dunes after the applicant’s arrest and were the subject of count 2 on the indictment.50 Apart from the applicant’s assistance to the authorities and the conditions of his custody, the sentencing judge made the following findings about the applicant’s subjective circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The applicant was 29 years of age at the time of sentence having been in a relationship of some years standing with his girlfriend. He was a qualified paver operating his own business before leaving Belgium although he was at that time experiencing financial difficulties as a result of a cash flow crisis. He was apparently also in the process of renovating a house. In combination these pressures motivated him to accept the invitation to become involved in the possession and distribution of ecstasy for reward. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) The applicant’s time in custody will be onerous because of the absence of family and friends in Australia. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) The applicant had criminal antecedents, including for intentional battery and wounding, robbery with violence, fraudulent destruction of goods and possession of psychotropic substances. It appears he was serving a suspended sentence at the time he arrived in Australia. Accordingly, her Honour found that the applicant’s record did not entitle him to a great deal of leniency. This finding was open to her. I am not satisfied that she has given it undue weight in the calculation of sentence and accordingly do not regard ground 4 on the appeal as made out.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (d) The applicant was genuinely remorseful and contrite and the prospects of him re-offending were minimal. 
        
       
      
    51 On the appeal the applicant directed his primary submissions to grounds 2, 5 and 7, namely the characterisation of his role, the issue of parity and the appropriate discount for his assistance to the authorities. Since the question whether the sentences were manifestly excessive can only sensibly be considered after reviewing the evidence as to his role in the enterprise, I propose to deal with ground 2 of the appeal first. 
     
      
    Ground 2: the learned sentencing judge erred in finding the applicant’s level of participation in the criminal enterprise and the quantities of drugs involved put his level of offending at the highest end of the scale52 As I have noted, notwithstanding the fact that her Honour accepted that the applicant acted under duress when he initially agreed with Koen to supply 200,000 of the ecstasy tablets, she was satisfied that over succeeding weeks his role changed to that of an active participant in the supply of drugs for reward. She also concluded that his attitude changed from being a person taking a passive role in compliance with those who had duped him into a proactive role, and that this was evidenced by the fact that he unilaterally determined when and how much of the drug he would supply. She also found he attempted to negotiate a much higher financial reward for himself both from Yona as the person to whom he supplied drugs on 26 and 27 June 2004 and Koen as the person on whose instructions he acted. She described the applicant’s role in this context as that of a warehouseman and first-line distributor of the drug rather than a courier or mule. In short, her Honour regarded the offending constituted by the commercial supply counts in counts 4 and 5 on the indictment as at the highest end of the scale of criminality.  
     
      
    53 In oral submissions the applicant conceded that while he welcomed the prospect of the financial reward that Koen offered him given his strained financial circumstances, he did not engage in brinkmanship to secure it and that her Honour was in error in interpreting his conduct in that way. He conceded that while the evidence tendered at the sentence hearing showed that he was not a totally unwilling supplier of drugs (in particular in regard to supply of 10.7-12 kilos to the man at The Entrance on 21 June 2004) he maintained he received no reward for doing so. In addition, he submitted that at no time in his dealings with Yona, dealings which culminated in the supply of large quantities of ecstasy tablets on 26 and 27 June 2004, did he demand money before he supplied the drugs and that he only agreed to supply drugs to him at all because of a fear of reprisals and in order to secure his safe passage out of Australia. He submitted that to the extent that he took unilateral action in deciding when, where and how much of the drug would be supplied this was in order that the risk of being caught would be minimised in circumstances where he was the one who had been put in the compromising position of being in possession of the drugs having accepted the job of delivering them. He submitted that her Honour misconstrued his role and that the fully extracted telephone intercepts demonstrate that he was a reluctant warehouseman and first line distributor and that at all times he was acting for and on behalf of others whilst at the same time being manipulated by them. In addition, he asks rhetorically, why if he was seeking to hold Yona and others to ransom would he leave the county after supplying the drugs without being paid the money he had been promised when he had the option of leaving the drugs buried in the ground until he had been paid. 
     
      
    54 In addition the applicant sought to demonstrate, again by reference to the fully extracted calls, that he was subordinate to the role Yona performed in the distribution of the drugs. 
     
      
    55 The Crown submitted that the characterisation of the role the applicant assumed upon taking the drugs into his possession was open to her Honour and that the fresh evidence did not serve in any way to undermine her findings or to cast the applicant’s role or attitude in any different light.  
     
      
    56 In my view, after comparing the summary of the intercepted calls in the agreed facts with the fully transcribed calls tendered as fresh evidence, there is some substance in the applicant’s submission. However when read in their entirety, I am not of the view that the calls go so far as to compel the conclusion contended for by the applicant. In particular, I find that while his actions were dictated by the contingencies that presented from time to time in the process of delivering the drugs to Yona, he nevertheless performed an active, informed and consultative role.  
     
      
    The fresh evidence 
     
      
    57 After the applicant was told by Koen to supply Yona with 230,000 tablets on 24 June 2004, he made his way from The Entrance to Bondi to meet with Yona but did not take any drugs with him. From what Yona reported by telephone to others it would appear that the applicant was extremely agitated and concerned about the speed and reliability of the rented car he was driving and the distance he had to travel carrying the drugs as distinct from positioning himself to broker a better financial arrangement. After collecting the Commodore from Yona and over the course of a number of conversations with Koen the applicant also complained to Koen about having to travel a considerable distance with drugs in his possession to supply people that he described as not “Koen’s people”. This would tend to suggest that the applicant had at least an appreciation of who Koen’s people were and that the person he supplied with 10.7-12 kg on 21 June 2004 was in that category whilst Yona was not. The applicant proposed that Koen ask Yona to drive to collect the drugs.  
     
      
    58 While it is clear that the applicant was at this time eager to leave Australia, it is also clear that he was concerned that if further drugs were “lost” in transit he would be held responsible. It also appears from the calls with Koen at this time that the applicant has had ongoing communication with the person “Dave” he supplied on 21 June 2004 and that he was in receipt of advice generally from that person as to the likelihood of police surveillance. It is also clear that although he had no prior knowledge of Yona as one of Koen’s new buyers he accepted, without question, his role in supplying Koen with drugs. Koen, on the other hand, appeared to be humouring the applicant (no doubt in an effort to secure his ongoing cooperation) while at the same time colluding with Yona, and those with whom he was in contact, in order to placate the applicant.  
     
      
    59 It is also patent from the calls that Yona was the source of threats which he asked others to communicate to Koen and in turn to the applicant. There is no evidence however that these threats were ever communicated by Koen to the applicant (for again what might be obvious and expedient reasons). They do however reveal Yona as occupying a more integrated, concerned and ultimately directorial role in his desire for the drugs to be supplied to him.  
     
      
    60 It would also appear that in the course of his dealings with the applicant Yona was intentionally downplaying the extent of his own knowledge of the trade in drugs in order to keep the applicant in the dark as to the true extent of his involvement and also so as to encourage the applicant to view him as a person who was also simply acting at the direction of others. That is not to say however that the calls reveal the applicant as reluctant or resistant to the role he had agreed to perform. Importantly, in none of the calls with Koen or Yona does the applicant appear to show any reluctance to supplying the vast quantities of ecstasy with which he is charged even if he was temperamentally ill-fitted to the task.  
     
      
    61 In the result, while I do not regard the role that he performed as in the most serious category of offending, I do accept he was at least on an equal footing with Yona in their possession of commercial quantities of ecstasy (albeit at different times) and that Yona was intimately connected with those who were to receive the drugs the applicant supplied to him, no doubt for the ultimate supply to end users. 
     
      
    62 I will have something more to say about Yona’s role when coming to consider the question of parity. At this stage, however, I am satisfied that the applicant was not a reluctant distributor of the drugs but was manipulated by others to secure their objectives. By contrast, I am not satisfied that the evidence discloses that the applicant sought to exploit his control over the drugs to his own financial end otherwise than in an increasingly desperate effort to be paid the money he was promised by way of an advance from Yona to enable him to leave Australia. 
     
      
    63 Having regard to my reappraisal of the role the applicant performed by reference to the fresh evidence, the question that presents on the appeal is whether the sentences imposed upon him were excessive. The application of the parity principle will also need to be considered in light of my reappointment of the respective roles of the applicant and Yona. I propose to deal firstly with the question whether the sentences were excessive in conjunction with the challenge to her Honour’s calculation of sentence as expressed in ground 6. 
     
      
    Ground 3: the sentences in all the circumstances were manifestly excessiveGround 6: the sentencing judge erred in miscalculating the appropriate sentence to give effect to her findings64 Having regard to the way in which her Honour structured the sentences, the effective overall sentence of 22 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 14 years was largely the result of the sentence imposed in relation to count 4. While the applicant directed most of his arguments to the sentence imposed in respect of that count, and then principally on the basis of alleged disparity with the sentence imposed on Yona, he did not limit his challenge to the sentence imposed on that count. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the challenge he makes to the severity of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 2 (the Commonwealth counts of possession) is made out.65 Count 1 attracted a head sentence of 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years. This count concerned the 16.863 kilograms of pure ecstasy in the applicant’s possession between 25 and 28 June 2004 which comprised the drugs supplied to Yona on 26 and 27 June 2004. It cannot be overlooked, of course, that the 16.863 kilograms was only part of the contents of the bag over which her Honour accepted the applicant had possession and control from 9 June 2004 given that 10.7-12 kilograms (impure) of ecstasy was supplied four days earlier. Moreover this combined quantity represented only half of the total consignment of ecstasy the applicant found himself in possession of when the truck and opened safe were returned to him on 9 June 2004. That said, the applicant did not present for sentence on count 1 other than in respect of the amount of pure ecstasy he possessed between the nominated dates. 
     
      
    66 Her Honour arrived at the head sentence of 16 years by taking as a starting point a head sentence of 25 years and applying discounts of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty and a further 15 per cent for assistance. Leaving aside the adequacy of the combined discount of 40 per cent, the question that presents is whether a starting point of 25 years was within range having regard to the circumstances in which the applicant came into possession of the drugs and the role he assumed once in possession of them.67 The sentence imposed in respect of the second count was a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, imposed on the express basis that the sentence was to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the first count. Her Honour arrived at the fixed term by taking as a starting point a head sentence of 4 years and applying to it a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty and a discount of 15 per cent for assistance (the same discounts as applied in relation to count 1). The amount possessed in respect of count 2, namely 2.745 kilograms of pure ecstasy, was the residue of the contents of one bag of ecstasy after the supply of commercial quantities on three separate occasions between 21 and 28 June 2004 in the particular circumstances outlined. Although a greater discount than 25 per cent for the plea of guilty might have been appropriate given that the residue was nominated to police by the applicant (see R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603) a concurrent and fixed term of 2 years and 6 months from a notional starting point of 4 years against the statutory maximum of life imprisonment was not in my view excessive. That conclusion is also subject to the conclusion I have reached in respect of the adequacy of the discount for assistance in the particular circumstances of this case to which I will later refer.68 In R v To [2007] NSWCCA 200; 172 A Crim R 121 at [19] (Hulme J) and [94] (Hall J) cited with approval what was said in R v Peel (1971) 1 NSWLR 247 at 262, namely that:  
     
      
       
        
        “[in] determining the proper penalty … the fundamental consideration is rather the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the Act in questions, the [offender’s] conduct would offend against the legislative object of suppressing the illicit traffic in the prohibited drug.”  
        
       
      
    69 The weight of a narcotic that is possessed under the Customs Act (Cth) is given statutory significance for sentencing purposes by the distinction between the maximum sentence that may be imposed for offences involving trafficable and commercial quantities under s 235. Whilst the weight of the narcotic may not necessarily be the most significant factor to be taken into account in sentencing under the Customs Act (Cth) (Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 609), it is nevertheless a relevant consideration. The amount of ecstasy in the applicant’s possession between 25 and 28 June 2004, namely 16.863 kilograms pure, was over 30 times the amount specified in the Customs Act (Cth) as a commercial quantity. While it must be accepted that the quantity of the drug was considerable, the bearing it has on an assessment of the objective criminality must be considered in the context of the circumstances in which the applicant came to be in possession, in particular, that he only came to learn of the very large quantity of the ecstasy he was being invited to take control over and deliver many months after it was imported, although at all times thereafter he was fixed with that knowledge. 
     
      
    70 Whilst no two cases are identical, sentencing patterns where large-scale importations of narcotics are involved are frequently referred to as a guide to an appropriate sentence both at first instance and on appeal. A consideration of sentencing patterns for offences involving the possession of large quantities of ecstasy in generally comparable cases reveals, in my view, that the starting point adopted by her Honour in the sentence imposed on count 1 was excessive. 
     
      
    71 In R v To (supra), Hulme and Hall JJ reviewed a range of recent sentences for offences involving both the importation and possession of comparable quantities of ecstasy. Again, acknowledging differences between the facts and circumstances in the cases reviewed by their Honours and this case, in my view, they demonstrate that her Honour’s starting point of 25 years for count 1 was too high.72 A number of cases to which their Honours referred in R v To arose out of the importation in 2001 of some 480,000 ecstasy tablets with a pure weight of 34.4 kilograms. The tablets were concealed in the components of an industrial freezer which was discovered by customs authorities in Brisbane and which resulted in the substitution of a benign substance in order to facilitate a controlled delivery of the drugs under the investigative command of the Australian Federal Police. The freezer was delivered in Brisbane after which it was unpacked and trucked to Sydney where the freezer was opened and the tablets removed. The two principal participants were Shepherd and El-Hani. Both appealed to this Court against sentences imposed in District Court proceedings. 
     
      
    73 On Shepherd’s appeal (R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287; 142 A Crim R 101 at [13]) Howie J found that Shepherd’s criminality arose from the fact that he was prepared to play a significant role in the importation of what he must have known to be a very substantial quantity of drugs. His Honour found that he was an active participant over a period of months by attending meetings with various participants in Australia and overseas and by taking steps to facilitate the clearance of the container through the shipping company and by direct dealings with customs. He also permitted premises he had leased to be used to receive the container and to store some of its contents. Shepherd was present when the container was delivered and assisted in the removal of some of the freezer parts after which he loaded them onto a truck to commence their transit from Brisbane to Sydney and thereafter for their distribution. Shepherd agreed to assist with the importation in return for a $25,000 fee at the instigation of another participant, namely, Prasad, a business friend and associate. On analysis the court reasoned that the starting point for the calculation of sentence must have been a term of 32 years which was regarded at the very top of the range but was not, in the court’s view, excessive. For reasons which are not presently relevant the court intervened to reduce the sentence. 74 On El-Hani’s appeal (R v El-Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162) he was described as a senior person in the organisation who played an important managerial role. His involvement preceded the importation by his attendance at meetings with various participants. He also responded to the concerns of other participants once it was obvious that the drugs had been interfered with. The judge at first instance fixed a starting point of 30 years which did not attract criticism on the appeal. El-Hani’s appeal was dismissed. 75 Shepherd was introduced to the venture by Prasad, a participant who in the view of Wood CJ at CL, performed an active and important role in relation to the importation (see R v Prasad [2004] NSWCCA 293; 147 A Crim R 385 at [28]). On the Crown appeal against sentence his Honour was of the view that by assuming the task of ensuring the clearance of the drugs and engaging Shepherd to attend to the documentary and other tasks involved, Prasad was able to insulate the Australian principals, namely Choi, and Steven, Louis and Joseph Sukkar from direct contact with the consignment. Prasad also became an important conduit for the collection of documents. The Court considered he was not as involved as Shepherd and had a more compelling subjective case. Nevertheless, the Crown appeal against sentence was allowed and implicit in the approach of the Court on re-sentence a proper starting point should have been in the order of 25 years. 76 Of the three Sukkar brothers, Steven Sukkar had no involvement in the importation until after the drugs had been delivered to premises in Sydney which were owned by him but occupied by his brother. His knowing involvement commenced on the day of delivery after which he helped unload the truck in which the freezer parts were contained, permitted those parts and tablets to remain on his premises, and helped sort through the tablets to separate those containing drugs from those that did not. He then undertook the task of ascertaining what had happened to the freezer parts after their arrival in Australia, with a view to identifying when the substitution may have taken place so as to either recover the drugs or exact compensation for their loss in the event that responsibility could be traced to another participant. His role was described as being a knowing assistant to his brothers and his motivation as fraternal. Both the offender and the Crown appealed against the sentence imposed. By majority the appeals were dismissed. Reference to the remarks on sentence at first instance make it clear that the starting point for the calculation of sentences was 21 years. 77 Lewis and Joseph Sukkar were regarded as joint principals. The sentencing judge’s starting point for the calculation of Lewis Sukkar’s sentence was 36 years and for Joseph Sukkar 45 years.  
     
      
    78 The Court was also referred to a unrelated case of R v Moore [2005] NSWCCA 212 where the offender pleaded guilty to being in possession of 92.4 kilograms of pure ecstasy contrary to the Customs Act (Cth). The offender was involved in discussions prior to the importation and over a period of months communicated with others concerning the then anticipated importation of the tablets. Of those people, one was located in the Netherlands while the other two were in Australia, each being jointly responsible for procuring the supply of the ecstasy tablets from the importers. The tablets ultimately came into Moore’s possession. He leased premises in anticipation of delivery of the tablets, took delivery of them and then transported them to the leased premises where they remained in a van. He was arrested that day. The Court did not disagree with the sentencing judge’s characterisation of his role as reflecting very great criminality. The starting point for the calculation of sentence was 26 years and 8 months. After allowing a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, the Court was of the view that a head sentence of 20 years was well within the sentencing judge’s discretion, it being an offence approaching the worst category of an offence of its nature given the quantity of drug destined for distribution into the wider community.79 In R v To (supra) itself, the Court allowed a Crown appeal against a sentence of 17 years imprisonment (with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months) in respect of To’s conviction for aiding and abetting the importation of 34.8 kilograms of ecstasy. The sentencing judge found that the offender had a managerial role in the importation and should be sentenced as a principal. Having reviewed the sentencing patterns as discussed above, the Court re-sentenced the offender and imposed a sentence of 25 years imprisonment, which included a discount for facilitating the course of justice by making admissions at his trial. The majority imposed a non-parole period of 15 years.80 Having regard to the findings made by the sentencing judge in relation to the circumstances in which the applicant came into possession of the drugs, coupled with the fact that he stored them for the purpose of supply for some weeks, and after giving due weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances, in my view, the sentence imposed in respect of the first count in the indictment was excessive. In my opinion, a more appropriate starting point for the calculation of sentence on the first count is 22 years. State offences81 Her Honour arrived at the sentences in respect of the three State offences of supply as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) In relation to count 3, the first State offence, involving the supply of 10.7-12 kilograms of ecstasy to the person “Dave” at The Entrance on 21 June 2004, her Honour indicated that if the matter had gone to trial she would have imposed a head sentence of 25 years imprisonment. She found that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty and 35 per cent for his disclosure of the offence to the authorities. She then imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 years and 2 months. 
         
         
        (b) In relation to count 4, the second State offence, involving the supply of 20.8 kilograms of ecstasy to Yona on 26 June 2004, her Honour indicated that if the matter had proceeded to trial, she would have imposed a head sentence of 35 years imprisonment. She found that the applicant was entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty and assistance of 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. She imposed a term of imprisonment of 22 years and 4 months comprising a non-parole period of 14 years and an additional term of 8 years and 4 months. 
         
         
        (c) In relation to count 5, the third State offence, involving the further supply of 6.7 kilograms of ecstasy to Yona on 27 June 2004, her Honour indicated that if the matter had proceeded to trial, she would have imposed a head sentence of 21 years imprisonment. She found that the applicant was entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty and assistance of 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. She imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 13 years and 4 months. 
        
       
      
    82 Her Honour noted that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act governed the sentences to be imposed in relation to counts 3, 4 and 5. Her Honour also noted, correctly, that s 54A of that Act specified a standard non-parole period of 15 years for offences under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act in the middle of the range of objective seriousness following conviction after trial. That said, it is difficult to reconcile the approach taken by the sentencing judge with the relevant provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and in particular the approach to be taken in applying Division 1A of Part 4 as determined in R v Way (supra) at [117]-[124]; see also R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135.83 It would appear that in accordance with s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act she found that the reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period was both because of the plea of guilty and because she was satisfied that the offending constituted by the supply counts was at the highest end of the scale of like offences. I have already expressed the view that her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness failed to reflect those findings favourable to the applicant, in particular, that he was duped into participating in the drug distribution syndicate, that he was subject to duress at an early stage and in this sense his offending was opportunistic. In addition, again as I have noted, I am not satisfied that her Honour’s finding that the applicant brokered a position to suit his own financial ends is supported by the evidence. For these reasons, quite apart from her Honour’s failure to approach sentence as mandated by R v Way, I am unable to agree that the offending was as her Honour described it. Subject only to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act the effect of these errors require this Court to re-sentence. However, since I am also of the view that her Honour has failed to properly assess the discount for the applicant’s assistance to the authorities in the calculation of sentence another sentence is warranted at law and re-sentencing is the inevitable outcome of this appeal. 
     
      
    Ground 5: the sentencing judge erred in failing to give the applicant an appropriate discount for his assistance to the authorities84 The evidence before the sentencing judge in relation to the assistance comprised a letter of assistance signed by the Federal Police case officer which revealed, amongst other things, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the Federal Police had doubts about the veracity of some information provided by the applicant and had identified inconsistencies in the applicant’s version of events in his witness statement,  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the statement the applicant had provided in relation to the case against Yona did not play an important role in the brief,  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) the applicant had provided a statement to the Netherlands National Police Agency which would be utilised in prosecutions as would his record of interview, and  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (d) the applicant had been interviewed by Belgian Federal Police but had ultimately declined to answer further questions. 
        
       
      
    85 The information provided by the applicant in relation to the person to whom he supplied ecstasy in The Entrance on 21 June 2004 had not led to any arrests. 
     
      
    86 In respect of (a) above, these concerns must be taken to have been effectively disregarded by her Honour since she resolved such inconsistencies as there were in the applicant’s favour, in the sense that they did not serve to undermine the reliability of his account of how he came to be in Australia and involved in criminal activity. Moreover she considered that his account was generally reliable and, since it fully detailed his criminal activities from 9 June 2004 to 24 June 2004, where for some of that time at least his activities were unknown to police, it must have saved considerable police time. 
     
      
    87 As to (b) above, her Honour noted the applicant executed an undertaking to cooperate by giving evidence pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in the trial of Yona although, as events transpired, Yona pleaded guilty and the applicant was not required to give evidence against him or his co-offender despite the fact that on 16 February 2006 he received a subpoena from the DPP to give evidence at their trial. Her Honour was nevertheless satisfied that the statement the applicant provided for inclusion in the Yona brief of evidence complemented other evidence and that it was served before Yona entered pleas of guilty on 21 September 2005.  
     
      
    88 In addition, her Honour found that threats had been made against the applicant’s life as a result of his willingness to give evidence against Yona and that this had resulted in his being incarcerated for over 18 months of the almost two years spent on remand in protective custody in conditions that her Honour described as inhumane. In this connection her Honour was doubtless referring to the transcript of proceedings of the Serious Offenders Review Council in which the Chairman noted that the conditions of custody imposed on the applicant, purportedly for his own safety, were such that he was locked in his cell for 23½ hours each day with release for 30 minutes into a very small attached exercise yard, that he was isolated from all other prisoners and that his cell was infested with cockroaches. It is patently clear that the conditions of the applicant’s custody arose directly from the threats to his life and, consistent with the management of correctional centres, the conditions of his custody were imposed upon him rather than sought by him. The Chairman expressed the view that these conditions were more onerous than those to which a prisoner is subject when segregated for discipline. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had undergone some painful surgery to his genitalia whilst in custody which rendered his remand in protective custody even more onerous and which further exacerbated his compromised psychiatric functioning as reported upon by Dr Tran in February 2005. 89 Her Honour was satisfied that the information the applicant provided in relation to the supply at The Entrance on 21 June 2004 was of assistance since the police did not have him under surveillance at that time and but for his admission the supply would not have been discovered. As a result, her Honour found that the applicant was entitled to a significant discount which she assessed at 35 per cent.  
     
      
    90 Her Honour also accepted that while the evidence provided to the Netherlands Police Agency and the Belgian authorities was of limited value, the Dutch authorities regarded his evidence to be useful. 91 In summary, her Honour assessed the combined discount for the pleas of guilty and assistance as 40 per cent for counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 (25 per cent for the pleas and 15 per cent for assistance) and 60 per cent for count 3 (25 per cent for the plea and 35 per cent for the assistance).  
     
      
    92 The applicant submitted that given her Honour’s findings as to the value of the assistance given both to authorities here and overseas, the combined discount should have been greater than the 40 per cent allowed in respect of counts 1, 2, 4 and 5. I do not understand him to complain about the discount in respect of count 3.  
     
      
    93 I referred earlier to the applicant taking the Court to a judgment from a court in Belgium in the course of oral submissions, a judgment which has since been translated and provided to the Court in accordance with the Court’s directions. On the appeal the applicant sought to supplement the value of the evidence of his assistance to the authorities overseas by reference to this material. He also claimed that this material provided further support for his submission that because Yona occupied a more senior role, the principle of parity dictated that his sentences should be reduced. 
     
      
    94 I am of the view that nothing in the judgment sheds any light on the relative roles and involvement of the applicant and Yona. On the other hand, the extract does refer to a person by the name of Abraham Yaron who the Belgian Court found guided a criminal organisation actively engaged in a number of large-scale ecstasy shipments to Australia from the Netherlands. That finding is said by the applicant to be significant in assessing whether sufficient weight was given to the assistance the applicant provided to Dutch police. Although her Honour did not have available to her a letter under the hand of J E W Gonzalez, Solicitor General of the Department of Justice in the Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Arnhem in the Netherlands dated 16 January 2008, which the applicant has made available to the Court since the appeal, she was aware that the applicant’s statement and record of interview would be made available to the prosecuting authorities in the Netherlands, a matter which she was satisfied attracted a discount on sentence.  
     
      
    95 The document provided to this Court advises as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The investigation concerned large scale trafficking in ecstasy tablets hidden, amongst other things, in Chandeliers to be sent to Australia. The main suspect in this matter for the Dutch justice system was Y. Abraham. Y. Abraham was first convicted by the tribunal in Utrecht and subsequently lodged an appeal with the Court of Arnhem. I have dealt with this matter in my capacity as Solicitor General. 
        
       
       
        
        Your declarations have contributed to the pool of documentary proof in order to have Y. Abraham convicted for a period of 11 years of incarceration. This matter is not yet beyond the reach of the appeals process because Y. Abraham has lodged an appeal with the High Court of the Netherlands. The matter of conviction against Y. Abraham, however, still has to be processed for the time being by the court in Arnhem. Your declarations are also there (sic) of importance. It is my intention to confirm by means of this letter that your cooperation in the matter Merlijn is appreciated by the government prosecutor’s office.” 
        
       
      
    96 Whilst it is true that the letter details the use to which the applicant’s statements and his record of interview were ultimately put, this information does not in my opinion add to the weight of the evidence of assistance overall. 
     
      
    97 The Crown drew the Court’s attention to the fact that the applicant was himself named as a defendant in the Belgian judgment and that he was found to be a member of the same criminal organisation controlled by Abraham. I note that this finding would appear to run counter to her Honour’s finding that the applicant knew nothing of the drugs before he came to Australia. The Crown has however expressly eschewed making any use of any part of the extract of the judgment against the applicant on the appeal and, I assume, against the applicant in the event of re-sentence.  
     
      
    98 The balance of the correspondence forwarded by the applicant to the Court since the hearing of the appeal concerned the question as to whether he will provide any further assistance to the prosecuting authorities in both Holland and Belgium in relation to their ongoing investigations. So far as I can understand it, the applicant has made it plain that he does not want to assist further until he learns the outcome of his appeal and/or until he has been transferred to custody in Belgium and his safety and the safety of his family members is guaranteed. In his various communications with the relevant judicial officer in Holland he has also made it plain that he is not prepared to return to protective custody in an Australian gaol because of the deprivations he was subject to whilst on remand. The question as to whether or not the applicant will provide further assistance to the authorities overseas is, accordingly, not a matter that can have any bearing on the appeal. Not only is it beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to dictate where a prisoner ought be detained in this State, still less is it a matter for this Court to involve itself in the arrangement between the Department of Justice in Belgium and relevant authorities in Australia should an international transfer of a serving prisoner be under consideration. 99 While the combined discount of 40 per cent with a discrete discount of 15 per cent for assistance was within the range of discounts customarily given for assistance considered to be generally useful, and timely and motivated by a desire to cooperate, a range which, at least until recent times, was between 20 and 50 per cent (see R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243; R v Chu [1998] NSWSC 568) it failed, in my view, to adequately account for the fact that there was a direct relationship between the threats to which the applicant was subject and the conditions of custody on remand. I am mindful of what this Court has had to say in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151, where Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) expressed the view that the customary range of a combined discount should now be reduced to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount, namely that an offender who has provided assistance will serve the sentence in more difficult conditions, is no longer generally applicable and that a case would need to be exceptional for a combined discount of greater than 40 per cent to be granted. I note that in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [52], Buddin J, with whom Simpson J agreed, expressed a preference for a combined discount of more than 50 per cent being reserved for an exceptional case. I also note that Howie J was a member of that bench and expressed no dissent from that view.  
     
      
    100 While it is true there was no evidence before her Honour that the applicant would be incarcerated in onerous conditions for any nominated or predicted period beyond the date of his sentence because of his assistance, in my view the fact that the applicant was forced to withstand inhumane conditions of incarceration over an extended period prior to sentence, such that his medical condition was exacerbated and his mental functioning compromised, is compelling. I regard this case as legitimately falling within an exceptional class of case where a combined discount of more than 40 per cent should have been allowed, not because of evidence that the applicant will spend his sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population, but because the onerous conditions to which he was subject whilst on remand were directly related to the assistance he offered and the threats to his life that resulted.  
     
      
    101 I note that in Sukkar, Latham J considered that the fact that there was little in the assistance by way of contrition, no evidence of any personal risk to the offender or to any member of his family and no evidence of any hardship arising directly out of the provision of assistance, allowed her Honour to conclude that a combined discount of 45 per cent was unduly generous and that it should be reduced to 35 per cent.  
     
      
    102 By contrast, in the case of this applicant his assistance was significant and all three features were present. For that reason I consider that a combined discount of 40 per cent in respect of counts 1, 2 4 and 5 was inadequate and that a 45 per cent discount should have been allowed. I am not of the view that the combined discount of 60 per cent for count 3 is in the same category, indeed I regard it as generous. 
     
      
    103 In SZ v The Queen, the importance of ensuring that a discount for assistance does not produce a result that is disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence was emphasised, and in the context of State offences this is mandated by the provision of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Consideration will need to be given to the operation of s 23(3) of the Act when re-sentencing the applicant for the three State offences. 
     
      
    Ground 7: The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by nature of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and those imposed upon his co-offender104 Following his arrest on 28 June 2004, Doran Yona was charged with two offences. The first was laid under the Customs Act (Cth) and concerned his possession of the ecstasy supplied by the applicant on 26 and 27 June 2004 as located by police in the boot of the Holden Commodore parked in the car park at the Swiss Grand Hotel at Bondi Beach on 28 June 2004. He was also charged with money laundering an amount of $1,000,000 contrary to s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for the money laundering offence was a fine not exceeding $79,200 or imprisonment for 12 years or both. The maximum penalty for the drug offence was life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $825,000 or both. The sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years for the money laundering offence and a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months in respect of the drug offence. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. His Honour arrived at that sentence after allowing a 60 per cent discount for the combined value in his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. From the remarks on sentence it would appear that after assessing the objective seriousness of the drug offence and the offender’s role, which his Honour regarded as tangential and marginal, a head sentence of 15 years was considered an appropriate starting point for the calculation of sentence.  
     
      
    105 Although her Honour noted that at the time of the applicant’s sentence hearing Yona’s sentence was subject to a Crown appeal, she considered that in addition to the sentence being lenient there were good reasons why parity with Yona did not apply. She considered the charges faced by the applicant and Yona were markedly different in that Yona was charged with a money laundering offence and a single count of possession under the Customs Act (Cth), while the applicant faced multiple counts of possession and supply. She also noted that the quantity of drugs involved in Yona’s offence were less than the drugs the applicant possessed and supplied and that in Yona’s sentencing proceedings the sentencing judge described his role in possessing the drugs as tangential and marginal, that Yona’s assistance was far more valuable than the assistance given by the applicant because he gave evidence against other offenders both at committal and trial and that he had a stronger subjective case.106 Following the sentencing of the applicant, this Court published its decision on the Crown appeal. The majority found that his Honour erred in appointing 15 years as the starting point for the calculation of sentence in circumstances where the quantity of drug involved was almost 33 times the commercial quantity and erred in his description of the offender’s role as a “somewhat tangential or marginal”. The Court regarded Yona’s role in arranging for the applicant to transfer the drugs to him as far more significant than the time he was in actual possession of the drugs and that the offending comprehended by both counts on the indictment reflected a high level of criminality such that it was patent that his Honour’s sentencing discretion had miscarried. The Court regarded that finding as reinforced by the fact that his Honour allowed a 60 per cent discount for the combined value of the assistance and his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    107 In accordance with the principles that apply when re-sentencing following a successful Crown appeal, Beazley JA was of the opinion that the lowest sentence that could have been imposed for the drug offence was a sentence of 16 years imprisonment. In arriving at this sentence her Honour took into account Yona’s mental condition and compromised capacity to function as diminishing the need for general deterrence without reducing the sentence by any arithmetic calculation an approach taken by the judge at first instance which her Honour found to be in error (see [44]-[69]). Her Honour then allowed a 50 per cent discount for the combined utility of the assistance to authorities and the plea of guilty reducing the head sentence to one of 8 years and imposed a non-parole period of half of the head sentence since that was an approach taken by the sentencing judge, an approach that was not challenged on appeal. Her Honour then ordered partial concurrency in respect of the sentence for money laundering and specified that the sentence for the drug offence commence 12 months after the commencement of the sentence for the money laundering offence. In the result, Yona was sentenced to a period of 5 years imprisonment before being eligible to be released on parole.108 The Crown submitted that there were sound reasons why the parity principle had no application in sentencing the applicant and that the sentencing judge was correct to find that there were significant differences, both objective and subjective, between Yona’s case and the applicant’s, and significant differences between the offences committed by Yona and the applicant. The Crown submitted that the applicant’s attempts in his written submissions to portray Yona as more significantly involved and more senior than him should be rejected. The Crown also submitted that if there was to be any comparison between the sentence imposed on Yona and the sentence imposed on the applicant, the comparison would only relate to count 1 where the applicant was charged with being in possession of the drugs that he supplied to Yona such that they were in Yona’s possession on his arrest. While that comparison is valid, in my view, it does not necessarily stop there given that the applicant was also charged with supplying the drugs in Counts 4 and 5 which Yona was charged with possessing.109 Although her Honour was correct in identifying differences in the number and type of offences with which Yona and the applicant were charged, and while I am conscious that parity as a sentencing principle does not extend to redressing any imbalance or discrepancies in the manner in which prosecuting authorities might charge co-offenders (see R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363), I am also mindful of the fact that a justifiable sense of grievance may arise in cases where even though a co-accused is sentenced on a different factual basis so as to justify the imposition of unequal sentences, the sentences are nevertheless disproportionate to that degree of difference (see Formosa, per Simpson J at [49]). For these reasons, I propose to take into account the issue of parity when re-sentencing the applicant. I am not however of the view that equal sentences will be the result. It cannot be ignored that Yona was re-sentenced after a Crown appeal where, consistent with principle, Beazley JA calculated the head sentence from a starting point at the lowest end of the range, namely 16 years. On this appeal the Court is not so constrained. In addition, Yona’s subjective circumstances were such as to entitle him to leniency by reason of his mental health which was of a different nature to the psychological stresses from which the applicant suffers.  
     
      
    110 In the result, as will be apparent from the orders that I propose on re sentencing, the starting point for the calculation of sentence in respect of Count 4 is significantly higher than 16 years despite the fact that the objective criminality in Yona’s possession of the drugs that the applicant supplied to him is comparable. This is necessary in order to ensure that the term of imprisonment to be imposed on the applicant adequately reflects the principle of general deterrence – a principle of fundamental importance when sentencing offenders who are involved in large scale trafficking in illegal drugs.111 As a result of the errors I have identified in her Honour’s approach to sentencing in respect of the State offences and in her calculation of the discount for the plea and assistance, coupled with the impact of the fresh evidence on the appointment of the applicant’s role and his position in the enterprise relative to Yona, I am satisfied that some other sentence in respect of counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 is warranted in law. In respect of count 2, and despite the fact that her Honour allowed only a 40 per cent discount where in my opinion a 45 per cent discount should have been allowed, I do not regard any other sentence other than that imposed by her Honour is warranted in law. I note that her Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months. In passing that sentence, however, her Honour did not comply with s 19AB(4) and (5) of the Crimes Act (Cth). To rectify that error, I decline to fix a recognisance release order by reason of the circumstances in which the applicant retained possession of the ecstasy the subject of this count. Orders112 Having regard to relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I propose the following orders:1. Leave to appeal against the sentences is granted. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    2. The appeal allowed in part. The sentences imposed on 5 May 2006 in respect of counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 are quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         (a) In respect of count 1 on the indictment, sentence is calculated from a starting point of 22 years. After applying a discount of 45 per cent, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years and 1 month. There being no basis to depart from the accepted ratio of 60 – 66 per cent between the term of imprisonment and the non-parole period in Commonwealth matters, a non-parole period of 8 years is imposed. I direct that the sentence commence on 28 June 2004 with the non-parole period commencing on that date and expiring on 27 June 2012 the date upon which the applicant is eligible for release on parole. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
         (b) In respect of count 4 on the indictment (objectively the most serious of the three State offences and reflecting a degree of criminality relative to the first Commonwealth offence), I consider that in light of all of the circumstances in which the applicant came to supply Yona with the drugs in his possession, his offending is in the mid range. After taking into account the applicant’s previous record (s 21A(2)(d) of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         ) and the fact that his activity was part of an organised criminal enterprise (s 21A(2)(n)) as aggravating factors and his assistance to the authorities (s 21A(3)(m)), his plea of guilty (21(A)(3)(k)) his remorse (s 21A(3)(i)) and the fact that he is unlikely to re-offend (s 21A(3)(g)) as mitigating factors, there are sound reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 15 years. The applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 5 years. I am satisfied that the conditions of the applicant’s custody warrant a finding of special circumstances such as to justify a departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term as specified in s 44(2) of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
          
          
         (c) In respect of count 3 on the indictment, and for the reasons specified when imposing the sentence on count 4 above and in addition for his disclosure of his offending to police, I impose a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 20 months. I have taken into account the offence on the Form 1 in the calculation of this sentence. 
          
          
         (d) In respect of count 5 on the indictment, again for the reasons specified above as justifying a departure from the standard non-parole period of 15 years, I impose a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 28 June 2004 with a balance of term of 2 years. 
         
        
       
      
    3. The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 27 June 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Frederick John Owens applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Freeman on 9 March 2007.  
     
      
    3 The applicant and a co-accused had stood trial before his Honour and a jury on charges of:- 
     
      
    1. Specially aggravated detaining for advantage a woman who I will refer to as “SP” 2. Manslaughter of EP, a baby born to SP. 
     
      
    4 On the first count the jury found both accused guilty, not of the offence charged of specially aggravated detaining for advantage, but of an alternative offence of aggravated detaining for advantage. The jury acquitted both accused on the count of manslaughter. 
     
      
    5 For the offence of aggravated detaining for advantage Judge Freeman imposed on the applicant a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of four years commencing on 21 January 2005 and a balance of the term of two years.  
     
      
    6 Detaining for advantage is an offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act. Section 86(1) creates a basic offence of detaining a person without the person’s consent with the intention of obtaining an advantage. Under s 86(2) of the Act a person is guilty of the aggravated offence if he commits the offence in the company of another person or if at the time of the commission of the offence or immediately before or after the commission of the offence actual bodily harm is occasioned to the victim. Under s 86(3) a person is guilty of the specially aggravated offence, if both the person commits the offence in the company of another person and at the time of the commission of the offence or immediately before or after the commission of the offence actual bodily harm is occasioned to the victim. Section 86(4) provides for the finding of an alternative verdict, if the jury is not satisfied that an accused person is guilty of the offence charged but is satisfied that the accused person is guilty of a lesser offence under the section. 
     
      
    7 In the present case, as the offence, if committed, was clearly committed by each accused in the company of the other accused, the explanation of the jury’s verdicts on the first count is necessarily that, while the jury was satisfied that each accused had committed the offence in the company of another person (that is, the other accused), the jury was not satisfied that actual bodily harm had been occasioned to the victim at the time of or immediately before or after the commission of the offence.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    8 Having regard to the limited nature of the only ground of appeal against sentence, it is sufficient to summarise quite succinctly the facts of the offence as found by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    9 The victim of the offence SP was at the date of the offence in an advanced state of pregnancy. She had been living for a number of weeks in the applicant’s flat. However, she spent the night of 16 January 2005 elsewhere, returning to the applicant’s flat on the morning of 17 January 2005.  
     
      
    10 After the victim had returned to the flat, the applicant verbally abused her, demanding that she return a wallet and money which he accused her of having stolen from him.  
     
      
    11 According to evidence given by the victim at the trial the applicant also physically assaulted her by striking her on various parts of her body on a number of occasions. Whether the sentencing judge should have accepted this evidence was the subject of the only ground of appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    12 The victim began having contractions. A woman who had come to the flat observed the victim in a distressed state, and after leaving the flat, made, and caused to be made, emergency telephone calls.  
     
      
    13 Police and an ambulance arrived at the flat and the victim was conveyed by ambulance to a hospital. At the hospital the victim was diagnosed as suffering from a ruptured uterus. The ruptured uterus was the actual bodily harm alleged by the Crown on the first count.  
     
      
    14 The victim’s baby EP, who was several weeks premature, was delivered by Caesarean section at the hospital. The baby suffered brain damage as a result of the rupture of her mother’s uterus and died the following day. The death of the baby gave rise to the charge of manslaughter on which both of the accused were acquitted. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    15 The only ground of appeal against sentence was:- 
     
      
       
      His Honour erred in concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the victim had been assaulted by the applicant in the manner described by the victim. 
       
      
    16 The victim gave evidence at the trial that the applicant had assaulted her quite severely by striking her a number of times on the left hand side of her body, her face, her legs and her stomach. During these assaults the victim had endeavoured to protect herself by covering herself with her arms and drawing up her legs.  
     
      
    17 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge held that neither the acquittal of the applicant on the charge of specially aggravated detaining for advantage nor the acquittal of the applicant on the charge of manslaughter entailed that the jury had rejected, or at least had not accepted beyond reasonable doubt, the victim’s evidence about the applicant assaulting her. Some medical evidence had been adduced before the jury that the victim’s uterus could have ruptured spontaneously, that is independently of any assault by the applicant, the victim having undergone three previous Caesarean operations and being in labour. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge proceeded to say that he had no difficulty in accepting the victim’s evidence that she had in fact been struck by the applicant “in the manner alleged” by the victim.  
     
      
    19 In making his finding the sentencing judge rejected submissions on behalf of the applicant based on evidence given at the trial by an ambulance officer, that, in response to a question by the officer as to whether anyone had assaulted her, the victim had answered “No, nothing happened”. The sentencing judge found that at the time of giving this answer to the ambulance officer the victim was “in extremis” and in fear of the offenders.  
     
      
    20 On this application it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to find beyond reasonable doubt that the victim had been assaulted by the applicant in the manner described by the victim.  
     
      
    21 It was common ground on the application that such a finding would be a finding of facts adverse to the applicant and could only be made if the facts were proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281 (27). It is clear from his Honour’s remarks on sentence that his Honour did regard the assaulting of the victim by the applicant as a matter seriously aggravating the applicant’s criminality.  
     
      
    22 In support of the general submission that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to make the challenged finding beyond reasonable doubt, counsel for the applicant submitted that the assaults described by the victim in her evidence at the trial were of such ferocity or severity that one would have expected her evidence, if true, to have been confirmed by medical or physical evidence but there was no such confirmatory evidence at the trial. Counsel for the applicant also referred to the evidence given by the ambulance officer at the trial that the victim had denied to him that she had been assaulted and to evidence given by the applicant himself at the trial in which he denied that he had assaulted the victim.  
     
      
    23 I do not consider that this Court should hold that it was not open to the sentencing judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the victim had been assaulted by the applicant in the manner described by the victim. 
     
      
    24 The sentencing judge, of course, had the advantage of having seen and heard the victim give evidence over an extended period at the trial.  
     
      
    25 As held by the sentencing judge, both the verdict of not guilty on the charge of specially aggravated detaining for advantage and the verdict of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter could be explained, without having to find that the jury did not accept beyond reasonable doubt the victim’s evidence that she had been assaulted by the applicant.  
     
      
    26 Although there was no evidence independent of the victim confirming that she had been assaulted by the applicant, there was no medical evidence actually tending to show that she had not been assaulted as she alleged.  
     
      
    27 It was open to the sentencing judge to reason that a witness such as the ambulance officer would have been devoting most of his attention to the victim’s being in labour and would have paid little attention to other matters. The ambulance officer gave evidence at the trial that the victim was haemorrhaging copiously and had a towel between her legs which was covered in blood. The ambulance officer gave further evidence that in the back of the ambulance he attempted to make a more thorough examination of the victim, including whether there were any signs of trauma in the area of her abdomen or vagina, but “it was very difficult because of the amount of blood”.  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to adopt the explanation given in the remarks on sentence of the evidence of the ambulance officer that the victim had denied to him that she had been assaulted.  
     
      
    29 I would reject the only ground of appeal against sentence and, hence, while granting leave to appeal against sentence, I would dismiss the appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: I agree with Hall J and the orders which he proposes. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 18 July 2007 following pleas of guilty to four offences arising from the one incident. 
     
      
    4 On 27 February 2007, he pleaded guilty in the Cobham Children’s Court to the following four counts:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Specially aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s.111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty: 20 years’ imprisonment); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Assault with intent to rob whilst being armed and causing wounding contrary to s.98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty: 25 years’ imprisonment; standard non-parole period: seven years’ imprisonment); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s.59 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty: five years’ imprisonment); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: Assault contrary to s.61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty: two years’ imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant is presently 16 years of age. He was 14 years of age at the date of the offences. He was 15 year of age at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    6 By notice dated 8 February 2008, the applicant provided notice of the following grounds of appeal:- 
     
      
       
      (1) His Honour erred in failing to make an order pursuant to s.19(3) of the  
      Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act 
       1987 that the applicant serve his non-parole period in juvenile detention. 
       
       
      (2) The sentencing judge gave too much weight to what were regarded as the objectively aggravating features of the offences. 
       
       
      (3) The sentencing judge had insufficient regard to the applicant’s age and misapplied the principles relevant to sentencing offenders of such tender years. 
       
       
      (4) The sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the contents of the Juvenile Justice Report. 
       
       
      (5) The sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify and properly recognise the discount to which the applicant was entitled for his assistance. 
       
       
      (6) The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case. 
       
      
    7 The applicant has been held in custody since the commission of the offences, namely, 2 November 2006. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge imposed an effective overall term of eight years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and six months. In relation to the individual offences, the following sentences were imposed:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 2: Eight years’ imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and six months to commence on 2 November 2006 and expire on 1 November 2014, the applicant being eligible for release to parole on 1 May 2011. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 1: A fixed term of four years’ imprisonment to date from 2 November 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: A fixed term of two years’ imprisonment to date from 2 November 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: A fixed term of 18 months’ imprisonment to date from 2 November 2006. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in failing to make an order pursuant to s.19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act that the applicant serve his non-parole period in juvenile detention 
       
      
    9 At the sentencing hearing, the solicitor for the Crown indicated that she would not argue against a direction that s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 be applied. At a later point, the applicant’s legal representative asked the sentencing judge to recommend under s.19 of the Act that the applicant serve all his time in a Juvenile Justice Centre. 
     
      
    10 The Court had power pursuant to s.19(1) of that Act to make the order. That provision empowers the sentencing court to make an order directing that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    11 By s.19(3), a person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years unless, inter alia, the sentencing court is satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying detention of the person as a juvenile offender after that age. The sentencing judge did not refer to this last-mentioned provision. As the Crown has observed in its written submissions on this application for leave to appeal, there is nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that his Honour would not have made the order had he recognised that the power existed. 
     
      
    12 The offence contrary to s.98 of the Crimes Act (Count 2) is a serious indictable offence and one that must be dealt with according to law pursuant to s.17 of the Children Criminal Proceedings Act. 
     
      
    13 In the circumstances, it was not contested that an error had been made in this respect and the Crown accepted that an order ought to have been made pursuant to s.19(3) of the Act that the applicant serve his sentence in juvenile detention. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge gave too much weight to what were regarded as the objectively aggravating features of the offence 
       
      
    14 There was placed before the sentencing court a statement of facts (Exhibit A). According to that document, the applicant was woken by his elder brother, PM, early on the morning of 2 November 2006 and was driven by him to an area near an abandoned house located next door to the victims’ premises. He then provided the applicant with various items of disguise and a knife. The applicant’s brother took a meat cleaver. 
     
      
    15 They both entered the premises via a rear door. A number of members of a family living there were present, although the father of the family had left for work shortly before. Those present in the house on the morning in question included a woman and her three sons and two daughters. 
     
      
    16 According to the statement, the facts surrounding the offences were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[The applicant] and [the applicant’s brother] moved quickly into the hallway, near the entrance to the lounge area and the kitchen. Both of them gestured for the victims in the loungeroom to remain quiet and get on the floor. [The applicant’s brother] moved into the doorway separating the kitchen and lounge room. As he moved into the kitchen area [the applicant’s brother] stood in the hallway watching the victims in the lounge room. 
        
       
       
        
        As [the applicant] entered the kitchen he approached Li Wang with his arm raised with a knife in his hand and he demanded money, ‘Give em the money. You no give me money I kill you’. Li Wang commenced screaming.” 
        
       
      
    17 Following these events, the applicant was restrained following a struggle with the mother of the children and one of her sons. The woman received a wound to her hand from the applicant’s knife which did not require stitches. One of her sons received a small cut to his right middle finger. The applicant was also injured by the knife causing a wound to his arm which required stitches. 
     
      
    18 His brother was swinging the meat cleaver at one of the children. The brother then went outside and commenced throwing rocks at the windows of the house causing them to smash. He evaded apprehension but, at a later point in time, was arrested and charged with offences arising out of the abovementioned events. He had not been sentenced at the time of the applicant’s sentence hearing. 
     
      
    19 In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, Ms A Francis of counsel observed that the knife that the applicant had been provided with by his brother had broken during the altercation. It was argued that it was self-evident that the applicant was readily restrained and that whilst the offence was a home invasion, the applicant demonstrated little capacity to intimidate, to carry out the crime and overcome the occupants. 
     
      
    20 In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge observed that the plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity. He noted that the standard non-parole period for the offence under s.98 of the Crimes Act was a period of seven years. His Honour referred to the principles enunciated by this Court in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, [2007] NSWCCA 131 and also to the provisions of s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    21 In relation to the latter provisions, the sentencing judge had regard to the applicant’s youth and his prospects of rehabilitation which were said to be excellent. 
     
      
    22 In relation to the standard non-parole period of seven years, the sentencing judge stated (remarks on sentence, p.5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I need to say, without turning to the facts in significant detail or lengthy detail, that I entertain not the slightest doubt that these offences fall within that category and, leaving other matters aside, they would be subject to the imposition of a standard non-parole period of seven years.” 
        
       
      
    23 However, he then referred to the applicant’s age and to his prospect of rehabilitation and said that it would not be in the public interest for the standard non-parole period of seven years to be applied to him. In this context, reference was also made to the applicant’s “very limited criminal history”. 
     
      
    24 The sentencing judge also had regard to the fact that, although the circumstances of the s.98 offence were “disturbing in the extreme”, it was committed in the company of his elder brother who, he noted, was a man in his mid to late 20s. In the circumstances, he considered that he was entitled to draw the inference “… that the elder brother … was the driving force behind this enterprise. But that is not to say that the present offender … was not an enthusiastic participant in relation to these events” (remarks on sentence, p.6). 
     
      
    25 The remarks on sentence also recorded the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time of the s.98 offence, bail having been granted for “… a not dissimilar offence involving robbery in company …”. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge, in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, concluded (remarks on sentence, p.9):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already said that, in my view, having regard to some of the factors in relation to this particular matter, this incident certainly falls, in terms of objective seriousness, into the middle range. Both participants were heavily disguised, gloves, socks on their boots, armed with weapons, that is, a knife and a meat cleaver. Both in the company of each other. It was a home invasion, a number of victims of various ages and genders and this particular offender played a prominent role in what occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        His conduct was the conduct of a young juvenile but he certainly acted like an adult in terms of this enterprise. I realise that general deterrence is less important than rehabilitation prospects, but general deterrence, of course, cannot be ignored …” 
        
       
      
    27 In relation to the element of planning, the remarks on sentence record that there must have been some discussion between the applicant and his brother before entering the premises, it being observed (remarks on sentence, p.11):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… so that even if the planning was limited and I suppose I must give the offender the benefit of the doubt in terms of his knowledge of the planning. Certainly before they entered, the planning reached the stage of adopting these disguises and the other protections by way of gloves and socks on the boots.” 
        
       
      
    28 The sentencing judge determined that the aggravating factors under s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were:- 
     
      
       
      • That the applicant was on conditional liberty (bail) for a not dissimilar offence. 
       
       
      • That there was at least limited planning. 
       
       
      • That the injuries themselves were not substantial but, on the other hand, they were not trivial. 
       
      
    29 As stated in the Crown’s written submissions, it was ultimately a question for the sentencing judge as to what weight was to be given to the objective aggravating features of the case: Regina v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 per Spigelman CJ at [11]. Reliance was also placed upon the fact that the sentencing judge found the offence to be in the mid-range of objective seriousness and no complaint has been made as to that finding. The complaint was essentially that the sentence imposed was too high. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge had insufficient regard to the applicant’s age and mis-applied the principles relevant to sentencing offenders of tender years 
       
      
    30 It is clear from the remarks on sentence that the sentencing judge was mindful of the applicant’s age and the sentencing principles that apply to the sentencing of young offenders. He quoted from the decision of this Court in Regina v DB; Regina v DMM (2007) 167 A Crim R 393, [2007] NSWCCA 27, a decision which emphasised the importance of recognising the role immaturity plays in the commission of offences by young persons. 
     
      
    31 In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, the following passage was extracted from the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I would normally, having regard to the serious nature of this particular crime, impose a sentence on an adult, particularly one who was on conditional liberty at the time, of somewhere between 12 and 14 years. The maximum penalty, of course, is 25 years. Having considered the matter for a couple of days, I reached the conclusion that a sentence of 10 and a half years would be approximately appropriate, but the prisoner is entitled to a 25% reduction in broad terms.” 
        
       
      
    32 Ms Francis, in her written submissions, observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “5.3 Whilst little assistance is to be derived from assessing whether a starting point of 12 to 14 years would be appropriate for the broad class constituted by ‘adult offenders’, his Honour’s approach reveals a reduction in penalty, on account of youth, of between 18 months and three and a half years. This is illustrative of the errors contended for by the applicant, namely, that his Honour had insufficient regard to the principles relevant in sentencing juvenile offenders, particularly, juvenile offenders who are as young as the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    33 In a case such as the present, the age and immaturity of the offender is an important factor that determines the level of culpability associated with a serious offence where such immaturity was a significant contributing factor. 
     
      
    34 In this respect, in Regina v JLC-H [2004] NSWCCA 70 at [30], Santow JA stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Then there are subjective factors of a terrible home background and domestic violence of a continuing nature which clearly marked this immature young man, still only 16 years 9 months at the time of these offences. That immaturity is an important aspect of this case. In  
        Hearne 
         [2001] 124 A Crim R at [22], this Court considered the sentencing of young offenders and, in particular, what might be described as the tension between the desirability of rehabilitating the offender with the need to recognise the criminality of an offender who has committed a particularly serious crime. Addressing the principle involved, the Court said (at para 25):- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It lies in at least part of the rationale for making any allowance for youth, that is, the immaturity which is usually involved.  
          Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence 
          , then it may be fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years.’” 
           (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    35 In MS2 & Ors v Regina (2005) 158 A Crim R 93, [2005] NSWCCA 397, Adams and Hoeben JJ (Simpson J dissenting) referred to and applied the relevant principles. The principal offender in that case had a family background and early behavioural problems leading up to the offences that were remarkably similar to those of the applicant to the present proceedings. The principal difference was that the offender in that case was aged 15 years and seven months at the time of the offences. Adams, J in MS2 at [16], stated, in relation to the sentencing of young offenders, that there are two reasons why the youthfulness of offenders is considered a very significant factor. The first is the substantial public interest in the rehabilitation of youthful offenders. The second is that immaturity is relevant to culpability or criminality. His Honour there stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the point may be put simply: children do not have adult value judgments, adult experience, adult appreciation of consequences – especially catastrophic consequences – or adult understanding of criminal culpability. That, of course, is not to say that, depending on age and background, they cannot be intentionally wicked and know very well that what they do or intend to do is very seriously wrong and even criminal …” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour later added that immaturity in the circumstances of that case was of considerable significance as a factor and although it did not provide an excuse for the conduct, the point was “… that their culpability was significantly less than would have been the case had they been mature adults …” (at [23]). Hoeben J expressed a similar opinion. 
     
      
    37 I will return to the question as to whether or not the sentencing judge did properly assess, in accordance with accepted principle, the extent to which the applicant’s immaturity was a factor in the commission of the offence (see Ground 6: sentence manifestly excessive). 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the contents of the Juvenile Justice Report 
       
      
    38 Section 25(2) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act requires a sentencing judge to “take into account the matters contained in the (background) report” before a child can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    39 The sentencing judge referred to the background report (Exhibit B) at p.10.1 of the remarks on sentence in the context of finding that the applicant had excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    40 The eight page report was made by Andrea Bartolo, Juvenile Justice Officer, dated 13 July 2007. It was based on a number of sources of information as set out on pp.1 and 2. The circumstances relating to the offence, family background, education, social activities and peer group, custodial response and assessment were fully discussed in the report. 
     
      
    41 Ms Bartolo observed that, since being in custody, the applicant had maintained a constant level of good behaviour and maintained a good relationship with staff and other residents. He continued to attend school on a full-time basis and maintained a very high standard of participation and conduct. He was currently working towards his Year 10 School Certificate. 
     
      
    42 The Juvenile Justice Report, however, was not concerned to determine the extent to which the applicant’s immaturity had contributed to his offending. It did refer (p.6) to the fact that the applicant’s older brother “… may have had some detrimental effect on (the applicant’s) behaviour and encouraged him to become involved in criminal activity”. 
     
      
    43 The report then set out the suggested sentencing options which included the applicant’s suitability for inclusion into the Community Order Scheme. 
     
      
    44 It is clear that the sentencing judge did read the background report. The report, as I have stated, focussed ultimately on the issue of sentencing options. I do not consider that it has been established that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the matters contained in the report. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify and properly characterise the discount to which the applicant was entitled for his assistance 
       
      
    45 Whilst the applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview with police in which he made admissions nominating his brother as co-offender, he did not provide an undertaking to give evidence against his brother. 
     
      
    46 The sentencing judge did have regard to the fact that he had been frank in discussions with police and expressly said that he had taken it into account. 
     
      
    47 I do not consider that there is any substance to this ground. It very much formed part of the sentencing discretion of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case 
       
      
    48 As earlier stated, no complaint is made concerning the assessment that the offence under s.98 fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    49 The written submissions for the applicant also accepted that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time, having been granted bail for three robbery offences. He was dealt with without conviction in relation to those offences before being sentenced in relation to the present matters. 
     
      
    50 There is no express reference as to whether or not the applicant’s youth or immaturity was a factor in the commission of the offences, let alone that it was a significant contributing factor. The sentencing judge inferred, as noted earlier, that his brother was the driving force behind the enterprise. There was also the finding that there had been some planning, although limited in nature. 
     
      
    51 I accept as valid the argument put by Ms Francis in her written submissions that it is not an appropriate approach in a case such as the present to approach the sentencing exercise by identifying the appropriate sentence that might have been applied to an adult (as the sentencing judge did in the present case) and then to allow some kind of discount on account of youth. 
     
      
    52 The correct approach requires the sentencing judge to assess whether immaturity, having regard in particular to an offender’s age, was a significant factor in the commission of an offence. If those questions are answered in the affirmative, then it may be fairly said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years in accordance with the principles stated in Regina v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, [2001] NSWCCA 37 and Regina v JLC-H (supra). 
     
      
    53 The objective seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant by way of a home invasion in company and causing injury was undoubtedly of a high order, although fortunately the nature of the injuries were not serious. 
     
      
    54 The evidence before the sentencing judge established that the applicant’s elder brother was considerably older then him (being approximately 28 years of age at the date of the offences), that it was his brother who enlisted the applicant in the relevant events and provided him with the disguise and other apparel and gave him a knife. The fact that the sentencing judge found the applicant to be a willing or active participant, does not, in itself, deal with the extent of the contribution of his immaturity. 
     
      
    55 In the report of the clinical psychologist, Mr Peter G Champion, the personal history included the fact that there had been a number of suspensions from high school and a report of truancy and a report of the applicant “… having tended to gravitate to older sub-cultural peers”. Mr Champion stated at p.5 of his report:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the problem being that the next oldest brother was apparently a problem child and reportedly involved in offending behaviour, and thus his influence may not have been a positive one …” 
        
       
      
    56 In his conclusions, Mr Champion stated that the applicant’s history suggested, inter alia, “peer-group dependency” exacerbated by prior cannabis use and recent alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    57 In the circumstances in which it may be inferred that a considerably older brother, consistently reported as having had a history of behavioural problems, had influence over the applicant and who instigated the subject offences, it is clear that the applicant’s immaturity was a significant factor in his offending, Mr Champion’s report confirmed that he had a pre-disposition to being led to participate in disorderly behaviour. 
     
      
    58 These matters are central to the assessment of the criminality of the applicant as a young offender of 14 years at the time of the offences. Notwithstanding that the sentencing judge had regard to both the applicant’s youth and to his excellent prospects of rehabilitation, he did not, in my opinion, undertake the assessment of criminality in accordance with the principles discussed in the authorities to which I have referred. 
     
      
    59 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that without that assessment having been properly brought into account, the sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    60 The applicant was granted leave to rely upon the affidavits of Catherine Ridge, solicitor, both declared and affirmed on 20 May 2008. The report of Andrea Bartolo, Juvenile Justice Officer, a copy of which is Annexure A to the longer of the two affidavits, consistently with her earlier report referred to above, confirmed that he has been a co-operative student of good behaviour and has undertaken counselling. He has received positive reports from teachers. The reference from Pastor Bromley dated 14 May 2008 (a copy of which is Annexure B to the same affidavit) also attests to the applicant’s progress and his participation in chapel services and sporting activities and respect shown to others. His concern as to the possible effect of continued detention is noted. 
     
      
    61 Ms Ridge’s second affidavit attaches a supporting letter from his sister and confirms that he will have the support and assistance of his family upon his release. 
     
      
    62 I am of the opinion that an appropriate starting point would be a head sentence of nine years. After allowing 25% discount for an early plea, that would result in an overall term of six years and nine months. 
     
      
    63 The finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge was one appropriately made and there was no challenge in that respect. 
     
      
    64 I am, accordingly, of the opinion that the appropriate non-parole period in respect of Count 2 is a period of three years and six months to commence on 2 November 2006 and to expire on 1 May 2010, with a balance of term of three years and three months to expire on 1 August 2013. 
     
      
    65 I propose that the fixed term of four years’ imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of Count 1 be quashed and that the applicant be re-sentenced in respect of Count 1 to a fixed term of three years and six months commencing 2 November 2006. Accordingly, the sentence for Count 1 will expire on 1 May 2010. 
     
      
    66 The sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of Counts 3 and 4, and the sentence I propose in respect of Count 1, I consider should be wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed with respect to Count 2 in accordance with paragraph [64]. The fact that the particular offences all occurred during the one episode, I consider in the particular circumstances of the case, provides a sufficient basis for concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    67 Accordingly, the orders I propose are:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal is allowed, in part. 
       
       
      (3) An order under s.19(1),  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 
      , that the applicant serve the sentence imposed under orders (5) and (7) below and the sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of Counts 3 and 4 as a juvenile offender. 
       
       
      (4) That the sentence imposed in respect of Count 2 be set aside. 
       
       
      (5) That, in respect of Count 2, the applicant be sentenced to a period of three years and six months commencing on 2 November 2006 and expiring on 1 May 2010 with a balance of term of three years and three months to expire on 1 August 2013. 
       
       
      (6) That the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 be set aside. 
       
       
      (7) That, in respect of Count 1, the applicant be sentenced to a fixed term of three years and six months commencing 2 November 2006 and expiring 1 May 2010. 
       
       
      (8) That the sentence imposed by the District Court in respect of Counts 3 and 4, and the sentence imposed by this Court in respect of Count 1, be wholly concurrent with the sentence of this Court imposed in respect of Count 2. 
       
       
      (9) Accordingly the date on which the applicant will become eligible for parole will be 1 May 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Harb Yacoub was convicted following a trial by jury in the District Court of the attempted murder of the victim. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of two years. He challenges his conviction but does not seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    2 The appellant makes no complaint about the conduct of his trial. He seeks to advance only one ground of appeal, being that, on all the evidence, “the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported.” It may be that leave to argue this ground is required (see Krishna v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 318). The Crown does not oppose leave and in my opinion it should be granted. I will refer to Mr Yacoub as the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    3 Before considering various issues in detail it may be helpful to outline the Crown case. It began with evidence that the appellant and the victim commenced a relationship after meeting in a coffee shop. The appellant is a Lebanese-Australian Christian and the victim is a Sudanese-Australian Christian who has spent most of her life in Dubai. Her parents were still residing in Dubai. The victim lived in Sydney with her grandmother. 
     
      
    4 During the months of their relationship the appellant obtained money, in the order of $60,000, from the victim on promises that he would marry her. They had sexual relations on a number of occasions. The victim obtained the money from her parents and brother in Dubai, her grandmother, from her own savings and by selling some jewellery. 
     
      
    5 On the day of the incident, 22 February 2006, the victim told the appellant that she had placed $800 in his bank account but had no more money. The appellant promised the victim that he would not ask her for any more money and arranged for them to go out that night for “a celebration.” He picked the victim up in his car. She rang her friend Ms Hassan when she was in the car with the appellant. The victim told Ms Hassan that she had told her grandmother she was going out that night with Ms Hassan to a party (the victim agreed when giving evidence that she rang Ms Hassan to ask her to tell a lie in case her grandmother rang). The appellant also spoke with Ms Hassan and asked her to join them. Ms Hassan declined. 
     
      
    6 Shortly afterwards, the appellant stopped the car to allow the victim to purchase a bottle of Ouzo. They then went to the Comfort Inn Town and Country Motel in South Strathfield. The victim went alone to the reception and booked a room. She then called the appellant on his mobile phone and gave him the room number. He then left his car and came directly to the room as arranged. 
     
      
    7 When they got to the motel room the appellant removed his clothes and the victim removed her clothes. The appellant told her to drink from the bottle directly and to make sure she took a big sip so it would not hurt her throat. She agreed in evidence that she did not say at any time she did not want to drink the Ouzo but said that she “wanted to drink it as a human being with water and ice” to enjoy herself, rather than drink it directly form the bottle. The victim agreed they had consensual intercourse on the bed and then she performed oral sex on the appellant. When the appellant ejaculated she said he “told me to swallow the sperms and I said – I refused and I just kept them in my mouth. When he got up to wash off, I just spitted on the tissue.” The appellant came and sat next to her on the bed. He said there was something he needed to tell her. She said he “just told me that he is married and have kids, and that’s when I had the shock and I started crying so hard from my heart.” He got up from the bed and she asked him where he was going. He said he was just going for a smoke and sat on the sofa and she could see he was having a smoke. She said that after the appellant had the smoke on the sofa he returned to the bed. He then proceeded to cut both her wrists and inflicted a further cut to her neck. 
     
      
    8 The victim agreed that in her statement to police on 2 March 2006 she gave an account of the events which differed in some respects from her evidence at the trial. She accepted that she told the police when making a statement on 2 March 2006 that she saw the appellant come out of the bathroom and “He walked straight over to me. I thought he was coming to console me.” Then she said “He got to the right hand side of the bed where, I was now lying, after rolling back over onto my back. Harry took my right arm with one of his hands, I felt something cutting my right wrist.” 
     
      
    9 The victim agreed she may have told police who spoke with her at the hospital that, rather than coming from the bathroom, the appellant had come from where he had been sitting on the sofa and inflicted the injuries on her. She ultimately thought the sequence she gave the police at the hospital was correct and that the appellant had come over from having a cigarette on the sofa – not from the bathroom before he attacked her. She agreed she was more sure about the sequence of events when giving evidence than she was in March when she gave the statement to the police. 
     
      
    10 The victim agreed that when the appellant cut her wrists and neck she did not scream or shout aloud. She said in evidence, “Yes I shouted very hard but inside my heart, I was praying, I was shouting to Jesus to help me.” She agreed she did not react spontaneously by pulling her wrist away stating, “I didn’t react in any other way because at that time I was shocked and I was – you can – the alcohol was also – I was – I didn’t know if it was real or it was like me dreaming a bad dream or it was really happening to me.” She said she could not move or scream out because “the alcohol was playing in my head.” 
     
      
    11 The victim said that her eyes were closed the whole time the injuries were being inflicted. At some point she felt the appellant had left the room and she knew she had to get up from the bed and look for her mobile so she could call for help. She agreed that it was around half an hour after the cutting sensations before she called reception. She said she had trouble raising herself from the bed to call for help. At first she could not find her bag. Then she realised her bag was on the table and not on the sofa. She was feeling dizzy and weak. She went to the table to get her bag, which dropped off the table and onto the floor. She looked inside the bag for her mobile telephone but could not find it. She said that she did not go into the bathroom but was sitting on the floor unconscious for a while. It could have been for 10 or 15 minutes, she was not sure. After that she vomited. She said that “When I got up from the bed the first thing I did is I try to wrap my right hand because it was the most one – the cut was really big in it and the blood was coming very heavily. I grabbed the towel which was on the bed and I just wrapped it around my right hand.” She agreed she did not wrap anything around her left hand or neck. As far as she was aware, while she was unconscious on the floor her other wounds were still bleeding but not as much as the injury to her right hand. When she awoke and got hold of her bag she took out her watch and saw that it was around 9.30 pm. 
     
      
    12 The victim called reception and said “Please can you call the ambulance because someone tried to kill me … someone tried to kill me.” The receptionist told her the ambulance was on its way and the victim put her jeans and shirt on. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital. 
     
      
    13 The police interviewed her at the hospital. The victim did not agree that she told police that night that she was sitting on the bed when the appellant came and cut her, although she accepted that the police may have written that in their notes. She was not sure what she said to police about sitting, but she firmly believed she was lying on the bed. 
     
      
    14 She agreed after the appellant inflicted the injuries she pretended to be dead. She lay there not breathing with her eyes closed and not moving. 
     
      
    15 The police conducted a search of the motel room and areas surrounding the motel. A cutting implement which could have caused the victim’s injury was not found. The windows in the motel could not be opened and the clothes the victim was wearing that evening had no pockets. When the appellant was later arrested he was found to be in possession of the victim’s mobile phone. His fingerprints were found on the Ouzo bottle and the bathroom door of the motel room. An analysis was done on seminal fluid in a ball of tissues found next to the bed which resulted in a full DNA profile match with the appellant. An open packet of Stanley blades was found in the boot of the appellant’s car. 
     
      
    16 There was a time lapse of about 50 minutes between when the appellant left the motel, (he was recorded on a CCTV camera) and when the victim phoned reception asking for help. The victim explained this lapse of time as being due to her shocked state, during which she vomited, felt dizzy and lapsed into unconsciousness. There was objective evidence of her vomiting and being incontinent. 
     
      
    17 The victim was the primary Crown witness. The trial judge made plain to the jury that the Crown case depended upon her evidence. His Honour gave careful instructions to the jury as to how to assess a witness’s credibility and discussed the appropriate approach to the victim’s evidence in some detail. No complaint is made about any direction given to the jury. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    18 The appellant did not give evidence. The defence case was that he did not inflict any of the injuries on the victim. It was further contended that he had never proposed to the victim and, although it was accepted that they met a few months earlier, it was said that they only had a brief affair. It was suggested that the victim did not give the appellant large amounts of money as she had alleged. Rather it was contended that the payments by her were confined to approximately $4,000. 
     
      
    19 The defence case accepted that the appellant and the victim met on the evening of 22 February 2006 when the victim bought a bottle of Ouzo. It was contended that she then performed oral sex on him in the back of his car. At that point the appellant told the victim he was married and they had an argument. About half an hour later he dropped her off at the motel. She had decided to stay the night because of her embarrassment in returning home when she said she would be out for the evening and went ahead and booked a room.  
     
      
    20 The victim then went to the room and rang the appellant and asked him to come back to talk about matters. It was suggested that the appellant eventually came to the room where they talked for quite a while about what had happened. After a time they had sex together after which the victim started crying. She became angry at him and the appellant ultimately decided to leave. It was suggested that the victim was angry and threw her mobile phone at the appellant which fell on the floor and he then picked it up and left. 
     
      
    21 It was put to the victim by counsel for the appellant that after the appellant left the motel she had consumed the half bottle of Ouzo. It was suggested that she was emotional and her defences were down and she decided to end her life. Defence counsel put to her that she either started out to harm herself and then decided against it, or she was intent on harming the appellant by making false allegations about him after inflicting the injuries on herself. It was put to the victim that having sex with a married man brought great shame in her culture. It was suggested that when she was alone in the room, after the appellant left, the realisation of the shame hit her and she could not cope with it.  
     
      
    22 It was put to the victim that she secreted the cutting implement somewhere in the motel in the time between when she cut herself and the call for help. It was suggested that she may have gone outside and abandoned the cutting implement in the garden before phoning reception. 
     
      
       
      Some inconsistencies and confusion 
       
      
    23 At the trial the defence emphasised that there were some internal inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence. I have referred to them in the summary of the Crown case. They were fully aired before the jury and highlighted by the address of defence counsel. Dr Timothy Green, the emergency doctor who first saw the victim described the victim’s physical state when she arrived at the hospital. He indicated that from his experience he could understand how a version of events given by someone in a hospital bed after sustaining potentially life threatening injuries may not be entirely consistent with their recollection of the events some weeks later. 
     
      
    24 The victim said she had received “ten proposals” of marriage. There was a great deal of cross-examination on this issue during which the victim said the appellant was not the first man to propose to her and that she thought at least ten men had proposed to her in the past. She said they were all Muslims and “they won’t be knocking on my door” because “I can’t get married to a Muslim person.” She said that she had received two proposals of marriage since the appellant had asked her to marry him. She later explained that when referring to a proposal she did not mean a proposal of marriage but rather an invitation by a male person to have a “relationship” with her. She later acknowledged that she may not have correctly understood what the questioner had meant by a proposal.  
     
      
    25 When pressed on the matter and it was suggested that she had lied about there being ten proposals she replied “because they did propose to me but I don’t consider them as a proposal because I cannot take them to my parents and tell them they proposed to me.” When she withdrew her evidence that ten people had “proposed to her” she said “proposal for us, back in Dubai, is different than what you have here … Our traditions in Arabic is different than your traditions. I hope you are aware of that.” Ultimately it was apparent that when speaking of a proposal the victim was speaking of an arrangement whereby a couple would “go steady.” She said that when the appellant proposed to her she believed it was a real commitment because he spoke about going to the church to get married. She said that this was the only time she had been proposed to in this way. 
     
      
    26 The trial judge dealt with the issue of proposal. His Honour suggested that in considering this issue the jury should not “brush aside … the subtleties of language.”  
     
      
    27 I accept that there were inconsistencies in the victim’s account of the events. This is not surprising. Whatever be the correct sequence, the events were traumatic. Given the alcohol she had consumed, her wounds and distress it is to be expected that some of her recollection for detail was impaired. It is apparent the jury accepted the victim’s evidence. The inconsistencies in her recollection could not justify intervention by this Court. The same is true of the confusion in her evidence as to the number of “proposals” she had received. 
     
      
       
      The victim’s mobile telephone 
       
      
    28 After the victim was wounded she said that she looked for her mobile phone in her handbag to call for help but could not find it. Her mobile telephone records showed that she had last used her phone in the motel room at 8.10 pm that evening. The call lasted 30 seconds. Both the timing and duration of the call are consistent with the evidence which the victim gave that she telephoned the appellant to inform him of the number of the motel room she had checked into. 
     
      
    29 The victim’s mobile telephone was subsequently found by police in the appellant’s car the following day. The SIM card, which would have identified calls between the victim and the appellant, had been removed. 
     
      
    30 The appellant’s counsel suggested that the victm had thrown the telephone at the appellant before he left the motel room and that he had picked it up and taken it. The victim denied this suggestion. It is difficult to understand, if the appellant’s account of the events is correct, why he would have taken the mobile phone, even if it had been thrown at him. With respect to the SIM card the Crown suggested that the appellant had removed it in order to destroy any evidence of contact between himself and the victim the previous evening. 
     
      
    31 The appellant’s explanation was that he had removed the SIM card so that his wife would not happen upon evidence which might indicate that he was having an affair. It is difficult to accept this explanation. If the appellant was concerned that his wife might discover incriminating items it would seem unlikely that he would have taken the mobile telephone. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand how his wife would have been able to retrieve information from the SIM card to any significant extent. It was of course entirely foreseeable that if the police obtained the SIM card they would be able to retrieve information available from it. 
     
      
       
      The victim’s mental state 
       
      
    32 There was no history of the victim ever having suffered from any mental illness including depression. Dr Green’s evidence was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my experience most patients with self inflicted wounds will admit to their causation unless they are psychotic. [The victim] showed no signs of psychosis or any other alteration of her mental state.” 
        
       
      
    33 During the period when the victim was in hospital there was no indication of any concern by the hospital staff in relation to her mental health. 
     
      
    34 Ms Hassan was questioned about whether she had observed any signs of depression in the victim. She indicated that the victim had never indicated to her that she was depressed prior to the incident. 
     
      
    35 There was evidence from Detective Campbell that when she interviewed the victim’s grandmother she said that the victim may be “depressed sometimes.” The grandmother was not called at the trial and there was no evidence as to what she meant when she used the word “depressed.” The trial judge gave this warning to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “To say somebody is depressed can mean an almost infinite number of things; it can certainly mean one of two things. It can mean they are a bit down or it can mean they are suffering from a diagnosable psychiatric illness. That becomes important in this case because if the word ‘depression’ means the latter, then it does go some way to explaining why a person might be suicidal. If it means the former, it does not really amount to anything at all.” 
        
       
      
    36 I do not believe this evidence from Detective Campbell to be of any significance. 
     
      
       
      The victim’s demeanour 
       
      
    37 The appellant’s counsel suggested during the trial that the appellant and the victim had argued in the car after the bottle of Ouzo had been purchased. However, the CCTV footage recorded when the victim checked into the motel, which I have examined, does not suggest that the victim was in any way distressed or concerned. Her demeanour does not suggest that she was in conflict with any person. Ms Jenny Ferizis, the receptionist at the motel gave evidence. She said that the victim was “calm natured” when she booked in. 
     
      
       
      The money 
       
      
    38 The defence challenged the victim’s suggestion that the appellant had given her large sums of money. He accepted that he received only about $4,000. However, the victim’s bank records were tendered which showed the withdrawal of large sums consistent with Ms Hassan’s evidence. In my opinion the jury were entitled to accept that significant sums had been paid. It was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant only admitted to receiving approximately $4,000 because these were the amounts of money which went directly into his bank account and accordingly, could be traced. They may also have concluded that he overlooked the fact that the victim’s bank records would show relevant withdrawals. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s lie 
       
      
    39 When the appellant was approached by police at about 2 pm at his home on the day after the victim was injured he was told that he was under arrest for an attempted murder. The arresting constable said:  
     
      
       
        
        “You are under arrest for an attempted murder in Strathfield last night. If you do not comply with my directions you may be committing further offences.” 
        
       
      
    40 The appellant’s immediate response was: 
     
      
       
        
        “What for? I was at home from 6 pm last night.” 
        
       
      
    41 The appellant then indicated that he had a poor understanding of English. Although an interpreter was brought to the police station he did not further respond to questions. 
     
      
    42 The fact that the appellant had lied was confirmed by other evidence obtained during the investigation. In particular the appellant’s DNA was found in the motel room. His fingerprints were also found on the Ouzo bottle and on the bathroom door. He is also clearly visible on the CCTV footage entering and leaving the motel. 
     
      
    43 The Crown relied upon the appellant’s immediate response to the constable as a lie evidencing a consciousness of guilt on his behalf. The jury was appropriately instructed as to how they could take this lie into account in the Crown case. 
     
      
    44 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that his lie to police was explained as an attempt to hide the affair rather than to avoid being implicated in an attempted murder. However, the Crown emphasised that the arresting constable did not mention the complainant’s name, only that there had been an “attempted murder”, and accordingly the appellant’s response was consistent with him having knowledge of the victim’s circumstances. In my opinion the appellant’s lie adds weight to the Crown case. 
     
      
       
      The absence of a weapon 
       
      
    45 An important aspect of the Crown case was that no cutting implement capable of inflicting the injuries on the victim was found anywhere in the motel room. The Crown case was that the appellant had taken the weapon which he had used with him when he left. The absence of any weapon was quite inconsistent with the injuries having been self-inflicted. 
     
      
    46 A crime scene officer gave evidence of having searched the motel room. She indicated that when she carried out the search she was looking for an implement of possible self-harm. She said the search was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Quite thorough, I overturned all the furniture in the unit, I checked the floor waste in the bathroom with a torch, also checked the vanity basin waste as well, the cistern of the toilet, yeah lifted up all the cushions, under the bed, everything, I made a thorough search and I located no items.” 
        
       
      
    47 Other constables carried out a complete and systematic search of the room. They also conducted a comprehensive search of neighbouring gardens and yards looking for weapons. 
     
      
    48 The victim said that she did not see the weapon that cut her. She said that the cutting was fast and that the appellant started with her right hand and then her left. She felt the cuts but did not see what he was cutting her with. 
     
      
    49 The police found an open packet containing three Irwin-brand Stanley blades in the appellant’s car. Such a blade was capable of inflicting the victim’s wounds and would account for her not having seen the handle of a knife. 
     
      
    50 It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the victim disposed of the weapon after wounding herself and before calling for help. It was suggested that she may have put the cutting implement down the bathroom sink, secreted it under the door mat or gone out into the motel grounds and disposed of it before returning to her room and calling an ambulance. It could not have been thrown from a window of the room. They were double glazed and could not be opened. The ambulance officer who cleaned the ambulance gave evidence that no weapon was found in the vehicle after the victim had been admitted to hospital. 
     
      
    51 I regard the appellant’s suggestions as bordering on the fanciful. In my opinion it was highly improbable that the victim inflicted the serious injuries on herself and (whilst significantly intoxicated and in shock from the bad news she had received from the appellant and having vomited and possibly passed out) had the presence of mind to, either dispose of the weapon down the bathroom sink, or, leave the room. There was no evidence of blood droplets consistent with these movements. The emergency room at the hospital recorded that when the victim arrived she had “a considerable amount of blood in her hair and over her trunk and torso.” The suggestion that she hid the weapon in the garden so that it could not be found by police and then returned to her room and called for help is entirely unbelievable. The suggestion that in her physical state the victim took steps to create the suggested deception was clearly rejected by the jury and in my opinion it was correct to do so. 
     
      
    52 The Crown emphasised that the defence theory assumed that on the night she was injured the victim had in her possession a cutting implement capable of inflicting the harm on herself. Even the defence accepted that she had expected the evening to be a happy occasion when she was to be taken out for a celebration. There was no reason for her to have suspected that the evening would end in total disappointment causing her to inflict significant harm upon herself. There was simply no reason for her to have a cutting implement capable of causing her death in her possession that night. And there was no evidence that she did have one. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Samia Hassan 
       
      
    53 Ms Hassan was a friend of the victim’s and gave evidence which was consistent with the victim’s account of her relationship with the appellant. She said that the victim had confided in her and told her of her meetings with the appellant. She told Ms Hassan that the appellant had an opportunity to get a unit at a good price and if she could get the deposit he would pay the rest of the money. The house would be in her name and that would be his marriage gift for her. 
     
      
    54 On one occasion Ms Hassan was with the victim when she withdrew money from a Westfield Commonwealth Bank. Apparently she withdrew a large amount of money that her mother had sent to her. She told Ms Hassan that the money would go toward the deposit for the unit the appellant was buying for her. Ms Hassan realised that the victim was withdrawing monies and selling her gold. The victim was short of money and told Ms Hassan that the appellant was going through difficult times because someone borrowed money from him and had not paid it back. She also told Ms Hassan that the appellant had told her that he needed money because his father had died and he needed money for his funeral. A strong attack was made upon Ms Hassan’s credit. She did not agree that she was prepared to lie for the victim or that she had lied in court. 
     
      
    55 After the victim had been picked up by the appellant on 22 February she spoke to Ms Hassan on the telephone. The appellant also spoke with Ms Hassan and invited her to join them. Ms Hassan declined. 
     
      
    56 This was not the first time the appellant had spoken to Ms Hassan. Two weeks previously the appellant had invited Ms Hassan to join him and the victim so that they could engage in sexual activity together. She declined. On the later occasion the appellant renewed the invitation. Ms Hassan insisted she was married and did not want to come. 
     
      
    57 The appellant submitted that it was inconsistent with the appellant having planned to kill the victim that he had invited her friend to join them that evening. This may be so. However, it is likely that the appellant’s intention was not serious. The victim did not believe it was. The appellant knew that Ms Hassan was married. It may also be that he had not formed the intention to kill the victim at that time or that he intended to kill her, but only after the friend had left them.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of planning by the appellant 
       
      
    58 There was evidence which suggested that the appellant had planned to murder the victim in the motel. It was the appellant who suggested that the victim buy some alcohol and gave her the money for it. He waited in the car outside the bottle shop and told her that he did not want the people standing there to see him. He gave her $50 and told her to get something strong so she could enjoy herself. She bought the bottle of Ouzo. 
     
      
    59 When the victim got back into the car the appellant asked her if she was sure she had bought a strong drink, because it appeared to be transparent. He opened the bottle and smelt it and said he was making sure it was strong enough. 
     
      
    60 Once in the motel room the victim said that the appellant encouraged her to drink a large quantity of the Ouzo. Her evidence was that he did not force her but that he did hold the bottle while she drank. She said that he was making her drink “big shots.” She asked the appellant why he was not drinking. He said he was not drinking because he was driving. She said that he told her to drink from the bottle directly and to make sure she took a big sip so it would not hurt her throat. 
     
      
    61 If the victim’s evidence is accepted the inescapable inference is that the appellant wanted to get the victim drunk. The Crown suggested that his purpose was so that she would be less resistant and less able to think clearly during any assault. 
     
      
    62 The victim also gave evidence which indicated that the appellant took steps to ensure that he was not seen entering the motel room. He stopped his car close to the motel and gave an excuse for not wanting to be seen. He told the victim that he would drop her off and go and park the car somewhere not too close. He told her to go inside and book the room. She later telephoned and told him the room number. After he arrived the victim said that the appellant had wanted to know what questions the receptionist asked her when she booked in. He had asked to know exactly what the receptionist had questioned her about.  
     
      
    63 The defence suggested that the appellant’s actions could be explained by him not wishing to be seen out of concern that he was having an extramarital affair. Even if this was the case it does not explain his insistence that the victim consume the Ouzo.  
     
      
       
      The medical evidence 
       
      
    64 Four expert witnesses gave evidence at the trial in relation to the victim’s wounds. Dr Timothy Green treated her when she first arrived at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Dr Stuart Anderson was a police forensic medical officer who examined her wounds on 7 March 2006. Associate Professor John Hilton was called on behalf of the appellant. Associate Professor Hilton is an expert on, inter alia, wounds and blood patterns. Dr Philip Sharp was also called on behalf of the appellant. He is also an expert on wounds. 
     
      
    65 The evidence indicated that the cut to the right wrist was significantly more serious than the injury to the victim’s left wrist. The victim is right handed making it far more likely, if she had cut herself, that the injury to the left wrist would be the more significant injury. 
     
      
    66 There was no dispute that the injury to the victim’s right wrist had the potential to cause her death. It was also agreed that there was no indication of any hesitation wounds and there was a lack of evidence of any defensive wounds. The doctors also discussed the victim’s mental state. 
     
      
    67 Dr Green said that the wounds were of a consistent and even depth throughout. They had no multiple lacerations or jagged features to the edges which may have suggested hesitation when the wounds were made. He explained that it is common when people injure themselves for there to be evidence of an initial attempt, which is hesitant, before a further more definite injury is inflicted. He indicated that the initial wounds tend to have a jagged irregular appearance. Associate Professor Hilton’s evidence was to similar effect. He indicated that it is common to find, although not always, three or four superficial cuts before the ultimate wound is inflicted. 
     
      
    68 Dr Sharp said he could not give a firm opinion but “I tend to think that (the wounds) may have been self-inflicted.” When cross-examined he agreed that hesitation wounds are a common indicator of self-harm. He made no reference to them in his written report.  
     
      
    69 It was agreed that there was no evidence of any defensive wounds to the victim. This suggested that she had not fought off the appellant, which the defence submitted was consistent with her injuries being self-inflicted. However, the victim’s evidence was that immediately prior to the appellant cutting her she believed he was walking towards her to console her. Her evidence was that he was “very fast” and that she did not do anything. She said “I just made myself quiet, I didn’t scream, I didn’t do anything, I made myself like not showing that I’m breathing or anything.” 
     
      
    70 Dr Green was asked about this evidence. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Look, I don’t see any – I don’t see – I can see circumstances where a person by reason of intoxication, in view of cultural or ethnic belief or practice in terms of shock, emotional shock, I guess paralysis by fear that those circumstances may arise where the injuries are delivered in quick succession and the person is unable to protect themselves.” 
        
       
      
    71 Associate Professor Hilton said it was usual when people were attacked that they would try and defend themselves. This would result in defensive wounds. However, when cross-examined he agreed that a person who was not anticipating an attack and was taken by surprise may not defend themselves in a way which would give rise to defensive wounds. 
     
      
    72 Dr Sharp was of the opinion that it would be usual to find defensive wounds in persons capable of defending themselves. The lack of such wounds may be an indication of self-inflicted injuries. However, he agreed that a person might be “frozen by fear” in the face of an attack of the kind suggested by the victim. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I suppose so, I’ve not had any experience of seeing this so I’m trying to answer to the best of my experience. I don’t know the answer to that, I suppose it could be.” 
        
       
       
      Blood and the appellant’s clothing 
       
      
    73 The appellant relied upon the evidence of Associate Professor Hilton who suggested that given the injury to the radial artery there would have been a spurting of blood from the victim’s arm. He accepted that it would have been likely that there would have been at least traces of blood on the clothing of any person who had inflicted the injuries on the victim. 
     
      
    74 The victim’s evidence was that the appellant was only wearing shorts and underwear when he cut her. When the police searched the appellant’s house they seized the clothes they believed he had been wearing the previous evening including a pair of shorts. The shorts were retrieved from the clothesline. There was evidence, which the jury was entitled to accept, that the blood stains could have been washed completely out of the clothing, especially if the stain was fresh. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    75 I have carefully examined the entire record of the trial. I am in no doubt that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of wounding the victim with the intent of killing her. In my opinion none of the arguments raised by the appellant, either alone or collectively, could lead to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge, correctly in my view, informed the jury that the Crown case essentially depended upon the view they formed of the victim’s evidence. If they accepted her evidence on the critical issues a conviction was inevitable. Although there were some issues raised by the appellant which the jury was required to consider, neither alone, or collectively could they raise a reasonable doubt in the face of the victim’s account of the relevant events. 
     
      
    76 I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    77 SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons. 
     
      
    78 HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

          APPLICATION FOR INQUIRY INTO CONVICTION AND SENTENCE 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      DECISION 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Ivan Robert Marko Milat has applied to the court for an order that there be an inquiry into his conviction pursuant to s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900. Mr Milat has previously made two applications under s 474D both of which have been declined by the court. In the first of those applications Barr J considered the detailed submissions lodged by Mr Milat and concluded that for the most part the matters raised in the application had been dealt with at trial and on appeal. In relation to other matters his Honour concluded that he had: 
     
      
       
        
        “No unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand. No doubt or question about the guilt of the applicant arises on the material he relies on.” 
        
       
      
    2 I considered the second application and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing in the material submitted by the applicant in support of his present application which provides a basis for concluding that there is a doubt or question as to his guilt or which otherwise represents a mitigating circumstance that would support the referral of this matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I have no unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand. The material provided by the applicant does not raise a doubt or question about his guilt.” 
        
       
      
    3 Mr Milat has lodged detailed written submissions in support of the present application. Although the application has been framed under s 474D that provision has been repealed. The relevant provisions are now found in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. I shall treat the application as one made pursuant to s 78 of that Act. 
     
      
    4 In his submissions Mr Milat refers to a television program in which Mr Clive Small, a police officer apparently in charge of the investigations of Mr Milat’s crimes, made comments about the matter. Mr Small allegedly said that there was no police evidence to suggest that Mr Milat acted with another person in committing the murders. The Crown prosecutor gave an interview on the same program. He apparently said that it was no part of the Crown case to prove that any person other than Mr Milat was involved in the murders. 
     
      
    5 Mr Milat now complains that the trial judge’s ruling that the Crown did not have to prove whether Mr Milat acted alone or in company was in some respects erroneous. His argument appears to be that because the Crown could not prove whether or not another person or persons was involved its case was flawed and he should not have been convicted. 
     
      
    6 In my opinion this submission is without merit. As I understand the Crown case it only sought to prove that Mr Milat committed the crimes. It was no part of the Crown case that others may have been involved. That case was made good and when I previously reviewed the matter I was satisfied, as was Justice Barr that it was a strong Crown case. It must be remembered that the matter was the subject of appeals including an application to the High Court. 
     
      
    7 Mr Milat also complains that in some manner he was denied procedural fairness during the course of his trial. The matters of which he speaks were the subject of evidence at his trial when an opportunity to place submissions before the jury with respect to them was available. I can see no basis for complaint about those matters. Notwithstanding the previous appeal and applications it has not previously been suggested that the trial was not fair for the reasons now raised.  
     
      
    8 The material provided by the applicant does not raise a doubt or question about his guilt. 
     
      
    9 The application is refused.

     AGOSTON, Peter Gabriel v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Peter Gabriel Agoston applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act against an interlocutory judgment of his Honour Judge Freeman of the District Court, refusing to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings against the applicant for five alleged offences of defrauding the Commonwealth under s 29D (since repealed) of the Crimes Act (Cth) (“the Act” or “the Commonwealth Act”). No certificate within s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act was given by the primary judge and, accordingly, an appeal lies to this Court, only if this Court gives leave to appeal. However, no submission was made on behalf of the Crown that leave to appeal should not be granted.  
     
      
       
      Background to the charges 
       
      
    2 The applicant, who is now 81 years old, practiced for many years as an accountant. It is alleged by the prosecution that between July 1996 and April 2001 the applicant defrauded the Commonwealth by preparing and lodging income tax returns for clients who were individuals or partnerships, which falsely overstated the amount of the expenditure by the individuals or partnerships in the production of a number of Australian films.  
     
      
    3 Between 2000 and 2003 an auditing of the clients’ income tax returns were conducted by the Australian Taxation Office. In June 2006 criminal proceedings were commenced against the applicant by the issuing of court attendance notices and in July 2006 these court attendance notices were served on the applicant. 
     
      
    4 No committal hearing in respect of the charges has yet been held. The question of the applicant’s fitness to be tried for the alleged offences was raised in the Local Court and, in accordance with s 20B(1) in Div 6 of Pt 1B of the Act, the Magistrate referred the proceedings to the District Court.  
     
      
    5 On 7 February 2008 a notice of motion was filed in the District Court on behalf of the applicant, seeking an order that the prosecution of the applicant on the five charges be permanently stayed.  
     
      
       
      The judgment of the primary judge 
       
      
    6 The hearing of the applicant’s application for a permanent stay took place on 18 February 2008 and on that day his Honour gave an immediate judgment. In his judgment his Honour refused the application for a stay but found that the applicant was unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    7 In his judgment his Honour said”- 
     
      
       
        
        “The major grounds of today’s application are the applicant’s alleged unfitness to plead because of cognitive difficulties, together with his age and his physical frailty, together with his history of serious physical conditions and (the) delay between 2003 when the auditing was complete and the filing of the charges in June 2006.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour considered the factor of delay and concluded that, whether by itself or in combination with other factors, it was not material.  
       
      
    8 In his judgment his Honour said that “easily the largest plank upon which the application rests is the allegation that the applicant is himself unfit to plead” (that is, to be tried). His Honour then reviewed some of the medical evidence which has been adduced on the hearing of the application.  
     
      
    9 Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, who had been treating the applicant since 2002, said in a report that an original diagnosis of depression had been overtaken by the development of dementia. This diagnosis was supported by brain scans showing shrinkage of the cerebellum and by neuropsychological testing, which demonstrated a deteriorating cognitive function, consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Nielssen considered that the applicant would be unfit to be tried, in that he would be unable to follow the proceedings in a meaningful way. 
     
      
    10 Dr Batchelor, a neuropsychologist, who had conducted some of the testing of the applicant on which Dr Nielssen had relied, expressed the opinion that the results of testing provided evidence of “specific cognitive deficits that characterised patients with progressive neurological disorder (dementia)”. 
     
      
    11 Dr Pulman, a neuropsychologist, who assessed the applicant on behalf of the Crown, concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The implications of Mr Agoston’s current level of cognitive functioning indicate that he is unlikely to be able to follow legal proceedings in a meaningful way or provide meaningful instructions to his solicitors. He is also unlikely to be able to give consistent evidence on his own behalf or withstand cross-examination on complex matters. Furthermore, as dementia is irreversible and represents a progressive deterioration in cognitive functioning, Mr Agoston is likely to remain unfit for trial.” 
        
       
      
    12 Dr Milder, a neurologist, listed the findings he had made on examination of the applicant and concluded that the findings suggested Alzheimer’s type dementia. 
     
      
    13 Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, expressed the opinion that the applicant was not fit to be tried.  
     
      
    14 Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist retained by the Crown, examined the applicant in August 2007 and concluded that “the issue of fitness at this point in this case is finely balanced”. Dr Allnutt accepted that the applicant was unlikely to be able to properly provide instructions to his legal advisers or follow the course of a trial or give evidence in a trial. Judge Freeman observed in his judgment that in the six months which had elapsed since Dr Allnutt had examined the applicant it was likely that the applicant’s condition had deteriorated.  
     
      
    15 In his judgment the primary judge then proceed to consider whether, if it was accepted that the applicant was unfit to be tried, the application for a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against the applicant should be granted. 
     
      
    16 His Honour noted that counsel for the applicant accepted that a permanent stay of criminal proceedings should be granted only in an exceptional case. However, his Honour recorded, it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that “a combination of his client’s unfitness to plead, if it be accepted, and those other matters (to) which I have referred, frailty, prostate cancer, twice the subject of operative intervention and so on” was sufficient to make the applicant’s case an exceptional case. The primary judge rejected this submission by counsel for the applicant. In rejecting the submission his Honour referred to the cases of Subramaniam v The Queen (2004) 211 ALR 1 (High Court of Australia); R v WRC (2003) 59 NSWLR 273 (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal); and R v Sexton (2000) 77 SASR 405 (South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal). 
     
      
    17 In his judgment the primary judge said that in Subramaniam it had been held that “where an alternative exists, namely the special proceedings which are available when someone is found unfit to plead, then the legislative intent, which is that those proposed procedures be followed, rather than the process be stayed, should be given effect (to)”. The “alternative” procedures his Honour was referring to were those stated in the provisions of Pt 1B Div 6 of the Act.  
     
      
    18 The primary judge quoted part of par (20) of the judgment of the High Court in Subramaniam, where the Court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “One important purpose of the Act is an ameliorative one, to give a person unfit to be tried in an orthodox way, an opportunity of being acquitted in a special hearing so that any possibility of legal proceedings against the accused of any kind may be brought to an end. It is also no doubt another purpose of the Act that a special hearing actually take place, and that victims be afforded an opportunity to see that a form of justice, as necessarily imperfect as it may be in the circumstances, has been done.” 
        
       
      
    19 The “Act” referred to in this paragraph of the judgment of the High Court in Subramaniam was, not the Commonwealth Act, but the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act (NSW) and “the procedures” referred to were the procedures, not in the Commonwealth Act, but in the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act (NSW) (which I will refer to as “the State Act”). 
     
      
    20 Nevertheless, notwithstanding that the High Court was referring to a different Act, his Honour considered that what had been said by the High Court in par 28 of its judgment in Subramaniam could be applied to the present case, there being no difference in principle. In support of this view, his Honour cited Sexton. In accordance with par 28 of the judgment of the High Court in Subramaniam, the applicant should be given the opportunity of having the criminal proceedings against him terminated in his favour and, although there was no personal victim of the applicant’s alleged offences, the community at large should be given the opportunity of seeing that a form of justice had been done. His Honour concluded that it would not be appropriate to grant a stay of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.  
     
      
    21 In his judgment his Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Granting this applicant a stay of proceedings would be the equivalent of granting him a certificate of immunity from prosecution, which I should not do where there exists a process whereby he may be cleared of the allegations or at least where the outcome of the community’s will can be advanced by seeing the evidence against him arrayed in open court, although, admittedly, in an incomplete and imperfect way. This persuades me that it would be inappropriate to grant a stay. It is not outside common humanity to require that the proceedings against him continue.” 
        
       
      
    22 Towards the end of his judgment the primary judge returned to the question of the applicant’s fitness to be tried. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I should say one thing more since it is relevant to a consideration of his fitness. The consensus of opinion is that a long trial, with the requirement that he receive, consider and give instructions on detailed evidence spanning some weeks would be outside his capacity to cope. I have not been given an estimate of the trial, but its dimensions – or the dimensions of the brief are such as to make me think that it would in fact last for a number of weeks. 
        
       
       
        
        The substance of allegations can be stated, I think fairly succinctly. It is said, as I understand it, that Mr Agoston recruited some clients of his long standing accounting practice into a scheme whereby they claimed deductions for greater than the amounts which they actually invested in the making of the films… Thus in round figures, fifteen or so of them, including Mr Agoston himself, put up about $600,000. There then ensued a round robin whereby company A drew a cheque for about $800,000 in one case and after it had passed through other accounts the same amount was deposited back into that company account. Of this entire notional sum each contributor was gifted or loaned, depending on the instant scheme, an amount so that that sum together with their actual contribution could be claimed as expenditure on the film. That is very straightforward, but the relationship between this applicant and Mr Hay, who produced and directed the films and certified the expenditure, would require, I daresay, some detailed exploration. I am not dissuaded, or rather I am persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that this applicant lacks the understanding or would lack the capacity to receive that information, to process it as that evidence is given against him, to instruct those who represent him to delve into those dealings to unpick the evidence given about what advice was on hand and precisely what steps were taken and so on in these events now between six and ten years ago. Therefore, whilst I refuse the application for a stay I find myself satisfied that the applicant is unfit to plead.” 
        
       
       
      Commonwealth Crimes Act Pt 1B Div 6 
       
      
    23 To fully comprehend the primary judge’s judgment and some of the submissions made on this application, it is necessary to set out a number of the provisions of Div 6 of Pt 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which is headed “unfitness to be tried”.  
     
      
       
        
        Division 6—Unfitness to be tried 
         
        20B Consequences of preliminary finding that person unfit to be tried 
          
         
         
        (1) Where, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences, the question of the person’s fitness to be tried in respect of the offence, is raised by the prosecution, the person or the person’s legal representative, the magistrate must refer the proceedings to the court to which the proceedings would have been referred had the person been committed for trial. 
         
         
        ………………….. 
         
         
        (3) Where a court:  
         
          
          (a) to which proceedings have been referred under subsection (1);  
          
         
         
        …………………. 
         
         
        finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence concerned. 
         
         
        …………………. 
         
         
        (6) For the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie case is established if there is evidence that would (except for the circumstances by reason of which the person is unfit to be tried) provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence. 
         
        (7) In proceedings to determine whether, for the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie case has been established:  
         
          
          (a) the person may give evidence or make an unsworn statement; and 
           
          (b) the person may raise any defence that could properly be raised if the proceedings were a trial for that offence; and 
           
          (c) the court may seek such other evidence, whether oral or in writing, as it considers likely to assist in determining the matter. 
          
         
         
        20BA Upon determining prima facie case, court to dismiss charge or to determine fitness within 12 months 
          
         
         
        (1) Where the court determines that there has not been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge against the person and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody. 
         
        (2) Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence, but the court is of the opinion, having regard to:  
         
          
          (a) the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person; or 
           
          (b) the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or 
           
          (c) the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances; 
          
         
        that it is inappropriate to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody. 
         
         
        ………………… 
         
         
        (4) Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence, but the court does not dismiss the charge under subsection (2), the court must, as soon as practicable after making that first-mentioned determination, determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, the person will become fit to be tried, within the period of 12 months after the day the person was found to be unfit to be tried.” 
        
       
      
    24 Section 20BC contains various provisions which apply if a person is found by a court to be likely to be fit to be tried within 12 months.  
     
      
       
        
        20BC Persons found by a court not to be likely to be fit within 12 months 
          
         
         
        (1) Where a court determines, under section 20BA, that a person who was found unfit to be tried will not become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding, the court must, at the time of making that determination, also determine:  
         
          
          (a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital; and 
           
          (b) if so—whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital. 
          
         
         
        (2) Where a court has made a determination under subsection (1), the court must:  
         
          
          (a) if the court has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person does not object to being detained in a hospital—order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or continue to be detained in a hospital, as the case requires; or 
           
          (b) otherwise—order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital, including a prison; 
           
          for a period specified in the order, not exceeding the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed if the person had been convicted of the offence charged. 
          
         
         
        ………………….. 
         
         
        (5) Despite subsection (2), the court may, if in the court’s opinion it is more appropriate to do so than to make an order under subsection (2), order the person’s release from custody either absolutely or subject to conditions to apply for such period as the court specifies in the order, not exceeding 3 years.” 
        
       
       
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act Pt 2 
       
      
    25 To fully comprehend the primary judge’s judgment and some of the submissions made on this application, it is also necessary to refer to a number of the provisions in Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, that is the State Act.  
     
      
    26 Under s 10 of the State Act if a court determines that an inquiry should be conducted or the question of a person’s fitness to be tried for an offence is raised, the court must conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence charged.  
     
      
    27 Under s 11 of the State Act, as in force from 1 January 2006, the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by a judge alone. Previously, under the former s 11 and s 11A of the State Act, the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried was to be determined by a jury, unless the person elected to have the question tried by a judge alone.  
     
      
    28 Under s 14 of the State Act if, following an inquiry, an accused person is found unfit to be tried for an offence, the criminal proceedings against the accused person are not to be continued and the accused person is to be referred to the Mental Health Tribunal.  
     
      
    29 Under s 16 of the State Act, if a person has been referred to the Tribunal, the Tribunal must determine whether the person will during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness become fit to be tried for the offence. The Tribunal must notify the court which referred the person of its determination.  
     
      
    30 Section 19 of the State Act provides in part as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3) …. that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court:  
         
         
          
          (a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and 
           
          (b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken. 
          
         
         
        (2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.” 
        
       
      
    31 Section 21 of the State Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “21 Nature and conduct of special hearing 
         
         
        (1) Except as provided by this Act, a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings. 
         
        (2) At a special hearing, the accused person must, unless the Court otherwise allows, be represented by an Australian legal practitioner and the fact that the person has been found unfit to be tried for an offence is to be presumed not to be an impediment to the person’s representation. 
         
        (3) At a special hearing:  
         
          
          (a) the accused person is to be taken to have pleaded not guilty in respect of the offence charged, and 
           
          (b) the Australian legal practitioner, if any, who represents the accused person may exercise the rights of the person to challenge jurors or the jury, and 
           
          (c) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person may raise any defence that could be properly raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings, and 
           
          (d) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person is entitled to give evidence. 
          
         
        (4) At the commencement of a special hearing for which a jury has been constituted, the Court must explain to the jury the fact that the accused person is unfit to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, the meaning of unfitness to be tried, the purpose of the special hearing, the verdicts which are available and the legal and practical consequences of those verdicts.” 
        
       
      
    32 Under s 21A, as in force from 1 January 2006, at a special hearing the question of whether an accused person has committed the offence is to be determined by a judge alone at the special hearing, unless an election to have the special hearing held with a jury is made. Previously, under the former s 21 and s 21A of the State Act, a special hearing was held with a jury, unless the accused person elected to have a special hearing by a judge alone.  
     
      
    33 Section 22(1) of the State Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The verdicts available to the jury or the Court at a special hearing include the following:  
         
          
          (a) not guilty of the offence charged, 
           
          (b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness, 
           
          (c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged, 
           
          (d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 Section 23(1) of the State Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court:  
         
          
          (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 
           
          (b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as  
          a limiting term 
          , in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Cases 
       
      
    35 In the primary judge’s judgment and in the submissions of both counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown references were made to the cases of Subramaniam, WRC and Sexton.  
     
      
    36 In Subramaniam the appellant had been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice. After a first trial, in which the jury had been unable to agree, the appellant’s mental health deteriorated. A judge made a determination that an inquiry be conducted (s 10 of the State Act). At the inquiry the appellant was found unfit to be tried and was referred to the Mental Health Tribunal (s 14 of the State Act). The Tribunal determined that the appellant would not during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness become fit to be tried for the offence (s 16 of the State Act). A special hearing was directed to be held (s 19 of the State Act). At the special hearing an application was made on behalf of the appellant for a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against her. This application was refused. The special hearing continued and at the conclusion of the special hearing the jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count and a verdict of not guilty on the other count (s 22 of the State Act).  
     
      
    37 An appeal was brought to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the refusal of a stay and against the conviction. Both appeals were dismissed.  
     
      
    38 On a further appeal to the High Court the appeal against the refusal of a stay was dismissed but the appeal against conviction was allowed, on the ground that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury at the special hearing in accordance with s 21(4) of the State Act. 
     
      
    39 Of importance to the present application is what the High Court said regarding the appeal against the refusal of a stay. The High Court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] 
          
        The principles governing stays 
        : The principles relating to the grant of a stay are not disputed. The appellant does not in this court, nor has she previously, complained of unreasonable delay in the prosecution of her case. She relies solely on the fact of her deteriorating mental health, that it relevantly adversely affected her in two particular respects. First, it is submitted that her mental health prevented her from being able to give reliable testimony. Secondly, further prosecution of the proceedings could have resulted in a serious worsening of her current mental health. We observe at this point that no fresh evidence was sought to be tendered in the Court of Criminal Appeal to establish that the trial had in fact significantly worsened the appellant’s condition. 
         
         
        [25] 
          
        In  
        Jago v District Court (NSW) 
         Brennan J cautioned against too ready a disposition to grant stays: The reasons for granting stay orders, which are as good as certificates of immunity, would be difficult of explanation for they would be largely discretionary. If permanent stay orders were to become commonplace, it would not be long before courts would forfeit public confidence. The granting of orders for permanent stays would inspire cynicism, if not suspicion, in the public mind. 
         
         
        [26] 
          
        It may now also be accepted however that the categories of factual situations which may call for a consideration of the possibility of abuse of process in criminal proceedings are not closed. As Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said in  
        Walton v Gardiner 
        , the inherent power of a superior court to stay proceedings on the ground of “abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness”. 
         
         
        [27] 
          
        Fairness or unfairness has been said to defy “analytical definition” and to “involve an undesirably, but unavoidably, large content of essentially intuitive judgment”. Deane J in  
        Jago  
        posed some examples of unfairness: default or impropriety on the part of the prosecution in pre-trial procedures, or the concealment of evidence from an accused person that may have assisted his or her defence. Others may include conviction on evidence truly not probative; compulsion upon an accused to incriminate himself or herself; the exaction of involuntary confessions or admissions; failure to hold committal proceedings; the absence of legal representation of an indigent person facing serious criminal proceedings; and, unreasonable delay. 
         
         
        [28] 
          
        Stays in the context of the Act 
        : One important purpose of the Act is an ameliorative one, to give a person unfit to be tried in an orthodox way, an opportunity of being acquitted in a special hearing so that any possibility of legal proceedings against the accused of any kind may be brought to an end. It is also no doubt another purpose of the Act that a special hearing actually take place, and that victims be afforded an opportunity to see that a form of justice, as necessarily imperfect as it may be in the circumstances, has been done. This purpose is secured not only by the holding of the special hearing, but also, in an appropriate case, by the pronouncement of a “limiting term” of imprisonment that would have to be served if the person had been tried in the normal way. It is self-evident that a special hearing in which an accused is disabled from instructing his or her lawyers or in other ways from full participation in the proceedings, will have its deficiencies. But no system of justice is perfect. Neither the deficiencies of a special hearing under the Act, nor the other matter which was referred to in submissions, that the Act reposes expansive and wide discretions in the state Attorney-General, provides reason to construe and apply the Act otherwise than according to its tenor. 
         
         
        [29] 
          
        No error has been shown 
        : The main difficulty for the appellant is that the Act assumes as the basis for its application to her, the very matter upon which she would seek to rely to escape its application, her current mental infirmity and all that it involves. 
         
         
        [30] 
          
        The appellant relied not only upon her current mental condition, but also upon the potential for its exacerbation by reason of the special hearing. This, it was said, would be so oppressive to her as to justify a permanent stay. 
         
         
        [31] 
          
        A relevant test that has been applied and which we would adopt, is whether, in light of the appellant’s deteriorating condition, it “would be out of accord with common humanity” to have allowed the matter, which was, it must be emphasized, a special hearing, to proceed.”  
        
       
      
    40 The High Court then considered the evidence in Subramaniam and concluded that it had not been shown that the trial judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion in refusing a stay. 
     
      
    41 In par 35 of its judgment the High Court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The ground of appeal relating to the stay should therefore be rejected. This is not to say that notwithstanding the manifest purposes of the Act, there may not still be cases of mental infirmity calling for the grant of a stay even of the special hearing for which it provides, although instances of them are likely to be rare. This is so for two reasons: the Act does not, expressly or by implication, forbid their application; and, common humanity would argue in favour of a stay if the risk were a real one, and the likely exacerbation grave.” 
        
       
      
    42 In WRC the Crown appealed pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act against an order by a District Court judge that the criminal proceedings against the respondent be permanently stayed. The principal judgment in WRC was given by Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed.  
     
      
    43 In his judgment the Chief Justice referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hakim (1989) 41 A Crim R 372, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Crown against a decision by Lee J ordering a permanent stay of criminal proceedings on the grounds of the accused person’s long history of ischemic heart disease. The test which Lee J applied, which was affirmed by the Court of Criminal appeal in Hakim, was that in the light of Hakim’s medical condition it would “offend common humanity” to allow the charges to proceed.  
     
      
    44 In pars 55-60 of his judgment the Chief Justice said:- 
     
      
       
        
        [55] 
          
        A permanent stay of criminal proceedings is a wholly exceptional intervention into the processes of the criminal law. The public interest in ensuring that persons charged with crimes are tried is entitled to significant weight in the necessary balancing process. (See, for example,  
        Jago 
         (at 30 and 49–50).) Because of this, as Mason CJ said in  
        Jago 
         (at 34): “a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case …”. 
         
         
        [56] 
          
        Woods DCJ purported to apply a test of “exceptional circumstances”. However, his Honour did not in my opinion, give proper consideration and weight to the existence of a system for determining the matters upon which he primarily relied to reach his conclusion. In Pt 2 of the Act, the Parliament has indicated that, in accordance with the normal procedures for trial of serious offences, issues of this character should usually be determined by a jury. His Honour arrogated to a judge the very function which the Parliament has indicated should be performed by a jury, as representative of the community. 
         
         
        [57] 
          
        It is not entirely clear what weight his Honour gave to the kinds of medical considerations that determined the outcome in  
        R v Hakim 
        . His Honour did say that the case before him was similar to  
        R v Hakim 
        , however, at the time that he expressed his relevant finding, he did so in the terms quoted above, that is, “the combined effect of his various illnesses impact severely on his capacity to defend himself in a trial”. This conclusion, in large measure, if not exclusively, is concerned with matters that would arise in a fitness hearing in accordance with the well established approach to deciding that issue in Australia. (See  
        R v Presser 
         [1958] VR 45 esp at 48;  
        Kesavarajah v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 230 esp at 244;  
        Eastman v The Queen 
         (2000) 203 CLR 1 esp at 21 [59]–[64]; 98 [294], 109 [332];  
        R v Mailes 
         (at [112]–[181]). Indeed the psychiatric reports of Dr Lucire and Dr Westmore, upon which his Honour relied, applied what the authors described as “the  
        Presser 
         criteria”. 
         
         
        [58] 
          
        His Honour's approach to the alternative under Pt 2 was to assert, without elaboration of reasons: “this is not a case where it is necessary or appropriate to have reference to the special trial procedure to the exclusion of the remedy [of a permanent stay]”. 
         
         
        [59] 
          
        In this reasoning, his Honour failed to give weight to the existence of an alternative mechanism, to be determined by a jury, for deciding the very matters upon which his Honour primarily relied to reach his conclusion that this was one of those exceptional cases in which a permanent stay was appropriate. Where, as here, a specific statutory procedure with a different decision-maker, is laid down for the determination of the matter primarily relied upon for purposes of a permanent stay, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which it would be appropriate to find that the continuation of proceedings, which will involve the determination of that question by that procedure, should at that point be stayed, on the basis that any further proceedings would constitute an abuse of process. The Court should permit the special procedure to operate in accordance with its terms, unless there is some overwhelming reason for not allowing that to happen. There was no evidence of that character before his Honour. The medical evidence was not of that character.  
         
         
        [60] 
          
        His Honour purported to exercise a general unfettered discretion to decide whether a stay should be granted. However, with respect to the matters on which his Honour primarily relied, the discretion was not entirely unfettered because significant weight had to be given to the fact that a mechanism to resolve that issue was available. His Honour did not give that consideration appropriate weight and the discretion miscarried. This Court should re-exercise the discretion.” 
        
       
      
    45 The Chief Justice concluded that a permanent stay should not have been ordered. The continuation of the proceedings would not be an abuse of process and would not be “an affront to common humanity”.  
     
      
    46 In Sexton an accused person Sexton had been charged with a Commonwealth offence under the Customs Act. Sexton applied for a stay on the grounds of his ill health.  
     
      
    47 Two questions were reserved for the consideration of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal. The first of these questions was whether the application was to be determined in accordance with Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act. This question was answered “No” by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act sets out the consequences of a finding that a person is unfit to be tried but does not prescribe the procedure for determining that question and contains nothing to abrogate the inherent jurisdiction of a court to grant a permanent stay of proceedings for an offence against Commonwealth law.  
     
      
    48 There were four grounds of appeal against the refusal of the primary judge to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings against the applicant. These grounds of appeal were: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant, by determining that the existence of Part 1B Division 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required that the application for the permanent stay be refused. 
       
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in that his Honour placed undue weight upon the existence of Part 1B Division 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
       
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the existence of the medical condition of the applicant, the applicant’s age, the complexity of the charges brought against the applicant and the delay in the bringing of those charges. 
       
       
      Ground 4: The evidence before his Honour demonstrated that the applicant’s case was an exceptional case justifying the grant of a permanent stay of proceedings.  
       
      
    49 In counsel for the applicant’s written submissions grounds 1 and 2 were dealt with together and grounds 3 and 4 were dealt with together and it is convenient to adopt this method of dealing with the various grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant, by determining that the existence of Part 1B Division 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required that the application for the permanent stay be refused. 
       
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in that his Honour placed undue weight upon the existence of Part 1B Division 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
       
      
    50 It was accepted by counsel for the applicant that the existence of Pt 1B Div 6 of the Act was a relevant matter to take into account in the exercise of the primary judge’s discretion whether to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings. However, it was submitted that the primary judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion by regarding the existence of Pt 1B Div 6 as requiring an exercise of his discretion so as to refuse a stay, without taking into account other matters which should have been regarded as relevant to the exercise of the discretion or by giving excessive weight to the existence of Pt 1B Div 6, as compared with the weight given to other relevant matters. 
     
      
    51 In support of these submissions counsel for the applicant pointed particularly to two parts of the primary judge’s judgment to which I have already referred earlier in this judgment, namely:- 
     
      
    1. The part of his Honour’s judgment where his Honour said that in Subramaniam the High Court held “where an alternative exists, namely the special proceedings which are available when someone is found unfit to plead, then the legislative intent which is that those proceedings be followed rather than the process be stayed, should be given effect (to)”. 
     
      
    2. The part of his Honour’s judgment where his Honour said that he should not grant a stay, which would be equivalent to granting a certificate of immunity for the applicant, “where there exists a process whereby he may be cleared of the allegations or at least … the outcome of the community’s will can be advanced by seeing the evidence against him arrayed in open court, although, admittedly in an incomplete and imperfect way”. 
     
      
    52 With regard to Subramaniam, it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the relevant legislation in that case was Pt 2 of the State Act, that there were a number of differences between the statutory scheme in Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act and the statutory scheme in Pt 2 of the State Act and these differences were such as to render the reasoning of the High Court in Subramaniam inapplicable, or at least less applicable, in the present case. Even in Subramaniam the High Court in par 35 of its judgment had accepted that there might still be cases of mental infirmity where the granting of a stay would be required.  
     
      
    53 With regard to WRC, counsel for the applicant pointed out that in that case also the relevant legislation was Pt 2 of the State Act and counsel repeated the submission that there were a number of differences between Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act and Pt 2 of the State Act. Under Pt 2 of the State Act, as it then stood, a special hearing was to be held with a jury, unless the accused person made an election that the special hearing be by a judge alone. It was submitted that in pars 56 to 60 of his judgment in WRC and particularly pars 56 and 59 the Chief Justice had stressed that, not only was there a special set of procedures in Pt 2 of the State Act, there was provision for a different decision-maker from a judge, in that, unless there was an election, a special hearing was to be held with a jury. In granting a stay the primary judge in WRC had “arrogated to a judge” the very function which Parliament had indicated should be performed by a jury. Under the scheme in Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act, on the other hand, all decisions are to be made by a judge. 
     
      
    54 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the primary judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion by not taking into account, or by giving insufficient weight to, various matters which would make it “unfair” to the applicant for the criminal proceedings against him to continue, including his medical condition both mental and physical, the complexity of the prosecution case and the delay which had occurred. 
     
      
    55 It was disputed by counsel for the Crown that the primary judge had regarded the existence of Pt 1B Div 6 as of itself requiring the refusal of the application for a stay or that the primary judge had given excessive weight to the existence of Pt 1B Div 6. The primary judge, it was submitted, had recognised that he had a discretion and had referred in his judgment to other matters apart from the existence of Pt 1B Div 6.  
     
      
    56 It was submitted by counsel for the Crown that, while there were admittedly differences between the statutory schemes under the Commonwealth Act and the State Act, the latter being the scheme considered in both Subramaniam and WRC, the two schemes were broadly similar and the same general argument against the granting of a stay was available, that the applicant in his application for a stay was relying on the very matter, namely the applicant’s mental infirmity, which brought into operation the special statutory provisions applying where a person by reason of mental infirmity is unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    57 With regard to WRC, it was submitted by the Crown that, on a fair reading of the Chief Justice’s judgment, the important consideration for the Chief Justice was the existence of “an alternative mechanism” (“a specific statutory procedure”), rather than that at some stage in that alternative mechanism there would be a different decision-maker from a judge.  
     
      
    58 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the primary judge had taken into account all of the matters sought to be relied on by counsel for the applicant as making a continuation of the criminal proceedings unfair to the applicant.  
     
      
    59 Counsel for the Crown relied on the general principles governing applications for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings as set out in Subramaniam. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    60 I do not consider that I should find that the primary judge regarded the existence of Pt 1B Div 6 as of itself requiring an exercise of his discretion so as to refuse a stay, without any need to take into account other matters which should have been regarded as relevant to the exercise of his discretion. 
     
      
    61 Early in his judgment the primary judge stated the major grounds of the application as being the applicant’s unfitness to be tried, his age, his physical frailty, his history of serious physical medical conditions and the delay which had occurred particularly between the completion of the auditing by the Australian Taxation Office and the commencement of the criminal proceedings. Later in his judgment the primary judge referred to counsel for the applicant’s argument that the combination of unfitness to be tried and “those other matters which I have referred (to), such as physical ill health”, was such that the granting of a stay was required “to ensure fairness”.  
     
      
    62 The primary judge, adopting the test first stated by Lee J in Hakim, concluded that it was “not outside common humanity” to require that the criminal proceedings against the applicant continue. It would have been irrelevant for his Honour to apply such a test, if the only matter his Honour was taking into account was the existence of Pt 1B Div 6.  
     
      
    63 Nor do I consider that his Honour erred in placing excessive weight on the existence of Pt 1B Div 6. It will not often be the case that an exercise of a discretion by a primary judge can be successfully challenged on appeal, on the basis that the primary judge gave excessive weight to a matter which is conceded to have been relevant. In any event, it could not be disputed in the present case that “the largest plank” on which the application for a stay rested was that the applicant was unfit to be tried.  
     
      
    64 There are, undoubtedly, differences between the statutory scheme in Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act and Pt 2 of the State Act, particularly as it stood when WRC and Subramaniam were decided.  
     
      
    65 Some of the differences between the Commonwealth Act and the State Act render less applicable to the present case some of the reasoning in the judgment of the High Court in Subramaniam on which the primary judge relied. 
     
      
    66 So far as the accused person is concerned, under the State Act a person found to be unfit to be tried is given the opportunity of being acquitted at a special hearing, which is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial and at which the accused person is entitled to be acquitted unless his guilt is proved to the criminal standard of proof. On the other hand, under the Commonwealth Act a court merely determines whether there is a prima facie case against an accused person who has been found unfit to be tried, that is whether there is evidence that would provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial. It is only if the court determines that a prima facie case has not been established that the charge against the accused person can be dismissed.  
     
      
    67 So far as victims are concerned, even accepting that in the present case it is appropriate to regard members of the public generally as victims of the applicant’s alleged offences, the opportunity given to the victims to see that a form of justice has been done is a lesser opportunity under the Commonwealth Act. Under the Commonwealth Act there is no special hearing approximating to a trial and the period for which a person may be ordered to be detained is less analogous to a sentence than is a limiting term under the State Act. 
     
      
    68 However, although such differences between the two statutory schemes render less applicable to the present case reasoning of the kind contained in par 28 of the judgment in Subramaniam, they do not prevent that reasoning having some application and, in my opinion, the primary judge was entitled to have some regard to such reasoning. 
     
      
    69 Likewise, some of the differences between the Commonwealth Act and the State Act, particularly as it stood at the time of WRC, render less applicable, but do not entirely exclude, some of the reasoning in pars 56 to 60 of the Chief Justice’s judgment in WRC.  
     
      
    70 In my opinion, the Chief Justice in these parts of his judgment relied both on the existence of “an alternative mechanism” or “special procedure” and on the fact that under that mechanism or procedure a special hearing would, unless there was an election by an accused person, be held before a jury, that is a different decision-maker from a judge. I would not accept the Crown’s submission that the fact of a different decision maker was merely “a side issue”. Under the Commonwealth Act all decisions, including whether a prima facie case has been established, are made by a court, that is a judge. Accordingly, the second matter on which the Chief Justice relied in WRC is not present in the instant case. However, the first matter, the existence of a special statutory set of procedures, is present and an argument that the very matter on which the applicant principally relies in his application for a stay, that is the applicant’s mental unfitness, is the same matter as makes applicable Pt 1B Div 6 of the Commonwealth Act, is still available to the Crown. 
     
      
    71 I would reject the first two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in declining to grant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the existence of the medical condition of the applicant, the applicant’s age, the complexity of the charges brought against the applicant and the delay in the bringing of those charges. 
       
       
      Ground 4: The evidence before his Honour demonstrated that the applicant’s case was an exceptional case justifying the grant of a permanent stay of proceedings.  
       
      
    72 All of the matters referred to in the third ground of appeal were expressly referred to in the primary judge’s judgment and, I would infer, were taken into account by his Honour. His Honour, as I have already indicated, examined the expert psychiatric and psychological evidence about the applicant at some length. His Honour referred in two parts of his judgment to the physical ill health of the applicant. There was no occasion for his Honour to discuss any medical evidence about the applicant’s physical ill health, because there was no such evidence, apart from incidental evidence in the reports of the psychiatrists or psychologists. In his judgment the primary judge referred to the applicant’s age. In the judgment the primary judge considered the alleged delay at some length and concluded that such delay as had occurred, either alone or in combination with other matters did not require “any real consideration as part of the overall circumstances”.  
     
      
    73 I have already quoted the part of the primary judge’s judgment in which his Honour considered the alleged complexity of the proceedings. Counsel for the applicant referred in his submissions to correspondence between the solicitors for the applicant and the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking further particulars or clarification of the charges. If there is any remaining lack of particularity or clarity in the charges, it can be pursued by the solicitors for the applicant.  
     
      
    74 In my opinion, his Honour did not err in holding that the present case was not such an exceptional case as to require or warrant granting a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.  
     
      
    75 I would reject the third and fourth grounds of appeal and, as I have now rejected all of the grounds of appeal, I would, although granting leave to appeal, dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    76 HOEBEN J: I agree with James J and the order which he proposes. 
     
      
    77 HALL J: I agree with James J.

      Nature of the Case 
       
      
    4 This is a combined hearing of four appeals relating to verdicts and orders made by his Honour Judge Peter Johnstone in the District Court on 14 May 2007. Because different parties play different roles in these various appeals, I will refer to the parties by name rather than by their role in the proceedings.  
     
      
       
      The Decision Below 
       
      
    5 The plaintiff in the court below, Mr Gregory Cook, was a linesman employed by NorthPower. Country Energy was formerly known as NorthPower, and I will refer to it by its former name. On 28 December 2000 Mr Cook was very seriously injured through receiving an electric shock from a power line. 
     
      
    6 ACQ Pty Limited (“ACQ”) owned a particular light aircraft. That aircraft was operated by Aircair Moree Pty Ltd (“Aircair”).  
     
      
    7 In the very early morning of 28 December 2000 that aircraft was being used to carry out aerial spraying of a cotton field. The cotton field had a power line passing over it. At its lowest point the line was about 6.2m above the ground. The pilot of the aircraft, a Mr Stubbs, was an employee of Aircair. He carried out the spraying by flying underneath this power line.  
     
      
    8 On the tenth spraying run of the day the aircraft was flown underneath the line, but at a height insufficient to avoid colliding with it. The collision sheared off the top 150mm of the tailfin of the aircraft, and caused the line to be dislodged from one of its supporting poles. That in turn caused the line to drop. The trial judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “It remained suspended, swinging over the field, but at a height that at the point of Mr Cook’s accident was then only 1.5m above the ground, at about throat level.” 
        
       
      
    9 NorthPower was notified of the incident. It sent Mr Cook and another linesman, Mr Buddee, to deal with the situation. They decided to isolate the line by de-energising it from the nearest links site, which was some 7kms further up the line. Mr Buddee drove towards the links site. Mr Cook then approached the line with a view to assessing what damage had been occasioned to the line and the supporting pole, to determine what repair work might be required. Some minutes later he received an electric shock from the line. The trial judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied that Mr Cook never actually came into contact with the conductor as the evidence is that if he had done so, that would probably have resulted in his death. More probably than not, what occurred was a phenomenon known as ‘flashover’, whereby electricity passed across a charged ionised field, or corona effect, around the live conductor. Some part of Mr Cook’s body must have penetrated this ionised electric field resulting in electricity crossing the air gap to his body, and then to the ground. Such a flashover had an increased propensity to occur in conditions of humidity such as prevailed at this site, where the cotton crop and surrounding grain grasses were saturated. Mr Cook had travelled across the muddy field over wet cotton bushes to reach the point where he was injured.” 
        
       
      
    10 The trial judge found that Mr Cook’s injuries were caused by negligence on the part of NorthPower, and also by negligence on the part of Mr Stubbs. Mr Stubbs was not sued, but Aircair was sued on the basis that it was vicariously liable for his negligence.  
     
      
    11 Mr Cook also sued Aircair and ACQ on a statutory cause of action arising under the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999 (Cth) (“DAA”). It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        10 Liability for injury, loss etc. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) This section applies if a person or property on, in or under land or water suffers personal injury, loss of life, material loss, damage or destruction caused by: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) an impact with an aircraft that is in flight, or that was in flight immediately before the impact happened; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) an impact with part of an aircraft that was damaged or destroyed while in flight; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) an impact with a person, animal or thing that dropped or fell from an aircraft in flight; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (d) something that is a result of an impact of a kind mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) If this section applies, the following people are jointly and severally liable in respect of the injury, loss, damage or destruction: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) the operator of the aircraft immediately before the impact happened; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) the owner of the aircraft immediately before the impact happened; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        11 Recovery of damages without proof of intention, negligence etc. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Damages in respect of an injury, loss, damage or destruction of the kind to which section 10 applies are recoverable in an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in Australian territory against all or any of the persons who are jointly and severally liable under that section in respect of the injury, loss, damage or destruction without proof of intention, negligence or other cause of action, as if the injury, loss, damage or destruction had been caused by the willful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The trial judge held that the circumstances in which Mr Cook was injured fell within the ambit of section 10 DAA and that both ACQ and Aircair were liable to pay damages to Mr Cook pursuant to section 11 DAA.  
     
      
    13 ACQ and Aircair raised a defence of voluntary assumption of risk. The trial judge rejected that defence, on the facts. There was thus no need for the judge to decide whether voluntary assumption of risk was available, as a matter of law, as a defence to an action for damages under section 11 DAA. 
     
      
    14 The trial judge held that a defence of contributory negligence was not available to Aircair and ACQ concerning their liability under DAA. In that circumstance, he evidently took the view that there was no point in assessing the extent to which the damages that Mr Cook could recover from Aircair for negligence would be reduced on account of Mr Cook’s contributory negligence, as the judge did not make any such assessment. 
     
      
    15 The trial judge held that, as between Mr Cook and NorthPower, Mr Cook had engaged in contributory negligence, such that the damages Mr Cook could recover from NorthPower should be reduced by 40%. 
     
      
    16 Aircair and ACQ each sought indemnity or contribution from NorthPower under section 5(1)(c) Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (the “1946 Act”). NorthPower also sought contribution, on that basis, from Aircair and ACQ. The trial judge held that contribution under the 1946 Act was recoverable only by one tortfeasor against another tortfeasor, that the liability of Aircair and ACQ under the DAA was not a liability as a tortfeasor, and hence Aircair and ACQ could not recover contribution from NorthPower towards their liability to pay damages under the DAA. However, because Aircair was a tortfeasor who had caused Mr Cook’s damage, NorthPower could recover contribution from it. The trial judge evidently took this view even though Aircair’s liability as a tortfeasor was not the liability in relation to which the judge entered a verdict against Aircair. The judge assessed the amount of that contribution at 50%.  
     
      
    17 The damages recoverable against NorthPower were assessed in accordance with section 151G Workers Compensation Act 1987 at $433,860.00. That sum was to be reduced by 40% for contributory negligence.  
     
      
    18 Damages against Aircair and ACQ were assessed in accordance with the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) rather than in accordance with the common law. On that basis of assessment the trial judge arrived at a figure of $953,141.  
     
      
    19 The trial judge delivered reasons for judgment on 20 April 2007, in which he expressed his conclusions and gave his reasons concerning all the topics I have mentioned so far. However, he did not enter verdicts on that occasion. This was because he recognised the possibility that adjustments may need to be made to the assessments of damages by reason of section 151Z Workers Compensation Act. He therefore said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the findings I have made, it is in my view appropriate that the parties be given the opportunity to either reach agreement on the adjustments, and the verdicts to be entered as a consequence, or to make further submissions as to the proper application of the section.” 
        
       
      
    20 At a further hearing on 9 May 2007 counsel for ACQ and Aircair sought to re-open the question of whether ACQ and Aircair could recover contribution from NorthPower. Counsel sought to argue that contribution was available, by referring to some additional authorities relating to section 5(1)(c) 1946 Act, and also sought contribution pursuant to the general law independently of statute. The judge was not persuaded that the additional authorities made any difference. The cross-claim that ACQ and Aircair brought against NorthPower seeking contribution specifically sought contribution on the basis of the 1946 Act, and said nothing about seeking contribution under the general law. The possibility of there being contribution under the general law had not been mentioned at the earlier hearing. The trial judge declined to permit the case to be re-opened to explore contribution under the general law. 
     
      
    21 The trial judge held that, because neither ACQ nor Aircair had a right of contribution from NorthPower, there was no scope for the damages that Mr Cook could recover from ACQ and Aircair being reduced pursuant to section 151Z(2)(c) Workers Compensation Act.  
     
      
    22 Thus, the trial judge entered verdicts as follows: 
     
      
    · “For the plaintiff against Aircair Moree Pty Limited and ACQ Pty Limited for $953,141.00. 
     
      
    · For the plaintiff against Country Energy for $260,316.00. 
     
      
    · For Country Energy on its cross-claim against Aircair Moree Pty Limited for $130,158.00. 
     
      
    · For ACQ Pty Limited on the cross-claim brought by Country Energy. 
     
      
    · For Country Energy on the cross-claim brought by Aircair Moree Pty Limited. 
     
      
    · For Country Energy on the cross-claim brought by ACQ Pty Limited.” 
     
      
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    23 On this appeal no party disputes the figures arrived at by the trial judge in assessing, using the two statutory regimes for calculation of damages contained in the Workers Compensation Act and the Civil Liability Act, the damages sustained by Mr Cook. The issues that were argued in the appeal relate to: 
     
      
       
      (i) Whether Aircair owed a duty of care to Mr Cook, and breached it. 
       
       
      (ii) Whether the construction of sections 10 and 11  
      DAA  
      is such that, on the facts of this case, they gave a cause of action to Mr Cook against ACQ and Aircair. 
       
       
      (iii) Whether the judge was right in finding that Mr Cook’s injuries were  
      caused by 
       a breach of duty of Mr Stubbs, or by  
      “something” 
       that falls within section 10(1)(d)  
      DAA 
      . 
       
       
      (iv) Whether contributory negligence is available as a defence to any action brought pursuant to  
      DAA 
      . 
       
       
      (v) Closely related to the causation issue, whether the trial judge should have found that contributory negligence was a complete defence for both ACQ and Aircair pursuant to section 5S  
      Civil Liability Act  
      2002 
      , or that Mr Cook had voluntarily assumed the risk of his injury. 
       
       
      (vi) If contributory negligence is available as a defence to an action under  
      DAA 
      , but is not a complete defence, what assessment of contributory negligence should be made. 
       
       
      (vii) Various related issues concerning whether ACQ and Aircair are entitled to contribution from NorthPower, including:  
       
       
       (a) whether contribution is recoverable under the  
      1946 Act  
      by ACQ from NorthPower, in circumstances where ACQ is not a tortfeasor liable for the same damage; 
       
       
       (b) whether contribution is recoverable under the  
      1946 Act  
      by Aircair from NorthPower, in circumstances where Aircair has been held to be a tortfeasor liable for the same damage, although the verdict entered against it is based on its liability under  
      DAA  
      rather than its liability as a tortfeasor; 
       
       
       (c) if contribution is recoverable under the  
      1946 Act  
      by ACQ or Aircair from NorthPower, what contribution should be ordered; 
       
       
       (d) whether the trial judge should have permitted, or this Court should now permit, argument to be raised about whether contribution is available under the general law to a person who has a liability under  
      DAA 
      , from a tortfeasor whose negligence has caused the same damage; 
       
       
       (e) if such argument ought have been permitted, or is now permitted, what, if any, contribution is each of ACQ and Aircair entitled to recover under the general law from NorthPower. 
       
       
      (viii) Whether the trial judge was right in holding that NorthPower was entitled to recover contribution under the  
      1946 Act  
      from Aircair, notwithstanding that he held that Aircair was not entitled to recover contribution under the  
      1946 Act  
      from NorthPower. 
       
       
      (ix) Whether the trial judge was right in holding that section 151Z  
      Workers Compensation Act  
      did not operate to reduce the damages payable by either ACQ or Aircair. 
       
       
      (x) Whether the judge was right in assessing the liability of both ACQ and Aircair to give contribution to NorthPower at 50%. ACQ and Aircair assert that they should bear less than 50%, while NorthPower contends that Aircair should bear considerably more than 50%. 
       
       
      (xi) Whether the trial judge correctly found that NorthPower had breached its duty of care to Mr Cook. 
       
       
      (xii) What assessment should have been made of the contributory negligence attributed to Mr Cook concerning his claim against NorthPower? Mr Cook contends he should not have been found guilty of contributory negligence at all, or if he is guilty of contributory negligence that the proportion should have been considerably less than 40%. NorthPower contends that the proportion should have been considerably greater than 40%. 
       
       
      Circumstances of the Accident 
       
      
    24 The cotton field that was being sprayed is field 19 at a rural property called “Milo”. That property is reached by travelling 20.8kms north of Moree on the Newell Highway, then 7kms west from the Newell Highway. Field 19 is crossed by an access road that runs in a north-south direction. The field was planted with cotton plants that were planted in rows 1 metre apart, with those rows running in a north-south direction. The cotton bushes were knee-high or more – some evidence put them as being 600mm tall, other evidence put them as being 750mm tall, and there is no basis for choosing between those figures. Individual bushes in a row were planted so that they grew into each other, giving any row the appearance of a low hedge. The rows had irrigation ditches between them. These are troughs or depressions in which water collects when the field is irrigated. The ground in profile had a crest and trough configuration, akin to corrugations spaced one metre apart. 
     
      
    25 The power line that traversed the field was a 22,000-volt line. It consisted of two separate conductors running parallel to each other. Those conductors were connected to insulators on the crossbeams of poles located in the field. One of those poles was located immediately adjacent to the access road, others were in the field. The line ran diagonally across the field from the northwest corner in a southeast direction. It ran at an angle of about 60º to the line of the rows of cotton bushes. 
     
      
    26 Mr Stubbs took off at 5:10am on 28 December 2000 from an airstrip about five miles from Milo for the purpose of conducting the spraying operations. Mr Stubbs did not give evidence at the trial, but some statements he made in a Bureau of Air Safety investigation and a WorkCover investigation were in evidence. His account was: 
     
      
       
        
        “On approaching the property of Milo I contacted irrigators to confirm spraying of field 19 which I am familiar with and its wire hazard. I commenced spray operations on which I came into contact with the overhead wire on about the tenth run. I then immediately contacted my operations manager concerning the incident and proceeded to Moree airport landing without further incident.” 
        
       
      
    27 In carrying out the spraying, Mr Stubbs was assisted by a “spotter”, Mr Matt James. Mr Stubbs described the spotter’s job as to: 
     
      
       
        
        “Keep an eye on weather conditions, put out ground markers to identify shape of the field and for any other information I require concerning ground activities.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Stubbs and the spotter could communicate by UHF radio. The spotter did not notify him that he was flying close to the power lines. 
       
      
    28 Aircair has stated that the wind speed at Milo at 5:30am was 13kms per hour. That wind was blowing roughly at right angles to the direction in which the power line ran.  
     
      
    29 The aircraft’s tailfin came into contact with the wire at about 5:30am. That timing is consistent with some automatic tripping devices having been activated in the line at 5:32am, but then resetting themselves.  
     
      
    30 A WorkCover inspector who investigated the accident, Mr Gary Mason, gave evidence that around 5:30am on the day of the impact “it would have been pretty dark because of daylight saving”. Apart from meteorological evidence that the sun rose at 6:01am that day, that was the only evidence about the light conditions at the time of the impact. 
     
      
    31 The contact occurred between the pole closest to the road, and the next pole west. One of the conductors was torn from its insulator on the cross arm of the pole closest to the road, breaking the end of the cross arm in doing so. Because it had been elevated by that pole, the conductor then hung low to the ground, but above the cotton growing under it. The other wire was torn from its insulator on the pole nearest the road, but came to rest on the cross bar of that pole, so did not drop. 
     
      
    32 Mr Greg Cartwright was a farm worker at Milo. He was in field 19 at this time, and heard the noise as the plane clipped the line. Mr Cartwright did not give evidence, but parts of a statement that he gave to Mr Mason were established through cross-examination.  
     
      
    33 Mr Cartwright’s account was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Aircair Marker then told me that the plane had hit the powerline. I then went down and inspected what happened. The line was swinging across the field. I then rang up Don McKay to tell him what had happened. I then stayed with the line while Don McKay contacted NorthPower.” 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Don Mackay worked as a supervisor at Milo. Mr Mackay had died by the time of the trial, but a statement that he made on 15 January 2001 in the WorkCover inquiry was in evidence. Mr Mackay said that Mr Cartwright 
     
      
       
        
        “… told me that an airplane had hit the power line on field 19 and the line was down. I rang NorthPower about 6:20 am and informed them that the power line was down.” 
        
       
      
    35 A NorthPower report into Mr Cook’s injury puts the time that the call was received reporting that the line had been struck as being 6:04am. That account of the time is likely to be more accurate than Mr Mackay’s recollection. 
     
      
    36 The closest the evidence comes to a contemporaneous record of the terms of Mr Mackay’s telephone report appears in a facsimile that NorthPower sent to WorkCover on the day of the accident. It describes it as a “report of a wire brought down by an aircraft on a rural property 21.5kms north of Moree …”. 
     
      
    37 Some relevant parts of the operations of NorthPower around Moree were controlled from Port Macquarie. A NorthPower investigation report records: 
     
      
       
        
        “At 6.17 am, Greg Cook was called out by Port Macquarie Dispatch with Ray Buddee being called at 6.18 am. Both employees proceeded separately to the accident site near the house on the property “Milo”.” 
        
       
       
      At the time of receiving the call each man was at his home in Moree. 
       
      
    38 Mr Buddee arrived at the property at about 6:45am, and parked his vehicle near the pole from which the wire had been torn. Mr Cook arrived shortly after. The day was fine, but there was almost complete cloud cover. 
     
      
    39 Mr Buddee’s statement, made on the day of the accident, about what happened before Mr Cook arrived was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Aircair arrived at site on other side of line and came over to me ducking under line, I told him I needed a Do and Charge signed before any work would commence. He went back to his truck and radioed in and I came over to him ducking under the line and we filled out the paperwork.” 
        
       
       
      The 
       “paperwork” 
       there referred to was documentation whereby Aircair agreed to pay NorthPower for the repairs to the line. Clearly Mr Buddee’s assessment was that the situation he found was not one calling for immediate action to save life or property. 
       
      
    40 After Mr Cook arrived he or Mr Buddee “talked to Milo person that was there”. This person was Mr Cartwright. Mr Cartwright told Mr Buddee and Mr Cook that there may be some possible damage to the pole in the field, and that he had irrigated the section of the field that the lines were swinging over, so that it was wet. He described that portion of the field to Mr Cook as “sloppy”. 
     
      
    41 Another document in evidence records: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Cartwright suggested to Mr Buddee and Mr Cook that they use an aircraft to inspect the overhead distribution line and the power pole because of the muddy state of the field over which the overhead distribution line passed and in which the power pole was located.” 
        
       
      
    42 Mr Buddee and Mr Cook discussed what should be done. They decided between them that Mr Buddee would drive to the links site, 7kms up the line, and isolate the line. They agreed that Mr Cook would “walk the line”, to assess what damage had been occasioned to the conductor and the supporting pole, and thus to determine what repair work might be required. They set out on their respective tasks. Mr Cook entered the cotton field, walking towards the place where the plane had run into the line.  
     
      
    43 At this time Mr Mackay arrived on the scene. He saw one NorthPower vehicle driving away and the other parked near the power pole. Mr Mackay’s statement continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I was driving on the road north of Field 19, I seen a NorthPower worker walking in the field. He appeared to have lost his balance, one arm went up I don’t know which one, then there was a flash and bang a loud bang. With that he fell forward onto his face. I then turned and headed for the NorthPower Ute parked at the power pole. I then called the other NorthPower vehicle and told him that his partner was down. I ran across the field keeping away from the downed line. The injured worker was lying face down in mud.” 
        
       
      
    44 Mr Cook was unable to give any account of how the accident happened, as he has no memory of the day of the accident, or the two days before it. 
     
      
    45 Mr Buddee’s account is that as he was driving toward the links he: 
     
      
       
        
        “Got a radio call from someone saying NorthPower man get back here your man’s gone down. I turned around and got back there. When I got there I found a man out in the field who told me that Greg had touched the line and was lying face down in the mud. I radioed PanPan to Port Control and told them to turn off supply, and told another person to stay by the truck and let us know when it was off.” 
        
       
       
      That  
      “other person” 
       was Mr Cartwright. 
       
      
    46 Mr Cartwright’s account of events after Mr Buddee had driven off towards the links was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I then asked Cookie if he was right because it was the end of my shift. I then drove around to the shed. When I was back at the shed getting ready to leave Don called me on the two-way to get back because there was a man down. When I got back to the field Don was out with Cookie telling me, ‘We have got to do something’. At that stage the other NorthPower worker turned up and said, ‘The power is still on.’ He told me to stand by the radio while he went in to help Don and to confirm to them when the power had been turned off.” 
        
       
      
    47 Mr Buddee ran to where Mr Cook was lying in the field, cleaned his mouth and face of mud, found that there was no breathing or pulse, and gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation until pulse and breathing were restored. In the course of this an ambulance and senior people from NorthPower were summoned by mobile phone. The place where Mr Cook fell was approximately 65m from the place his truck was parked.  
     
      
    48 A NorthPower internal report on the accident, dated 27 February 2001, gives a somewhat fuller account of Mr Buddee’s version of the conversation between himself and Mr Cook: 
     
      
    Ø “They were aware the cotton field was very wet and “walking the line” would be hard going. 
     
      
    Ø They understood the line was alive. 
     
      
    Ø The low wire did not appear to be blown out sideways or moving about. 
     
      
    Ø They realised one of them should stay in the vicinity in case a farm worker approached. 
     
      
    Ø They needed to find out exactly where the wire had been contacted by the plane, the extent of that damage to the wires and the next pole so they could plan and carry out the repair work safely. 
     
      
    Ø They decided that Ray Buddee would travel to the nearest set of pole mounted isolating links No 1292 located about 7 km back towards Moree in order to isolate supply from the faulty section and Greg Cook would start to “walk the line” to visually check for physical damage to the conductors and to adjacent pole No 82 120101115. 
     
      
    Ø Ray Buddee drove off to do the switching and Greg Cook entered the cotton field to inspect the line.” 
     
      
    49 NorthPower described the situation the men encountered as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Both conductors probably damaged and with the potential to break completely and drop or recoil or have a strand break, unravel and stick out some distance. 
        
       
       
        
        Mild cross breeze able to move the 567 m span no more than 0.5 metres to one side but also back and forth if some variation in wind speed was occurring.” 
        
       
      
    50 The NorthPower internal report also attributes to Mr Mackay the observation that Mr Cook: 
     
      
       
        
        “… was having considerable difficulty walking in the recently irrigated cotton field. Watching Cook proceed he noted that he got into what must have been a particularly boggy patch and was having great trouble removing his feet from the mud. At this stage Cook appeared to overbalance and throw his arms up in the air and Mackay stated that he saw a flash and Cook immediately fell out of sight, screened by the 750 mm high cotton bushes.” 
        
       
       
      I infer that this records what Mr Mackay told the NorthPower investigator. 
       
      
    51 The NorthPower internal report states that when Mr Buddee returned to the site he: 
     
      
       
        
        “… quickly made a Pan Pan Pan call to Port Macquarie System Control for immediate isolation of the entire Gingham Road Feeder. Mackay had already called for an ambulance. 
        
       
       
        
        The Pan Pan Pan call was received at 6.56 am and the feeder was isolated from supply at 6.57 am by Port Macquarie System Control. 
        
       
       
        
        By this time another farm worker had arrived and Buddee asked him to get more help. 
        
       
       
        
        Mackay was with Cook at the accident site when Buddee arrived back. Buddee made his way across the rows of cotton as quickly as he could towards Mackay and Cook. Mackay noticed Buddee getting close to the low wire as he approached and warned him to move away from it. Cook was face down in the mud when Buddee reached him. He was lying about one metre to the side of the low hanging wire.” 
        
       
       
      Condition of the Field 
       
      
    52 The field was being irrigated just before Mr Stubbs started spraying. Photographs of the field taken later on the day of the accident show that even at that time water was still lying in the irrigation ditches between the rows.  
     
      
    53 While the field across which Mr Cook walked has been described as “muddy” and “boggy” those words do not adequately convey its state.  
     
      
    54 The NorthPower investigation report records that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ambulance staff attended Cook at the accident site despite being hampered by 100-150 mm deep mud.” 
        
       
      
    55 Mr Mason attended Milo in the afternoon of the day of the accident. He requested Mr Mackay to take him to the site where Mr Cook had been electrocuted. Mr Mason reports: 
     
      
       
        
        “On stepping down from the tractor my feet had sunk to a level just below my knees making it hard to walk without falling over. I decided to return to the site when the area had dried.” 
        
       
      
    56 The conductor in question was 6mm (which is around 0.25 inches) in diameter. An expert witness, Professor Stillman, identified it as made of steel, and that it “would probably have degraded as a result of the time it had been in the air”. That degradation results in its surface no longer being shiny, but dull. 
     
      
    57 Mr Mason explained his observations of the day of the accident: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was there – this was between 1 o’clock and, say, 3 o’clock in the afternoon, and I found it very hard to actually make the wire out against the horizon, okay, even when I was – prior to going out there. When I was taking measurements and notes adjacent to where the vehicles were parked, I found myself checking myself there too because the wire went across the road at, as I said before, 1 and a half metres, and I kept losing it, and it was very easy. When you’re looking at other things, it was very easy to miss it.” 
        
       
      
    58 On 10 January 2001 Mr Peter Hyde, a member of the team investigating the accident for NorthPower, tried to re-enact Mr Cook’s journey from the access road to the spot where he was electrocuted. The NorthPower investigation report records: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hyde found it extremely difficult to keep a set distance from the line route as he set off from the track across the rows. He had to focus on trying to negotiate the rows particularly where to place his feet. As the mud on his boots built up (from 1 kg clean to 3.5 kg each) he found he was getting snagged on the roots and stalks of the cotton bushes and having difficulty maintaining his balance. He was sinking into the mud to about 150 mm. He also found that the resistance of the cotton bushes to his moving through them was substantial. 
        
       
       
        
        Ray Buddee also commented that when he was hurrying out to where Cook was lying, it had been difficult to focus on the low wire and its distance from him, as he had to concentrate on negotiating the rows of cotton bushes. It was very fortunate for Buddee that Mackay, at Cook’s side and near the low wire, had seen Buddee getting close to the wire as he headed towards them and had warned Buddee to move away from it.” 
        
       
      
    59 Mr Mason also re-enacted Mr Cook’s journey on 2 January 2001. He reports: 
     
      
       
        
        “I walked from the road and under the power line towards the site of the accident. This required me to cross over the rows of cotton in slightly diagonal direction. Every 10 to 12 paces I found myself looking up at the power line and correcting the direction I was walking. I observed both Jim Crawford and Garry Brady (NorthPower) who were walking with me were having the same directional problem.” 
        
       
      
    60 Mr Mason explained in oral evidence why he kept looking up at the power line and correcting his direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well, I took it on board that it was because the rows of cotton were diagonal, and it’s just, I suppose, human instinct that you try and walk a straight line, and I found myself veering off. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So to try and walk a straight line you had to keep checking? 
         
        A. Yeah, I keep checking, because you’re getting your bearings on the rows of cotton, okay. But they were at an angle, so as I’ve written here, I suggested that I found myself just checking myself every now and again.” 
        
       
       
      Results of NorthPower’s Investigation 
       
      
    61 The conclusion that NorthPower came to in its accident investigation was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Cook must not have realised how close he had got to the live wire. The cotton rows he was crossing are at an angle of about 60 degrees to the line, Cook would have been concentrating on where to place his feet relative to the cotton bushes, trying to avoid stepping into the troughs of the rows, trying to avoid stumbling as he dragged his mud-caked boots from row to row. In concentrating on this and periodically looking up at the quite thin wire and with nothing to aid his judging the distance to the wire, the path he took must have brought him much closer to the low wire.” 
        
       
      
    62 Even after the accident had occurred, NorthPower did not criticise Mr Cook’s decision to start walking through the field while Mr Buddee was still on his way to turn the electricity off. NorthPower’s accident investigation report states: 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears Buddee and Cook undertook an initial workplace risk assessment in that: 
        
       
      
    · They identified the live wire as a hazard and agreed that isolating supply testing and earthing the line was the required control measure to eliminate this risk. 
     
      
    · They realised that the low live wire was a public hazard and one of them needed to stay in the vicinity. 
     
      
    · They recognised the muddy field as a hazard and that walking through the field would be difficult but had to be done to determine the extent of damage to both wires and the pole some 300 metres in the cotton field. They needed this information to be able to plan the work and do it safely.” (Emphasis added) 
     
      
    63 After Mr Cook’s accident, NorthPower issued a “hazard alert” to its staff relating to the situation that Mr Cook had encountered. The “hazard alert” included in the “Lessons to be learnt” from Mr Cook’s accident: 
     
      
       
        
        “The need to always observe the  
        minimum 
         safe working clearances as per the Electrical Safety Rules, in this case 1000 mm, but to also realise that through Worksite Risk Assessment of this situation, a low hanging conductor can move a bit in the wind and can break or have one strand spring out, meaning that this minimum may not be enough. 
        
       
       
        
        The importance of doing a full worksite Risk Assessment at the very start of a job. Note that a mental/visual risk assessment allowed for emergencies involving immediate danger to human life does not mean a partial or cursory assessment.” 
        
       
       
      The Judge’s Finding on How Mr Cook Fell 
       
      
    64 The trial judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no evidence that Mr Cook voluntarily placed himself or any part of his body inside the proscribed one metre clearance, nor can such an inference be drawn. It is more probable that he lost his balance in the muddy conditions and breached the clearance as a consequence of stumbling or falling, from a distance in excess of one metre. I am satisfied that by reason of his training and experience, Mr Cook would not have risked breaching the required clearance.” 
        
       
       
      By the time of the appeal that finding was not contentious. 
       
       
      Mr Cook’s Training Experience and Observations 
       
      
    65 Mr Cook started working for NorthPower in 1995 as a trainee linesman. He did a series of courses over the years until, by the time of the accident, he had qualified as a grade 6 linesman, the highest grade of linesman that NorthPower employed. 
     
      
    66 Operating staff of NorthPower were assessed annually, in writing. Mr Cook’s last assessment prior to the accident had been on 28 June 2000. To the question “Who should be the prime consideration when operating in the system?” he gave the correct answer, namely “self”. He accepted in cross-examination that if somebody else had authorised him to do some work, but he considered it unsafe, it was his duty not to proceed with the work.  
     
      
    67 He was well aware that the minimum safe operating distance prescribed by the NorthPower safety rules was one metre for a 22 thousand volt conductor, and that the reason for prescribing the minimum clearance was because of the possibility of flashover. He was also aware that pools of water near a conductor, moisture vapour and humidity could affect flashover, by making it more likely to occur. (The evidence established that moisture did not increase the distance over which flashover could occur, just the likelihood of it happening.) Mr Cook agreed that when he arrived at a work site he assessed the risk of injury to himself from the moment he got out of his truck, and that he assumed that a conductor is energised until he has personally tested it with a device that all electrical linesmen carry. 
     
      
    68 Though in cross-examination Mr Cook could not provide a reason why he could not wait until the line was isolated before undertaking his assessment of what repairs were necessary, in circumstances where Mr Cook had no memory at all of the day in question I would not place weight on that answer. 
     
      
    69 Mr Cook explained the point of checking on the wire itself as being to make sure it wasn’t going to break at any stage before work was done on the conductors or the poles or the cross arms. This was part of assessing the method by which the job should be done, and deciding what parts and equipment were needed for the job. 
     
      
    70 He said it would probably not be possible to assess the condition of a 22 kv conductor that was 6mm in diameter from a distance of five or ten metres away. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You’d probably want to get to around about your clearances to see if there was any broken strands in the wire or anything like that, so around about 2 to 3 metres.” 
        
       
       
      Duty of Care of Mr Stubbs 
       
      
    71 The trial judge made no explicit finding concerning the existence of a duty of care owed to Mr Cook by Mr Stubbs. His reasons suggest that he simply assumed that a duty of care existed. The written submissions of Aircair at the trial had contested the existence of a duty with reference to authority, but the judge made no reference to any of those authorities. 
     
      
    72 Aircair submits that where one has an experienced tradesman: 
     
      
       
      (a) experienced in the task he was performing when injured; 
       
       
      (b) who knew of the relevant danger; 
       
       
      (c) who was accustomed to meeting and safeguarding against that danger; 
       
       
      (d) who had time to assess and overcome the danger; and 
       
       
      (e) was suitably equipped,  
       
       
      no duty is owed to him. 
       
      
    73 Aircair bases that submission upon O’Connor v Commissioner for Government Transport [1954] HCA 11; (1954) 100 CLR 225; Commissioner for Railways v Schier [1964] NSWR 880; Daley v Gypsy Caravan Co Pty Ltd [1966] 2 NSWR 22 and Papatonakis v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1985] HCA 3; (1985) 156 CLR 7.  
     
      
    74 In O’Connor v Commissioner for Government Transport an experienced plumber died after falling from an awning on which his employer had instructed him to work. His task was to remove, cut and replace some of the corrugated iron sheeting on the awning, so that the awning would overhang the footpath to a lesser extent. While on the roof of the awning, and in the process of disassembling some of it, the corrugated iron buckled, causing him to fall. The cause of the buckling was that some of the rafters were affected by dry rot. The party of workmen sent to the site had been sent there equipped with trestles and a plank, that would have enabled the work to be performed without going on the roof of the awning, but they were not used. The presence of the dry rot was as easily ascertained by the workmen as by anybody, however skilled. Though a jury had awarded the widow of the workman damages in a claim against the employer under the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897, the Full Court had set that verdict aside. The High Court (Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ) in a joint judgment upheld the Full Court’s decision. 
     
      
    75 The question at issue in the case was breach of duty, not existence of a duty of care. That was recognised when their Honours said, at [5], 230,  
     
      
       
        
        “The standard of care for an employee’s safety is not a low one, but in a case such as this the question must be whether any suggested course that was omitted could really be regarded as reasonable.” 
        
       
      
    76 Their Honours pointed out that the awning was the very thing to be worked at, and thus the defect in it was not a defect in the premises provided by the employer as the place where the employee was to do his work. Their Honours continued, at [5], 230: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was an ordinary question for a plumber to decide for himself how he would do the work. Obviously any experienced plumber would see that there must be a question whether a structure like the awning supported not by posts but by brackets was strong enough to bear his weight as he dismantled it. It was not made for that purpose and neither the deceased nor any of his companions can be supposed to have thought that it had been specially tested to see if it was strong enough. It seems fanciful to treat the question as one to be gone into and decided by some superior officer, as distinguished from the workmen on the spot, and still more fanciful to suppose that a warning or special instruction was demanded about so simple and obvious a matter requiring neither special skill or knowledge to decide and ordinarily treated as a matter for the man doing the job.” 
        
       
      
    77 Even though O’Connor turned upon questions of breach of duty rather than existence of duty, when both questions depend upon reasonable forseeability of a risk eventuating the types of considerations that their Honours regarded as decisive in O’Connor are capable of influencing whether a duty of care exists in situations, like the present, where any relationship between plaintiff and defendant is not an ongoing one but rather one that arises by virtue of the particular circumstances in which the plaintiff comes to be injured.  
     
      
    78 In Commissioner for Railways v Schier an employee of AIS sued the Commissioner for Railways when the employee sustained an injury while uncoupling two railway trucks the property of the Commissioner. A device on the trucks which would enable the uncoupling to occur from the side of the trucks, in safety, was not working. The employee went between the trucks to uncouple them manually, doing so while the engine was still engaged in a “bumping-up” operation. The procedure of going between the trucks while the “bumping-up” was still underway 
     
      
       
        
        “… was a dangerous one, forbidden by AIS’s traffic regulations, which had been issued to the plaintiff, contrary to the instruction which the plaintiff had received when he was being trained as a shunter, obviously dangerous in itself, and understood by the plaintiff to be dangerous.” (per Sugerman J at 882) 
        
       
      
    79 Manual uncoupling by going between the trucks once “bumping up” had stopped was quite safe. 
     
      
    80 Sugerman J at 883 said that while the uncoupling lever was defective: 
     
      
       
        
        “The defect was not latent or concealed. It was obvious in a significant sense, in that the lever was situated at, and designed to be worked from, a position of safety at the side of the truck, so that discovery of its defectiveness must occur on the initial attempt to uncouple the truck made from a situation in which no danger could ensue, from the circumstance that the lever turned out to be, in fact, defective. This is an entirely different situation from that of a latent or concealed defect, such that the danger becomes apparent, and injury or other harm may result, only during or after use or consumption. The lever may be denominated a safety device. But it is not one of those safety devices whose unexpected failure may endanger the lives or limbs of those who rely upon them. If it fails to work, the position merely remains as it was. The trucks remain to be uncoupled, and may be uncoupled by another method, which is safe, even if it is not so convenient as use of the lever.” 
        
       
      
    81 Indeed, it was precisely because the defect in the lever had been discovered by the plaintiff that he attempted the dangerous alternative method of carrying out the job. 
     
      
    82 The Court also held that the defective state of the lever was not the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Sugerman J quoted the portion of the speech in Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd [1936] AC 85 at 105 that said that the principle of Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562: 
     
      
       
        
        “… can only be applied where the defect is hidden and unknown to the consumer, otherwise the directness of cause and effect is absent; the man who consumes or uses a thing which he knows to be noxious cannot complain in respect of whatever mischief follows because it follows from his own conscious volition in choosing to incur the risk or certainty of mischance.” 
        
       
      
    83 As applied to the circumstances in Schier’s case, Sugerman J said, at 885, that the plaintiff 
     
      
       
        
        “… was not injured because of some mechanical or physical sequel of the defect in the lever which he had discovered; the defect in the lever did not of itself, in that or any other sense, give rise to any danger to the plaintiff. He was injured because, of the courses which were then open to him, he elected that which was dangerous. The existence of a defect, such as this, might be thought of as a temptation to the impatient or the imprudent to attempt a short cut, even though dangerous. And the plaintiff says that he was instructed by his foreman to take this short cut. But, of whatever significance considerations such as these may be, in a contest between an employee and his employer, it is not to their like that Lord Evershed’s reference to no practical alternative should be applied, as against a third party supplier of the truck.” 
        
       
      
    84 Walsh J was “in general agreement” with the reasons of Sugerman J, and added, at 886: 
     
      
       
        
        “If there are two courses which may be taken, one of which will avoid any risk of injury resulting from the situation created by the existence of the obvious and known defect, and the other of which will create a risk, then unless the latter choice is seen to be forced upon the plaintiff by the practical necessities of the situation itself, as viewed by a reasonable observer, then I think that the taking of that choice, with resultant injury, will not expose the supplier to liability. Even if the plaintiff can legitimately claim, as against his employer, that the urgencies of the employer’s business activities or its system of work or its express instructions, made the choice a reasonable one for the plaintiff to adopt, I think that this will not suffice, as against a stranger to that employment, to establish a relevant breach of the latter’s duty or the requisite causal relationship between the defect and the injury which the plaintiff sustains.” 
        
       
      
    85 Wallace J agreed with both Sugerman and Walsh JJ. 
     
      
    86 In Daley v Gypsy Caravan Co Pty Ltd the plaintiff was a qualified electrician who was requested by the owner of a caravan to investigate a slight electrical tingling that had been noticed in it. That caravan had been manufactured by the defendant. At the time of the investigation the caravan was in a caravan park, and connected to a 240-volt electrical supply. It would have been possible for the plaintiff to turn the supply off, but he decided to leave it on, to enable him to use a voltmeter that he had with him. He seized what he thought to be a piece of rubber flex that protruded below the floor of the caravan, believing it to be insulated. In fact, the object was copper pipe, connected to the frame of the caravan, into which a 240-volt current was passing. The plaintiff then suffered the injuries for which he sued. The plaintiff agreed that he knew that the cause of the fault was that 240 volts was getting into the caravan frame. The Court of Appeal (Wallace P, Jacobs and Asprey JJA) held that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff.  
     
      
    87 Their Honours recognised, at 26, that a manufacturer of products can owe duties to persons other than the purchaser, but that not everyone that is injured by a defect in the article manufactured, is necessarily within the class of “neighbour”. After quoting the statement of Lord Wright in Grant at 104-5 that “the duty cannot at the time of manufacture be other than potential or contingent” they said  
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he duty becomes vested (or, as it were, crystallised) when some person who is injured falls within the classification of ‘neighbour’. The question whether any particular person is within that class is one of fact and degree.” 
        
       
      
    88 The reference to “neighbour” was, of course a reference to Lord Atkins’ statement in Donoghue v Stevenson at 580: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer’s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.” 
        
       
      
    89 In Daley their Honours applied that principle at 26-27, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “A manufacturer of caravans, so constructed as to contain electrical wiring for the conduct of high voltage electricity, who sells such caravans with the knowledge that they would, in the ordinary course of use, be coupled to a high voltage electrical main could be found, in our opinion, to have in contemplation the fact that purchasers of those caravans would call in aid electricians to perform adjustments or repairs to the electrical system and that, as undoubtedly such caravans would in the contemplation of the manufacture be used over a substantial period of time, an electrician would be called to execute work thereon within a period certainly extending over two years from the date of its original purchase.” 
        
       
      
    90 That it was foreseeable that electricians might be involved in repairing the product in this way does not, of course, address all the elements of Lord Atkins’ test for existence of a duty. In Daley their Honours went on, at 27, to explicitly rely upon 
     
      
       
        
        “… the principle of proximity, that is to say the situation in which the potential duty of care would arise or vest.” 
        
       
      
    91 They adopted Lord Atkins’ statement in Donoghue v Stevenson at 581 that it would  
     
      
       
        
        “extend to such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care could know would be directly affected by his carelessness act.” 
        
       
      
    92 At 28, their Honours accepted that there could be some circumstances in which a manufacturer might owe a duty of care to a fully qualified person called in to repair a fault when the effects of the fault had become apparent though the precise nature of the fault itself was still unknown. They contemplated the possibility: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an item of machinery ceased to function and an expert engineer was called in to ascertain and remedy the fault and for the purpose of his examination started the engine, the fact that the engine thereupon exploded and injured him through some hidden defect of manufacture may not enable the manufacturer, so long, at any rate, as the starting up of the engine was in all the circumstances a reasonable step in the expert’s process of examination, to shelter behind the knowledge of the expert knowledge of the engineer so as to claim that he was not the neighbour in law of the manufacturer.” 
        
       
      
    93 The critical matters that their Honours took into account in deciding whether a duty of care existed in the case before them were that the plaintiff was both qualified and licensed to investigate the cause of the electrical leakage, he was aware that the caravan was connected to 240-volt power and that it was escaping into the framework of the caravan,  
     
      
       
        
        “… and he must be taken to be aware of the danger attaching to any person coming into contact with an electrical current of such high voltage. The fact that the plaintiff believed that the leakage was a minor one is not to deny that a major leakage was still possible. It appears to us that in those circumstances it could not be contended successfully, that the defendant could reasonably anticipate that the plaintiff was a person who would be directly affected by its carelessness. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff’s error, whilst the current was still being supplied to the caravan from the council’s main, of mistaking a copper pipe for a piece of electrical flex was unfortunate but that was an error of judgment on his part and in no way attributable to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    94 They concluded, at 29: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the words of Lord Wright, his injury followed from his own conscious volition in choosing to incur the  
        “risk of mischance” 
        ; but this is not a question of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which would only arise when the defendant’s negligence towards the plaintiff was established. In our view, the potential duty owed by the defendant manufacturer did not vest in relation to this particular plaintiff.” 
        
       
      
    95 Papatonakis v Australian Telecommunications Commission involved a Telecom linesman who was sent to repair a fault in the telephone system of a land occupier. The land occupier had extended the telephone line using cabling not as strong as Telecom’s usual cable. The linesman was injured when he placed his ladder against a makeshift pole that the occupier had used in extending the line. The force thereby exerted on the line caused the weak section of it to break, throwing the workman from the ladder. For the workman to rely on the makeshift pole as a support was contrary to his training by Telecom. However, it was not the substandard condition of the pole that caused his injury, it was the substandard condition of the added cable, a matter of which the workman did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know or find out for himself. Brennan and Dawson JJ at 30 recognised an applicable principle as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where an independent contractor carrying on a particular trade is engaged by an occupier to work on his premises, the occupier is not under a duty to give warning of a defect in the premise if tradesmen of that class are accustomed to meeting and safeguarding themselves against defects of that kind.” 
        
       
      
    96 See, to similar effect, Mason J at 20-21 (dissenting), and Wilson J at 24. Deane J at 38 said of the cases that establish that proposition: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that they support the proposition that, in the ordinary case where there has been no undisclosed non-expert meddling with a technical installation, an occupier is entitled to rely upon an expert to work out the appropriate method of dealing with a technical matter calling for expert skill, they represent no more than common sense.” 
        
       
      
    97 The essence of the reason why, in Papatonakis, the majority held that the occupier was liable to the linesman was expressed by Brennan and Dawson JJ at 30: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to leave it to an independent contractor to decide for himself how to do his work; it is another thing to leave him in ignorance of a fact that is material to his decision if he, using reasonable care, might not discover that fact.” 
        
       
      
    98 The statement of Brennan and Dawson JJ in Papatonakis that I have quoted at [95] above has been relied on by Santow JA (with whom McColl JA and Davies AJA agreed) in Bhambra v Roet [2003] NSWCA 393 at [34] in finding that a home owner owed no duty of care to provide handrails on the building site to an experienced carpenter engaged to do work on the home, even when those handrails would have prevented the carpenter from being injured in the manner in which he was actually injured. See likewise Davis v Nolras Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 379 at [39]-[49] per Ipp JA, [64] per Brereton J; State Rail Authority of NSW v Watkins [2001] NSWCA 405 at [55]-[57] per Mason P (with whom Heydon JA and Sperling J agreed); Kolodziejczyk v Grandview Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 267; (2002) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-673 at [52]. 
     
      
    99 I recognise that Mr Stubbs may well have owed duties of care to people other than Mr Cook concerning the operation of the aircraft. He may have owed a duty to people on the ground who might be injured if the plane or anything dropped from it struck them or caused them to injure themselves while taking evasive action. Particularly when he knew he was flying in close proximity to high voltage electricity cables, he may well have owed a duty to people on the ground who might be struck or come into the immediate vicinity of a wire as it fell, to inexperienced people who approached too close to the fallen wire, to people who might come near a fallen wire without realising it was there, or to property owners who it was reasonably foreseeable may suffer damage in consequence of the fall of the wire. But that A owes a duty of care to one person, or people who fit within a particular description, does not necessarily mean that A owes a duty of care to anyone else. 
     
      
    100 In deciding whether Mr Stubbs owed a duty of care to Mr Cook, it is necessary to bear in mind that all of the cases on which Aircair relies come from times when the understanding of the circumstances in which a duty of care rises was not quite the same as it is today. In particular, it is to be observed that in Daley their Honours explicitly relied on “the principle of proximity” (though with an explicit statement of what they understood by it). Direct application of the notion of “proximity” can no longer be seen as a safe guide to when a duty of care exists: Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at [7]-[10] 193-194 per Gleeson CJ, [25]-[27] 197-198 per Gaudron J, [70]-[82] 208-212 per McHugh J, [191] 251 per Gummow J, [245]-[247] 268-270, [255] 273, [259] 275, [267] 277-278, [279]-[287] 283-286, [292]-[296] 288-289 per Kirby J, [330]-[335] 300-303 per Hayne J, [389] 318-319, [393] 321-322, [398]-[400] 323-324, [406] 326 per Callinan J. More recent High Court authority has referred to proximity as a doctrine that is “rejected” (Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; (2003) 214 CLR 552 at [29]-[30], 563-564 per McHugh J; Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [236], 624-625 per Kirby J) “no longer … the criterion of a duty of care” (Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [99], 583 per McHugh J), “one that has not served as a unifying doctrine” (Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35; (2002) 211 CLR 317 at [53], 341 per Gaudron J), and “not only difficult to define but difficult to apply” (Tame at [257], 405 per Hayne J). In Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Choi [2007] NSWCA 363 Mason P (with whom Hodgson JA and Handley AJA agreed) said at [36] that a submission that a duty of care was based on proximity “had an old-fashioned and unhelpful ring about it.” In my view, it is necessary to decide whether a duty of care was owed by looking in a more particular fashion at facts relating to the particular relationship in which Mr Stubbs and Mr Cook stood.  
     
      
    101 In the present case, a person in Mr Stubbs’ position ought reasonably have foreseen that careless flying in the immediate vicinity of the power line might bring the power line down. He should reasonably have foreseen that a power line that was brought down was capable of inflicting very serious injury or death on a person who came near it. However, Mr Cook was not on the ground anywhere in the vicinity at the time the plane was flying. It is reasonably foreseeable by an aircraft pilot that if he flies the plane in such a fashion as to bring down a power line, power workers will come to repair the damage. It is reasonably foreseeable that, once such a power worker had come, he could injure himself as a consequence of his own inadvertence. However, to the extent that a reasonable person considering the matter can know in advance, a power worker sent to repair a damaged power line is likely to be properly trained and experienced, and likely to be able to take care of himself so far as avoiding electric shock is concerned. Those likelihoods are such that it would not seem to be a realistic possibility that a power authority would send a person who was not properly trained, experienced, and capable of protecting himself. In that circumstance, the taking of reasonable care for the interests of the hypothetical electrical power worker does not result in the imposition of a duty of care to that power worker on the pilot. I conclude that Mr Stubbs did not owe a duty of care to Mr Cook to operate the aircraft with reasonable care.  
     
      
    102 In these circumstances, no questions arise of whether a duty was breached, or whether Mr Cook’s injuries were caused by a breach of duty. 
     
      
       
      Application of  
      DAA 
       
      
    103 The trial judge’s reasons for holding that liability arose under DAA were: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there was an impact of the type contemplated by s 10(d), and an uninterrupted causal relationship between that impact and the injuries. Mr Cook, whilst on land, suffered personal injury caused by ‘something’ that was a result of the impact of the aircraft, in flight, with the conductor. That ‘something’ was the dislodgement of the conductor from a supporting pole, which created the foreseeable risk of injury to persons in the vicinity, or who might approach the live conductor, such as linesmen from North Power.” 
        
       
      
    104 Aircair and ACQ submit that there are two separate errors in that reasoning process. The first is that it accords too wide a construction to section 10(1)(d) DAA. The second is that the factual finding of causation is mistaken. 
     
      
       
      Construction of Section 10(1)(d) 
       
      
    105 Aircair and ACQ submit that sections 10(1)(a)-(c) DAA apply where an aircraft, a part of an aircraft, or something falling strikes the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s property, and that section 10(1)(d) is confined to situations such as where either an aircraft, a part of an aircraft, or something falling from an aircraft strikes an object that then strikes the plaintiff or his property with no opportunity for the plaintiff to avoid an injury. These appellants give examples of section 10(1)(d) applying where a part of an aircraft falls onto a roof, which then falls onto and strikes the plaintiff, or where a fire results from a crashed aircraft, and burns the plaintiff.  
     
      
    106 I do not agree that the construction of section 10(1)(d) is so limited. Explaining why involves examination of the history of this legislative topic. 
     
      
    107 The Convention on Damage caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface (""the Rome Convention"") was agreed between various countries in Rome on 7 October 1952. Article 1, 1 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any person who suffers damage on the surface shall, upon proof only that the damage was caused by an aircraft in flight or by any person or thing falling therefrom, be entitled to compensation as provided by this Convention. Nevertheless there shall be no right to compensation if the damage is not a direct consequence of the incident giving rise thereto, or if the damage results from the mere fact of passage of the aircraft through the airspace in conformity with existing air traffic regulations."" 
        
       
      
    108 Articles 2-4 identified on whom that liability fell. Article 6 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any person who would otherwise be liable under the provisions of this Convention shall not be liable for damage if he proves that the damage was caused solely through the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person who suffers the damage or of the latter's servants or agents. If the person liable proves that the damage was contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person who suffers the damage, or of his servants or agents, the compensation shall be reduced to the extent to which such negligence or wrongful act or omission contributed to the damage."" 
        
       
      
    109 Articles 11 and 12 provided that, save in the case of a person who suffers damage caused by a deliberate act or omission of the operator, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage, the liability for damage was limited in accordance with a scale provided by the Convention. The limitation of liability was imposed by fixing a sum that was the total amount of compensation that could be paid for each aircraft and incident. The amount so payable was calculated on a sliding scale depending on the weight of the aircraft, and in a monetary measure that depended upon the value of gold from time to time. Article 21 provided for a period of limitation of two years from the date of the incident that caused the damage. That period could be suspended or interrupted under the law of the court trying the action, but in any case would be extinguished on the expiration of three years from the date of the incident which caused the damage. Article 23 stated that the Convention applied to damage contemplated in Article 1 caused in the territory of a Contracting State by an aircraft registered in the territory of another Contracting State. 
     
      
    110 The Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act 1958 (Cth) was passed to give effect in Australian law to the Rome Convention, to the extent that the Federal Parliament was then conceived as having power to do so. It gave approval to the ratification by Australia of the Convention (section 7). Part II of the Act provided that the provisions of the Convention have the force of law in Australia (section 8). In this way, it allowed an action for damages to be brought in Australian courts in those circumstances in which the Convention itself established a liability in international law. Thus, the action for damages created by Part II applied only to the limited class of aircraft that fell within Article 23 of the Convention. Part III of the Act provided for liability to arise for damages caused by certain aircraft that were not covered by the Convention, in the same circumstances as the Convention would cause liability for damage to arise for an aircraft to which it applied. The aircraft to which Part III extended that liability were, broadly, aircraft engaged in trade and commerce between Australia and another country and that were in flight in Australia. 
     
      
    111 Some Australian states have enacted legislation to give effect to principles somewhat similar to those of the Rome Convention. In New South Wales, section 2 Damage by Aircraft Act 1952 (“the 1952 NSW Act”) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) No action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance, by reason only of the flight of an aircraft over any property at a height above the ground, which, having regard to wind, weather, and all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of such flight, so long as the provisions of the  
        Air Navigation Regulations 
         are duly complied with. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where material loss or damage is caused to any person or property on land or water by, or by a person in, or an article or person falling from, an aircraft while in flight, taking off or landing, then unless the loss or damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the person by whom it was suffered, damages in respect of the loss or damage shall be recoverable without proof of negligence or intention or other cause of action, as if the loss or damage had been caused by the wilful act, neglect, or default of the owner of the aircraft.” 
        
       
      
    112 It expressly provides that loss or damage includes, in relation to persons, loss of life and personal injury. That State legislation was not, however, inspired by the Rome Convention – as Brownie J explained in Southgate v Commonwealth of Australia (1987) 13 NSWLR 188 at 190: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The  
        Damage by Aircraft Act 
         had its origin in s 9 of the  
        Air Navigation Act 
         1920 
         of the United Kingdom, which was successively replaced by other Acts by the name  
        Civil Aviation Act 
         of 1949 and 1982. There are statutes in like terms in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New Zealand…” 
        
       
      
    113 A significant difference between this New South Wales legislation and the Rome Convention is that there is no limitation on liability under the New South Wales statute.  
     
      
    114 The DAA repealed the Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act 1958 (Cth). Clause 3 DAA provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The main object of this Act is to facilitate the recovery of damages 
         
        for certain injury, loss, damage or destruction caused by aircraft, or 
         
        by people, animals or things that are dropped, or that fall, from 
         
        aircraft that are in flight.” 
        
       
       
      The use of the word  
      “facilitate” 
       shows an intention to improve the pre-existing situation.  
       
      
    115 The purpose of the legislation was explained by the Minister in the second reading speech (House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 24 March 1999, 4163 ff) as being ""… to improve compensation for members of the public who suffer personal injury or property damage as third parties on the ground involved in an air accident"". Other indications of the remedial intention of the statute are found in the Minister’s statement that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… as the Bill is intended to provide members of the public with compensation that is as prompt and as comprehensive as practicable, it modernises and strengthens the provisions of relevant State legislation, where clear public gains have been possible.” (4164) 
        
       
       
      and in the Minister’s reference at 4164-5 that: 
       
       
        
        “It is intended that compensation will also be as comprehensive as practicable, to cover all economic and non-economic loss possible.” 
        
       
      
    116 The Minister expressly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It should be stressed that the involvement of members of the public in an air accident as third parties on the ground is generally not due to any choice or action on their part. In the great majority of cases they will not have contributed in any way to the accident, for example, by contributory negligence or by choosing aviation as a mode of transport."" 
        
       
      
    117 He identified unsatisfactory features of the existing arrangements concerning damage caused by aircraft as being the limit on compensation available under the Rome Convention, that the Convention had been adhered to by few countries, and that it was unsatisfactory to have limited liability for damage by aircraft applying to some aircraft flying in Australian skies but not to others. In those circumstances, he announced an intention to denounce the Rome Convention.  
     
      
    118 As well, the Minister noted that not all States and Territories had legislation that imposed strict liability concerning damage by aircraft. The Minister urged those states that had not enacted legislation imposing strict liability (South Australia and Queensland) to do so, and stated that the new legislation would apply in the territories.  
     
      
    119 The DAA went further to achieve national uniformity in the legislation governing damage by aircraft than the Minister had specifically announced in the second reading speech. DAA relied on a much wider range of Commonwealth heads of power to identify the aircraft to which it applied than the Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act 1958 had done, and in that way significantly widened the scope of the aircraft to which Commonwealth legislation on the subject applied. Section 9 DAA stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This Act extends to each external Territory. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This Act does not apply in relation to a Defence Force aircraft. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) This Act applies to acts, omissions, matters and things within Australian territory. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Subject to subsection (2), this Act applies in relation to the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Commonwealth aircraft; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) aircraft owned by a foreign corporation or a trading or financial corporation (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) aircraft (including foreign aircraft) engaged in: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (i) international air navigation; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) air navigation in relation to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (iii) air navigation conducted by a foreign corporation or a trading or financial corporation (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution); or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (iv) air navigation to or from, or within, the Territories; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (v) landing at, or taking off from, a place acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    120 There was no examination of the circumstances by virtue of which the DAA was capable of applying to the aircraft involved in the present case, and both the trial and the appeal were conducted on the basis that the DAA was capable of applying to that aircraft. One reason for that may well be that the aircraft falls within section 9(4)(b) or section 9(4)(c)(iii) or both.  
     
      
       
      Limited Reading of “Caused By” Because of Limitation of Liability to Impact and Its Consequences? 
       
      
    121 ACQ and Aircair submit that the effect of the Act providing strict liability for impacts of the kind listed in section 10(1)(a)-(c) and the consequences of such impacts, is that it does not provide strict liability for loss suffered other than as a consequence of an impact. As the Minister explained in the second reading speech: 
     
      
       
        
        “Alleged minor damage from such incidents as tile movement from wake vortices, or trespass or nuisance claims from noise or vibrations and the like are not included.” 
        
       
      
    122 In this respect, the scope of operation of DAA is narrower than that of, for instance, the 1952 NSW Act which imposes strict liability where the loss or damage in question is caused by an aircraft while in flight, taking off or landing, or by a person in an aircraft in flight, taking off or landing, or by an article or person falling from an aircraft while in flight, taking off or landing. In Southgate Brownie J held that injuries suffered by a horse rider who was injured when her horse was frightened by a low flying helicopter were within the scope of the 1952 NSW Act. Damage caused in such a way, with no impact as part of the causal sequence by which the damage is sustained, would not now fall within DAA. Given the way in which DAA is now likely to cover most of the aircraft operating in Australian skies, a question may one day arise about whether DAA prevails, by virtue of section 109 Constitution, over the 1952 NSW Act in those situations that are covered by the language of both statutes, and in situations where an aircraft falls within the language of both DAA and the 1952 NSW Act but a loss falls within the provisions of the 1952 NSW Act but not within DAA. However, no such question arises in the present case.  
     
      
    123 The Minister in his second reading speech explained the limitation of liability to damage resulting from impact as being “… a balance against this comprehensive and relatively rigorous application of liability.”  
     
      
    124 Contrary to the submission of Aircair and ACQ, I do not see Parliament’s intention to limit the scope of liability to damage caused by impacts and the consequences of impacts as providing a reason for adopting a narrow reading of the phrase “caused by” in section 10.  
     
      
       
      Limited Reading of “Caused By” Because of Limitation of Liability to Aircraft In Flight? 
       
      
    125 Aircair and ACQ rely on the fact that the liability of DAA only attaches in relation to an aircraft “in flight”. Section 5 DAA defines precisely when it is that an aircraft is “in flight”. I see no reason why the need for an aircraft to be “in flight” before section 10(1) applies provides any reason to adopt a narrow reading of the phrase “caused by” in section 10(1). 
     
      
       
      Limited Reading of “Caused By” Because of Absence of Provision for Contributory Negligence? 
       
      
    126 Aircair and ACQ also submitted that there is no express provision in the DAA for contributory negligence, and that would be unexceptional if the construction for which those appellants contend was correct, as one could not think of any situation that would fall within that construction of the scope of section 10(1), and yet be one in which the person injured was guilty of contributory negligence.  
     
      
    127 The principle impliedly invoked here is one of statutory construction. In Ganter v Whalland [2001] NSWSC 1101; (2001) 54 NSWLR 122 at [35]-[36], 131 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A legitimate check for a court to use, in deciding whether an interpretation of a statute arrived at by grammatical analysis is indeed the correct interpretation, is to consider whether that interpretation produces practical results which are sensible, rather than: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “… ‘absurd’, ‘extraordinary’, ‘capricious’, ‘irrational’ or ‘obscure’”  
          ( 
          Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation 
           (1981) 147 CLR 297 
            
          at 321 
            
          per Mason and Wilson JJ).” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Jordan CJ expressed the same notion by saying “a court is entitled to pay the legislature the not excessive compliment of assuming that it intended to enact sense and not nonsense”: ( 
        Hall v Jones 
          
        (1942) 42 SR (NSW) 203 at 208). From the strength of the language which these judges employed to describe the sort of consequences which will cause a possible construction to be rejected, it is apparent that an anomaly arising from what, on all other tests of construction, is the correct construction of legislation, must be a very serious one, before the court is justified in using that anomaly as a reason for rejecting what otherwise seems the correct construction. Were courts to act otherwise, they would risk taking over the function of making policy choices which properly belongs to the legislature.” 
        
       
      
    128 As later appears (paras [144]-[180]) I have reached the conclusion that contributory negligence is not available as a defence to an action under DAA.  
     
      
    129 I do not see it as being a serious anomaly that the proper construction of the legislation leads to the conclusion that contributory negligence was not available as a partial answer to a claim for damages under section 11 DAA. There is nothing irrational in Parliament adopting a policy that participants in a particular industry should bear the consequences of mishaps arising from the operations of that industry. 
     
      
    130 As well, it is noticeable that the legislative predecessors of DAA made express provision for contributory negligence being a defence to the statutory action they created, while DAA says nothing about contributory negligence. The legislative predecessors to which I refer are the chain of English legislation from the Air Navigation Act 1920 onwards, the 1952 NSW Act and analogous legislation in some other States that was in force prior to the enactment of DAA (ss 30-31 Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic); ss 3-4 Damage By Aircraft Act 1963 (Tas); ss 4-5 Damage By Aircraft Act 1964 (WA)), and the Rome Convention as adopted and extended by the Civil Aviation (Damage By Aircraft) Act 1958 (Cth). An omission of this kind is commonly regarded as an indication that the omission reflects a deliberate attempt to alter the law. In the present case there are the various indications of intention, to which I have earlier referred, that DAA should improve the position of claimants for compensation by comparison with the law that had existed prior to DAA.  
     
      
    131 The English legislation of 1920 and the Australian State legislation that copied it all contained an exclusion of liability for trespass or nuisance by reason of the ordinary and legal flight of aircraft, as well as the imposition of strict liability in relation to certain kinds of damage caused by the operation of aircraft. In Glen v Korean Airlines Co Ltd [2003] EWHC 643 (QB); [2003] QB 1386 at [29], 1394 Simon J paraphrased the second reading speech given by the Minister who introduced the 1920 legislation, Mr W S Churchill MP, 
     
      
       
        
        “as being the reconciliation of the rights of land owners in the super-incumbent air with the practical necessities of civil aviation. The reconciliation was to be achieved by laying down the principle that no action would lie for aerial trespass or nuisance simply by reason of the aerial flight through the column of air; but that, where damage was done to any persons on the ground, the owner of the offending aircraft would be liable without forcing the injured person to prove negligence.” 
        
       
       
      It is not to the point that it is in any event not a trespass for an aircraft to pass over someone’s land at a height greater than the owner needs for the ordinary use and enjoyment of his or her land and the structures upon it:  
      Bernstein v Skyviews & General Ltd  
      [1978] 1 QB 479. 
       
      
    132 Achieving a trade-off between the rights of two different groups of people affected by a particular type of activity is a commonplace feature of legislation. Even if it were the case that much of the work formerly done by section 2(2) 1952 NSW Act and analogues in other States have been taken over, pursuant to section 109 Constitution, by DAA, section 2(1) would still remain effective. I see nothing anomalous in the federal Parliament having decided that the terms of the trade-off between the interests of land holders and members of the aviation industry with potential liability under DAA should be achieved on different terms to those of the previous legislation, not involving contributory negligence being a defence.  
     
      
    133 The Minister in the second reading speech relating to the DAA made express reference to contributory negligence (para [116] above), and did so not by saying that potential claimants under the Act will never engage in contributory negligence, but by saying that “in the great majority of cases” they will not have engaged in contributory negligence. I recognise that there are some aspects of the Minister’s speech that do not make this same distinction – he referred to the Act providing “prompt and adequate compensation for the innocent victims of air accidents” (4164), and the legislation assisting in providing compensation “for those members of the non-flying public unfortunate enough to be included among the victims of an air accident, through no choice or action of their own” (4165). These statements seem to me to be a reflection of the “great majority of cases” in which the legislation would operate. As with all the provisions of the Minister’s speech to which I have referred, reliance as an aid to construction can only be placed on them in accordance with section 15AB Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). 
     
      
    134 There is nothing irrational about a legislature failing to make special provision for a type of situation that it envisages may occur, when it envisages that it will occur fairly infrequently, so as not to justify special provision. Thus, that DAA does not have contributory negligence as a defence to a claim is not a reason for adopting the narrow construction of causation for which ACQ and Aircair contend.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion on Construction of “Caused By” in Section 10(1)(d)  
      DAA 
       
      
    135 I conclude that there is no reason to adopt the narrow construction of section 10(1) for which these appellants contend. 
     
      
    136 Article 1 of the Rome Convention had provided for there to be no right to compensation “if the damage is not a direct consequence of the incident giving rise thereto”. In my view, section 10(1)(d) DAA aims to alter this aspect of the previous law, and makes clear that it is not only the direct consequences of an impact that attract limited liability, but also indirect or consequential results of an impact. Such a construction is consistent with the language, the legislative history, and the purpose of DAA. 
     
      
    137 In March v E & M H Stramare Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; (1991) 171 CLR 506 the majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) endorsed, in the context of the tort of negligence, a test of causation whereby it was a question of fact to be answered by reference to commonsense and experience, and one into which considerations of policy and value judgments necessarily enter. When causation is so regarded, the law has no difficulty in recognising that there can be multiple causes of the one damage.  
     
      
    138 In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525 Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ held that the entitlement of a person who suffers loss or damage “by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of” certain identified provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). They held that the word “by” 
     
      
       
        
        “… clearly expresses the notion of causation without defining it or elucidating it. In this situation, s 82(1) should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation recently discussed by this court in  
        March v Stramare E & MH Pty Ltd  
        (1991) 171 CLR 506, except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act. Had Parliament intended to say something else, it would have been natural and easy to have said so.” 
        
       
      
    139 In my view, the understanding of the concept of causation that is expressed in March v Stramare should similarly be applied to the expression “caused by” in section 10(1) DAA. While the meaning that is given to an expression in one area of the law is not necessarily the same as the meaning given to that same expression in a different area of the law, I see nothing in the purpose for which a judgment about causal connection is made in the law of negligence that differentiates it from the purpose for which a judgment is made about causal connection for the purpose of the application of DAA. In both cases, the purpose is deciding how legal liability to pay damages for loss or damage should fall. Further, in DAA there is a particularly close connection between the way in which causation works to attribute that responsibility, and the way causation works in the law of negligence. It arises in section 11 DAA, where it provides that damages of a kind referred to in section 10 are recoverable “as if the injury, loss, damage or destruction had been caused by the wilful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants”. 
     
      
       
      Causal Connection Between Impact and Injuries? 
       
      
    140 In my view, the trial judge made no error in holding that there was a causal relationship between the impact and the injuries that Mr Cook sustained. It was the impact that created the situation that caused Mr Cook to be there at all. I recognise that that is not in itself sufficient to establish a causal connection. As Mason CJ said in March v Stramare at [21], 516,  
     
      
       
        
        “… a factor which secures the presence of the plaintiff at the place where and at the time when he or she is injured is not causally connected with the injury, unless the risk of the accident occurring at that time was greater.” 
        
       
      
    141 In the present case, the impact caused the conductor to be hanging low over a field that was uneven, extraordinarily boggy, and methodically strewn with obstacles in the form of the rows of cotton bushes. The conductor was extremely dangerous in itself; the impact caused it to be in a position where people were at risk of getting dangerously close to it, and Mr Cook was injured when he encountered that precise risk. The conductor itself was thin and difficult to see against an overcast sky. Mr Cook did not make a deliberate decision to come dangerously close to the conductor. Mr Cook’s conduct in entering the field to investigate the situation while the power was still turned on was something that, in itself, was not dangerous, provided he stayed sufficiently far from the conductor. His employer did not disapprove of Mr Cook having entered the field, even after the very serious consequences of his having done so were known. While inadvertence on the part of Mr Cook was clearly a contributory factor to his injuries, his inadvertence was not such as to make him the sole author of his own misfortune. The difficulty in keeping a clearance of at least one metre from the wire is clearly illustrated by the way that, even after Mr Cook’s accident, Mr Buddee needed to be warned to move away from the wire, and by the difficulties experienced by each of Mr Hyde and Mr Mason when they made their attempted re-enactments of Mr Cook’s journey. 
     
      
       
      Relationship of Finding of Causation to Finding of No Duty 
       
      
    142 This finding of causal connection is consistent with my earlier finding that no duty of care was owed by Aircair to Mr Cook. One of the functions of a duty of care in the law of negligence is to identify those circumstances in which a person is liable for the causal consequences of his or her action or failure to act. Those situations where a defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, and that duty has been breached, are a subclass of the circumstances in which a defendant’s action or failure to act has caused a loss to a plaintiff. It is only in relation to that subclass that legal liability can exist in negligence. The present case falls outside that subclass. 
     
      
    143 Further, there is a fundamental difference between the way one goes about establishing whether a duty of care exists, and the way one goes about deciding whether a loss is a consequence of an action of the defendant. Existence of a duty of care is decided as at the time the defendant is acting. It is a forward-looking, predictive activity, that involves predicting who are the people who could be affected by the contemplated action. Sometimes those people will be identifiable individually (as when a surgeon is about to operate on a particular person), sometimes they will be identifiable only as a class or by description. Another part of the inquiry involves ascertaining what possible consequences of harm to those people are reasonably foreseeable. Another part of the inquiry involves ascertaining whether reasonable care ought be required on the part of the actor to avoid that harm. By contrast, deciding that there is a causal link between a particular action and particular damage is carried out as at the date of the trial, with hindsight and the benefit of any investigation there may have been into the cause of the damage. 
     
      
       
      Application of the Law of Contributory Negligence 
       
      
    144 Part 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (the “1965 Act”), in the form relevant to these proceedings, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. In this Part: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          wrong 
           means an act or omission that:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) gives rise to a liability in tort in respect of which a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) amounts to a breach of a contractual duty of care that is concurrent and co-extensive with a duty of care in tort.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    145 Section 9 of the 1965 Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If a person (the  
        claimant 
        ) suffers damage as the result partly of the claimant’s failure to take reasonable care ( 
        contributory negligence 
        ) and partly of the wrong of any other person:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a claim in respect of the damage is not defeated by reason of the contributory negligence of the claimant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    146 The operation of these provisions is modified by Part 1A (which runs from section 5 to section 5T) Civil Liability Act. Relevant provisions of that Part are:

          In determining the extent of a reduction in damages by reason of contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100% if the court thinks it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages is defeated.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    147 Sections 5R and 5S Civil Liability Act commenced on 6 December 2002, well after Mr Cook sustained his injury. The whole of Part 1A Civil Liability Act was inserted as part of the amendments to the Civil Liability Act made by the Civil Liability (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002. However, the transitional provisions relating to those amendments provided that they extended to civil liability arising before the commencement of the amendments, but not to proceedings commenced in a court before the amendment (Civil Liability Act Schedule 1, Part 3, clause 6). As Mr Cook’s proceedings did not begin until 2004, these provisions of the Civil Liability Act are capable of applying to them, and will apply if the wording of the provisions is adequate to attach to Mr Cook’s proceedings. 
     
      
    148 Notwithstanding that the 1965 Act and the Civil Liability Act are State legislation, ACQ and Aircair submit that the provisions as to contributory negligence that they establish apply to the cause of action that arises under DAA, a Commonwealth law. The first, and uncontroversial, step in that argument is that because the claims made in the proceedings included a claim for damages arising under the DAA, the District Court was exercising federal jurisdiction in deciding the proceedings, and this Court is exercising federal jurisdiction in deciding the appeal. 
     
      
    149 The federal jurisdiction arises in this way. Section 76(ii) Constitution enables the Parliament to make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament. Section 39(2) Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) invests “the several Courts of the States” with federal jurisdiction in all matters in which original jurisdiction can be conferred upon the High Court (save for a presently irrelevant exception and restriction). Section 39(2) operated to confer on the District Court jurisdiction to decide the dispute arising under the DAA, and on this Court the jurisdiction to hear the appeal relating to that dispute. Even though the litigation involved claims that arose solely under the common law, once any aspect of the case involves the exercise of federal jurisdiction, the entirety of the jurisdiction exercised by that court is (again subject to a presently irrelevant exception) federal jurisdiction: Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39; (1971) 124 CLR 367 at 373. In exercising that federal jurisdiction, section 79 of the Judiciary Act applies. Section 79 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “State or Territory laws to govern where applicable 
        
       
       
        
        The laws of each State or Territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State or Territory in all cases to which they are applicable.” 
        
       
      
    150 The trial judge accepted that, by this route, any provisions of the Civil Liability Act that were “applicable” could be applied even to the claim for damages arising under DAA. That his Honour took that view is not a subject of controversy on this appeal. It was because he took that view that he used the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, rather than those of the common law, in assessing the quantum of damages that Mr Cook was entitled from ACQ and Aircair under section 11 DAA. 
     
      
    151 ACQ and Aircair argued that there were two separate routes by which contributory negligence came to be available in (on the first version of the argument) any action under DAA, or (on the second version of the argument) this particular action under DAA. 
     
      
    152 The first argument derives from sections 10 and 11 DAA. Just as the trial judge correctly held that the provisions of the Civil Liability Act relating to assessment of damages were applicable to the action that Mr Cook brought (notwithstanding the Civil Liability Act is a State statute) so, they submit, the provisions of section 79 Judiciary Act, and the terms of section 11 DAA itself make the State provisions concerning contributory negligence applicable, because those State provisions would be applicable in an action to recover damages for injury, loss, damages or destruction caused by the negligence of the defendant. 
     
      
    153 I do not find that argument persuasive. Section 10(1) identifies a type of injury, loss, damage or destruction by reference to both the location of the person or property who suffers it, and the cause of that injury, loss, damage or destruction. Section 11 creates a statutory cause of action, whereby damages in respect of such injury, loss, damage, or destruction are recoverable from certain identifiable people, and in an identified manner. That manner is: 
     
      
       
        
        “… without proof of intention, negligence or other cause of action,  
        as if 
         the injury, loss, damage or destruction had been caused by the wilful act, negligence, or default of the defendant or defendants.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    154 The phrase just quoted requires the statutory action for damages under section 11 to have the attributes of an action for recovery of damages in respect of an injury, loss, damage or destruction that had been caused by the wilful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants, save only that it is not necessary to prove intention, or negligence, or any other cause of action. State and Territory laws apply in all cases where federal jurisdiction is exercised “in all cases to which they are applicable”. One needs to identify something that makes a particular law “applicable” in a particular case.  
     
      
    155 An example can be found in the way the provisions of the Civil Liability Act concerning computation of damages for personal injuries come to apply to an action under DAA. The provisions of the Civil Liability Act that require a different method of computation of damages to that of the common law are contained in Part 2 of the Act. Section 11 defines “personal injury damages” as meaning “damages that relate to the death of or injury to a person”. Section 11A provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This Part applies to and in respect of an award of personal injury damages, except an award that is excluded from the operation of this Part by section 3B. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This Part applies regardless of whether the claim for the damages is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A court cannot award damages, or interest on damages, contrary to this Part.” 
        
       
      
    156 It is to be observed that the definition of “personal injury damages” is quite general, in that the damages are not restricted to damages arising on any particular cause of action, or any under any particular system of law. The provision in section 11A(2) that says the Part applies to actions “in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise” has the effect that the provisions of the Part are, in their terms, capable of applying to a cause of action for damages under DAA. The provisions of section 11A Civil Liability Act make “applicable” the provisions of Part 2 of that Act to an action for damages under DAA that is not excluded by section 3B. No provision of section 3B applies to Mr Cook’s actions for damages against ACQ and Aircair.  
     
      
    157 One needs to enquire whether there is anything that similarly makes ""applicable"" the law of contributory negligence in the type of action that section 11 says that the right to recover damages that it creates must model itself on, namely an action for recovery of damages in respect of an injury, loss, damage or destruction that has been caused by the wilful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants. I turn to that enquiry. 
     
      
    158 Section 5R and 5S Civil Liability Act presuppose that someone has been contributorily negligent. They operate to modify the way in which the law of contributory negligence operates under the 1965 Act rather than create by themselves any particular rights or defences. Thus, the scope within which section 5R and 5S can operate must be ascertained by first considering the 1965 Act.  
     
      
    159 Under section 9 of the 1965 Act, a defence of contributory negligence is available only in circumstances where the defendant has committed a “wrong”. An essential attribute of the definition of a “wrong” in section 8 of the 1965 Act is that it is an act or omission that gives rise to a liability in tort in respect of which a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law. Thus, it is necessary to inquire in what circumstances a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law. In particular it is necessary to enquire whether a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law in an action for recovery of damages in respect of an injury, loss, damage or destruction that has been caused by the wilful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants. 
     
      
    160 It is elementary that a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law in an action for recovery of damages in respect of an injury, etc, caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. The availability of a defence of contributory negligence in action for recovery of damages in respect of an injury, etc, caused by the “wilful act” or “default” of the defendant or defendants is more complex. 
     
      
    161 Glanville Williams, (Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1951) Stevens & Sons Limited at 197) identifies six different species of legal liability in relation to which he delineates the field of contributory negligence at common law. These are: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) torts of wrongful intention; (2) torts based on fault where the defendant did not, on the facts, cause the damage intentionally; (3) torts based on strict liability where the defendant, on the facts, acted negligently or the damage was accidental; (4) statutory duties of insurance; (5) unintentional breaches of contract; and (6) unintentional breaches of trust."" 
        
       
      
    162 Torts of wrongful intention he subcategorises into two kinds: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(a) torts based on intentional wrongdoing solely, ie, those that can be committed only intentionally, and (b) those based on fault or strict liability where the defendant on the facts caused the damage intentionally. (""Fault"" means, of course, either intention or negligence.)"" 
        
       
      
    163 Examination of Glanville Williams at 198-222 shows that when contributory negligence was available as a defence at common law is a matter of considerable complexity. For example, if the consequences of which the plaintiff complains were intended by the defendant, no defence of contributory negligence is available: Quinn v Leathem [1901] AC 495 at 537 per Lord Lindley. For the tort of deceit (which can be committed either intentionally or recklessly: Derry v Peek (1888) 14 App Cas 337) contributory negligence of a gullible plaintiff, or of a plaintiff who negligently failed to check the accuracy of the statement made, is not a defence: Central Railway Co of Venezuelan v Kisch (1867) LR 2 HL 99. However contributory negligence can be a defence to the unintended consequences of wilful wrongdoing: Butterfield v Forrester (1809) 11 East 60, 103 ER 926. It may also be a defence to an action against a master for the wilful tort of his servant, and to an action based on strict liability where the loss was caused through the wilful tort of the defendant’s servant: Bradley v Waterhouse (1828) M & M 154, 173 ER 1114, 3 Car & P 318, 172 ER 438. The situation may be different where the plaintiff actually intends to bring the damage on himself, rather than merely being careless of his own interests. A person whose goods are stolen after he or she has been careless for their safety can nonetheless recover them, or their value, from a bona fide purchaser from the thief: Scholfield v Earl of Londesborough [1896] AC 514 at 522 (an intentional tort in that proof of an action or actions by the defendant showing an intention to assert dominion over the goods would be an essential part of the plaintiff's case). These examples by no means exhaust the complexity of the topic. More recent authority continues to assert that there is no invariable rule about whether contributory negligence is a defence to a tort based on the wilful action of the defendant: State of NSW v Riley [2003] NSWCA 208; (2003) 57 NSWLR 496 at [104]-[106], 522-523; Elite Protective Personnel Pty Ltd v Salmon [2007] NSWCA 322 at [25]; Lane v Holloway (1968) 1 QB 379 at 392-393; Dura Constructions (Aust) Pty Ltd v Dovigi [2004] VSC 252 at [67]-[68]; Australian Guarantee Corporation Ltd v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1989] VR 617 at 637-638; P Vout (ed), Torts: The Laws of Australia, 2nd ed (2007) Thomson Legal & Regulatory Group par [33.9 .600]; J G Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed (1998) LBC Information Services at 316 ff; F Trindale & P Cane The Law of Torts in Australia, 4th ed (2007) Oxford University Press at 688-689; Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 19th ed (2006) Sweet & Maxwell par [3.36]-[3.49]. 
     
      
    164 The relevant point, for present purposes, is that contributory negligence is sometimes available at common law in relation to an action to recover damages for injury, loss, damage or destruction caused by a wilful act of the defendant, and sometimes it is not. 
     
      
    165 The meaning of “default” in section 11 can be ascertained when one recognises that the elements of the phrase “without proof of intention, negligence or other cause of action” in section 11 are echoed by the phrase “caused by the wilful act, negligence or default”. So understood, “default” is a cause of action other than one requiring intention or negligence. Section 11 is quite unspecific about the nature of that cause of action, and so it is impossible to say whether a defence of contributory negligence would apply to it or not.  
     
      
    166 The wording of section 11 is quite indifferent as to whether the statutory cause of action it creates should operate “as if” the injury, etc had been caused by a wilful act, had been caused by negligence, or had been caused by “default”. I see no reason for Parliament to have intended that either a plaintiff, or a defendant, ought be in a position to choose whichever one of “wilful act, negligence or default” might suit their interests – the meaning of a statutory provision does not change with the choice of any individual who might seek to apply it. Rather, the requirement of section 11 that the action for damages that it creates should operate as if the injury, etc, had been caused by the wilful act negligence or default of the defendant or defendants requires the action under section 11 to have those features that are common to actions to recover damages for an injury, etc, caused by the wilful act, negligence or default of the defendant or defendants.  
     
      
    167 Section 79 Judiciary Act is in that situation not sufficient to enable a defence of contributory negligence to become available in an action under section 11. The wording of section 11 is inadequate to perform the task of making contributory negligence “applicable” as a defence to all actions for damages under DAA.  
     
      
    168 An alternative submission is that contributory negligence is available in this particular action. The argument is that the claim in the present case is a claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, that is brought under statute, and thus falls within section 5A Civil Liability Act. As I understand the argument of ACQ and Aircair, it is that the definition of “negligence” in section 5 Civil Liability Act makes clear that in section 5A the word “negligence” does not refer to the tort of negligence, but to a mode of human behaviour. ACQ and Aircair submit that, even though the cause of action sued on is a statutory cause of action under section 11, it is still a claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, ie, a claim for damages for harm resulting from Mr Stubbs’ failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in flying the plane, or perhaps a claim for damages for harm resulting from NorthPower’s breach of its duty of care to Mr Cook, and therefore the provisions of the Civil Liability Act relating to contributory negligence apply to that claim. They draw attention to the remarks of Ipp JA (with whom Giles and Tobias JJA agreed) in Booksan Pty Ltd v Wehbe [2006] NSWCA 3; (2006) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-830 at [166]-[167];  
     
      
       
        
        “Section 5A, by its express words, makes Pt 1A of the  
        Civil Liability Act 
         applicable to any claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, regardless of whether the claim is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise. The effect of this provision must be seen in the context of the repeal of the 1945 Act and s 7(1) of the 1965 Act resulting in contributory negligence once more becoming a defence to a claim for breach of statutory duty. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion the consequences of the repeal of the 1945 Act and s 7(1) of the 1965 Act, and the insertion of s 5A into the  
        Civil Liability Act 
        , are clear. Irrespective of how a claim is formulated, if — in substance — it is a claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, a defence of contributory negligence may be raised to that claim even if it is based on a breach of statutory duty. Division 8 of Pt 1A of the  
        Civil Liability Act 
         (which sets out principles applicable to contributory negligence) will then apply to that defence.” 
        
       
      
    169 Ipp JA’s reference to “the repeal of the 1945 Act” in that passage relates to the way in which contributory negligence had once been a defence at common law to a claim for a tort of breach of statutory duty: Piro v W Foster & Co Ltd [1943] HCA 32; (1943) 68 CLR 313. The effect of Piro in New South Wales was reversed by the Statutory Duties (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (“the 1945 Act”). The 1945 Act was itself repealed by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002. That repeal had the effect of reinstating the availability of contributory negligence as a defence to an action for the tort of breach of statutory duty. However, as reinstated it was subject to the provisions of the 1965 Act, under which contributory negligence was no longer a total defence, but led to apportionment. Booksan v Wehbe held that the effect of Part 1A of the Civil Liability Act was to introduce the defence of contributory negligence for breaches of statutory duties.  
     
      
    170 However, Booksan v Wehbe also went on to hold, at [172]-[173] that the retrospective effect given by Clause 6, of Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the Civil Liability Act to the amendments made by the 2002 Amending Act applied only to the amendments that were made by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act to the Civil Liability Act itself, and did not apply to the repeal of the 1945 Act. Thus the provision in the 2002 Amending Act that made that repeal should be interpreted having regard to ss 30(1)(c) and 30(1)(e) Interpretation Act 1987. As so construed, contributory negligence is only available as a defence to causes of action for beach of statutory duty that accrued after the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act took effect on 6 December 2002.  
     
      
    171 As Mr Cook’s cause of action under section 11 DAA arose on the day he was injured, the repeal of the Contributory Negligence (Statutory Duties) Act 1945 would not apply to his cause of action, if it were an action for breach of statutory duty. 
     
      
    172 But there is a question about whether the cause of action arising under section 11 DAA should be regarded as giving rise to a tort of breach of statutory duty at all. The trial judge said that it was not a cause of action for breach of statutory duty, but rather an action that arises by application of the statute. As to that, see Proctor v Jetway Aviation [1982] 2 NSWLR 264 at 276 per Cross J (a decision reversed by the Court of Appeal at [1984] 1 NSWLR 166, but without commenting on this passage of Cross J’s judgment), and as to the tort of breach of statutory duty see generally J C Campbell, “Contribution, Contributory Negligence and Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act” (1993) 67 ALR 87 at 93-108, 177-185. The essence of an action for breach of statutory duty is expressed in the terms in which the 1945 Act repealed contributory negligence as a defence to actions for personal injury based on such a cause of action:  
     
      
       
        
        “… an action for damages for that injury founded on a breach of a statutory duty imposed on the defendant for the benefit of a class of persons of which the person so injured was a member at the time the injury was sustained.” 
        
       
      
    173 That definition does not apply to DAA. DAA does not impose a statutory duty on anyone to act in any particular way. All that it says is that damages are recoverable by a particular type of person, from a particular type of person, if events of a particular description happen. As well, given the scope of section 10(1)(d) DAA, there is room for argument (which I need not resolve) about whether DAA operates “for the benefit of a class of persons”. In my view the trial judge was right in holding that an action under section 11 was not a cause of action for breach of statutory duty. Thus, the remarks of Ipp JA quoted above from Booksan v Wehbe do not bear upon an action for damages under DAA. 
     
      
    174 The balance of authority supports the view that the action for damages conferred by section 82 Trade Practices Act is not an action in tort, notwithstanding that it expressly confers a remedy for a breach of a standard of action that the Trade Practices Act itself requires to be adhered to: Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd (1998) 83 FCR 1 at 11; Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69; (1998) 196 CLR 494 at [17] 503-504, [38] 510, [40] 512; Hampic Pty Ltd v Adams [1999] NSWCA 455 at [61]. Until Part VIAA was introduced into the Trade Practices Act in 2004, the action for damages conferred by section 82 of that Act was not one in which damages could be reduced if the applicant’s conduct had contributed to the loss or damage: I & L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41; (2002) 210 CLR 109. Similarly, when the action for damages under DAA is not for the breach of the tort of statutory duty, but is the enforcement of an expressly conferred statutory right of action, circumstances that fell within section 10(1) DAA would not be a “wrong” within the meaning of section 8(a) of the 1965 Act because they would not involve an act or omission that gave rise to a liability in tort. Nor would there be a liability in respect of which a defence of contributory negligence was available at common law. The wording of section 8(b) of the 1965 Act clearly does not apply to the action under DAA. Thus, such an action is not a “wrong” within the meaning of the 1965 Act. 
     
      
    175 Indeed, when DAA does not require any particular standard of action to be adhered to, the situation is a fortiori that covering the Trade Practices Act. 
     
      
    176 If it were the case that the damages Mr Cook claimed were for damages for harm resulting from Mr Stubbs’ failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in flying the plane, or resulting from NorthPower’s breach of duty, the cause of action under DAA would fall within section 5A(1) Civil Liability Act. However, having fallen there, section 5R and 5S would have no work to do in relation to it, because section 5R and 5S presuppose that the 1965 Act applies to the type of claims with which they deal. Thus, even in the hypothetical situation I am considering, a defence of contributory negligence would not be available in relation to an action under DAA. 
     
      
    177 In those circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether the claim is actually a claim for damages for harm resulting from Mr Stubbs’ failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in flying the plane. ACQ and Aircair argued forcefully that no want of care and skill on the part of Mr Stubbs had been proved. On the view I take, it is unnecessary to enter into that factual question. 
     
      
    178 In Southgate, Brownie J held that the 1965 Act applied to an action for damages that was brought under the 1952 NSW Act. At that time, the provision of the 1965 Act that governed the availability of contributory negligence was worded differently to its present version. Then, section 10(1) of the 1965 Act stated the circumstance in which apportionment could occur as being: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons …"" 
        
       
       
      As well there was a definition of  
      ""fault"" 
       which differed from the present definition of  
      ""wrong"" 
      . 
       
      
    179 Brownie J said, at 190-191: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… it seems to me that the liability of an aircraft owner under the  
        Damage by Aircraft Act 
        , s 2(2), and its equivalents, based as it is solely upon the fact that the owner's aircraft, whilst in flight, caused damage to the plaintiff, is “fault”, as defined in the  
        Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) 
          
        Act 
         1965, s 9 (and its equivalents), viz “negligence, or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in tort or would, apart from this Part, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence but does not mean or include a breach of statutory duty”. The liability under s 2(2) is not in my view a liability in respect of a “breach of statutory duty”. It is rather a liability imposed by the statute in the factual circumstances I have just mentioned.” 
        
       
      
    180 That reasoning is, with respect, correct. The then definition of “fault” was satisfied if there was an act or omission that would, apart from “this Part”, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence. The terms of the 1952 NSW Act expressly make contributory negligence a defence. Thus, if an act or omission of a plaintiff had contributed to that plaintiff's own injury, that act or omission of the plaintiff fell within the definition of “fault” as it then existed. As well, the act or omission of the defendant, that contributed along with the act or omission of the plaintiff to the plaintiff’s eventual injury, was an “other act or omission which … would, apart from this Part, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence”, because contributory negligence requires the act or omission of both plaintiff and defendant to make a causal contribution to the eventual injury. In this way, there was “fault” of both the plaintiff and the defendant, and so the statutory apportionment could operate in Southgate. The reasons why I conclude that contributory negligence is not a defence to an action under DAA have as important elements the fact that DAA does not expressly make contributory negligence a defence, and the present definition of “wrong” in the 1965 Act, both matters concerning which the legislation I am considering differs from that considered by Brownie J. 
     
      
       
      Voluntary Assumption of Risk 
       
      
    181 Because of the provisions of 151O Workers Compensation Act 1987, a defence of voluntary assumption of risk was not available in Mr Cook’s action for damages against NorthPower. The trial judge assumed that a defence of voluntary assumption of risk was available to Aircair and ACQ, but held that, on the facts that defence was not made out. He did not give any separate consideration to how such an alleged defence might operate concerning the tort of negligence, and concerning the statutory liability under DAA. 
     
      
    182 The submissions of ACQ and Aircair on the appeal likewise did not differentiate between how an alleged defence of voluntary assumption of risk might operate in relation to the action for the tort of negligence, and in relation to the statutory liability under DAA. Rather, the submissions dealt with the trial judge’s reasoning on this topic on his Honour’s own terms.  
     
      
    183 When I have held that Aircair owes no duty of care to Mr Cook, and hence that no tort of negligence was committed by it, voluntary assumption of risk could enter into the picture only if it were a defence to DAA. 
     
      
    184 When DAA does not create a liability in tort, and says nothing in its terms about voluntary assumption of risk being a defence to the action, I have some difficulty in seeing how, as a matter of law, it could even possibly be a defence in a way that was separate to an inquiry into whether the damage was caused by one of the events in section 10(1)(a)-(d). However, no submissions were addressed, on the appeal, to this matter of law. Thus I, likewise, shall simply consider whether, if voluntary assumption of risk were a defence to the action under DAA, the conditions for its application apply here. I make clear that by taking this course I give no encouragement whatever to the notion that voluntary assumption of risk actually is a defence to that action. 
     
      
    185 In Monie v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWCA 230 at [74]-[76] I said (with the assent of Mason P and Beazley JA): 
     
      
       
        
        “The justification for the defence of voluntary assumption of risk was explained by Lord Herschell in  
        Smith v Baker & Sons 
         [1891] AC 325 at 360 as being: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          One who has invited or assented to an act being done towards him cannot, when he suffers from it, complain of it as a wrong. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Voluntary assumption of a risk involves consenting to the particular thing being done which would involve the risk:  
        Smith v Baker & Sons 
          
        (at 338). Mere knowledge that a risk exists is not the same as consenting to the risk:  
        Smith v Baker & Sons 
         (at 337, 362);  
        Letang v Ottawa Electric Railway Co 
         [1926] AC 725 at 730. As well, before the defence applies, ""the whole risk"" must be voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff:  
        Smith v Baker & Sons 
         (at 337). ""There must be an assent to undertake the risk with the full appreciation of its extent"":  
        Smith v Baker & Sons 
         (at 369 per Lord Morris). The defence applies only when "" … the plaintiff freely and voluntary, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk he ran, … agreed to incur it"": per Wills J,  
        Osborne v London and North Western Railway Co 
          
        (1888) 21 QBD 220 at 224, approved in  
        Letang v Ottawa Electric Railway Co 
         (at 731). In  
        Roggenkamp v Bennett 
         (1950) 80 CLR 292 at 300 a majority of the High Court (McTiernan and Williams JJ), quoting Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2nd ed, vol 23, at pp 716–718, said that before the defence applied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … the plaintiff must be shown not only to have perceived the existence of the danger, for this alone would be insufficient, but also that he fully appreciated it and voluntary accepted the risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Randwick City Council v Muzic 
         [2006] NSWCA 66 at [48], Hunt AJA (with whom Handley and Ipp JJA agreed) said that before a defence of voluntary assumption of risk applies, a defendant: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … must establish that the plaintiff perceived the existence of the danger, that he fully appreciated it and that he voluntarily agreed to accept the risk:  
          Roggenkamp v Bennett 
            
          (1950) 80 CLR 292 per McTiernan & Williams JJ (at 300),  
          Hadland v Council of the City of Blacktown 
           (Court of Appeal, 21 May 1997 unreported) per Clarke AJA (Grove AJA agreeing) and  
          Canterbury Municipal Council v Taylor 
           [2002] NSWCA 24 per Ipp AJA (Spigelman CJ & Mathews AJA agreeing) at [141]–[148].”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    186 Applying those principles to the present case, one particular risk of which Mr Cook was well aware was of the danger of electrocution if he came within one metre of the conductor. However, he did not assent to coming that close to the conductor – he came to be there by inadvertence. As the facts of the case sadly show, Mr Cook also underwent a risk that in entering the field, with the extremely difficult conditions that it provided, he might by inadvertence get too close to the conductor. I am not satisfied that he assented to undertaking that risk with the full appreciation of its extent.  
     
      
    187 In my view, even if as a matter of law it were available, the defence of voluntary assumption of risk would fail. 
     
      
       
      Negligence of NorthPower 
       
      
    188 At the trial Mr Menzies QC articulated the plaintiff’s case against NorthPower as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the only safe way of dealing with the circumstances which arose here was to turn the power off first. Why? Because of the dangers that were inherent in [not doing so] 
        
       
       
        
        So far as the clearance distances are concerned, it’s a matter of no concern to us that it flashes only a relatively short distance, for this reason: the flaw in the system which said “maintain a distance of a metre” was that it failed to take into account that this could inadvertently be breached in circumstances short of negligence; and certainly in circumstances of negligence … [W]hat they should have done was have a system that said this: “In a circumstance where you might come too close to the line, for goodness’ sake, you are not to go on the site until you turn the power off first.” It’s absolutely perfectly plain and, whatever view one takes of the evidence, that’s not what any of them were told or were ever told. 
        
       
       
        
        The second point about it is that, if one does go onto a site, just remember that the clearance of a metre can easily be compromised by a fall or a stumble, even if you’re a metre away.”  
        
       
      
    189 Mr Menzies’ reference to “it flashes only a relatively short distance” was to uncontested evidence from Professor Stillman that flashover could occur only if a person or object came within 60mm of a 22kv conductor. Thus, requiring a clearance distance of 1 metre in itself provided some margin for error. 
     
      
    190 The claim that Mr Cook brought against NorthPower was one concerning which damages would be assessed under the modified common law provisions contained in Division 3 of Part 5 of the Workers Compensation Act. It is common ground that therefore the whole of the Civil Liability Act does not apply to it: section 3B(1)(f) Civil Liability Act. 
     
      
    191 The trial judge found that NorthPower was negligent in two respects. The first was by failing to isolate the line remotely prior to the arrival of Mr Buddee and Mr Cook. The second was by inadequate training of Mr Cook concerning maintaining clearances. 
     
      
       
      Failure to Isolate the Line 
       
      
    192 The trial judge’s reasoning concerning failure to remotely isolate the line prior to the arrival of Mr Buddee and Mr Cook was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [A]fter the conductor was dislodged, it was swinging about across the field: (T 196.29). It was difficult to see in the particular conditions; there were people in the vicinity who were “ducking under the downed conductor”; and even Mr Mackay had to be warned away by Mr Buddee. Mr Cartwright rang Mr Mackay, who in turn rang NorthPower to inform it the line was down. There was no evidence as to what NorthPower was or was not otherwise aware. The risk of harm from the energised line swaying across the field at head height was clearly foreseeable. In my view it would not have been a disproportionate response for NorthPower to have remotely isolated the conductor from Port Macquarie, until the arrival of the two linesmen it dispatched to assess the situation. The line, or some part of it, was always going to need to be isolated. Any relative increase in time out or customers affected by remote isolation was in my view the required, proportionate, response to the danger.” 
        
       
      
    193 Professor Stillman expressed a view in his report that NorthPower should have isolated the line remotely. He expressed the view in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a basic and inviolable principle in the operation of an electric power system, no matter the operational voltage, that an overhead power line once energised and made live remains and is treated as  
        “live” 
         until made  
        “dead” 
         by being isolated or disconnected from all possible other sources of electricity and is visibly earthed at the point of isolation. Only when a line is considered safe having been isolated and earthed, then the procedure is for those who are to work on the line to observe and to know there is an open point and then to sign on to an access permit and on arriving at the work site to put in place visual working earths. 
        
       
       
        
        Based on the above principle it would have been expected that the instructions received by Buddee and Cook when they were sent to attend the fault was that system control would have de-activated the line by supervisory remote control and informed them so. This at least would have given some measure of safety to any one of the public, such as farm workers, who may have been in or near the line conductor. The next step would have been to direct Buddee and Cook to the isolating links located 7 kms from the fault site, where an open point would have been established and indicative earths placed on the load side conductors. None of this procedure was followed until after the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        If this procedure had been followed Cook would not have been placed at risk and subsequent injury.” 
        
       
      
    194 He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “The supervisory procedure adopted by NorthPower once they were informed of the line being down, breached the basic operational principle of deactivating, isolating and earthing prior to any inspection and repair. NorthPower should have isolated the line by remote supervisory control as a simple precaution in respect of the safety of local farm personnel and then directed Buddee and Cook to open, and isolate and earth the line at the links, rather than having it done after the event. If this procedure had been followed Cook would not have been placed at risk and subsequent injury.” 
        
       
      
    195 In cross-examination Professor Stillman had put to him a hypothetical situation in which an electricity authority received: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a report of a line down in a cotton field without any suggestion of danger to any person, okay? Nobody is threatened, there are no workers in the field and so on. It’s not threatening the farmhouse or the barn or the livestock.” 
        
       
      
    196 Professor Stillman agreed that, faced with that situation, the appropriate course for the electricity authority to take was to send out an experienced person to check the situation, and that one would not isolate the line before the experienced person got there. However, he saw the difference between that situation and that of the present case as being that in the present case: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it was reported by one of the personnel employed by Milo Foods. So consequently I came to the conclusion that there would be other people in the area and as there was, there was Mr James, the person involved with the aircraft people and Mr Cartwright. And so I considered that there were people at risk.” 
        
       
      
    197 He denied that concluding that people must be at risk from the fact that a man from the farm phoned in involved an unjustified leap, saying “no, it’s based on my own experience”. When Professor Stillman’s experience covered actually working on power distribution networks, and holding a senior managerial position in an electricity distribution authority, as well as impressive academic qualifications in electrical engineering, I find that response persuasive.  
     
      
    198 Professor Stillman’s cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The isolating of the line in that circumstance would be to protect the Milo man and his co-workers. Correct? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Wouldn’t be aimed at protecting the Country Energy employees going out to check the line, would it? 
         
        A. Well, it – any person that -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It may have that effect. 
         
        A. Its ultimate effect would be to protect anybody that came within the vicinity of the live line. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, but if there was no concern about the danger of people on the ground when the report comes in, then as I think you’ve already agreed, it would be appropriate to send out your employees to see what’s going on. 
         
        A. I agree.” 
        
       
      
    199 Professor Stillman agreed that the qualifications of Mr Cook were such that he was an appropriate man for an electricity authority to send to deal with the situation. 
     
      
    200 Mr Cook himself accepted in cross-examination that it would be “ridiculous” that if every time there was a call about a fault in a line, the whole line was switched off. He accepted that if electricity workers arrived at a site and found that it created a danger, it was open to them to use their radio contact with Port Macquarie to ask for the line to be switched off remotely.  
     
      
    201 From the evidence I have quoted it can be seen that in Professor Stillman’s view it was the presence of the farm workers that made the difference between whether NorthPower should have deactivated the line before Mr Cook and Mr Buddee arrived, and whether it could have left the line alive until Mr Cook and Mr Buddee had the chance to assess the situation. It is as though, in response to a question “bearing in mind all the people who NorthPower had reason to believe could be affected by the line remaining live, what should NorthPower have done about de-activating the line” that Professor Stillman gave an answer “Northpower should have de-activated it”. But that is not the right question to ask in deciding whether, by failing to de-activate the line, NorthPower breached its undoubted duty to take reasonable care for the safety of its employee Mr Cook. That failure to isolate the line might have been a breach of NorthPower’s duty to farm workers in the field, does not answer the question of whether it was a breach of NorthPower’s duty to Mr Cook, given the special training and experience that Mr Cook had. If NorthPower had reason to believe that Mr Cook was properly trained and experienced, and thus well able to assess for himself how to deal with any danger resulting from the wire being live when he arrived at the site, reasoning similar to that in O’Connor would lead to the conclusion that there was no breach of duty to Mr Cook in failing to isolate the power before he arrived. I therefore turn to the question of whether his training and experience was adequate. 
     
      
       
      Training 
       
      
    202 The trial judge found that the evidence was “motley” concerning training about how linesmen were to work in the field. He found: 
     
      
       
        
        “Linesmen were trained to maintain clearances from live conductors in all circumstances. They were also trained to isolate and earth conductors before actually working on them. There was also a system for completion of a written risk assessment to be completed before starting work, but this was only to be finalised after isolation and earthing. Less clear, however, were the requirements involved in approaching live conductors and assessing risk prior to isolation, other than the clearance rule. And missing altogether was evidence as to the criteria to be applied as to when to isolate to a live conductor and in what circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    203 The trial judge’s finding concerning inadequate training was (at [53]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The training received by Mr Cook as to maintaining clearances was ambiguous. On the one hand he was acutely aware of the requirement to maintain a minimum clearance of one metre before working on a line until it was isolated and earthed. On the other hand there was no clear procedure by which he had been trained to keep well clear of the line before carrying out an assessment of the work required. Nor had he been trained as to how the clearance was to be calculated or observed. In adverse conditions, such as were present here, not very much was required for that one metre clearance to be compromised. Inadvertence, through fatigue, tripping or falling, or misjudgement in conditions of poor visibility, were all reasonably foreseeable concomitants of establishing, through training and instruction, a safe clearance, and how to apply it. The requirement should have been to require linesmen in these circumstances to stay well clear of the line until isolated, sufficiently far away to take account of inadvertence.” 
        
       
      
    204 Mr Cook had never been given any specific instructions by his employer about how to deal with muddy or wet conditions. In cross-examination he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You didn’t actually need any, did you? I mean, you knew that you take into account mud. 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You knew that you take into account wet conditions. 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And your employer giving you any warning along that line was something you already knew. Do you agree? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    205 Those questions were quite general, and imprecise, and leave unexplored whether he knew what he should do, in circumstances like those in the field on the day of the accident to “take into account” mud, or wet conditions. The questions did not address the other hazard that Mr Cook would have encountered, just as Mr Hyde encountered it (para [58] above), that of moving through cotton bushes at least knee-high on which one can get snagged on the roots and stalks. I would not base a finding of no breach of duty on Mr Cook’s answers to the questions.  
     
      
    206 The rule that had been drilled into Mr Cook was that he should maintain a minimum one-metre clearance from a conductor of this type. The trial judge’s conclusion about the mechanism of Mr Cook’s fall (para [64] above) is to the effect that, so far as Mr Cook was making deliberate movements, he maintained at least a one metre clearance. 
     
      
    207 NorthPower’s own assessment of Mr Cook’s accident led it to issue a document to all its relevant staff, that explicitly stated that in some circumstances the minimum may not be enough (para [63] above). The particular circumstances that it identified in that document, of the conductor moving a bit in the wind, or having one strand spring out, so that the minimum was not enough, are not shown to have been operative in the present case. Indeed, the proper conclusion from the evidence is that, had Mr Cook maintained a clearance of one metre from the line, no harm would have befallen him. 
     
      
    208 I have some difficulty in understanding just what a “clear procedure by which … to keep well clear of the line” would amount to, or what training in “how the clearance was to be calculated or observed” could consist in. No example of such a procedure, or such training, was given by the judge, or provided in the evidence, or in submissions. It is not suggested that the one metre distance could or should be measured – placing a measuring device on or near the line would itself involve breaching the clearance. Necessarily, the clearance is to be ascertained by estimation, based on observations in the field, not by measurement.  
     
      
    209 Mr Cook was well aware of the potential danger that the line posed. The clearance was always expressed in terms of a minimum distance that should be maintained from the line. In my view, the danger of the clearance being breached if a linesman tripped and fell, whether because of the mud, or through being tripped by a cotton bush branch or root, is an obvious one. The particular conditions that Mr Cook encountered in the field on the day were most unusually arduous ones. However in my view it is reasonable for an employer to leave to the man in the field the task of assessment of such conditions, and what the appropriate response to them should be to ensure that one stayed at least a metre from the line.  
     
      
    210 Mr Cook was clearly aware that his first priority was always expected to be his own safety. If, on walking some distance into the cotton field he found that the going was too difficult for him to be confident about maintaining the clearance, or if the conditions were such that he could not get and keep a clear view of where the line was, it was always an available alternative for him to give up, return to his vehicle and wait for Mr Buddee’s return, or if there was some particular urgency to get the repair job finished (as there was not in the present case) to contact Port Macquarie by radio and ask to have the power turned off remotely.  
     
      
    211 In my view NorthPower was not in breach of its duty of care to Mr Cook through providing him with inadequate training. And, when the employer had no cause to believe that Mr Cook was inadequately trained or insufficiently experienced, neither was NorthPower in breach of its duty of care by failing to isolate the line remotely before the arrival of Mr Cook. 
     
      
    212 In these circumstances, the judgment against NorthPower cannot stand. NorthPower’s entitlement to any contribution towards any such judgment likewise falls away, and it is unnecessary to consider the extent to which Mr Cook’s injury was caused by his own contributory negligence. There is also no question of either ACQ or Aircair being able to claim contribution from NorthPower (either under the 1946 Act or under the general law) on the basis that NorthPower has a liability to pay the same damages as ACQ and Aircair are liable to pay. When there is no question of contribution being payable by NorthPower, no question arises of whether the damages that Mr Cook can recover from ACQ and Aircair ought be reduced under the provisions of section 151Z(2)(c) Workers Compensation Act. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    213 The result of the reasoning so far is that Mr Cook retains his judgments against ACQ and Aircair, but is not entitled to a judgment against NorthPower. When NorthPower has no liability to Mr Cook, it cannot retain its judgment against Aircair, as NorthPower’s judgment against Aircair was one requiring Aircair to make contribution to the liability of NorthPower to Mr Cook.  
     
      
    214 I mentioned at the outset of this judgment that there are four appeals involved in this matter. An appeal was lodged by each of ACQ, Aircair, NorthPower, and Mr Cook. Each of those appeals was from the one judgment in the court below. That judgment in the court below had been given in a single set of proceedings, in which Mr Cook sued ACQ, Aircair, and NorthPower. There were cross-claims in those proceedings, in which ACQ and Aircair sought contribution from NorthPower, and vice versa.  
     
      
    215 Notwithstanding that there were four separate appeals, in substance the hearing of the appeals was a single proceeding. ACQ and Aircair have at all times acted by the one set of solicitors and counsel. In my preliminary view, it may be appropriate to make costs orders concerning the appeals on a basis that aggregates the costs of the four separate appeals. 
     
      
    216 It is also my preliminary view that, on the assumption that there are no offers of compromise or Calderbank letters, and nothing else that is not contained in the appeal books that might influence a proper order as to costs, it may be appropriate for the costs of the combined appeals, and of the proceedings in the court below, to follow each respective event. 
     
      
    217 There were numerous issues raised and argued in the appeals of ACQ and Aircair that it was not necessary to decide. Those are the issues identified as (vi)-(x) inclusive in para [23] above. When the reason for it not being necessary to decide those issues is that all those issues depended upon NorthPower having a liability to Mr Cook, when NorthPower succeeded in its appeal against there being any such liability (an appeal to which Aircair, as well as Mr Cook, were respondents) I at present see no reason why the cost of arguing those issues should not be treated as part of the general costs of the combined appeal.  
     
      
    218 Likewise, it was not necessary to address issue (xii) identified in para [23] above, because of NorthPower succeeding in its appeal against having a liability to Mr Cook. Again, my preliminary view is that the costs of that issue might properly be disposed of as part of the general costs of the combined appeal. 
     
      
    219 As the costs orders have some complexity, and the parties have not had the opportunity to address what might be the appropriate orders in light of the findings that the Court has made, the preferable course is not to make costs orders at this stage. Rather, the parties should be given the opportunity of agreeing, or alternatively of formulating the costs orders each party submits is appropriate, in light of the findings of the Court so far. If the parties are unable to agree on the appropriate orders, I shall direct the exchange of written submissions concerning costs. I do not at present envisage that a further oral hearing concerning costs would be necessary, but if any party is of a different view, I shall reserve liberty to each party to apply, at its own risk as to costs, for a further oral hearing on the question of costs. 
     
      
    220 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      Appeals of ACQ and Aircair (40302/07 and 40303/07)

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the District Court. In order to give appropriate context it is desirable to recount some of the circumstances. The victim was the applicant’s wife. They had been together for over 40 years, however the relationship had deteriorated and in April 2004 at Parramatta Local Court an apprehended domestic violence order (ADVO) was issued against the applicant for the protection of his wife. That order did not restrict their continuing to share the premises which had been their matrimonial home. 
     
      
    3 However, on 31 December 2004 the applicant was charged with two counts of common assault and three counts of contravening the ADVO. He was bailed on conditions which included not approaching or contacting his wife or being within 500 metres of the premises where they had both formerly resided. Despite these conditions the applicant wrote a number of letters to her, two of which were delivered by a family member and others were found by the victim left in and about the house. 
     
      
    4 On Thursday evening 27 January 2005 the applicant’s wife attended a birthday celebration at the house of a friend in a nearby suburb. She arrived home shortly after 9 pm. She found that there had been left an old letter from the applicant together with a packet of photographs. She attended to having a cup of coffee and making a telephone call, after which she went to use an en suite facility attached to the main bedroom of the house. 
     
      
    5 As she emerged from the en suite she went to close the door of a walk in wardrobe which she noticed was opened, and, as she was turning on a light the applicant leapt from within and struck her on the face causing her nose to bleed. There followed further attacks by him and other serious criminal misconduct, the detail of which was recounted in a lengthy statement of agreed facts. For present purposes it will suffice to recount only some of the more prominent elements of the violence visited by the applicant upon his wife which took place throughout the night and continued until it was terminated when she was able to push him out of the front door early on the Friday morning, after which she was able to contact police who arrived at 7.20 am. 
     
      
    6 The applicant had initially prevented the victim from screaming by covering her face with his hand. Subsequently she was pushed to the floor and, among other things, the applicant said that he had come to hurt her and intended to torture her. Having announced this intention, he proceeded to tie her up with a length of orange nylon rope. He said that he had brought whisky and was, when he was ready, intending to engage in intercourse. To this his wife responded, “over my dead body” and he replied, “that can be arranged”. He drew a Luger pistol from his pocket and pointed it at her head making a comment about his being “back in control”. 
     
      
    7 The victim was able to struggle free from the rope but as she attempted to exit through the front door, the applicant apprehended her and dragged her back and retied her. He produced the whisky and two glasses. He placed the pistol on the floor next to where he sat. He commenced to drink the whisky and gave a glass to his wife. He proceeded to drink a considerable amount while she simply sipped what he had given to her. 
     
      
    8 Throughout these events there were exchanges which substantially referred to the breakdown of the relationship. Eventually the applicant began to cry and he later untied her but then made her walk to the bed and told her to remove her clothes. She removed some of her clothing and threw herself on the bed telling him to get over with whatever he was planning. He repeated his intention concerning intercourse but the victim commented that she did not intend to be raped on the last day of her life. He then tied one of her hands to the bedpost and secured the ankle on the same side of her body. He engaged in sexual assaults upon her but she prevented him from achieving penile penetration by kicking with her unsecured leg. She shouted at him to stop and he put a piece of her clothing into her mouth which acted as a gag. During these struggles, the victim got her hand free and scratched the applicant but he subdued her and again tied her to the bed. After this he straddled her and ejaculated over her face. 
     
      
    9 Later the applicant expressed shock at what he had done and that he intended to kill himself. He continued drinking whisky. His condition became such that the victim was able to push him out of the front door and she then made an emergency call to police who arrived and transported her to hospital. 
     
      
    10 In the meantime other police had observed the applicant sitting in a vehicle in a car park. On approach they saw that he was holding the Luger pistol to his chest. After negotiation, he opened the door of the car and fell to the ground leaving the pistol on the car seat. Police arrested him. 
     
      
    11 The charges against the applicant as ultimately dealt with were using a prohibited pistol without a licence or permit (count 1) which carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment; detain with intent to obtain advantage occasioning actual bodily harm (count 2), maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment; attempt sexual intercourse without consent (count 3), maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment and indecent assault (count 4), maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment. Taken into account on a Form 1 when sentence was imposed on count 2 was an offence of possessing an unauthorized firearm. At the final hearing, the applicant was also sentenced for breach of the ADVO, such charge having been transferred to the District Court pursuant to a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    12 I should record some observations about the statement that a standard non-parole period of 7 years was applicable to count 3. The Particulars of Trial filed by the Crown pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules noted that count 3 was charged pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and that the standard non-parole period applied. Section 61I establishes an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the other person is not consenting for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. The schedule in s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 specifies a standard non-parole period of 7 years for an offence against s 61I. The indictment charged the applicant with an attempt to commit an offence contrary to s 61I. There is no mention in s 54D of attempts but s 61P of the Crimes Act provides that a person who attempts to commit an offence under s 61I “is liable to the penalty provided for the commission of the offence”. 
     
      
    13 In the District Court no question was raised about whether or not the statutory structure resulted in the applicability of the standard non-parole period when attempt was charged. It was mentioned in passing in the course of submissions in this Court but no argument was directed to the matter. As will appear when the impositions of sentence are examined, any issue about a standard non-parole period would not be determinative of the resolution of the appeal and insofar as it is perceptible that the statement in the Particulars of Trial may be argued to be incorrect, in the absence of hearing submissions, I would refrain from expressing an opinion. 
     
      
    14 The applicant was committed for trial from the Newcastle Local Court on 29 June 2005 and in due course a trial date of 17 October 2005 was set. On that date, pleas of guilty were entered and the applicant was remanded for sentence. In March 2006 he applied to reverse the pleas of guilty but when this application was listed on 18 May 2006 it was withdrawn. Sentence proceedings were heard in the latter part of 2006, however owing to the serious illness of the presiding judge they were not completed and by 27 September 2007 it became known that that judge would not be able to continue. The applicant then appeared before Sorby DCJ. His Honour was supplied with relevant material including transcript of the earlier proceedings, part of which was evidence given by the applicant.15 There is an ambiguity in the expression of some of the sentence imposition but his Honour specified an intention to achieve an overall result of custody for a minimum of 8 years with a balance period of 3 years 6 months during which the applicant may be released on parole. The applicant had been in custody since his arrest on 28 June 2005. The ambiguity derives first from impositions on counts 1 and 3 of what were expressed as non-parole periods but without balance terms. Second, his Honour said in his remarks that he considered the appropriate sentence on count 3 to be 2 years but when imposing sentence he articulated a “term of a non-parole period of three and a half years, to commence on 28 January 2005 and conclude on 27 July 2008.” 
     
      
    16 The endorsement on the back of the indictment records a sentence of “a term of 2 years to date from 28/1/05 and expire on 27/1/07” on count 3. The warrant of commitment reflects this endorsement. The warrant effectively treats both the sentences on counts 1 and 3 as fixed terms equivalent to the terms expressed by his Honour as non-parole periods.  
     
      
    17 Following his remarks concerning his assessments of appropriate terms for the individual counts, his Honour stated that he intended to make sentences partly concurrent and partly cumulative and backdated two counts to the commencement of the applicant’s custody on 28 January 2005. 
     
      
    18 Accordingly, the applicant was expressed to be, as recorded in the remarks, sentenced on count 4 (indecent assault) to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 28 January 2005 and expiring on 27 January 2006; on count 3 (attempt sexual intercourse without consent) to a “fixed term” of 3 years 6 months commencing on 28 January 2005 and expiring on 27 July 2008; on count 1 (use prohibited pistol) to a “fixed term” of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 28 January 2007 and expiring on 27 January 2010, and on count 2 (detaining for advantage) and taking in account the Form 1 offence (possessing unauthorized firearm) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 28 January 2008 and expiring on 27 January 2013 with a balance term of 3 years 6 months commencing on 28 January 2013 and expiring on 27 July 2016. For breach of the ADVO the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment commencing on 28 January 2005 and expiring on 27 April 2005.  
     
      
    19 The endorsements on the back of the indictment and the specifications in the warrant of commitment were the same except, as I pointed out above, the expiry date of the sentence on count 3 is recorded as 27 January 2007 rather than 27 July 2008. 
     
      
    20 The applicant relies upon six grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1. His Honour erred in failing to express the sentences in accordance with section 44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 in that when sentencing for counts 1 and 3 on the indictment his Honour failed to set a balance of term. His Honour also failed to give reasons for setting a fixed term in relation to count 4 as required by section 45(2). 
       
      
    21 That his Honour’s impositions on counts 1 and 3 were expressed as non-parole periods but effectively amounted to fixed terms has been acknowledged above. In respect of neither of these impositions nor in respect of the expressed fixed term on count 4 did his Honour record any reasons for not setting a non-parole period and balance term. Such failures do not invalidate the sentences: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 44(3) and s 45(4). 
     
      
    22 Whilst in the event of inconsistency it is the endorsement on the back of the indictment which is the record of the court prevailing over transcribed remarks, I am persuaded that the applicant’s argument that the extent of concurrence and cumulation which his Honour intended has been infected by his error in expressing the sentence on count 3 and its expiry date, is made out. I comment that, even on the photocopies of the indictment in the papers, it is plain that the expiry date has been overwritten to substitute “07” for “08”.  
     
      
    23 Subject to the sentence on count 4 being wholly concurrent with the first 12 months of the sentence on count 3 (irrespective of whether it is viewed as 2 years or 3 years 6 months), there is a pattern of partial cumulation and partial concurrency perceptible in the spans of the sentences except that the second year of service on count 3 has no concurrency with any other sentence and, in terms of his Honour’s oral expression of a sentence of 3 years 6 months, concurrency is in the final 18 months, that period being concurrent within the first 18 months of the sentence on count 1 and the final 6 months being also concurrent with the first 6 months of the sentence on count 2. 
     
      
    24 As the operative sentence on count 3 is 2 years imprisonment (as earlier in his remarks, his Honour said he intended) there is no final 18 months of a 3 year 6 month sentence on count 3 and the applicant receives no benefit of partial concurrency during such period. 
     
      
    25 I am conscious that the consequence of his Honour’s erroneous statement of sentence on count 3 can be viewed in different ways but I conclude that the error has led to an extension of the minimum term of custody intended by his Honour. Again, the extent of the extension may be differently viewed, for example as 12 months during which there was no other sentence concurrent or, 18 months being the addition to the actual term of 2 years. 
     
      
    26 The error attracts the power of this Court to intervene and, stressing that I do not seek to minimize the serious criminality of the applicant’s offences, I consider that a lesser effective sentence overall is warranted. I would adjust commencement and expiry dates to remove any perception that the applicant is required to serve minimum custody of 18 months longer than appropriate structure would achieve. 
     
      
    27 Ground 2: His Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the delay which occurred between the entering of the plea of guilty and the passing of sentence. This delay was not due to the fault of the applicant. 
     
      
    28 As the ground implies, his Honour did take delay into account. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Following authority, I am able to take in a (sic – into) consideration in the offender’s favour that he has been awaiting sentence for these matters, through no fault of his own, since his day of arraignment on 17 October 2005. Whilst there could be no doubt in the offender’s mind that he would be sent to prison for these offences, the delay over two years would have produced needless uncertainty in his mind, as to the actual length of his sentence.” 
        
       
      
    29 As the Crown has pointed out, the finding is generous to the applicant in that at least some part of the delay could be referenced to the abandoned application to reverse his pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    30 The applicant argued that, although his Honour recognized the delay, there was “no indication that any mitigation of sentence was applied in regard to that fact”. His Honour’s task was to assess appropriate sentences and in so doing to take into account relevant matters. Delay was relevant in the sense stated and his remarks included specifying that he took it into account. He was not obliged to quantify individual items of relevance nor to calculate terms by processes of addition and subtraction reflecting the various elements which he had taken into account. 
     
      
    31 It is complained that his Honour did not consider the effective delay as a basis for finding special circumstances when setting the division of total term into non-parole period and balance term. In fact, his Honour did depart from the formulation in the statute in the applicant’s favour, the minimum custody period against total term being approximately 69.5 percent as opposed to 75 percent. The issue would be whether his Honour erred in that division not what variety of factors may have been available to justify the decision to depart from the statutory formula.  
     
      
    32 I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
    33 Ground 3: His Honour gave insufficient weight to the fact that the applicant was suffering from severe depression at the time of the commission of these offences. 
     
      
    34 His Honour made explicit reference to the applicant’s mental health issue which antedated the offence and to the diagnosis by Dr Nielssen of severe depressive illness. He quoted extensively from the principal report of the doctor. Clearly his Honour did not overlook this matter. 
     
      
    35 Submission is made that the applicant is less culpable than a person not affected by this illness. The evidence did not oblige his Honour to find that the applicant’s judgment was impaired by the illness. Obviously the applicant was in a state of high emotion. To the extent that his depression may have contributed to his poor judgment, its significance is diminished by his voluntary reduction of his capacities by drinking a large quantity of whisky. 
     
      
    36 There was evidence of advance planning by the applicant who secreted himself in the wardrobe after equipping himself with a pistol, a rope and a bottle of whisky. His Honour specifically found that specific and general deterrence were particularly important in this case. No submission had been made to his Honour that the applicant was, by reason of depression or for any other reason, not a suitable vehicle for the manifestation of general deterrence. 
     
      
    37 The approach undertaken by his Honour was amply endorsed by authority particularly when offences have been committed in a domestic context: R v Hamid [2006] 164 A Crim R 179 and emphatically this is the case when such offences occur in breach of extant restraining orders such as an ADVO: Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336.  
     
      
    38 Ground 4: His Honour gave insufficient weight to the remorse and contrition shown by the applicant.  
     
      
    39 His Honour stated that he accepted that the applicant was remorseful for what he had done. That statement followed recitation of an extract of evidence about regret and expressions of sorrow by the applicant in the proceedings presided over by the late Judge Donovan. Having recited that evidence and made that statement Sorby DCJ moved on to record an intended “discount” of sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Whilst the transcript places both the finding of remorse and the statement of intention concerning discount for utilitarian value in the same paragraph, it is plain that the former statement was referrable to the passage of evidence which his Honour had just cited.  
     
      
    40 The applicant’s submissions complain that the applicant was given credit for the utilitarian value but his Honour did not indicate credit being given for remorse and contrition. Sentencing courts have been encouraged, but not obliged, to quantify the so-called utilitarian discount and obviously that is what his Honour was doing when he recorded his assessment of 20 percent in that regard. Insofar as the applicant was found to be contrite that was one of the factors about which his Honour had made a finding and this indicated its inclusion in the accumulation of matters from which assessment otherwise than in respect of the utilitarian discount derived. 
     
      
    41 Ground 5: His Honour gave insufficient weight to the apparent improvement in the psychiatric condition of the applicant since the increase of his medication whilst in prison. 
     
      
    42 It is plain that his Honour gave appropriate consideration to the applicant’s treatment and progress. He referred to Dr Nielssen’s opinion that the applicant was in need of long term rehabilitation and this formed a basis for variation of the ratio of non-parole period to total term in the applicant’s favour. Having made this finding he added a quotation from a further report from Dr Nielssen referring to the post imprisonment contact between the applicant and his wife and the applicant’s acceptance that he should submit to her wishes in regard to any future contact. 
     
      
    43 Grounds 3, 4 and 5 all asserted error in giving insufficient weight to identified factors to which his Honour clearly and expressly had paid attention. No basis is shown for concluding that his Honour did not take into account the matters which he mentioned and there is no basis for conclusion that his discretion has miscarried in any of these regards so as to attract intervention by this Court.  
     
      
    44 Ground 6: The sentences imposed, structured as they are, result in a manifestly excessive sentence. 
     
      
    45 The effective sentence can be categorized as severe, but the conduct of the applicant constituted criminality of a very high order. Reference was made to the standard non-parole period of 3 years specified in relation to count 1. Of course in the light of the pleas of guilty that prescription was indicative but it is instructive to observe that in assessing what was appropriate for the individual counts, his Honour obviously considered the conduct manifest in count 2 involving detention and the causing of actual harm as of greater gravity than the offence in count 3 which, certainly if the attempt had succeeded, carried a standard non-parole period of 7 years. As earlier recounted, the attempt failed because of the victim’s vigorous physical resistance despite the applicant’s efforts to subdue her by binding her with the rope. 
     
      
    46 This Court was invited to consider that the offences occurred in the context of (broken down) domestic relationship and the applicant’s depression. Depression has been dealt with in relation to ground 3. That a violent and pre planned attack occurred in what might be classified as a domestic setting is not a matter of mitigation. This Court has repeatedly stressed that it is a circumstance of significant seriousness: R v Edigarov [2001] 125 A Crim R 551; R v Dunn [2004] 144 A Crim R 180; R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128. 
     
      
    47 The applicant detained and abused his wife verbally, physically and finally sexually. He did so in defiance of restraints placed upon him by conditions of the ADVO and by bail. The production and use of a pistol must have magnified the fear which his threats instilled in his wife. The level of fear would surely elevate as he drank a copious amount of whisky. It is claimed that the attempt by the applicant to commit suicide was real. His Honour made no finding to that effect and the facts simply show that after considerable consumption of whisky, the applicant was found sitting in a car with the pistol and shortly thereafter persuaded by police to surrender. Those facts did not compel a finding that the applicant’s behaviour extended beyond a threat of self harm which he did not carry out. That he had previously made some attempt does not in the circumstances attract the application of any particular mitigation. 
     
      
    48 I would not uphold ground 6 except to the extent above discussed in relation to ground 1.  
     
      
    49 The shortcomings which have been identified in dealing with ground 1 are in essence both technical and procedural. Failure to comply with the procedures does not of itself give rise to a lesser sentence: Itaoui v R [2005] 158 A Crim R 233; R v Brown [2004] NSWCCA 249. 
     
      
    50 Nevertheless, in this instance I have concluded that the overall justice of the situation should be achieved by a variation of 18 months in the term of custody before the applicant is eligible for parole. This can be done in a practical way by advancing the commencing dates of the sentences on counts 1 and 2 by that period. Although the individual sentences are unaltered in terms of length, it should avoid recurrence of ambiguity if all sentences are quashed and re-imposed. There is no need to do so in respect of the offence referred to in the District Court under the s 166 certificate, the sentence for which is expired. 
     
      
    51 Also expired are the sentences on counts 3 and 4 but they are reimposed for clarity and to maintain specification of the continuity of custody. Fixed terms on counts 1, 3 and 4 are ordered as they will expire during or before the commencement of the non-parole period specified in respect of count 2. The finding of special circumstances by Sorby DCJ should be adopted and applied. 
     
      
    52 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed and sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the appellant sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (a) On count 1 to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 28 July 2005 and expiring on 27 July 2008; 
         
        (b) On count 2 (taking into account the offence on the Form 1) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 28 July 2006 and expiring on 27 July 2011 with a balance term of 3 years 6 months commencing on 28 July 2011 and expiring on 27 January 2015; 
         
        (c) On count 3 to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 28 January 2005 and expiring on 27 January 2007, and 
         
        (d) On count 4 to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 28 January 2005 and expiring on 27 January 2006. 
        
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility for consideration of parole specified as 27 July 2011.  
       
      
    53 LATHAM J: I agree with Grove J.

      HIS HONOUR 
      :  
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 The applicant, who is now 53 years of age, has applied under Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the redetermination of sentences of life imprisonment imposed on him on 30 November 1984 and 28 May 1987. The earlier convictions were two: assault with intent to rob one Bruce Kitamura and at the time of such assault, causing corporal violence to a Mr John Mitchell (the first offence) and the felony/murder of Mr Mitchell (the second offence). When bringing in its verdict of guilty in respect of the murder charge, the jury added as a rider a recommendation for leniency. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for each offence. The third conviction was for the murder of one Anthony Cameron (the third offence). 
     
      
    2 Two earlier applications have previously been dismissed, the first by Allen J on 18 August 1995 and the second by me on 19 November 1999 (R v Main [1999] NSWSC 1174). 
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    3 The facts relevant to the earlier convictions are not in dispute and it is sufficient to adopt the summary set out in my previous determination –  
     
      
       
        
        “[3] …At approximately midnight on 17 June 1983, the applicant, who was armed with a loaded .357 calibre revolver and accompanied by another man, both disguised with balaclavas, arrived at [Bruce] Kitamura’s house at Whale Beach planning to rob him of drugs of which he was a supplier. Present at the house as a guest was the deceased [John Wallace Mitchell] who struggled with the applicant and was fatally wounded when the loaded revolver was discharged during the struggle. The applicant told the police that he realised that a man was dead but said, ‘I only went there to rob them, not hurt them, that’s the truth’. The report of the Probation and Parole officer tendered for the purpose of the sentence proceedings before the trial judge stated that he displayed ‘little remorse’ over Mr Mitchell’s death.” 
        
       
      
    4 The objective gravity of these offences was increased by the fact that they were committed within months of the applicant’s release on license whilst serving a sentence of imprisonment of four years for armed robbery. Although it is obvious that there was a very substantial degree of overlap and despite the consequential double punishment (see R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610) life sentences were imposed for both offences. In those days problems of double punishment were routinely “solved” by imposing concurrent sentences.  
     
      
    5 The applicant’s sentence of 28 May 1987, was imposed for the murder of Anthony Cameron at Malabar on 27 November 1983. At the time he was charged the applicant was serving the life sentences to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    6 It will be seen that the third offence occurred just over five months after the second offence. The statement of facts tendered for the present application sets out the background to the events of 27 November 1983 and then describes what is known about the events of that day. The victim, aged about thirty years, was an inmate of 12 Wing in the Metropolitan Remand Centre, Malabar. The applicant was housed in 13 Wing of the Centre, on remand in respect of the earlier offences. He was known to be a supplier and user of heroin. Mr Cameron was due to attend court on 28 November 1983, with several alleged co-conspirators, for the purpose of committal proceedings on charges of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited drug. His co-offenders included one Charles Lo Surdo, who was apparently apprehensive about what Cameron might say during the proceedings. Cameron was known to be a heroin user in prison, either inhaling or having it injected. It was said that he did not inject himself. About a month before Cameron’s death, the applicant told a fellow prisoner, George Crawford, that he had been approached by Lo Surdo to murder Cameron because Lo Surdo feared that Cameron was going to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution at the committal proceedings and he wanted him taken care of. The applicant said he would receive a pound of heroin for carrying out the murder. The applicant had further conversations with Crawford on two other occasions about the proposed murder. In the first of these the applicant told Crawford that Lo Surdo was trying to arrange for pure heroin to be provided to him in the gaol and, in the second conversation, he told Crawford that Lo Surdo had overseas connections. 
     
      
    7 At about 3pm on 27 November 1983, the applicant accompanied Cameron and another prisoner into an upstairs cell of 12 Wing. In that cell, Cameron either inhaled or had injected at the applicant’s instigation a substance which Cameron was told was heroin but which in fact was a substitute. When Cameron complained that the substance did not have the desired effect the applicant gave him pure heroin which, again, he either inhaled or had injected. He was rendered unconscious almost immediately and died shortly afterwards. The applicant and his companion then either dragged or carried Cameron from the cell to the dining room where the body was left. Ensuing efforts to resuscitate him at the gaol and at Prince Henry Hospital were unsuccessful. A post mortem showed that Cameron died from narcotic poisoning from a heroin overdose. 
     
      
    8 After the murder the applicant spoke with Crawford and, later, with a former prisoner, Stephen Murray, and told them that he had killed Cameron for Charles Lo Surdo. The accounts given to these confidantes differed in that to one the applicant said that the pure heroin was injected whilst to the other, he said that Cameron had snorted the drug. During the murder investigations on 28 and 30 November 1983 the applicant told investigating officers that he was not in 12 Wing at all on the afternoon of the murder though on a second occasion he said that he remembered that he could have been there. It was only after Crawford had provided a statement to police in February 1986 that it was decided to charge the applicant with Cameron’s murder. When he was interviewed prior to being charged, he told police, in defiant language, that he had nothing to say. At his trial, the applicant made a statement to the jury which included the following –  
     
      
       
        
        “Charlie Lo Surdo, he was a sweeper in 13 Wing, but if he had a plot to kill Tony Cameron, he never discussed it with me. At no stage did Charlie Lo Surdo or any of his co-accused discuss the killing of Tony Cameron with me.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I did go into 12 Wing in the afternoon, but I didn’t kill anybody. I am not responsible for the death of Tony Cameron. I never gave him any heroin. He never gave me heroin. I never had any transactions with him whatsoever.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I never made any confessions to Stephen Murray about the demise of Tony Cameron.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I never had any conversations with [George Crawford] about the death of Tony Cameron.” 
        
       
       
        
        “I am not responsible in any way for the death of Tony Cameron and I hope you will find in that way. I think that’s all I have to say. Thank you.” 
        
       
       
      The jury accepted the evidence of the informers and the applicant was convicted. 
       
      
    9 On 28 May 1987 Enderby J sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for life. 
     
      
       
      Reports  
       
      
    10 I do not intend to refer, except in passing, to the matters that were tendered before me on the applicant’s earlier application. They are sufficiently set out in my judgment on that application and it is unnecessary to repeat them. I dismissed the application and directed that the applicant not reapply to the Court for a determination under s 13A for a period of two years from 9 July 1999. Of course, a much greater period than that has since ensued.  
     
      
    11 The evidentiary material placed before me is somewhat, and I think significantly, different to that which was before either Allen J or before me on the earlier occasion. Two additional supplementary reports of the Serious Offender’s Review Council, dated 16 September 2003 and 17 July 2007, have been tendered. The first report noted that the applicant had two recorded offences in custody since the previous report (of 20 April 1998, tendered in the earlier application before me), which were the damaging of clothes or bedding on 20 February 1999 and the detection of a non-prescribed drug in his urine on 23 September 2000. The last report showed that the applicant had incurred only one internal charge since 23 September 2000, which involved “fighting”. The SORC detected a significant improvement in the applicant’s attitude and conduct and, on 19 June 2001, recommended his classification be reduced to C1 from B. With the exception that I have mentioned, the applicant was stable on methadone and there was no sign of any significant relapse. It was recommended, however, that he should be on a relapse prevention programme. On 27 January 2002, the applicant suffered from an acute psychotic episode of significant severity. He was transferred to the Metropolitan Medical Transient Centre where he stayed until 14 August 2004. The applicant has been taking prescribed anti-psychotic medication which has been effective.  
     
      
    12 On 20 May 2003, the SORC received a psychiatric report in which it was concluded –  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Main did not appear to be experiencing any symptoms or demonstrating any signs suggestive of ongoing psychosis. It would appear, based on Mr Main’s clinical presentation, that he has made a complete recovery from an acute psychotic episode, the aetiological nature of which could not be determined.  
        
       
       
        
        I would consider Mr Main’s prognosis at this stage to be favourable, as there does not appear to be any biological pre-disposing factor and/or identifiable precipitating/perpetuating risk factors.  
        
       
       
        
        In terms of treatment recommendations, it would be appropriate for Mr Main’s anti-psychotic medication to be gradually reduced under psychiatric supervision and monitoring.” 
        
       
      
    13 The SORC supplementary report of 17 July 2007 takes up the account of the applicant’s history in gaol. I do not intend to set out all that material here but, generally speaking, a significant change for the better in his attitude and conduct was noted. 
     
      
    14 The Council noted and, I think, accepted a psychological report of 1 June 2007 by Ms Dianna Ebzery co-signed by the Regional Senior Specialist Psychologist, which contained the following material – 
     
      
       
        
        “The LSI-R is an instrument that attempts to identify predictors of criminal conduct in relation to other offenders … Mr Main’s score was 31, which places him at the 72.8th percentile. This means that his risk/needs level is higher than approximately 73% of a sample of inmates, and places him in the range described as ‘moderate risk’. 
        
       
       
        
        The PCL:SV is a screening version of the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R). This [?his] total scores on the PCL-SV place him in the 20.1st percentile for male prison inmates, which is not regarded as high when compared to others in this population, and therefore not suggestive of psychopathy. 
        
       
       
        
        The VRAG…provides a probability rating of the inmate violently recidivating within a specific time period…Mr Main’s scores falling in the middle of the moderate group for violent recidivism (the 5th highest of nine categories) when compared to a sample of inmates. 
        
       
       
        
        Summary and Recommendation 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Main has spent most of his adult life incarcerated, and many of his views have been normalised within an institutionalised culture and the limitations imposed by this ‘life’ sentence. His propensity for violence as a means of having his needs met remains a relatively untested risk factor outside of the gaol environment, but would appear to be moderated by his present stability and compliance. Behavioural indicators in recent years are indicative of a man who can maintain adequate controls over his anger and aggression when he so chooses. Similarly, he has been better able to control impulsive tendencies associated with drug use, and has maintained favourable urinalysis results. 
        
       
       
        
        Although Mr Main does have some difficulties in discussing the wider effects of his crimes, this does not appear to be unusual given the disassociation of time since their occurrence, and drug intoxication around that time. He appears more genuine in accepting greater responsibility for his actions and demonstrates an understanding of remorse. His agreeance to participate in voluntary programmes such as the Phoenix and those of greater intensity such as the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP), if suitable, appear supportive of this also. 
        
       
       
        
        Further contact with Education and exploration of vocational interests is encouraged. It is hoped this would allow for early graded exposure to organisations and opportunities which may strengthen his outside supports whilst building confidence in mixing with others outside of custodial settings. In this regard, referral to transitional programmes such as that run by the Community Restorative Programmes (CRC) and Justice Health would be appropriate in providing pre-release planning and support (should Mr Main be given a determined sentence). Strengthening ties with family and increasing social networks and supports are emphasised as a further moderating factor in his overall picture of risk.” 
        
       
       
      It seems to me that the Council considered that this report was a reasonable assessment of the applicant’s situation. 
       
      
    15 The applicant also relies on the reports of Dr William Lucas and Dr Stephen Allnutt, both highly experienced psychiatrists. They were tendered without objection and the Crown did not seek to suggest that I should not rely on them. Again, I do not propose to set out these documents in detail. The advantage of Dr Lucas’ assessment is that he first assessed the applicant on 27 July 1998, so that he had a basis for considering whether he found any significant changes in the applicant’s condition and attitude. In respect of the offences he said –  
     
      
       
        
        “About the shooting of Mr Mitchell on 17 June 1983 he said it was terrible and he wished he could change it but ‘there is not much you can do’. For a long time he preferred to think of the shooting as an accident, he did not go to the premises to kill anyone but he had taken a loaded gun. Having done this was murder and he was ‘not proud for sure’. He remarked that there was ‘not much I can do in my position, just hope people just forgive you. I am the bad guy, I know that. For a long time I thought I was the victim, I wasn’t’. 
        
       
       
        
        About the death of Mr Cameron at Long Bay he said he did not have much to say but felt responsible. For a long time he had denied the offence. He spent a while discussing the event, indicating it had been a complex situation. However, he ended by saying, ‘He still died as a direct result of what I did’. He felt a lot of guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Main finished the discussion of deaths of Mr Mitchell and Mr Cameron saying, ‘I was so arrogant to think I could get away with all of that shit. It’s easy to be a fuck up. You don’t need brains to do something stupid, just to say, “I did that”’. He says that when he sees young men in prison he thinks, ‘Was I that ridiculous?’” 
        
       
      
    16 Amongst other comments, Dr Lucas observed –  
     
      
       
        
        “I thought him considerably changed as he was no longer as talkative and outgoing and there was no hint that he was uninhibited as previously noted. In 1998 I thought his presentation was consistent with a personality disorder but that was not the case recently. I noted his presentation was consistent with that observed by [the psychologist’s report to which the Council referred and which is mentioned above] and probably Dr Carne who saw him in May 2004 … He spoke about his offences in a straightforward fashion and I thought his remorse was genuine.” 
         
        
       
      
    17 The Doctor’s opinion was as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        “I believe there is good evidence that Mr Main has changed in the nearly ten years since our first interview. The psychological report by Ms Ebzery strongly supports this. I note in particular a report by Senior Custodial Officer D McLachlan dated 1 November 2000 that he had known Mr Main for twenty years and found him a completely different inmate than when they first met. Mr Main’s self report of improvement in attitude and behaviour and his presentation at interview convinced me he has changed significantly for the better.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Main has had his psychiatric difficulties, as described, but is currently stable and well motivated to continue rehabilitation by attending appropriate recommended programmes. I believe he is capable of completing and benefiting from these programmes.  
        
       
       
        
        I think the evidence suggests that Mr Main is now at much less risk of re-offending and, based on the psychological assessment and my knowledge of him, I believe risk of serious re-offending is probably low. It is essential that he does not return to drug use at any time and that if released receives support while under supervision, has good contact with his family, and continues on methadone and whatever other medication is considered necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Main has now served twenty-four years of his life sentences. From the psychiatric point of view I support the setting of a minimum sentence which will enable correctional authorities and Mr Main to proceed with rehabilitation programmes to assist with his eventual consideration for release.” 
        
       
      
    18 Dr Allnutt evaluated the applicant on 29 January 2008. Amongst other things, the applicant told Dr Allnutt about the murder of Mr Cameron. He said –  
     
      
       
        
        “With regard to the second homicide, he stated ‘He had a bag of gear and I had a syringe because I was involved in the drug scene. I lent him a syringe. He had a shot. I should have pushed the button but didn’t because I thought he’d be all right. I feel terrible … As I result of what I didn’t do someone died. I should have raised the alarm straight away.’ I asked him why he believed he should have raised the alarm and he replied, ‘I haven’t got an answer’.” 
        
       
      
    19 Dr Allnutt noted again the gradually dawning understanding about the destructiveness and unacceptability of his previous behaviour. 
     
      
    20 Dr Allnutt’s report includes a detailed analysis of all the material available from psychiatric and prison sources. Broadly speaking, it may be said that he came to the same conclusion as Dr Lucas, though emphasising the importance of a stepped release process, and ongoing involvement in treatment programmes. With reasonable and appropriate qualifications, the substance of Dr Allnutt’s opinion is, I think, that the applicant had progressed sufficiently to justify his being able to work towards release.  
     
      
    21 On the last occasion, I was troubled by suggestions that the applicant had used illicit drugs whilst in custody and in this context saw it as significant that he required a daily dose of 100–110 mgs of methadone and expected to need this for the foreseeable future. My attitude to this question has changed. First, it appears that the applicant has been free of illicit drug use for a considerable time, as evidenced by the fact that he has only returned a positive sample to a non-prescribed drug on one occasion since 1999 (that to which I have already referred and it was not heroin), despite frequent random urine analysis tests. Further medical evidence also establishes, I think, that in respect of the applicant his maintaining a stable dose of methadone is an important aspect of his rehabilitation and should not be regarded as a negative feature. I accept this evidence and have concluded that I placed rather too much weight on this aspect of the matter on the last occasion.  
     
      
    22 The applicant also gave evidence before me on the present application. In particular, he told me about involvement in the Phoenix programme, which is a drug abstinence and behaviour modification programme lasting about seven and a half months. It is an intensive programme of rehabilitation and would usually not be available to a prisoner who does not have a known date of possible release. The fact that the applicant has been chosen as suitable to undertake it and is still in the programme is a very positive sign. He also disclosed that his methadone dose has increased slightly in consultation with the relevant prison staff. The applicant also gave evidence about his change of attitude towards his earlier criminal lifestyle. The applicant also gave some brief evidence about his involvement in Mr Cameron’s death, saying that he shared his syringe with him and that this was the direct cause of his death. He said that he accepted his responsibility for Mr Cameron’s death but it had taken him twenty years to do so. He agreed that for many years he had thought that the shooting of Mr Mitchell was an accident but that now he understood that he was guilty of murdering Mr Mitchell. He said that he knew the gun was loaded and he should not have taken it to the property.  
     
      
    23 Also produced were the Victim Impact Statements from Ms Christine Power, the de facto wife of Mr Mitchell and Mrs Frances Sloss, the mother of Mr Cameron. Ms Power briefly but eloquently discloses the feelings of grief, loss, anxiety, fear and anger that she and her daughter experienced when Mr Mitchell was murdered and which continue up to the present time. Mrs Sloss discusses the circumstances in which her son was killed and rightly describes it as “a terrible thing to do”. She also describes the profound and long-lasting impact on her that resulted from the death of her son, her continuing distress, grief and depression. Her feelings of sadness and loneliness have not diminished. Mrs Sloss also speaks of the impact of her son’s death on other members of her family. 
     
      
       
      Determination: the first offence 
       
      
    24 As I have mentioned, the application seeks a redetermination in respect of each of the life sentences the applicant is serving. It is necessary, I think, to deal separately with each offence. Certainly, a life sentence for the offence involving Mr Kitamura was a most unusual sentence. As I have said, this sentence contained a very substantial degree of double punishment, having regard to the fact that the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Mr Mitchell, whose fatal wound was the corporal violence involved in the robbery offence. Of course, I am not at all sitting in any sense on an appeal in respect of any of these sentences. The question is whether there should be a redetermination by virtue of the provisions of Sch 1 to the Act.  
     
      
    25 In respect of the first offence it is important to note that the maximum penalty at the time was penal servitude for life but the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989, assented to on 12 January 2000, reduced the maximum penalty for this offence from life to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. Although it is material to consider the reduction in maximum penalty now provided, the validity of the earlier sentence is not called into question by that amendment. The Crown conceded that in relation to this sentence a determinate sentence should be imposed though the prosecutor also submitted that this was an example of the worst case. I do not understand what is said to follow from this contention. Since the applicant has already served a little over the 25 years presently prescribed as the maximum, to set a sentence significantly greater than that period seems to me to be wrong. At all events, I am unable to agree that this is the worst type of case. Certainly it was objectively very serious and was committed, as I have mentioned, when the applicant was free on licence, in respect of an earlier armed robbery conviction. It is also true that this was a home invasion but, at the time, offences such as this were not regarded as significantly more serious than, say, armed robberies on banks or other commercial premises. All are serious but necessarily depend upon their own facts. I think that the reason this matter is said to be in the worst category of cases is that Mr Mitchell was killed in the course of it. But in respect of that death he was convicted of murder and should not be double-punished. As Pearce makes clear, mere concurrency does not deal with the double-punishment problem. I do not think that it can be right for me to repeat the error of past days. 
     
      
    26 At the same time, in redetermining the sentence in respect of the first offence it is not, I think, for me to re-sentence the applicant in such a way as to impose a lesser sentence than that which the applicant has already served. As I have said, I am not sitting on appeal. The redermination is directed to dealing with the balance of the sentence remaining. In determining the application in respect of this particular sentence, I also bear in mind what I propose to do in relation to the other sentences.  
     
      
    27 Clause 4 of Sch 1 sets out the modes by which this Court can dispose of an application in relation to an existing life sentence. The Court can set a specified term together with a non-parole period, decline to set a specified term but set a non-parole period or decline to set either a specified term or a non-parole period. It seems to me to follow that a fixed term cannot be set on such an application. At the same time, I do not think it appropriate to impose a sentence which will substantially exceed the period which the applicant has already served as would be required if the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the overall sentence as specified in s 44 of the Act were applied. Accordingly, I propose to depart from that ratio. The applicant is sentenced to a term of twenty-five years and two months’ imprisonment to commence 29 June 1983 and end 28 August 2008 with a non-parole period commencing on 29 June 1983 and ending on 4 July 2008.  
     
      
       
      Determination: the second charge 
       
      
    28 The Crown prosecutor conceded – rightly in my view – that in all the circumstances this sentence should be redetermined. Of particular importance in assessing the objective seriousness of this crime is the fact that, although wounding may well have been foreseeable, no death or serious injury was contemplated by the applicant. He was convicted of causing the death of Mr Mitchell, not with any intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life but, rather, because it occurred during the commission by the applicant of the crime relating to Mr Kitamura, which then carried a sentence of life imprisonment. It cannot be stated without qualification that such an offence will usually be less objectively serious than other forms of murder. But this may well be the case and, in my view, was the case here. I am fortified in this opinion by the rider added by the jury to its verdict of guilty. The jury were well placed, in my view, to assess the criminality of the applicant.  
     
      
    29 In my view, the application should be disposed of in respect of this charge by imposing both a sentence and a non-parole period. Again, this sentence is a redetermination which is in no way a reflection upon the appropriateness of the sentence originally passed. If the applicant’s crimes were to be the subject of fresh sentencing proceedings, one would expect that there would be a degree of accumulation, subject to the principle of totality. However, again, I do not think that in the present context I can change the commencement date of the sentences. The applicant’s sentence on the second offence must commence on 29 June 1983. Having regard to the overall sentence that I consider to be appropriate it is necessary to depart from the s 44 ratio between non-parole period and the overall sentence. Accordingly, I redetermine the applicant’s sentence on the second offence by setting a sentence of twenty-six years ending on 28 June 2009 with a non-parole period commencing on 29 June 1983 and ending on 4 July 2008. 
     
      
       
      Determination: the third offence  
       
      
    30 When I dealt with this applicant previously, I said that, had the applicant appeared before me afresh for sentence at that time I would have imposed a life sentence. However, I pointed out the Court, in exercising its functions to redetermine a life sentence, must consider whether there has been any material change in the applicant’s character, especially concerning his or her possible rehabilitation. I concluded, in all the circumstances, that I should at that time decline to redetermine the applicant’s sentence in order to permit him to demonstrate a greater degree of rehabilitation and hence possibly establish that he should obtain in due course a redetermination. That conclusion was arrived at somewhat over eight years ago. There has been a significant degree of rehabilitation and a distinct change in attitude on the applicant’s part which, had it then been present, would have led me to a different conclusion on the question whether a life sentence under the present legislative prescription would have been justified. 
     
      
    31 Rehabilitation, of course, is far from the only material factor in sentencing. Some crimes are so heinous that, whatever the degree of rehabilitation, the maximum sentence must be imposed.  
     
      
    32 The particular substantial aggravating matters here are that this was the second murder committed by the applicant and that it appeared that the applicant acted at the instance of another criminal to prevent the victim from giving evidence. A complicating feature is that the applicant has now given a sworn account of how Mr Cameron met his death. It will be recalled that the Crown case, which relied on prison informants, was that the applicant had told them that Mr Cameron was killed in order to prevent him from giving evidence on behalf of the Crown in an impending prosecution. The accused’s initial denial that he had been in 12 Wing at the relevant time was contradicted by prison officers who placed him there at the material time. If the jury accepted their evidence and concluded that, indeed the accused was present despite his earlier denial, and considered that his later acceptance that he was there was opportunistic they may well have rejected the whole of his account for that reason. Moreover, in accepting that the applicant admitted his involvement in the death of Mr Cameron, as asserted by the informers, it was not necessary for them to have positively accepted the whole of that evidence which, having regard to its character, was inherently unreliable. It is scarcely possible for me to evaluate the applicant’s present evidence as against that of those informants.  
     
      
    33 At the same time, the applicant did not explain in his evidence here – although he was not asked either by his own counsel or by the prosecutor – how it was that Mr Cameron died from an overdose or whether he was aware of Lo Surdo’s apparent interest in the victim’s demise – and one can think of other issues upon which (if this matter were really controversial) the applicant might have been cross-examined. Certainly, he made himself available for that cross-examination. I think it implicit in his evidence, and he was not cross-examined on this aspect, that he provided the syringe but not the heroin. At the same time, this account is far from convincing and, of course, he has a motive for minimising his involvement. Nevertheless, I think I should accept the submission of Mr Haesler SC for the applicant that, without going behind the verdict, there is room for doubt that the death of Mr Cameron was quite the cold, calculated, planned murder of a would-be witness as I had previously thought. I am also minded to accept that the applicant was himself affected by having taken heroin at the time he shared his syringe with Mr Cameron.  
     
      
    34 Although in many cases the committing of two murders would justify, if not necessarily require, a life sentence for one or both, this is far from invariably the case. In this case, the murder of Mr Mitchell, though serious, was not an intentional and deliberate act although, as I have said, it was certainly objectively very grave. So this is not a situation where the offender has committed two deliberate murders. The applicant was twenty-eight years of age when he killed Mr Cameron and he is now fifty-three years old. Moreover, Enderby J (who sentenced the applicant for this offence) had no real choice but to impose another life sentence, since any sentence would necessarily be concurrent with the life sentences he was then serving.  
     
      
    35 Making due allowance for the seriousness of the offence, I have concluded that the applicant should have an opportunity to be released on parole in due course, providing of course that the Parole Board considers that it is appropriate to grant parole. He must serve an additional period in prison before he is eligible to be considered for release on parole and the effect of the redetermination will be to add a significant additional term to that which I have already imposed for the other offences. However, such is the seriousness of the offence, I decline to set a specified term for the sentence, leaving in place the life sentence which he initially received. Accordingly, pursuant to clause 4(1)(b) of Sched 1 to the Act, I decline to set a specified term for the applicant’s sentence but I do set a non-parole period of twenty-five years commencing 28 May 1987 and ending 27 May 2012. The applicant will be eligible to be considered for release on parole on that date.

    4 PRICE J: The applicant Mohammed Charkawi pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Two counts contrary to s 29B of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914 (Cth) (the Act); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Four counts contrary to s 135.1(5) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) (the Code). 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant acknowledged his guilt in relation to a further two charges contrary to s 29B, a further four charges contrary to s 135.1(5) and two charges contrary to s 8(K)(I)(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). He asked that these charges, which were placed on a schedule be taken into account on sentence by the Judge under s 16BA of the Act. 
     
      
    6 The maximum penalty for an offence of imposition upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation contrary to s 29B of the Act is imprisonment for 2 years and/or fine of $13,200, whereas the maximum penalty for an offence of dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Code is 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $33,000. 
     
      
    7 On 24 August 2007, the applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Count 1: 12 months imprisonment to commence on 1  
         
          
           
            
            June 2007; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Count 2: 9 months imprisonment to commence on 1  
         
          
           
            
            October 2007; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Count 3: 2 years imprisonment to commence on 1  
         
          
           
            
            December 2007; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Count 4: 2 years imprisonment to commence on 1 March  
         
          
           
            
            2008; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (v) Count 5: 2 years imprisonment to commence on 1  
         
          
           
            
            December 2007; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
      (vi) Count 6: 2 years imprisonment to commence on 1 June  
       
        
         
          
           
            
            2009. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    8 Counts 1 and 2 are offences contrary to s 29B of the Act and counts 3-6 are offences contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Code.  
     
      
    9 As a result of accumulation and concurrence, the Judge imposed an aggregate effective head sentence of 4 years to commence on 1 June 2007 with a single non-parole period of two years and six months from that date and to expire on 30 November 2009. A single non-parole period was set in accordance with s 19AB(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    10 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to provide  
         
          
          transparency in the application of the discount for the applicant’s pleas of guilty.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentences are, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.  
        
       
      
    11 As to Ground 1, Mr Dhanji for the applicant submits that the starting points of individual sentences or of the overall sentence gives rise to the question as to whether the discount for the plea of guilty of 10 per cent was in fact applied by the Judge. He contends that there can be no point having a precise discount if the starting point is imprecise. The Judge, he submits, erred in failing to provide transparency in the discounting of the applicant’s sentence for his pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    12 The applicant pleaded guilty on 6 March 2007 which was to have been the second day of his trial. No complaint is made about the amount of the discount which was assessed by the Judge. 
     
      
    13 The duty of the Court in imposing a sentence for a federal offence is to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence: s 16A(1) of the Act. The Court must take into account all matters identified in s 16A(2) in determining a sentence proportionate to the wrong-doing: Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [71]. A plea of guilty is a factor to be taken into account on sentence: s 16A(2)(g).  
     
      
    14 Section 16A falls within Div 2 of Pt 1B of the Act. There is no requirement in Pt 1B for the quantification of a discount for a plea of guilty, or for the provision of reasons for the discount allowed. 
     
      
    15 The Judge, however, quantified a discount which approach was in line with what was said at [28] in R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 by Hodgson JA (with whom James and Adams JJ agreed on this point): 
     
      
       
        
        “The range of discount suggested by  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         on this utilitarian basis is ten to twenty-five per cent. Although that range is not expressed as applying to Commonwealth offences in general terms, it seems to me that it is a reasonable range to adopt.” 
        
       
      
    16 Her Honour, however, did not specify the notional starting points for the undiscounted sentences which has been a practice encouraged by some judgments of this Court: see for example R v Waqa (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 33; R v Franklin [2005] NSWCCA 24, R v Lynn [2005] NSWCCA 222. When the discount for the plea is applied, a neat starting point for the sentences either individually or overall is not obtained. 
     
      
    17 Neither the omission by a sentencing Judge to identify an undiscounted starting point nor the inability to calculate a neat starting point for a sentence will necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Judge has simply paid lip service to the discount for a plea which the Judge has specified. Sentencing is not merely arithmetical. The encouragement of transparency does not confine sentencing to a precise mathematical exercise. An “instinctive synthesis” approach has been recognised in the High Court in AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 4; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15. 
     
      
    18 In the present case, the Judge specified the amount of the discount at 10 per cent and immediately prior to announcing the sentences said (ROS at 18): 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account the discount for the plea I will impose the following sentences.” 
        
       
      
    19 It is plain, to my mind, that the Judge applied to the sentences that were imposed the discount for the plea which she had quantified. The first ground of appeal is not established.  
     
      
    20 The second ground of appeal raises the issue of manifest excess. Whilst acknowledging that the applicant’s conduct was serious, Mr Dhanji contends that the offences were not as sophisticated as other similar offences seen by the Courts and the amount of money was not at the top of the scale in relation to such offences. He points to the applicant’s subjective factors which include the availability of $45,000 in reduction of the debt.  
     
      
    21 The applicant between 6 January 1998 to 4 May 2004 dishonestly obtained financial benefits from the Commonwealth in the sum of $106,095.57. The charges placed on the schedule involved a further $9,151.89 and the obtaining of false tax file numbers. Four false identities were used and false documents were produced to prove an identity when making an application for social security benefits. The applicant repeatedly made false statement in forms lodged with the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency (the Agency) throughout the period of the offences. The offences were only discovered when a comparative analysis was conducted by the Agency.  
     
      
    22 Her Honour observed that the offences were committed over a significant period of time and was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that despite the applicant’s denials he only stopped offending when he was brought in for interview and must have feared that discovery of his crimes was imminent. Her Honour found that the crimes “were obviously well planned” and “relatively sophisticated”. The Judge noted that the applicant was able to produce proof of identity for each false name and included in those identity documents were false driver licences, tax file numbers and translations of documents. The offences were characterised by the Judge as being of “significant objective seriousness”. 
     
      
    23 In my view, her Honour’s characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of the offences was open to her.  
     
      
    24 At the time of sentence, the applicant was aged 36. He is a married man. He and his wife have three young children. The applicant did not have a significant prior criminal history although offences involving dishonesty are disclosed on his record.  
     
      
    25 Her Honour found that the applicant’s reasons why he started offending and why he continued were not credible nor was his assertion that he did not fully understand that his conduct was wrong. His expressions of remorse, the Judge observed, “were heavily qualified by blaming others”.  
     
      
    26 Although her Honour did not make a specific finding of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, she stated that she did “not necessarily share the relative optimism of Mr Taylor”, a psychologist, about rehabilitation. She remarked that “there was little in the offender’s evidence which would persuade the Court that he had accepted the criminality of his actions.” 
     
      
    27 All of these findings were open to the Judge.  
     
      
    28 Due weight was given to the applicant’s subjective circumstances and plea of guilty. Her Honour gave sympathetic consideration to the availability of the $45,000 accepting that it did “lessen the objective seriousness of the offence”.  
     
      
    29 A number of sentences imposed in other cases have been referred to by Mr Dhanji in submissions. Many of those sentences, as so often is the case, can be distinguished for various reasons from the present circumstances. Whilst a consideration of sentences imposed by other Courts is helpful and promotes consistency in sentencing, it is for the Court to determine whether the sentences imposed in this case are manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    30 The Judge, in my opinion, correctly characterised the applicant’s criminality. His dishonest activity escaped detection over six years and a large sum of Commonwealth money to which he was not entitled was obtained. 
     
      
    31 The need for general deterrence for social security fraud has been emphasised over the years by judgments of this Court: see for example Regina v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141, Regina v Purdon, (Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 March 1997, unreported). 
     
      
    32 I am not persuaded that the sentence was in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    33 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by the District Court on 4 May 2007. On that date, the applicant was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years for each of three counts of using a carriage service to transmit a communication to a person under the age of 16 years, with the intention of procuring that person to engage in sexual activity, contrary to s.474.26(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). 
     
      
    4 The first count concerned the applicant’s use of an internet messaging facility sent along telephone lines through a computer. The second and third counts involved the use of telephone lines to communicate orally with the recipient by the communications. 
     
      
    5 The applicant proceeded by way of application for leave to appeal dated 8 February 2008 and he relied upon two grounds as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the nature of the sexual activity intended to be procured. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentences are, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was charged that on 15 July 2006, 30 July 2006 and 5 August 2006 he, being 41 years of age, used a carriage service in transmitting a communication to the recipient, being a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s.474.26(1). 
     
      
    7 That provision is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “474.26  
        Using a carriage service to procure persons under 16 years of age 
        
       
       
        
        1. A person ( 
        the sender 
        ) commits an offence if:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the sender uses a carriage service to transmit a communication to another person ( 
          the recipient 
          ); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the sender does this with the intention of procuring the recipient to engage in, or submit to, sexual activity with the sender; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the recipient is someone who is, or who the sender believes to be, under 16 years of age; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the sender is at least 18 years of age. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 15 years.” 
        
       
      
    8 The expression “carriage service” has the same meaning as in the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Dictionary to the Criminal Code). That expression is defined in s.7 of the latter Act as meaning “… a service for carrying communications by means of guided and/or unguided electromagnetic energy”. 
     
      
    9 Section 474.28(11) of the Code provides that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In s.474.26 and s.474.27 and this section:- 
        
       
       
        
        procure 
         a person to engage in sexual activity includes:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) encourage, entice or recruit a person to engage in that activity; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) induce the person (whether by threats, promises or otherwise) to engage in that activity.” 
        
       
       
        
        sexual activity 
         means:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) sexual intercourse as defined in s.50AC of the Crimes Act 1914; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) an act of indecency as defined in s.50AB of that Act; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) any other activity of a sexual or indecent nature that involves the human body, or bodily actions or functions. 
        
       
       
        
        The activity referred to in paragraph (c) need not involve physical contact between people.” 
        
       
       
      The trial proceedings 
       
      
    10 Following a plea of not guilty, the trial proceeded in the District Court with a jury. On 22 March 2007, the jury returned with verdicts of guilty to each count. 
     
      
    11 On 4 May 2007, the applicant was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years for each of the three counts, with an order being made that the sentences be served concurrently and commence on 25 August 2006. 
     
      
    12 In the Crown’s written submissions, the facts as determined by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence were accurately summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1 
        
       
       
        
        At about 7 pm on 15 July 2006 the complainant, who was 12 years of age at the time, was at the Golden Zone Internet Café in the Kogarah area. The complainant was logged on to the internet and had his MSN chat line open. The Appellant noticed the complainant and passed him a hand written note with his personal email address written on it. He asked the complainant to add him to this list of contacts. The complainant complied with the Appellant’s request and the Appellant began conversing with the complainant via the MSN internet facility. During the course of this email correspondence, the Appellant sent a message to the complainant offering to pay the boy $10 to play with his penis. The complainant became concerned, left the premises and went home and told his mother. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant’s mother checked her son’s email and established that the emails that the complainant had told her about had in fact been received. Those emails had 2 particular addresses on them. The complainant’s mother, pretending to be her son, then commenced to communicate with the Appellant for a number of days. On 22 July 2006 she engaged the accused in email conversations for some 30 minutes. During that discussion the Appellant asked:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Do you remember those cheeky questions? Did you tell anyone about those cheeky questions? Did you think about them anymore?’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Appellant also repeatedly sought the mobile phone number of the boy and eventually the complainant’s mother provided this together with a photograph of her son. Throughout these online conversations the offender used the pseudonym ‘Dan’. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        
       
       
        
        On Sunday 30 July 2006, the Appellant rang the complainant on the complainant’s mobile phone, introducing himself as Dan and saying ‘Are you still interested in my playing with your dick’. The appellant told the complainant that he was on a public telephone. The complainant recognised the voice of the Appellant from conversations he had had with him at the Golden Zone Internet Café. 
        
       
       
        
        Subsequent Police investigation revealed 2 telephone calls made from a public telephone booth in Forest Road Hurstville to the complainant’s mobile. The evidence disclosed that the public phone booth was close to a café known as the Digitime Internet Café, the location at which the Appellant was ultimately arrested on 25 August 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 
        
       
       
        
        On 5 August 2006 the Appellant again rang the complainant on his mobile phone, saying to him; ‘Do you want to tell me how I will touch you’. The complainant replied ‘okay’ and the Appellant said ‘do you want me to do it on the inside or the outside and are you doing it for money or what?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Again Police investigations revealed that the calls to the complainant were made from the same telephone booth in Forest Road Hurstville. 
        
       
       
        
        On 19 and 20 August 20006 detectives assumed the online identity of the complainant and engaged the Appellant in internet conversations. During these conversations, the Appellant expressed a desire to meet with the complainant, but was reluctant to do so unless the complainant confirmed his identity by means of a telephone call. 
        
       
       
        
        On 25 August, assuming the identity of the complainant, police initiated a further online conversation with the Appellant. While the conversation was continuing, other police entered the Digitime Internet Café at 267 Forest Road Hurstville and arrested the Appellant who was seated at a computer terminal and in the process of typing messages to the AFP agent who was masquerading as the complainant. On 1 September 2006 the complainant looked at a photo board display and picked the Appellant from a number of photos as being the man who had first approached him in the internet café.” 
        
       
      
    13 In the written outline of submissions for the applicant, it is stated that no issue is taken with the facts of the offences as set out in the remarks on sentence (pp.2 to 6). 
     
      
    14 The evidence established that, from 15 July 2006, being the date upon which the applicant initially targeted the child in question (to whom I will refer in this judgment as the recipient), he continued his attempts to pursue him over a period of approximately six weeks (until he was arrested on 25 August 2006). 
     
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence at the trial denying the offences. He did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. There was tendered on his behalf at the sentencing hearing, a report of John Machlin, clinical psychologist, dated 19 April 2007. 
     
      
    16 The applicant’s criminal history was tendered, which included previous convictions relating to sexual misconduct with young children. The Crown’s written submissions set out a summary of the previous convictions as follows:-

      The psychological assessment 
       
      
    17 The report of John Machlin, clinical psychologist, dated 19 April 2007 was based upon an assessment undertaken by Mr Machlin of the applicant at MRRC Silverwater on 12 April 2007. The interview and psychometric assessment took place over a period of two to two and a half hours on that date. Mr Machlin recorded that the applicant co-operated willingly and courteously with the assessment and responded expansively to questions. He impressed as being of above average intelligence and he spoke articulately and coherently. 
     
      
    18 The history provided to Mr Machlin by the applicant was of a troubled childhood. 
     
      
    19 Mr Machlin referred to the applicant’s unusually high level of insight into his problems and to this and other factors that were said to be favourable indicators for therapy. He gave an account of having committed himself willingly to sex offender treatment in the past and “... would like the opportunity to do so again …” (p.4). 
     
      
    20 Mr Machlin diagnosed a moderately depressive personality style and recorded that, according to the applicant at the time of the offences, he underwent a relationship break-up and that work problems had precipitated low mood and low self-worth. However, there was an insufficient basis to establish a diagnosable depressive condition. Mr Machlin’s impression was, as recorded in his report, that the applicant had genuinely accepted responsibility for his offences and was genuinely remorseful in view of their impact upon his victim. Mr Machlin concluded by saying that he believed that the applicant would willingly commit once again to rehabilitation and that he was a suitable candidate. 
     
      
    21 The Crown referred to a report by Dr Fisher in sentence proceedings in 1995 in which the applicant was said to have a “paedophilic orientation” but that it was “highly unlikely he would re-offend”. The Crown also observed that, in light of the subsequent convictions for offences of the same type and the jury’s verdict in the present case, it was clear that Dr Fisher’s optimism had been misplaced. 
     
      
    22 The Crown also referred to a report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 9 December 1997. Dr O’Dea is a forensic psychiatrist and he concluded that the applicant satisfied the DSMIV(1) diagnostic category, Paedophilia, sexually attracted to males, exclusive type. In paragraph 28 of his report he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The risk of further offending behaviour will remain a long-term issue for Mr Tector who will require to remain very motivated and committed to long-term psychiatric supervision in the community in order to minimise his risk of re-offending.” 
        
       
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    23 The sentencing judge observed that s.474.26(1) was introduced into the Criminal Code in 2004 and that its provisions were intended to provide protection for children from what his Honour referred to as “soliciting” to engage in sexual activity. 
     
      
    24 His Honour referred to the applicant’s persistence in that he “repeatedly sought the mobile phone number of the boy …” (p.4) and to the assumed name “Dan” in all discussions with the under aged person.  
     
      
    25 The second and third offences effected by telephone communication included specific questions being put to the recipient effectively seeking an affirmative response to the applicant’s proposal for him to undertake sexual activity in the nature of genital stimulation. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge referred to evidence that supported an inference or conclusion that the applicant, in making the communications, did so in a way that protected his identity (including in particular the use of public telephones) and to the fact that he exercised caution (on 19 and 20 August 2006) by seeking to confirm the recipient’s identity before meeting him. 
     
      
    27 His Honour placed considerable emphasis upon the matter of general deterrence in sentencing the applicant. In that respect, he emphasised in his remarks on sentence the need for protecting children in the community from adults who seek to procure the engagement of children in sexual activity. His Honour also had regard to the activity proposed by the applicant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The children of our community must be protected from people like him. It is doubtful I think that he would fully appreciate the harm that he does. I have no doubt that a lot of rationalisation would convince him that he was doing very little harm at all. There is no suggestion that he ever contemplated beating the child, or ill-treating the child. All that he was seeking to do in his own way of looking at things, was to get this child to touch him on his penis, either outside his clothes or inside his clothes so that he could get sexual gratification. 
        
       
       
        
        Luring children into such activities almost inevitably damages them for life …” 
         (remarks on sentence, pp.11 to 12) 
        
       
      
    28 His Honour also stated that he considered there were no significant prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 In relation to specific or individual deterrence, the sentencing judge stated (remarks on sentence, pp.12 to 13):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it seems to me that I should impose a sentence, which ensures that for quite a considerable period, he cannot engage in activities that could bring harm to young male children …” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The three offences were committed within a short period of one another and in a real sense, I suppose, it could be said they all arise out of the same general transaction. Therefore, whilst I impose a sentence on each one, that sentence will reflect what I regard as the overall criminality of all three. I take into account also the need to balance any sentence by the principle of proportionality … 
        
       
       
        
        Having considered all of these matters, I consider this offence as an offence of extreme seriousness. Accordingly, I intend to impose an overall sentence of 11 years imprisonment and I intend to impose an overall non-parole period of 7 years. I intend to recommend that he be given the benefit of sexual counselling. In my view, he should not be released to parole at all, unless the authorities are fully satisfied that he has done something about his sexual maladjustment from which he suffers.” 
        
       
      
    31 The sentencing judge then went on to state that the sentences would be back-dated to 25 August 2006, being the date the applicant was taken into custody. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into account the nature of the sexual activity intended to be procured. 
       
      
    32 Mr H Dhanji of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the applicant (but who did not appear in the proceedings below), observed that it had been submitted to the sentencing judge that the nature of the intended conduct was a relevant matter. Had the applicant in fact carried out the proposed activity, then an offence of indecent assault would have been committed under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Mr Dhanji observed that an offence of aggravated indecent assault under that Act would have been the subject of a maximum penalty of 7 years (s.61M(1), Crimes Act). This, it was observed, was in contrast to the maximum penalty of 15 years for an offence under s.474.26(1). 
     
      
    33 Further, in his written submissions (paragraph 9), the following passage from the remarks on sentence were quoted (remarks on sentence, p.2.2):- 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of argument, it was put to me that if these offences had not been preferred under the  
        Criminal Code 
        , they would have been nothing more than a summary offence matter to go before a magistrate. That is, some sort of attempt to solicit, or attempt to have sexual intercourse with a minor. I do not agree. In my opinion, if the police in this case had decided not to pursue the matter under Commonwealth legislation, they could have brought charged under State legislation relating to the prostitution of children, because an attempt to get a child to engage in sexual activity for the purposes of payment is an attempt to prostitute a child. Such offences carry penalties of the same order as the Commonwealth offences.” 
        
       
      
    34 It was submitted that this observation was not to the point and that in an offence under s.91D of the Crimes Act, it would still be necessary to take into account the nature of the sexual activity engaged in. 
     
      
    35 In oral submissions for the applicant, it was contended that it was necessary, in relation to the communication made by the applicant “… that we look at the nature of the communication and the nature of the sexual activity that is sought to be procured” (transcript p.3). 
     
      
    36 In developing the submission, reliance was placed upon the contrast between what was termed a “more explicit” communication and a communication that was not so explicit. In the present case it was submitted that the sexual activity sought to be induced was “… at the lower end of the scale” (paragraph 11). It was observed that there was no suggestion of intercourse of any form (which it was emphasised may involve various degrees of seriousness). In this case, the observation was that the contact proposed may have been made through clothing and there was no suggestion of violence (other than that implicit in the sexual activity itself) contemplated. It was also observed that no other person or persons were involved in the matter. 
     
      
    37 It was submitted for the applicant that the sentencing judge was required to consider the “proposed activity as part of the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. This, the sentencing judge failed to do” (paragraph 13 of the written outline of submissions for the applicant). 
     
      
    38 Further, in oral submissions, it was argued that, in the context of s.474.26(1)(b), there was a requirement in evaluating the offences that “… one looks to precisely what it is that is sought to be procured and it is that that will assist in determining the objective gravity of the offence, at least with respect to that element …” (transcript, p.4). 
     
      
    39 Accordingly, it was argued that the sentencing judge had erred by failing to take into account the nature of the sexual activity intended to be procured. 
     
      
    40 The Crown submitted (written submissions, paragraph 6.4), that the nature of the sexual activity is “… but one of the factors to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending …” (paragraph 6.4). 
     
      
    41 The Crown emphasised that the sentencing judge was entitled to have regard to the type of conduct which the Commonwealth legislation proscribed. 
     
      
    42 The Crown also contended that the seriousness with which the community regards the anonymous use of communication services such as the internet for “predatory sexual conduct” towards children is reflected in the Parliament having set a maximum penalty for the offence of 15 years imprisonment. The Crown submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “6.8 In this case, the facts as found by the jury are precisely those that the legislation is aimed at penalising. The offender, a man of mature years, used a carriage service to seek out a child who he believed to be 12 years of age in order to entice him to engage in sexual activity with him for payment. As has been said previously, the nature of the  
        proposed 
         sexual activity is but one factor to be taken into account. The overriding consideration is to give effect to the legislative intent of the section. His Honour did precisely that.” 
        
       
      
    43 The Crown submitted in any event that the sentencing judge did, in fact, have regard to the nature of the proposed activity. It submitted that no error had been demonstrated in relation to either ground of appeal relied upon in this case. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentences are, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive 
       
      
    44 Whilst Mr Dhanji acknowledged the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct, he again observed that the sexual contact that the applicant sought to engage the recipient in was not of the most serious kind. 
     
      
    45 Whilst he acknowledged that the applicant’s criminal record was a “concerning matter”, he submitted that the applicant was not in the category of child sexual predator where there is a failure to recognise the aberrant nature of their conduct. In this respect, reference was made to observations of Mr Machlin in his report, in particular, to the matters that indicated a willingness and a capacity for therapy. Mr Dhanji further noted that the present offences occurred some nine years after the last offences and that this was against the background of a relationship break-up and work related problems. 
     
      
    46 The applicant did not have the benefit of a plea of guilty. However, that said, it was submitted on his behalf that the sentences of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years was “… very significantly beyond anything imposed for comparable offences. The discrepancy is of an extent that cannot be reconciled by reference to the applicant’s record or the absence of a plea of guilty” (written outline of submissions for the applicant, paragraph 23). 
     
      
    47 The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was appropriate in all the circumstances and that the applicant had failed to make out Ground 1 and this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Decisions under State legislation 
       
      
    48 In the written submissions of both the applicant and the Crown, considerable attention was given to sentencing decisions made under State legislation. These included, in particular, the decisions in Regina v Poynder (2007) 171 A Crim R 544; State of Western Australia v Collier [2007] WASCA 250 and Regina v Meehan [2007] VCC (21 July 2006) unreported, Victorian County Court. Sentences imposed under State legislation for procuring offences of a similar nature do not provide guidance as to the appropriate sentencing range for the purposes of the present case. Mr Dhanji frankly and, with respect in my opinion, correctly acknowledged that these cases are of limited assistance.  
     
      
    49 However, as a number of decisions in relation to offences under s.218A(1)(a) of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Q) were referred to in the course of submissions, it is appropriate to examine them for the purpose of determining whether they may provide assistance in identifying the type of aggravating or mitigating circumstances relevant to offences committed under s.476.26(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). 
     
      
    50 Section 218A of the Criminal Code (Q), inserted into that Code with effect from 1 May 2003, is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Any adult who uses electronic communication with intent to:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) procure a person under the age of 16 years, or a person the adult believes is under the age of 16 years, to engage in a sexual act, either in Queensland or elsewhere; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) expose, without legitimate reason, a person under the age of 16 years, or a person the adult believes is under the age of 16 years, to any indecent matter, either in Queensland or elsewhere; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          commits a crime. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Maximum penalty – 5 years imprisonment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The adult is liable to 10 years imprisonment if the person is:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a person under 12 years; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a person the adult believes is under 12 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) For subsection (1)(a), a person engages in a sexual act if the person:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) allows a sexual act to be done to the person’s body; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) does a sexual act to the person’s own body or the body of another person; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) otherwise engages in an act of an indecent nature. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) Subsection (3) is not limited to sexual intercourse or acts involving physical contact. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) For subsection (1)(a), it is not necessary to prove that the adult intended to procure the person to engage in any particular sexual act. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Also, for subsection (1)(a), it does not matter that, by reason of circumstances not known to the adult, it is impossible in fact for the person to engage in the sexual act. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) For subsection (1), it does not matter that the person is a fictitious person represented to the adult as a real person. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Evidence that the person was represented to the adult as being under the age of 16 years, or 12 years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the adult believed the person was under that age. 
        
       
       
        
        (9) It is a defence to a charge under this section to prove the adult believed on reasonable grounds that the person was at least 16 years, or 12 years, as the case may be. 
        
       
       
        
        (10) In this section:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          electronic communication 
           means email, Internet chat rooms, SMS messages, real time audio/video or other similar communication. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          procure 
           means knowingly entice or recruit for the purposes of sexual exploitation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    51 In sentencing an offender for an offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child under 16 years, the sentencing court must have regard primarily to the matters in s.9(6) of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Q). 
     
      
    52 Regina v Kennings [2004] QCA 162: the applicant was the first person to be sentenced for an offence under s.218A. He was 25 years old at the time of the offence. He visited a mainstream chat rooms and conversed with a police officer who posed as a 13 year old girl for the purpose of catching sexual predators in internet chat rooms. Relevant matters included:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The applicant’s persistent (over four days) and aggressive pursuit of a meeting with the person. 
       
       
      (2) The fact that the applicant had no previous convictions. 
       
       
      (3) He had voluntarily sought referral to a psychiatrist with positive results for treatment. 
       
       
      (4) Medical assessment that he had a low risk of re-offending. 
       
       
      (5) There was an element of enticement by the police. 
       
       
      (6) There was no real child involved. This was expressly found as a relevant consideration on penalty with reference in this regard to s.9(6) of the  
      Penalties and Sentences Act 
      . 
       
       
      (7) The applicant’s personal circumstances and obvious remorse and co-operation with the authorities. 
       
       
      (8) The ongoing medical treatment and prognosis. 
       
      
    53 The applicant had been in custody for three months as at the date of the appeal. The sentence of a term of imprisonment of two and a half years, to be suspended after serving nine months imprisonment for an operational period of four years, was held to be excessive and was set aside. In lieu, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months to be suspended immediately, for an operational period of four years. 
     
      
    54 Regina v Campbell [2004] QCA 342: the applicant was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment suspended after three months with an operational period of four years. 
     
      
    55 The applicant was aged 22 years at the time of the offences. He had five conversations with a police officer who posed as a 13 year old girl. The evidence established he was desirous of arranging a meeting with her. 
     
      
    56 The language used was very sexually explicit. He sent over the internet two photographs of himself depicting sexual activity. 
     
      
    57 The applicant had no previous convictions and his personal circumstances were similar to Kennings (supra). 
     
      
    58 Whilst he was not as insistent or aggressive in seeking a meeting as Kennings, that was amply balanced out by the more explicit sexual nature of the conversations and the photographs. 
     
      
    59 The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the applicant. 
     
      
    60 Regina v Burdon [2005] QCA 147: the applicant was 50 years of age. He was charged with two offences under s.218A of using the internet to expose a person he believed was under 16 years to indecent matter and a procuring offence under the section. 
     
      
    61 He was sentenced to community service on the first count and to 18 months imprisonment wholly suspended with an operational period of two years on the second count.  
     
      
    62 As in the cases of Kennings and Campbell, a police officer pretended to be a 13 year old girl. There were two separate conversations on 27 March 2004 and 5 April 2004, the second constituting the offence in Count 1. Thereafter, the offender continued to discuss sexual matters with the police officer acting in the pretence of being the 13 year old girl. The discussion involved extremely explicit sexual matters. He arranged to meet her and, on attending at the appointed place and time, was arrested by police. 
     
      
    63 He admitted the offences. The Prosecutor at sentence urged the sentencing judge to impose a term of imprisonment of 18 months suspended after three months to recognise the mitigating factors and the early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    64 The applicant had occupied a prominent place in his community and the local media interest in the case caused him great shame. He had no prior convictions. 
     
      
    65 The opinions of a treating psychologist and psychiatrist was that the offender was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    66 The Court of Appeal noted that the sentencing judge had recognised the importance of general deterrence and the clear policy behind the legislation to protect young people from such behaviour as occurred in this case. 
     
      
    67 On appeal, the Court noted the maximum penalty was five years imprisonment and that the sentencing judge had not placed undue emphasis on the offender having been shamed. 
     
      
    68 The Court observed that the conversations initiated by the offender were comparable in their sordidness to those in Kennings (supra) and that in both cases arrangements had been made to meet the “child” to pursue the lewd suggestions. 
     
      
    69 The Court of Appeal observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The widespread use of the internet in Australia, especially amongst young people, gives those like Burdon disposed to corrupting and sexually exploiting children unprecedented access to vast numbers of potential victims. In enacting s.218A Criminal Code the legislature has plainly intended to punish those who commit such acts and to deter those who might otherwise consider taking part in such behaviour with the aim of protecting children from predatory conduct of this type. It is of concern that Burdon, a successful middle aged businessman, who, in other ways, has been a worthy member of the community, would prey on an apparent 13 year old innocent and vulnerable child. His approaches were sickening and his persistence in encouraging the fictional Angela to meet him extremely concerning. 
        
       
       
        
        As in Campbell and Kennings, there was no real victim in the case and the sentence imposed cannot be as severe as if he had physically carried out his suggestions made over the internet. Nevertheless, denunciation, just punishment and special and general deterrence are important factors in determining sentences in cases like this.” 
        
       
      
    70 The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown appeal. The sentence imposed in Burdon (supra) is to be understood in light of:- 
     
      
       
      • The maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 
       
       
      • The Prosecutor’s submission to the sentencing judge to impose a term of imprisonment of 18 months suspended after three months. 
       
       
      • The offender’s early plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities. 
       
       
      • The medical and psychological evidence that support a low risk of re-offending and the offender having embarked on his own rehabilitation. 
       
       
      • The medical evidence that, at the time of the offence, the offender had been devastated and overwrought by the death of his father. 
       
       
      • The offender’s unblemished record in the community. 
       
      
    71 The Court of Appeal noted that it was a difficult decision as to whether these combined mitigating factors were sufficient to allow the imposition of an effective non-custodial sentence. The fact that the offender had completed 240 hours of community service in an exemplary manner, and the fact that the matter was still hanging over him with resultant public notoriety since arrest on 22 April 2004, were, the Court of Appeal held, additional matters that tipped the scales in his favour and accordingly the Attorney-General’s appeal was not allowed. The Court concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless, people who are considering using the internet like Burdon to attempt to make contact with young people with a view to corrupting or sexually exploiting them must now be on notice that such behaviour will be likely to result in a salutary penalty generally involving a term of actual imprisonment, even where indecent physical contact does not and could not eventuate.”  
        
       
      
    72 In Regina v McGrath [2005] QCA 463, the applicant had pleaded guilty to five offences under s.218A, receiving a sentence of four months imprisonment for each of his offences. These five offences comprised two counts of using the internet with intent to procure a child under 16 to engage in a sexual act under s.218A(1)(a), and three counts of using the internet to expose a child under 16 to indecent matter under s.218A(1)(b). 
     
      
    73 The applicant was aged 19 years at the time of the offence and had no prior convictions. The offences arose out of the applicant’s communications with two internet users – ‘Bec’ and ‘Tabitha’ – both supposed girls of age 13. They were, in fact, police officers. 
     
      
    74 In determining the application for leave to appeal the severity of sentence, the Court of Appeal had regard to:- 
     
      
       
      • The nature of the contact: the contact with Bec having been ‘relatively sporadic’ while the correspondence with Tabitha being of greater continuity. 
       
       
      • The content of the conversations: in particular, conversations with Bec in which blatant sexual propositions were put to her and instructions on how to perform sexual acts were provided. 
       
       
      • The absence of definite meeting arrangements: notably, in regards to Tabitha, the applicant had in later communications evidenced a disinclination to meet her. 
       
       
      • That the applicant had not sent explicit images to either supposed girl. 
       
       
      • That no real child was involved. 
       
       
      • As well as his guilty plea, his youth, and his low risk of re-offending. 
       
      
    75 Upon consideration of these matters, the Court determined, in respect of counts one and two, a sentence of four months imprisonment, suspended forthwith (the applicant having spent six days in custody) and with an operational period of 12 months was appropriate. In respect of the three remaining counts, the Court ordered that the applicant be placed on a 12 month probationary period. 
     
      
    76 Regina v Hays [2006] QCA 20: In relation to an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence, the applicant had previously pleaded guilty to four offences under s.218A, those being, two counts of intent to procure under s.218A(1)(a) and two counts of intent to expose under s.218A(1)(b). 
     
      
    77 The applicant appealed against his sentence of a term of imprisonment of 18 months, suspended after three months and with an operational period of two years. 
     
      
    78 The applicant, aged 29 years old, had used a chat room to engage in sexually explicit internet communications with another person, believed by the applicant to be a 13 year old girl (but who was, in fact, a police officer).  
     
      
    79 Whilst the appellate court acknowledged an absence of attempt by the applicant to arrange a meeting with the supposed girl, this was outweighed by other circumstances unfavourable to the applicant.  
     
      
    80 In refusing leave to appeal, the Court noted that the applicant had instigated the conversations with the supposed girl, that these conversations were explicit (extending to the provision of graphic instructions on how to masturbate herself) and that on two occasions the applicant had transmitted ‘over an appreciable’ period moving, real time images of himself masturbating. Furthermore, of relevance, the applicant had sought from the supposed girl, names of her friends similarly online, and having been provided with such names, later communicated with one such ‘friend’ (in reality, another police officer). These facts prompted the Court to hold that the sentence imposed, requiring actual imprisonment, was not manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    81 The above five sentencing decisions under s.218A of the Criminal Code (Q) share similar circumstances including, in particular that:- 
     
      
       
      • The offenders were (apart from  
      Burdon 
      ) comparatively youthful. 
       
       
      • There was no real child victim involved. 
       
       
      • Each involved early pleas of guilty. 
       
       
      • The offenders did not have any prior convictions. 
       
       
      • The risk of recidivism was considered to be low (although in  
      Hays 
       there was no evidence that the offender had undergone counselling). 
       
       
      • The maximum penalty in all five cases was five years. 
       
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    82 The Crown, as earlier noted in its submissions, submitted that it was important for the sentencing judge to focus on “the type of conduct” at which the legislation was directed. Accordingly, it contended, consideration needed to be given to the sentence that was “proportionate to the circumstances of the offence”: Crown’s written submissions, paragraph 7.4. 
     
      
    83 In determining the issues raised by Grounds 1 and 2, it is necessary to have regard to the nature of the statutory offence created by s.474.26 of the Code in determining the nature and type of circumstances that may properly be considered to be matters of aggravation of a particular offence and that otherwise bear upon its culpability when determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    84 The provisions of s.474.26 were introduced by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No 2) (2004). 
     
      
    85 In relation to the mischief to which it was directed, the explanatory memorandum discussed the then proposed provisions of s.474.26 to s.474.29 in the following terms (p.44):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Proposed sections 474.26 – 474.29 contain an offence regime targeting adult offenders who exploit the anonymity of telecommunications services (for example, the Internet) to win the trust of a child as a first step towards the future sexual abuse of that child. The practice is known as ‘on-line grooming’. 
        
       
       
        
        There are two steps routinely taken by adult offenders leading up to a real life meeting between adult and child victim that results in child sexual abuse:- 
        
       
       
        
        (i) The adult wins the trust of a child over a period of time. Adults often use ‘chat rooms’ on the Internet to do this. They may pose as another child, or as a sympathetic ‘parent’ figure. Paedophiles reportedly expose children to pornographic images as part of this ‘grooming’ process. It is proposed to specifically criminalise this practice. Specific offences would remove any doubt about whether ‘on-line grooming’ of a child before actual contact is ‘mere preparation’ (ie, not a criminal offence) or an unlawful attempt to commit child sexual abuse. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) With the child’s trust won, adults often use telecommunications services to set up a meeting with the child. Although this step is more likely to be characterised as an attempt to commit child sexual abuse, than step (i), it is desirable to provide a firm justification for police action by enacting specific ‘procurement’ or ‘solicitation’ offences. This is consistent with the underlying rationale for the new offences: to allow law enforcement to intervene before a child is actually abused.” 
        
       
      
    86 The explanatory memorandum discussed (at p.45) the proposed s.474.26, observing:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The proposed offence in sub-section 474.26(1) would apply to acts of procurement where the sender intends to procure the recipient to engage in sexual activity with the sender. Proposed paragraph 474.26(1)(b) contains this fundamental component of the offences: the sender must actually intend to procure sexual activity. It is not enough for the prosecution to show that the communications between sender and recipient were of a nature that would suggest the sender wanted to engage in sexual activity with the recipient. The prosecution must prove that the sender had this specific intention.” 
        
       
      
    87 Section 474.26(1) is contained within Part 10.6 – Telecommunications Services. It is part of Subdivision C of that Part which is concerned with “offences related to the use of telecommunications”. 
     
      
    88 The provision is directed to apply to acts of procurement in the use of a carriage service by the transmission of a communication by an adult to a “recipient” as referred to in sub-paragraph (c) of the section to engage in sexual activity. In other words, it is directed to proscribing those specified acts of procurement in the nature of “on-line grooming” [Explanatory Memorandum Australian (Telecommunications and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) (2004)]. 
     
      
    89 The provisions of s.474.26(1) include the following elements:- 
     
      
       
      • Specified  
      “conduct” 
       – the physical element of the offence – being the transmission of a communication by a carriage service to a  
      “recipient” 
      . 
       
       
      • That such conduct is undertaken with a specific intent, namely, procuring the recipient to engage in, or submit to, sexual activity with the sender. 
       
       
      • The recipient being (or, alternatively, the sender believing him or her to be) under 16 years of age. 
       
       
      • The sender is an adult, that is, at least 18 years of age. 
       
      
    90 The gravamen of the offence, accordingly, is conduct by any adult directed at children under 16 years undertaken with the specified state of mind by way of encouraging, enticing, recruiting a child under 16 years or inducing such a person (whether by threats, promises or otherwise) to engage in sexual activity as defined in s.478.28. 
     
      
    91 The specific intent referred to in s.476.26(1)(b) may, in a particular case, be inferred from the particular terms of the communication. 
     
      
    92 Section 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in Division 2 – General Sentencing Principles – requires a sentencing judge, inter alia, to take into account the “nature and circumstances” of the offences of which the applicant was convicted.  
     
      
    93 Accordingly, as earlier noted, the nature of the offence created by s.476.26 and the circumstances associated with an offence are central matters in determining an appropriate sentence for such an offence. 
     
      
    94 I consider that, in addition to the nature of the sexual activity proposed by the applicant, the following matters were relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The fact that a monetary offer was made by the applicant by way of inducement in his communication to the recipient on 15 July 2006 (Count 1). 
       
       
      (2) The invitation on 15 July 2006 to the recipient to engage in sexual activity with the applicant. 
       
       
      (3) The applicant’s persistence in pursuing the recipient in telephoning him from a public telephone on 30 July 2006 and on 5 August 2006 in which he asked the recipient if he was interested in engaging in sexual activity with him. 
       
       
      (4) The fact that the recipient was significantly below the age of 16 years, namely, 12 years of age. 
       
       
      (5) The extent of the age differential between the applicant (54 years at the date of the offences) and the recipient. 
       
       
      (6) The steps taken by the applicant to preserve his anonymity – the use of a false name  
      “Dan” 
      , the anonymous use of email addresses and the use of public telephones. 
       
      
    95 Communications that fall within s.474.26 may, of course, relate to a range of proposed sexual activity between sender and recipient of varying degrees of seriousness as the definition of “sexual activity” indicates: s.474.28(11). 
     
      
    96 A communication, for example, that expresses an intention to engage in sexual intercourse in contrast to some lesser form of sexual activity is a relevant circumstance in the assessment of the gravity of an offence. 
     
      
    97 However, a communication that contravenes the section may be deliberately or strategically expressed in terms that propose a lower level of sexual activity in order to enhance the prospects of initially establishing a relationship between the sender and the recipient and/or to disguise an existing intention to engage in a more serious level of sexual activity than that proposed. In other words, what may be termed a “low level” of proposed sexual activity may be considered by a “sender” to be more effective in encouraging, enticing or inducing etc a child than one that blatantly conveys a high level of sexual activity. 
     
      
    98 It may, on the facts of a particular case, be open to a sentencing judge in assessing the gravity of a s.472.62(1) offence, not to accept the terms of a communication as a true reflection of the level of sexual activity the sender had in mind, at least where, for example, the “sender” has a relevant history of serious past offending involving sexual activity with children. In other words, the terms of a communication may, but may not always be fully accepted on their face in the assessment of the gravity of an offence under the section. 
     
      
    99 With these considerations in mind, the sentencing judge was correct in having regard to the nature of the offence at which the legislation was directed. It was appropriate for him to consider the nature of the proposed sexual activity in this case as one amongst other factors to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. 
     
      
    100 The evidence in the present proceedings establishes that the circumstances of the offences were, in a number of respects, significantly different from the Queensland cases examined above. In particular, the applicant was convicted after a trial on three counts under s.474.26(1) and he had prior convictions for actual sexual conduct and there had been no demonstrated commitment by him to receiving treatment or rehabilitation. 
     
      
    101 Whilst the terms of the communications may not have been as explicit as those in certain of the abovementioned cases, their terms (proposing specific sexual activity to a 12 year old) must be considered as a serious breach of s.474.26(1). 
     
      
    102 An important matter which the sentencing judge was required to (and did) have regard to was the maximum penalty prescribed of 15 years imprisonment. This stands in contrast to the maximum penalty of five years imprisonment under s.218A of the Criminal Code (Q) if the child is under the age of 16 years and 10 years imprisonment, if the person is under 12 years. 
     
      
    103 The evaluation of the criminality of an offence is for the sentencing judge to determine upon the relevant evidence in relation to the crime. This requires the court to assess the seriousness of the offence. The maximum penalty for an offence may operate as a yardstick and may, in relation to certain offences, assume particular significance. 
     
      
    104 In Regina v H (1981) 3 A Crim R 53, Street CJ (dissenting in the result) observed (at 65):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… deterrence and community disapproval of various crimes, such disapproval carrying with it an expectation by the community of punishment, are accepted aspects of sentencing. The term of imprisonment prescribed by the relevant section of the Crimes Act is the public expression on these matters through the legislative process. It is for the judge to determine how important they are in a particular case but always by reference to the seriousness of the crime itself as pronounced by the penalty provided by the statute.” 
        
       
      
    105 Recently, the significance of the maximum penalty for an offence as a “yardstick” was discussed by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in their joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 in particular, at [30] and [31]. Their Honours said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “30. Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. Judges need sentencing yardsticks. It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance. In their book sentencing, Stockdale and Devlin observed that:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘A maximum sentence fixed by Parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century … or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level … At other times, the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that the Parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate]. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        31. It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard, they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick …” 
        
       
      
    106 In relation to an offence under s.474.26(1), a sentencing judge, in my opinion, is required to give careful attention to the fact that the federal legislature has prescribed a maximum penalty for an offence under the section of 15 years imprisonment and that that, of itself, is a distinguishing aspect to those cases decided under s.218A of the Criminal Code (Q). 
     
      
    107 The question remains as to whether or not, having regard to all of the relevant circumstances, including the maximum penalty for an offence under s.474.26(1), the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case of a sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years for each of the three offences was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    108 In my assessment, the circumstances referred to in paragraph [94] characterise the offence as an objectively serious one. Applying the maximum penalty of 15 years as a yardstick for the present case, I consider that, although the offences fall short of what would be considered to be the most serious type of offence under s.474.26(1), they are nonetheless offences involving grave criminality. On that basis, I am of the opinion that the sentencing judge’s assessment of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years is outside the appropriate range for a case of this kind. I am, however, of the opinion that they warrant substantial sentences, having regard, in particular, to considerations of individual and general deterrence. It follows that it will be necessary for the sentence in question to be set aside and for this Court to re-sentence the applicant.  
     
      
    109 In the event that this Court did come to re-sentence, the applicant sought to rely upon his own affidavit sworn 18 May 2008. 
     
      
    110 The Crown objected to the affidavit as it had only been recently received and time had not permitted enquiries to be made with the Junee Correctional Centre where the applicant was currently serving his sentence. The particular matter the Crown indicated concern about was the statement in the affidavit (paragraph [2]) that he did not have access to counselling. 
     
      
    111 On 2 June 2008, the Crown filed an affidavit of Rachael Anderson of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, sworn 2 June 2008. That affidavit attached a letter from Dom Karauria, the General Manager of the organisation that operates the Junee Correctional Centre. A copy of Ms Anderson’s affidavit has been sent to the applicant’s solicitor. 
     
      
    112 Mr Karauria states in his abovementioned letter that the applicant was received at the Centre as a Protection Requiring Limited Association (PRLA) inmate. He also stated in respect of such inmates:- 
     
      
       
        
        “They also have access to one-on-one counselling services where they can submit a form at any time to be seen by a counsellor as soon as the counsellor is available.”  
        
       
      
    113 Mr Karauria also stated that such inmates have limited access to employment but that the applicant had not completed his “Pre-Employment Course” to be eligible to obtain work. 
     
      
    114 On 10 June 2008, pursuant to directions given by the Court, a letter was sent to the Registrar of the Court by the applicant’s solicitor. In that letter, it is stated that the applicant presses the affidavit filed on behalf of the applicant at the hearing and essentially accepts that he has access to a counsellor in accordance with Mr Karauria’s letters. 
     
      
    115 I am of the opinion that an appropriate sentence for each offence to be a head sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    116 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) The sentence imposed by the District Court of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years for each of the three counts be quashed. 
       
       
      (3) In lieu, the applicant is sentenced as follows:- 
       
       
        
        (a) Count 1: the applicant is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment dating from 25 August 2006 and to expire on 24 August 2014. 
         
         
        (b) Count 2: the applicant is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment dating from 25 August 2006 and to expire on 24 August 2014. 
         
         
        (c) Count 3: the applicant is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment dating from 25 August 2006 and to expire on 24 August 2014. 
         
         
        (d) In respect of each of the offences in Count 1, Count 2 and Count 3, there is to be a non-parole period of 5 years dating from 25 August 2006 and to expire on 24 August 2011, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released on parole.

   JUDGMENTApplications to exclude evidence pursuant to ss 85, 90, and 138 Evidence Act 1995 1. Ernst Hufnagl is charged: Between about 21 September 2004 and 31 March 2005 at Sydney, NSW and elsewhere, he did conspire with John Paul Holloway and divers other persons to dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another person with the intention of permanently depriving the other person of the property, namely one shipping container numbered TEXU7273351 and its contents, which property belonged to a Commonwealth entity, that is the Australian Customs Service.   2. The Crown case is that the accused participated in an alleged conspiracy. The principal demonstration of his participation occurred at the Port Botany terminal on the night of the 31 st March 2005. The accused was a stevedore with eight or more years working experience with P&O Ports who serviced part of the Port Botany terminal. While working as a forklift driver in the Rail Heavy Lifting section on the night of 31 st March 2005, according to the prosecution he loaded onto a semi trailer a 40foot container TEXU7273351 (hereafter TEXU ‘351), which was then unlawfully removed from the Port Botany terminal by other participants in the conspiracy. The Port Botany terminal is a secure terminal, in that only authorized vehicles and personnel are allowed into the terminal and only authorized containers were released from the terminal.  3. As a consequence of viewing CCTV footage both the accused’s employers and the Australian Customs Service (ACS) settled upon the accused as a person of interest. His premises were searched on the morning of 27 th April 2005 by ACS. That search was recorded to the extent that conversations occurring during the search were recorded on tape. A 64 page transcript of the tape has been taken out and became Voir Dire Exhibit 1. While not specified with precision in the search warrant, the defence conceded the terms of the warrant entitled the searchers to look for and seize samples of the accused’s handwriting. ACS investigators seized two such samples. However, the defence objects to the proposed tender of other samples of a series of designated words and numbers written ten times over by the accused at the request of Customs Officers. There is no dispute the Customs Officers desired the repeated writing of the words and numbers as samples to be submitted later for forensic comparison with writing contained on various papers the investigators had collected during their search for evidence.  4. The defence further objects to the portion of the contents (pp29 – 30) of a 34- page record of interview (ROI) as containing admissions caused to be made by the accused as a consequence of misrepresentations and other improprieties by Officers of the ACS conducting the interview. The defence sought exclusion of the relevant admissions pursuant to any of sections 85, 90 and/or 138 of the Evidence Act 1995.  A search warrant is executed 5. At 7:45am Wednesday, 27th April 2005 Customs Officers David Rooney (Rooney), Colin Oxford (Oxford) and “some gentlemen” (T. Search Warrant p.3) arrived at the accused home to execute a search warrant. The accused was provided with a copy of the warrant and invited to read it. Early in the execution of the warrant, Rooney cautioned the accused in the following terms:  Well, before I start talking to you about this, I may caution you first up and advise you that I may be asking you some questions you are not obliged to answer but anything that you do say will be taken down on the tape and will be recorded and may be used in evidence. Do you understand that?  6. It should be noted by the uninitiated, the caution was limited in its terms: “I may caution you first up”; “I may be asking you some questions you are not obliged to answer”; “anything you say will be taken down on tape…and may be used in evidence? (Emphasis supplied) 7. While the Customs Officers were waiting for the accused’s children to leave the house for school, they asked some questions of the accused in respect of matters that went directly to his part in the alleged offence (pp8 – 12.).  The accused is cautioned. 8. A second caution in the conventional terms was administered immediately prior to the commencement of the search proper by Oxford. Having administered the caution Oxford also took the opportunity to ask questions in respect of the offence (pp 20 – 22.4). Officially the search appears to commence at 8:16am (p26). Thus it would appear the second caution was administered some minutes before 8:16am.  9. Numerous items were found during the search, five of which were seized. The tape picked up a whispered conversation between Rooney and Oxford. Oxford is saying:  Just ask if we can get samples. They can get samples of his handwriting. We can take it under the general terms of the warrant.” (words and punctuation changes added to transcript version of tape by me after hearing recording). It appears this may be the first consideration given by either Officer to a collection of sample handwriting by the accused. While there is an “Okay” recorded on the transcript as the next response from the accused, it is clear from the tape he was not a party to the conversation between Rooney and Oxford.  10. As the search progresses it must have become clear to the accused the ACS Officers were interested in samples of his handwriting. For example on several occasions he is asked if a document recently selected contains his handwriting. This exchange occurs (p.31.8) between Rooney and the accused:   Rooney : Would this be your handwriting on this particular page here at the moment?  Accused : Yeah, looks like it. Yeah. Rooney : Okay, We’ll also take that page. Basically what we’re looking at is the handwriting.  11. The search moved onto other rooms. At p.48 Oxford has another whispered conversation with an unidentified person, probably Rooney:   
     
      
      To my untrained eye – one of those things. Not many people read a general … got a general power to take samples for forensic purposes. So handwriting samples for forensic purposes …explanations (?) … doesn’t have to meet the conditions … Ask him a few more but… [punctuation changed; and words added from printed transcript after hearing tape].  
      
     The accused provides samples of his handwriting 12. At p.57 a revue commences of the evidence found and seized. The time is now a little after 9:41am. At p. 60 Rooney is recorded as again telling the accused:  “We are looking at the handwriting that is involved there.” 13. There is a discussion about a small notebook that is apparently used by the accused to record how much money he collects each week from those he plays golf with for an end of year Christmas party. This exchange occurs between the accused, Rebecca, a Customs Officer, Rooney and Oxford:   Accused : There shouldn’t be any notes in there Rebecca : I mean like your handwritten notes Accused : Yes, yes. There would be that in there, yes. Rebecca : That’s all there is. I’m not sure … Rooney : Well, hopefully just saying we could get that back to you. Oxford : There is another way around it, which I will let Rebecca do her thing first [enter seized items in the relevant log book].  Accused : It just means we will be a week behind, that’s it…. Oxford : Before we finish, as you can see we have taken a number of handwriting samples of yours just for comparison against some other items that we have.  Accused: Yes  Rooney : Now, as I was saying, there is another way that we can do it and that is for you to give us a handwriting sample. Would you be prepared to do that?  Accused : Yes, I was going to say that myself. Why didn’t you just ask me for one?  Rooney : Yes okay. (Apparently speaking to someone else) Hang on a minute - not with the computers, but with the other handwriting pieces – a minute [punctuation changed from transcript].  Oxford : What is normally required is for comparison, they need a minimum of 10 samples of each word. What I’ve done is, they are the words we are interested in. If you would be prepared to write those 10 times?  Accused : Yes, Who wrote that? It’s a spitting image of mine [Words additional to transcript after hearing tape played].  Oxford: Me.  14. Thereafter the accused writes, 10 times, a series of words, number combinations, vehicle registration numbers and his name as directed by Oxford and Rooney.  15. The accused remarks at the conclusion of the exercise:  
     
      
      You have obviously got that because my handwriting is on something. Somebody has got hold of something with my handwriting on it and I know that for a fact.  
      
     16. The exchange with Rooney continues:  Rooney : You said you know that for a fact that somebody has got some handwriting  Accused : Well, that’s the only reason you will be doing this, comparing this with someone else.  Oxford : Yes, obviously, yes, there is some handwriting we need to check and eliminate.  The defence objects: 17. It would appear, as best one can tell, the sample of 10 times words and numbers was commenced about 1½ hours after the full caution given by Customs Officer Oxford.  18. The defence submissions are that the words and numbers as created by the accused in the sample constitute representations made by him of handwriting; that their reception into evidence would be adverse to his interest and therefore constitute admissions made by him. The defence argument is that the admission of these requested samples into evidence in the present case would be unfair to the accused. (s.90 Evidence Act 1995) 19. I accept the handwriting samples are capable of constituting admissions against interest made by the accused. A review of the circumstances in which the admissions were made establish the following propositions:  ·  The accused was initially put on notice that some of what he said may be used as evidence against him. Generally the initial caution was inadequate – but it gave him some notice that some evidence could be gathered during the search warrant. ·  The second caution made clear that anything he did or said could be used in evidence against him. ·  The Customs Officers were interested in his handwriting – and communicated their interest to him. ·  The searchers made clear to him they were interested in collecting existing samples of his handwriting for purposes of comparison. ·  The customs officers made the accused aware that when the truck, being driven around by John Holloway, was searched there was a slip of paper, part of the driver’s log, that had the accused’s name on it. ·  The accused was making a point of co-operating with, and seen to be co-operating with the searchers. ·  The accused told the searchers he was “freaking out” and “why would he” [Holloway] have my name in his truck”; “why did he write my name down” (my emphasis); “that’s what’s scaring me”. ·  The accused was also presenting as being confident that his non-involvement would be established. “I’m not really concerned because I didn’t do anything wrong”; “I’m not hiding anything” and “I’m sure you wont find anything [on the computers]”. ·  The Custom Officers were canvassing with the accused that there was another way that handwriting comparison samples could be accomplished – that is the supplying of such samples by the accused. It is unclear whether this was being canvassed as an alternative to the seizing of samples. It would appear the seized samples were already entered on the seized documents log. It would also appear there was no return of the seized documents. No complainant has been made by the defence that the return of the items was a condition precedent to the accused’s agreement to supply samples of his handwriting. Nor am I prepared, as presently advised to make any such finding. ·  The accused’s response to the request he supply samples of handwriting is determinative of his attitude – “Yes, I was going to say that [I am willing to supply a sample] myself. Why didn’t you ask me for one.” ·  The Customs Officers were seeking the samples of handwriting outside the terms of the search warrant. They appear well aware that their chances of obtaining such a sample depended upon “asking” the accused to supply them.  20. For the purposes of the voir dire I am satisfied the accused position towards the ACS search warrant team was that he had nothing to hide; apart from gossip at the workplace he had heard nothing about the theft of TEXU’351; and that he was prepared to cooperate with the investigators. He well knew the investigators were interested in comparing his handwriting with other handwriting in their possession prior to agreeing to supply samples. He well knew, prior to providing samples of his handwriting, the ACS regarded comparisons of his handwriting as having a potential of making or confirming him a suspect. I do not rule out as a possibility (although it would seem remote) that he may have believed the comparison of his handwriting was limited to the handwriting on the back of the driving log that contained his name. However, the sample writing of his name was among the final exercises required of him by Oxford. I am also satisfied he was anxious to establish his willingness to cooperate. Hence he accepted the invitation claiming, probably truthfully, that he was contemplating making the same offer as was requested of him.  21. In a situation where he was seeking to advance his claim of non-involvement and where he had been cautioned he did not have to say or do anything, it can hardly be unfair to him to admit the samples of handwriting he voluntarily supplied. Further, he volunteered when he well knew the sample writing contained in the documents was desired by the investigators to compare to other handwriting in their possession.  22. I review the terms and scope of s.90 Evidence Act 1995 later in this judgment. It is sufficient if I say there is nothing in the circumstances of the taking of the samples that suggests unfairness to the accused at his trial. Sections 85 and 138 have no application to this matter.  23. The application to exclude this evidence from the jury is rejected  An application to exclude part of the ROI24. On 5th May 2005 the accused was interviewed by Custom Investigator David Rooney (Rooney) at Customs House Mascot. Also present was Customs Investigator Ted Geverding and a solicitor, Philip Pastfield, provided by the accused’s industrial union. The interview was recorded on a tape recorder. The transcript of the recording was tendered on the voir dire.  25. There was no indication from either investigator at the outset of the interview of the general purpose of, or the reason for the interview. However, the accused could have been in no doubt that he was being questioned by ACS officers in respect of the disappearance TEXU’351, from the P&O terminal at Port Botany on 31 st March 2005. 26. The Crown case is the accused used a forklift he was working to load TEXU’351 onto the trailer pulled by a Red Atkinson prime mover being driven by one John Holloway (nominated in the indictment as a co-conspirator). Prior to the interview Rooney had studied CCTV footage of the terminal taken at the time of the theft of TEXU’351. Contained within that footage were images in which a person, dressed in a distinctive yellow shirt and tan coloured shorts, approached the Red Atkinson semi-trailer and then entered through the passenger side door into the prime mover’s cabin prior to its trailer being loaded with the container. On the Crown case this was an act done by the accused in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Three still shots used in the interview27. Three still shots of the CCTV footage were loaded onto Rooney’s computer for use during the record of interview. The first still shot, which I have assumed is the best photograph available for its intended purpose from all the CCTV footage showed a male dressed in a yellow, long sleeve garment and light coloured shorts that appear lighter than the colour of the male’s skin, with a full head of brown hair, walking through a doorway and looking away from the camera. While there are no distinctive facial features visible, the parties agree it is a photograph of the accused, no doubt based upon their earlier viewing of the CCTV. Frankly, however, this still photograph – as distinct from the moving image on the CCTV - does not present as a vehicle for forensic identification or recognition by a person who, prior to the incident, had not previously met or known the accused. I do accept the accused recognized himself from the photograph.  28. The second shows the Red Atkinson prime mover and a trailer parked in a holding yard prior to entering the terminal proper.  29. The third was taken from the CCTV footage at a time when a person dressed in the distinctive yellow upper garment approached the Red Atkinson prime mover still some 5 to 8 metres from the passenger side door. The quality in the photographic printout from the computer screen is abysmal. Allowing for a somewhat better reproduction of the original CCTV image on the computer screen, the image displayed on the computer must still have been abysmal for any useful forensic identification.  30. The photograph tendered in evidence appears as though taken through a lens with a reddish tinged filter. There is a reddish hue throughout. There are 2dozen or so small white patches scattered haphazardly through the picture. The evidence discloses these are lights scattered throughout the terminal, situate below the main lighting on tall poles not shown in the photograph. Having viewed the CCTV footage these lights appear attached to moving equipment such as cranes, gantries, forklifts, and vehicles. Some of those small white patches, now identified as lights, also had a prominent reddish hue. On first viewing this third photograph it may take the viewer, particularly without the aid of an earlier viewing of the second photograph, some time to identify the Red Atkinson, its trailer, cabin and wheels. Indeed from this third photograph it is difficult to tell the outline of the front of the truck, for example where the truck grill (if it has one) is located, whether the prime mover’s front is flat, level with the driver’s window, or has an engine contained forward of the windows like an old Rolls Royce.  31. Between the truck and bottom margin of the paper is an orange oval shape – perhaps the size of the index finger’s fingernail. From this photograph it would be impossible to identify the nature of the object, its true colour, or where it began or ended. Remembering the red hue covering the photograph, as a matter of logic, one might conclude its true colour is not accurately depicted by the photographic reproduction. The centre of the object is lighter than the margins. It may be the object could be mistaken for a stainless steel drum reflecting light.  32. On the Crown case it is the accused, clothed in a yellow long sleeved shirt walking away from the camera towards the truck. The gender, head, arms, or any other physical attribute is absolutely unrecognizable in this photograph. This photograph was used unfairly in the accused’s record of interview to finesse a response from him.  Impropriety occurs in the interview33. In the course of the interview the accused admitted that he generally always wore a yellow florescent shirt and a pair of shorts. He told the investigators that on the relevant day he was working as a forklift driver for each of the three work sessions during his shift.  34. Contained in the interview is the following (which is the subject of objection):  Rooney : All right. I’m now – I’m going to show you a series of images from CCTV footage that was given – was taken on the night of the 31 st March at P&O Ports. You may be able to assist us with some identification of situations, and provide answers that may clarify some of these outstanding questions we've got but just before we examine the photographs, which we have a series of here, I would like to remind you that you are still under the caution that I administered earlier. Therefore, I repeat that you are under no obligation to say or do anything, as anything you do say will be recorded on the tape recorder as the interview takes place, and may be later given in evidence.  Accused: Yeah. Rooney : Right, okay. Now, we will go into some tapes. I’d like you to look at these, if you would please, Ernst ---  Accused: Mm Rooney : --- because I’m partly in a position to also see these. The first one that we’re coming up to …  Accused: This one here?  Rooney : Okay. What we have there, we’ve got the truck. That is the red truck, that is there. It shows the red truck that was involved waiting to actually enter the loading area. [punctuation changed from ROI transcript].  Accused: Mm. Rooney : Do you see the red truck there? Accused: Yeah. Rooney : Move the screen if you cannot see it, right? Is that better? Accused: That’s better.  Rooney : Okay. As you’ll see the red truck is sitting there. Accused: Mm. Rooney : Do you recognise this vehicle? Accused : No, it doesn’t ring a bell. Rooney : Okay, so if we could move on please, Ted [Geverding] to the next one. All right. Now, what we have here is the truck again.  Accused: Mm. Rooney : Let me explain first with these. These photographs are not that clear on this computer.  Accused: Yeah. Rooney : We’ve had these blown up. But we are getting them digitally enhanced. We can recognise --- [punctuation changed from transcript].  Accused: Mm. Rooney : --- everything. Okay. Now, this picture shows a person approaching the truck ---  Accused: Mm. Rooney --- and this person has been identified as you. Accused: Yeah Rooney : Now, why did you approach the truck? Geverding: Can I ask a question?  Accused: Do I have to ---  Rooney : Well, hang on just one moment. Geverding : I don’t - its only for the benefit – I don’t know where the person is. (my emphasis). Rooney : Okay, yeah. I know it’s awkward but it’s right here. (probably indicating on photograph – or at least so I have inferred).  Geverding : I just though for any benefit --- Rooney : Yeah, good point so I should have actually pointed that out but ---  Geverding: Yeah. Rooney : --- it’s walking to the truck. Geverding: Yeah, all right.  Accused : Well, the only explanation I can give for that is, if it was on that night, is that that’s the idiot that said he had my phone. Remember I told you I’d lost my phone (punctuation changed from ROI transcript).  Rooney: Right. Accused : Right, and I went and asked a few people. Rooney : So you give me your explanation. Accused : Yeah, so after I asked a few truck drivers, he said, “I found the phone” all right, and I said, “Well, have you got it?” He said, “It’s in my truck.” So I said, “Well, can I get it?” and he said, “Yeah, go out to the truck. Come out to the truck and I’ll give it to you.” Yeah, so anyway I jumped into the truck, he handed me a phone, it wasn’t it. So I said, “This is not my phone.” He said “Well, you can have it anyway. It’s an old one I found.” I said, “I don’t want your phone. It’s not my phone” something alone those lines. So I said, “All right” and that’s it.  Now, this is getting out of hand now and it’s just starting to freak me out. These blokes …. [paragraphing not in original ROI text].  Rooney: Okay Accused : Christ, these blokes are setting me up real bad. I don’t know Phil. Should I answer any more questions? (punctuation changed from transcript)  Pastfield : Well, it’s a matter for you. If you want to stop now and have a chat to me first, that’s your right to do so.”  35. There is a passage in this section of the interview that needs to be examined in some detail. Rooney is talking:   
     
      
      “…These photographs are not that clear on this computer. We’ve had these blown up. But we’re getting them digitally enhanced. We can recognise everything. Okay. Now, this picture shows a person approach the truck and this person has been identified as you.”  
      
     36. It is difficult to understand the purpose of this passage to the questioning of the accused on the topic about to be approached. That topic, if I understood it correctly was to question the accused about his knowledge of, and circumstances in which he may have approached and entered the cabin of the Red Atkinson. This passage’s purpose, as with the whole of the questioning, could only have been about advancing the investigators knowledge of the circumstances of the offence, by establishing a series of false premises (blowing up of the still shots/digitally enhancement/recognition of everything/identification of accused) to ask the question immediately following this passage – “Now why did you approach the truck?”.  37. It may also have been about overstating the strength of the investigators’ potential evidence against the accused. The purpose of overstating the strength of the investigators’ position could only have been related to intimidating the accused.  38. I have accepted Rooney’s observation: “These photographs are not that clear” as an understatement. It is to be remembered, but for Geverding’s interruption the object that was said to be “a person” “approach[ing]” a truck would not have been specifically drawn to the accused’s attention.  39. The comment: “We’ve had these blown up” was capable of being construed as, and in my view was, a misrepresentation. No photographs had been blown up. Customs Officer Rooney’s evidence is that what he meant by these words was that the original CCTV images had been seen by him on a larger screen than the computer screen being used in the interview. There is such a gulf between what Rooney says he meant and what he actually said that it is difficult to accept him as accurately evidencing what he really meant by these words. I suspect he was dissembling when he was cross-examined on this topic.  40. Rooney next told the accused: “We’re getting them digitally enhanced.” It is to be remembered, from the perspective of the accused, this is an officer with all the resources of a major Commonwealth department behind him making a positive statement of what would be, or what was then happening to the “blown up” photographs. It may also be capable of being interpreted as an explanation of why the “blown up” photographs were not present at the interview. In fact the photographs, or more accurately the CCVT stills stored to computer files were never digitally enhanced.  41. These representations were followed by a further: “We can recognise everything.” The statement is expressed in the plural. Any review of the evidence before me most favourable to Rooney, would leave open the proposition that he alone would claim to “recognise everything” in the photograph. Even so, he was not put to the test on that score in the cross-examination. However, in answer to the one question he was asked on this topic he conceded he could not recognise the accused’s face. The statement was intended as a self-serving precursor to what followed: “this person has been identified as you.”  42. Rooney’s evidence was he recognised the accused from the CCTV footage that was the original source of the third photograph. The so called recognition of the accused was based upon an assumption of the gender of the person, the colour of the shorts when they were visible, the colour and cut of the yellow work garment, and an assumption that it was florescent. Of all the stevedore workers on duty that day, only three (evidence subsequent to the voir dire put the number at five) were said to be wearing a yellow upper garment. Of those claimed three, only the accused was said to possess a full head of brown hair. Thus when a full head of hair was visible in a yellow, long sleeved, (assumed) florescent upper garment, by a process of elimination, the person so seen was assumed to be male and “recognised"" as the accused. Finally it was said the accused had a particular gait from which he could also be recognised. Rooney’s evidence was when viewing the particular passage of the CCTV footage from which the photograph was taken he identified the accused from the cut and colour of the yellow work upper garment, the colour of the shorts, the full head of hair and the gait of the accused in the last few steps before the person entered the Red Atkinson’s cabin.  43. The next statement by Rooney is “Now this picture shows a person approaching the truck.” That would not have been apparent to the accused viewing the photograph for the first time. Frankly it could never have been apparent to a stranger to the photograph who had not seen the CCTV footage. I accept the CCTV footage shows someone walking to the truck. But the photograph from the footage fails miserably to depict that proposition. The accused should not have been required to take the interviewer’s word on this proposition.  44. Rooney’s ace was: “This person has been identified as you.” I regard this statement as a misrepresentation. It is significant that the person or persons who made the claimed identification and their knowledge of the accused was/were not identified to the accused by Rooney. A fair reading of the statement leaves open an implication to the accused that a person or persons other than Rooney made the claimed identification. Only one independent person, Joseph Schofield, has been offered by the Crown as expressing any opinion on the identity of the person approaching the truck. Rooney’s evidence was that Andrew Adam and Joseph Schofield also identified the figure approaching the truck’s cabin as the accused. In cross examination he conceded the identification came about in circumstances where there were a number of persons in the room looking at the CCTV all of whom reached a general agreement that it was the accused. Such identification is really of little forensic value if it comes from general discussion and a pooling of ideas. The prospects of contamination are high. 45. Andrew Adams was not called to give evidence on the voir dire. Earlier he had given evidence in the trial. But neither side asked questions of him on this topic.  46. Mr Schofield is a member of P&O’s senior management who worked with the accused and knows him well. He conceded he could not identify the accused as that person and that he made a statement in those terms shortly after he viewed the CCTV footage. Rooney claimed Schofield was one of those who made the identification. This so called identification was based upon a theory as to gender, clothing, hair colour and covering, and gait for the last few steps before the person entered the semi’s cabin. If the premise was incorrect, the identification was in peril. Rooney was, in the circumstances, required to expose to the accused the basis of his identification so that his thesis could be understood by, and if there was an answer, then answered by the accused. By that I mean obtain concessions from the accused that he was one of only 5 persons wearing that particular yellow garment that night, that the other four were of otherwise different appearance, that there were no women working in the yard, that he favoured his left leg when walking, and so on. The failure so to do was a denial of natural justice to the accused.  47. A fair reading of this introductory passage from Rooney would leave the impression the interrogator had seen blown up stills that were clearer than the computer image shown to the accused; that the blown up stills were to be enhanced so that the digitally enhanced images would provided clearer images still. There may well be circumstances where that detail would be admissible if given evidence by Rooney outside a record of interview, but this is not one of them. Further, the passage also leaves the impression that investigators could recognise everything from the blown up pictures including the third one shown to the accused on the computer and that the picture on the computer was a picture of the accused approaching the truck, and that he was so identified by an independent witness or independent witnesses. That evidence if given outside the interview would not be admissible from Rooney – it would not be relevant, would be hearsay, and would contravene principles enunciated in the High Court case of Mundara Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50.  48. Having put these inadmissible representations to the accused Rooney then asked his question:  Now why did you approach the truck?  49. While Geverding’s reaction to the question is the first recorded, the reaction of the accused bears a moment’s consideration. He asks an unfinished question “Do I have to ---”. From the transcript it is not apparent to whom the question was directed. Some indication of that is given in the final parts of the whole excerpt of the interview quoted. I am satisfied the question that was interrupted was addressed to Phillip Pastfield, the solicitor. I am satisfied these were the first words formulating an enquiry from the accused as to whether he was required to answer or continue with the interview. The accused appears to have been interrupted by Rooney : “Well, hang on just one moment.” 50. Then there was some further explanation of the photograph at the request of Geverding, but Rooney’s question was not withdrawn. It should be already readily apparent from what has been thus far set out, but let it be clearly said, the conduct of Rooney at the point in the interview where he shows the accused the third photograph and then seeks to question upon it, was improper.  51. The impropriety, however, did not stop there. The propositions enunciated by Rooney in his explanation of the pictures, if true, were highly incriminating of the accused, namely that the object selected by Rooney as a person was indeed the accused captured on CCTV; and secondly, that at the moment he was so captured he was approaching the Red Atkinson. Prior to asking the accused why he approached the truck, it was incumbent upon Rooney to obtain admissions from the accused that he was the person in the photograph and that he had approached the truck. That was not done. In those circumstances Rooney’s question assumed both propositions adversely to the accused. It is a classic instance of the “Have you stopped beating your wife?” type questions. The accused’s reaction to it, as expressed to Pastfield, “Christ, these blokes are setting me up real bad.” is entirely understandable.  52. I am satisfied the answers given by the accused, now sought to be relied upon by the Crown would not have been made in the form they were made but for the impropriety of the questioner. I am satisfied the conduct leading up to the question was improper because of the representations made by Rooney. I am also satisfied the question itself was an improper question. I am satisfied there were instances of procedural unfairness to the accused demonstrated in the portion of the record of interview now under consideration. That procedural unfairness is to be found in the misrepresentations, the denial of natural justice and the improper questions. Each constitutes and collectively all constitute unfairness to the accused.  53. The accused’s immediate response “Yeah” to the representation, “this person has been identified as you.” is not to be construed as an acceptance, admission to or an agreement with the proposition that the object in the still shot on the computer screen is him. Throughout the interview to this point he has used the word ‘Yeah’ or the sound “Mm” on several occasions as nothing more than a responsive filler to indicate he is following what is being said. On other occasions he has used the word “Yeah” to indicate acceptance of or agreement. The “Yeah” uttered by the accused immediately before the one after Rooney’s question is an example of him using “Yeah” as a responsive filler. His second use of “Yeah” as a responsive filler becomes clear once the significance of the accused’s words “Do I have to ---“ is understood.  54. The accused’s answer appears based upon the premises set by his questioner. He replies: “The only explanation I can give for this is if it was on this night is this idiot said he had my phone.” (my emphasis). Thereafter an account is given by the accused explaining his entry into the truck. The Crown says the account is false. The Crown would be seeking to rely upon it as a demonstration of a consciousness of guilt. In the alternate it would seek to rely upon it as a serious attack upon the credibility of the accused, particularly as to his honesty.  55. Thus the Court is asked by the prosecution to excuse the behaviour of the investigators – behaviour that also goes to the credibility of the investigators – so that it can attack the credibility of the accused, perhaps to the ultimate by advancing a consciousness of guilt argument. To do so would be unfair to the accused.  56. Consciousness of guilt would certainly be a factual issue of the question of guilt, as distinct from simply being a credit issue. As I said during argument, I would be reluctant to leave consciousness of guilt to the jury when other explanations are equally compelling. The answer as given raises an element of speculation - “if it was on this night”. The answer also has an element of acceptance of assertions made by Rooney (the truck was involved in the heist, there was a person in the photograph, the person was approaching the truck, and that person was the accused) none of which the accused had admitted as being within his knowledge. A theory of consciousness of guilt based upon such illusory foundations should not be allowed to go to the jury. It would only be upon an acceptance of Rooney’s assertions that the explanation given by the accused would be a lie (assuming for the sake of argument it is a lie) qualifying as one sufficiently telling as to permit consciousness of guilt to be considered by the jury.  57. That appears to leave the accused’s answer (assuming it is a lie) as going to credit issue, particularly a deliberate untruthfulness.  The position of the parties 58. The defence argues Rooney behaved improperly during this portion of the interview. It should be excluded pursuant to s85, s90 and/or s138 Evidence Act 1995.  59. The Crown says if I determine there was impropriety or improper conduct, I should have regard only to s138 to determine the issue. My understanding of the Crown position is that if the improper conduct resulted in an unfairness, I should still assess the admissibility against the criteria set in s.138(3). Initially the Crown resisted the existence of impropriety in Rooney’s questioning. However, as the argument continued, my sense was the Crown recognised a likelihood that an impropriety would be found by me. In fairness to the Crown I should note, I do not regard its preparation of Exhibit Book II with the relevant passage excluded as any concession by it that the defence had made out its argument. It was more a recognition of the inevitable – that I had determined, despite Crown’s argument to the contrary, to exclude the relevant passage.  The resolution60. Section 85 Evidence Act 1995 applies to evidence of an admission made by an accused in criminal proceedings. The admission has to be made in the course of official questioning, that is questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the possible commission of a criminal offence by the accused. I am satisfied Rooney was an investigating officer. Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.  61. The passage relied upon by the Crown is the passage it argues constitutes a deliberately dishonest reason for the accused’s approaching the cabin of the Red Atkinson. The dictionary definition of “admission” as meaning a representation that is made by a defendant in criminal proceedings and is adverse to his interest in the outcome of the proceedings. Given that the use the Crown seeks to make of the passage is adverse to the accused’s interest in the outcome of the proceedings, the passage constitutes an admission.  62. There is little doubt the circumstances in which the admission was made will ensure it was accurately recorded. If that is what is meant by the “truth of the admission” then section 85 would not offer any comfort to the defence. Neither party sought to argue it had any other meaning or could carry more than one connotation.  63. The next question is whether I should then determine whether s.90 applies. However, before I can do that, I must confront the Crown argument that in the event of any impropriety I must consider s.138. S. 90 Evidence Act is not necessarily dependant upon an impropriety in the circumstances in which an admission is made. The conditions precedent to the operation of s.90 include: criminal proceedings, evidence of an admission being adduced by the prosecution, and the circumstances in which the admission was made being unfair to an accused to use the evidence. Where those conditions precedent apply, the discretion of the court appears limited to two propositions - refusing to admit the evidence at all, or alternatively, refusing to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact (such as say consciousness of guilt). As the section presents, proved unfairness must yield one of two results.  64. By contrast s.138 gives to the Court discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence. The conditions precedent to its enlivenment include “evidence” obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. “Evidence” embraces admissions, but of course, includes much more than admissions. The discretion given to the Court is a balancing exercise expressed as unlawfully or improperly (tainted) “evidence … is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the underisability of admitting evidence that has been obtained...”. The burden falls to those who would have the ‘tainted’ evidence admitted. Sub section 138 (3) provides a list of matters to be considered important to the exercise of discretion. It is not an exclusive list.  65. S. 90 then is concerned simply with the fairness of admitting into evidence the admission in criminal proceedings, and the circumstances in which the claimed unfairness arose. It is not concerned with policy issues. S. 138 applies in all proceedings. It is confined to evidence obtained via improper or illegal conduct and considerations of policy impacting upon the admission of evidence obtained. While it is true that “unfairness” and illegal or improper conduct may see some overlapping of applications for the exclusion of evidence, there is no requirement upon a Court to look firstly to s 138 and subsequently to s 90. The final words of s. 90 “it would be unfair to the defendant to use the evidence” do not require the court to determine that issue through the prism of s 138(3).  66. The unfairness referred to in s.90 includes consideration of the accused’s right to a fair trial, and whether procedural fairness was extended to him in the circumstances in which the admission was made. An example of failure to extend procedural fairness to an accused may well arise if the accused freedom to chose to speak to investigators is impugned. That could occur wh ere an accused has been mislead by the investigators, or ridiculed or demeaned by them as he gives his account.  67. I have already indicated that I do not regard procedural fairness was extended to the accused during the course of this passage of the interview. I am satisfied the accused’s right to a fair trial would be impinged if this passage of the interview was tendered. The onus was upon the defence to so persuade me. It has satisfied the onus. The prosecution has not sought to argue for the evidence to be admitted for a limited purpose. In all the circumstances I propose to exclude the evidence complained of. Other than what I have said above about s138, I have not otherwise considered its application to this matter.   0o0o0o0

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: SL, RT and WS were all joint participants in an armed robbery of the White Horse Hotel on the Princes Highway at St Peters on 9 June 2006. 2 On 7 April 2008 each of the three offenders entered pleas of guilty to the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty provided for is 25 years imprisonment. Mr Ken Jankievski (the bar manager of the hotel) was named as the victim of the armed robbery. $2500 was specified in the indictment as the money taken from him. The dangerous weapon was a shotgun which satisfied the statutory definition by reason of it being a gun that was at one time capable of propelling a projectile by means of an explosive (see s 3 of the Crimes Act and s 4 of the Firearms Act 1996). It was not capable of firing a projectile at the time of the robbery. The ballistician was unable to say when it was last capable of firing a projectile. His evidence as to capability was sourced by reference to the date of manufacture of the gun in the USA. 
     
      
    3 The White Horse Hotel is located on the corner of Victoria Street and the Princes Highway at St Peters. Victoria Street extends over a distance of about 100 metres to the intersection with Church Street and is at right angles to the Princes Highway. The offenders were driven to the area by another offender, a young female. She remained with the car in Church Street while the male offenders made their way to the Hotel. They entered the hotel through the public entrance off Victoria Street into the public bar at approximately 11:55pm. They each had their faces obscured and were wearing latex gloves. I am satisfied that SL was carrying the shotgun, RT was carrying a knife and WS a meat cleaver. A fourth offender had a bag for the express purpose of carrying away the proceeds of the robbery.  
     
      
    4 The patrons and the manager of the hotel were subjected to physical violence, and threats of physical violence, by each of the three offenders in the process of being robbed of money and other items of personal property. The robbery extended over a period of about 10 minutes. The entire sequence was recorded on CCTV footage. It is clear that the patrons were put in fear of real and immediate physical harm given the level of aggression displayed by each of the offenders. Some patrons were pushed to the ground and held under threat by one or more of the offenders. One patron sustained an abrasion in the region of the eyebrow as he was flung to or fell to the ground.  
     
      
    Offences on the Form 1 
     
      
    5 Although the robbery of the patrons was not charged on indictment I have been asked by each of the three offenders to take 11 additional offences of robbery in company as itemised on the Form 1 into account in the sentencing exercise in accordance with s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These offences were committed against 11 individual patrons. The property taken from them comprised a total of $4205 in cash, four mobile phones, a watch, a cigarette lighter and a number of wallets. Consistent with authority, these offences do not have the effect of increasing the objective gravity of the offending for which the three offenders stand to be sentenced (R v Dowd [2005] NSWCCA 113). However, since they are each intimately and temporally connected with the principal offence, I am in a position in imposing sentence for the principal offence to sentence each of the offenders for the totality of their outstanding criminality (see R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292; 115 A Crim R 152 at [31]). I am also mindful that consistent with the guideline judgment in Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146, it is necessary that the sentence to be imposed reflects the need for each of the three offenders to be deterred from committing offences of this kind (or any similar kind) in the future and that this is called for independently of the fact that the offences on the Form 1 are intimately and temporally connected with the principal offence (see R v BB [2005] NSWCCA 215 at [24]).  
     
      
    6 After the robbery RT, WS and the fourth man ran out of the hotel in advance of SL. SL remained with the shotgun pointed at the bar manager in an effort to shepherd the escape of the others and, ultimately, himself. While he was still in the bar, the bar manager succeeded in wresting the shotgun from SL’s grip after which SL also ran from the hotel with the barman in pursuit. At this time the working parts of the shotgun, which were apparently taped together to give the appearance of it being in functioning order, broke into at least two parts. 
     
      
    7 Within a very short period of time a number of other patrons, who had by that time armed themselves with pool cues, also gave chase along Victoria Street and ultimately along Church Street. Some distance along Church Street the two groups of men – the offenders on the one hand and the bar manager and patrons on the other – were embroiled in a physical fight in the course of which one of the patrons was fatally stabbed. The offenders made their escape from the area in the vehicle driven by the young woman. The knife that killed the deceased was abandoned at the scene. Some of the property stolen from patrons, in particular a number of mobile phones, were located at the scene of the fight in Church Street. The balance of the property stolen was not recovered. The car was abandoned a short distance away.  
     
      
    8 On 10 June 2008 WS and RT were arrested. At that time they were aged respectively 17 and 16. By reason of their age they both qualified as “children” as provided for in s 3(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, and as such, and in accordance with s 11 of the Act they were each referred to by their initials for the purposes of trial and sentence. They have both been detained in a Juvenile Detention Centre since their arrest.  
     
      
    9 At the time of sentence WS and RT are respectively 19 and 18 years of age. Accordingly, they are to be sentenced by reference to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. However since the offence against s 97(2) is a “serious children’s indictable offence”, by operation of s 17 of the Act they are to be dealt with according to law.  
     
      
    10 On 6 July 2006, SL voluntarily presented himself to police. He was aged 20 at the time. He has been detained as a remand and serving prisoner in the adult prison since that time and is to be sentenced consistent with general sentencing principles. It was only to ensure the anonymity of his co-offenders that he was also referred to by his initials in the trial and in the sentence proceedings.  
     
      
    A brief history of the proceedings 
     
      
    11 On 10 March 2008, each of the three offenders along with two others were jointly indicted to stand trial on one count of murder and one count of armed robbery. Each pleaded not guilty to both counts. 12 On 7 April 2008, at the close of the Crown case, I heard argument as to whether I should direct the jury to acquit each of the five accused on the charge of murder on the basis that the evidence was incapable of satisfying the jury that the act causing death was a deliberate or voluntary act of any one of the accused. In light of the evidence of the pathologist, the Crown conceded that the evidence was deficient in that respect. I also heard argument as to whether I should direct the jury to acquit the fourth male - a person who was known as FT in the proceedings - of the charge of armed robbery on the basis that the evidence directly admissible against him was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty on that charge. The Crown did not seek to persuade me against that course. 13 Counsel for SL, RT and WS, together with counsel for the female offender, were then invited by me to confer with their respective clients as to their attitude to the remaining count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon since each of them had participated in records of interview on arrest and where each had admitted knowledge of and, to varying degrees, participation in the robbery. Upon being re-arraigned before me each of the three male offenders pleaded guilty to the remaining count on the indictment.  
     
      
    14 Accordingly, the following morning, 8 April 2008, I directed the jury to enter verdicts of not guilty on the murder charge for each of the five accused. I also directed the jury to enter a verdict of not guilty on the armed robbery charge in respect of FT. The sentence proceedings in respect of the three young men were then adjourned to 6 June 2008 to allow for preparation of a range of reports and to assemble other evidence bearing upon sentence.  
     
      
    15 The female offender reserved her position on the remaining count on the indictment until 8 April 2008 when the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in company in full discharge of the indictment against her. On 11 April 2008, I sentenced her to a non-parole period of 21 months commencing on 11 June 2006 and expiring on 10 March 2008 with a balance of term of 15 months expiring on 10 June 2009. In accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I directed that she be discharged from custody forthwith. 16 Although she was part of the same criminal enterprise to rob the White Horse Hotel, the female offender pleaded to a different and comparatively less serious offence than the offence to which each of the three young men pleaded guilty. In addition, she was sentenced on the basis that she did not enter the hotel at any time and was unaware until after the robbery that any of the three young men were armed. For this reason alone parity considerations do not arise in the sentence of these three offenders. 
     
      
    The pleas of guilty  
     
      
    17 There is also a marked difference in the weight to be given to the pleas of guilty in the case of these three offenders as compared to the case of the female offender. In her case I discounted the sentence by 10 per cent in recognition of the fact that although the plea was late it nevertheless had some utilitarian value since the Crown case against her on armed robbery was not overwhelming (a matter fairly conceded by the Crown). The same cannot be said in the case of these three offenders. I do not regard their pleas of guilty as having any utility at all in view of the time that the pleas were entered and in view of the fact that each of accused admitted their involvement in an armed robbery in recorded interviews with the police on their arrest. While I understand that defence counsel perceived a weakness in the Crown case in so far as the ballistic evidence was concerned, which at one time left in doubt whether the Crown could prove that the shotgun was a dangerous weapon as defined, and that this was the reason the plea was withheld, consistent with the views of Howie J in R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; 160 A Crim R 510 I am not satisfied that this has any relevance in determining the utilitarian value in the plea or moderating the fact that the plea was late. The Crown submits that in these circumstances the discount for the plea should be at the bottom of the range. I propose to allow a 5 per cent discount only. The facts upon which an assessment of the objective criminality of each of the offenders is made including their records of interview 18 For sentencing purposes I have had the advantage of the Crown having presented all the available evidence in proof of the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon in the course of the joint trial of each of the offenders.  
     
      
    19 In assessing the objective criminality, I place particular reliance on the CCTV footage, together with the evidence of the bar manager and the patrons as evidencing the circumstances in which the robbery was committed and the events thereafter. In addition, each of the offenders participated in an electronically recorded interview upon their arrest which were tendered at trial. SL and WS both made full, frank and detailed admissions of their involvement in the armed robbery and their movements before and after the robbery. RT gave a very short interview wherein he simply admitted that he was involved in the robbery after which he exercised his right to refuse to answer any further questions. I note that none of the offenders admitted to either stabbing the deceased or having witnessed a stabbing by either one of their co-offenders, or at the hand of any other person. I will refer to the content of the records of interview when I come to consider the individual cases of each of the three offenders. 
     
      
    The significance of the guideline judgment 
     
      
    20 The features of the offence for which each of the offenders is to be sentenced are not dissimilar from the typical case identified as the subject of the guideline judgment of this court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 380. This is so despite the fact that the offence with which Henry was concerned was robbery with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, which provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, whereas the offence with which I am concerned is aggravated by reason of the weapon being a dangerous weapon and, as I have noted, provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.  
     
      
    21 In Henry the Court identified a category of robbery under s 97 of the Crimes Act which was sufficiently common for the purposes of determining a guideline. The typical robbery case identified by the Court contained the following seven elements: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Young offender with little or no criminal history. 
         
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
         
        (iii) Limited degree of planning. 
         
        (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
         
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position, such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
         
        (vi) Small amount taken. 
         
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
        
       
      
    22 The Court also emphasised that it did not propose to fix a starting point for a sentence in a case which contained these elements, rather, it proposed ""a narrow sentencing range"" of between a full-time term of four and five years within which the court would expect sentences in such cases to fall. The Court recognized that the seven characteristics do not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise, and that some factors have an inherent variability depending upon the facts in any given case. It is also clear that the sentencing range of between four to five years is only a starting point, since aggravating and mitigating factors may justify a sentence falling below or above the range. Other factors, such as the age of the offender, the extent of the offender’s criminal record, positive steps taken towards rehabilitation, and any abuse of conditional liberty in the past, will also have an effect on the sentence. To varying degrees, each of these factors has a bearing on the individual sentences that are to be imposed in this case. 
     
      
    23 The Court in Henry also identified a number of circumstances which are particular to the offence of armed robbery, including: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The nature of the weapon. 
         
        (ii) The vulnerability of the victim. 
         
        (iii) The position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning. 
         
        (iv) The intensity of threat, or actual use, of force. 
         
        (v) The amount taken. 
         
        (vi) The effect on the victims. 
        
       
      
    24 For sentencing purposes appropriate weight has to be given to the fact that the shotgun, a weapon that otherwise met the statutory definition of a dangerous weapon, was defective in a range of respects rendering it incapable of firing a projectile. On any view, it was substantially less dangerous than the weapon contemplated in Henry, namely a “weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury”. While the shotgun undoubtedly inspired fear in those patrons who had it pointed at them, and despite the fact that SL handled the gun in an overtly aggressive manner such as to give the pretence that he was preparing to fire it if necessary, the shotgun was not in fact dangerous given its condition at that time. In this respect, at least, the objective seriousness of the offence for which the offenders are to be sentenced is appreciably less serious than one contemplated by reference to the guideline judgment. That is not to suggest that because the gun was defective the primary offence was trivial. It was a serious breach of the law on any view.  
     
      
    25 Another feature that distinguishes the conduct of each of the three offenders from offending of a more serious kind is the fact that none of the hotel patrons were seriously harmed. The fact that the offenders each claim to have had no intention of harming anyone, and that the weapons were only ever intended to subdue the patrons so as to more easily rob them and the hotel, is not however to the point. There remained a real risk of serious injury to the patrons in the course of the robbery from the knife and meat cleaver alone. Although WS and RT are not charged with being individually armed (whether on indictment or on the Form 1) and will not be sentenced as such, I propose to take into account the fact that they were armed with a knife and meat cleaver as part of the context and circumstances in which they committed the offence charged and the offences I am asked to take into account on the Form 1. It cannot be overlooked that it was the knife used in the robbery that ultimately caused the death of the deceased. Having said that I note the Crown’s concession that this is a matter that cannot be taken into account on sentence in proper recognition of the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
    26 I am satisfied that the nature of the weapons used and the force that was both threatened and applied in combination, serve to position the level of criminality above mid range. In addition, there is no view of the facts that would justify a finding that the offence was committed on impulse. To the contrary, I am satisfied that the robbery was clearly well planned with careful thought given to how it might be successfully executed. I am satisfied that there was some degree of pre-planning on the part of each of the three offenders in the sense that they prepared themselves with weapons and disguises (even if makeshift on the part of WS) before leaving in the car to make their way to the hotel, and that they assumed, or were assigned, the roles they were to each perform. While it would appear that at least SL knew the hotel which it was intended they rob, and that he must have had some degree of familiarity with the surrounding streets in order to plan for their escape, it appears that the offenders only settled on the plan on the night of the robbery. 27 Despite the fact that I regard the objective facts as reflecting offending of considerable seriousness, I propose to adopt the guideline judgment as a starting point, making necessary adjustments to reflect the circumstances of the individual offenders. Consistent with R v SDM [2001] NSWCCA 158; 51 NSWLR 530 the guideline is applicable even in the case of WS and RT who were children at the time of the robbery. The extent to which their age attracts any particular leniency in the calculation of sentence is a matter to which specific reference will be made when I come to consider their cases individually. 28 Despite the fact that the three offenders performed different roles in the course of the robbery, and despite the fact that SL on his own admission assumed the role of leader and carried the shotgun, I do not consider that it is appropriate to differentiate between the roles they each played in what was on any view a joint criminal enterprise. As a matter of principle, since each were involved together, they should each bear equal responsibility for the commission of the offence since the objective criminality involved in the offending is the same: see R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at [18]-[19]; R v McIlwraith [2005] NSWCCA 137 at [17] and R v Dukino; R v Moshref [2003] NSWCCA 379 at [27]-[28]. In this case, it is plain from the CCTV footage that the three offenders acted as members of a coordinated group and that they not only wielded their own weapons but were aware that the shotgun would be used, and that it was in fact used by SL, in a threatening manner. 29 I turn now to consider the case of each of the three offenders individually.The sentence of SL30 The following evidence was tendered by the Crown on sentence:

    32 SL voluntarily presented himself to police on 6 July 2006. That is to his credit as is the fact that he gave a detailed and forthright account to police demonstrating a preparedness to accept responsibility for the robbery.33 SL stated the following in his record of interview:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is there anything you can tell us about the armed robbery at the White Horse Hotel on Friday the 9th of June, 2006? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What can you tell us about that? 
         
        A. …we ran in to the hotel,  
        I was the leader 
        , I was holding the shotgun and … I told everyone to get down while one of the boys went to get the money and … I was telling people to [sic] their wallets and shit and then I was left in the hotel, I think the boys ran out in front of me… and then … I ran out and I think the owner of the pub took the gun off me and then … I ran around the corner ... “(emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    34 SL also made admissions regarding the extent of planning and organisation undertaken before the commission of the offence. He said that before going to the hotel he was drinking alcohol with other friends including RT and WS, at an apartment in Punchbowl. He said that it was then that he decided to recruit the other male offenders for the purposes of the robbery: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When did you decide on that night that you were going to do a robbery at the White Horse Hotel? 
         
        A. Um, just that night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just that night. And whose idea was it? 
         
        A. Mine. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. O.K. Did you just happen to be with the boys there at the time when you decided and they decided to join you or did you go and find those particular boys to do the job with you? 
         
        A. Um, I went and found them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah. So did you have it in your head how many blokes that you wanted to do the job with? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    35 Later that night he recruited the female offender to whom I have already referred as the driver of the getaway car. He stated in his record of interview that he approached her during the course of the night whilst she was visiting a friend who lived in the same apartment block where he and the other male offenders were drinking. He said that he went to her friend’s unit with the shotgun concealed in a white bag and asked her whether she would borrow and drive her friend’s car as the getaway car. He said that she agreed and that the two of them then went downstairs to the carpark where the other male offenders were waiting inside the car.  
     
      
    36 This account differs from the facts upon which it was agreed I should proceed to sentence the female offender. I accepted in her case that she only became complicit in the joint criminal enterprise once inside the car and en route to the hotel when she overheard the other male offenders talking. I also accepted in her case, consistent with her plea to a charge of robbery in company, that she was not aware of the fact that the offenders were armed until after the robbery. Based upon the admissions that SL made in his record of interview, I propose to sentence him on the basis that he recruited the female offender as the driver of the getaway car at a much earlier stage of the night than what I accepted was established by the facts in her sentence proceedings. That said, there is nothing to suggest that this involved him applying any pressure or coercion of any kind. Each of the other offenders were willing, indeed it would seem eager, participants. Although SL assumed a leadership role, in fact that consisted of him simply advising the other male offenders of what their respective roles would be and, on his own admission, providing each of them with their weapons. In his record of interview he described his role in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I just told the boys the positions… I just told Frank to get their money from the till and the safe…and… the rest were crowd control”. 
         
         
        
       
      
    He said that he gave RT and WS knives and that he gave the fourth offender, who he described as the “money man”, a white bag to collect the money. (I note that this is in conflict with WS who says he assumed responsibility for obtaining the knife and meat cleaver. This is not, of course, evidence admissible in the sentence proceedings of SL.) When arriving at the hotel he told the female offender where to park the car and that she was to wait for them to return. Although on one view SL’s conduct as initiator and notional leader is more egregious than the others since I am satisfied that there should be no differentiation in the roles they actually played in the robbery as executed, I do not propose to impose a heavier sentence upon him for that reason. The material difference in sentencing terms between his sentence and that of WS and RT is as a result of the different subjective case he advances, the fact that his criminal record is a matter of aggravation and the fact that he was older, although in my view for reasons which will become obvious, still relatively immature. SL’s criminal record 37 Although SL’s criminal record is not of inordinate length, it nevertheless reveals repeated breaches of the law and an apparent disregard of the leniency that has been extended to him in the past.  
     
      
    38 His record commences with an offence of robbery in company when he was 16 years of age for which he received a two year supervised good behaviour bond pursuant to s 33(1)(e) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. Departmental records indicate that his response to supervision was unsatisfactory due to a failure to maintain contact with the supervising service and to follow directions in regard to his drug use. On 28 January 2005, he was prosecuted for a breach of the good behaviour bond but was subsequently released subject to an unsupervised 10-month good behaviour bond. Thereafter it would appear he was convicted in his absence of various offences involving damage to property and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. He was released under a further 12-month good behaviour bond however, when he failed to comply with directions, action was taken for breach. On 31 January 2006, he failed to appear at court in relation to the breach and a warrant for his arrest issued. That warrant was not executed until his arrest in respect of this matter in July 2006. On 24 July 2006, three weeks after he was detained in custody, he was sentenced to a 6-month fixed jail term effective from that date. That term expired on 6 January 2007. Accordingly, SL has been in custody in respect of the current matter only from 6 January 2007 – a period of 17 months and 22 days. Accordingly, the sentence for this offence will commence from that date. Although it is not clear from the materials, it would appear that the fixed term was imposed because SL was otherwise in custody with no prospect in the short term of being released on parole. The Crown conceded that this is a matter which I am entitled to have regard to in considering whether special circumstances should be found and the extent to which the statutory ratio is disturbed.39 Due weight must also be given to the fact that SL committed this offence while subject to a good behaviour bond. Despite the fact that it appears, from the sentences imposed, that the previous offending was not in the same category of seriousness as that for which he is to be sentenced, the fact that he has repeatedly breached good behaviour bonds is nevertheless a circumstance of aggravation (see R v Doridis, NSWCCA, 18 December 1986, unreported and R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109).Subjective circumstances40 The pre-sentence report and a report prepared by Ms Duffy, psychologist, reflect the fact that SL’s criminal offending is a direct result of his involvement in a criminal subculture, which is in turn directly related to a breakdown in his family relationships both before and after his father’s death in 2000 when SL was 14 years of age. SL is the eldest of six children. It would appear from the material tendered on sentence, and the evidence of SL’s mother, that SL’s father was an alcoholic who imposed a strict corporal regime within the family. Mrs L corroborated her son’s account of having been beaten regularly by his father for the slightest of transgressions. She was also the victim of violence at her husband’s hand. On at least one occasion SL was beaten so badly he was hospitalised. He gave evidence that while he remembers being in hospital he has no memory of what he did to merit the punishment from his father. In Ms Duffy’s assessment, the relationship with his father was both traumatic and complex. Although SL is close to his mother, after his father’s death he rejected her efforts to control him and the efforts of other members of his extended family. It would seem that dating from this time he would stay away from the family home for weeks at a time in rebellion against the regime he was subjected to whilst his father was alive and in defiance of his mother’s wishes after his father’s death. I have read and taken into account the testimonial of Meleseini Sulaki, SL’s cousin, who is also the eldest child in her family. She reports that she has been witness to SL’s self-destructive behaviour and expresses her sadness at the damage he has done to himself, his family and the wider community as a result.  
     
      
    41 Having regard to her evidence, the pre-sentence report and the report from Ms Duffy I am satisfied that it was at a time when SL was very young and vulnerable to loss, trauma and an absence of an adult male mentor that he commenced using drugs and alcohol and mixing in a peer group where violence was an accepted social code and where defiance of the law was commonplace. There is a forged link between that state of affairs and his conduct in committing the armed robbery. In Ms Duffy’s assessment his underlying personality is also to be explained as a result of his traumatic and disrupted family life. She reports that his self-perception is stymied by feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy and fear. As a consequence he has learnt to expect criticism, which in turn results in resentment and outward displays of anger and conduct in defiance of social rules and constraints. On the other hand, Ms Duffy considers that he has intellectual capacities to benefit from counselling directed to deal with what she regards as the residual effect of post-traumatic symptoms in relation to the brutality he suffered at his father’s hand. 42 The trauma in his life as a young teenager was also, not surprisingly, commensurate with a crucial break in his education. After his father’s death SL was sent to Tonga to stay with his relatives to give his mother some respite. Upon his return he found it difficult to readjust to family life and to resume his schooling. It would appear that he was suspended from school soon thereafter for fighting and for his membership in a gang. He has not resumed his education in the community since that time. Although he claims to have held several labouring positions for short periods, it is also clear that this was interspersed with lengthy periods of unemployment. He was, at the time of his arrest, supplementing his Newstart Allowance with casual work with his brother mowing lawns and lopping trees. Use of drugs and alcohol43 SL reports that he was on a “24 hour binge on ice and alcohol” the day before the robbery. It was in that state he led others into committing the offence for which he and they stand to be sentenced. He reports that the decision to rob the hotel was a consequence of coming down from the effects of ice which he tried to ameliorate by consuming a bottle of whisky over a four hour period. He admits that the robbery was in order to obtain money for more drugs and/or alcohol. 44 His efforts in the past to obtain treatment for his drug problem have been short-lived and not productive of abstinence for any extended period. By contrast, whilst in custody, he has been proactive in seeking treatment. On his own initiative he was placed on a methadone program in May 2007 when he used heroin as a means of coping with what he then feared would, or might well be, en extended period in custody since he was facing a murder charge. He remained subject to that program until May 2008, when he voluntarily removed himself with a determination to be drug-free, without a synthetic substitute, in preparation for his release. This was with the encouragement of Ms Danylanko, the Drug and Alcohol officer. I also note in her report that SL has expressed a desire to participate in a live-in rehabilitation program upon his release from custody and with his voluntary withdrawal from the methadone program, and with a demonstrated ability to remain drug-free in the meantime, he may well be eligible for acceptance within a therapeutic unit in the community in the future. Ms Duffy advises that a treatment plan for SL should entail comprehensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation both within the prison system and upon release. She recommends the intensive program at Ngara Nura at Long Bay jail prior to release. She also recommends that he undertake drug and alcohol relapse prevention programs and other counselling whilst in custody. I commend her views to the Probation and Parole Service and endorse them.45 I also note Ms Danylanko’s concern that a proven commitment to remaining abstinent from drugs can only be successfully monitored if SL subjects himself to the discipline and authority of those who administer the live-in programs and provide counselling in the custodial environment. In his evidence before me SL acknowledged and accepted not only that he would be obliged to submit to the intervention and the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service upon his releases to parole, but, in particular, to be compliant with strategies designed to ensure against any relapse into drug and alcohol use or antisocial behaviour. To the extent that he remains resistant to the authority placed upon him within the prison system he has only a guarded prospect of being able to successfully participate in a program within the community. It is in that connection that I note that since entering custody he has incurred 11 documented breaches of discipline and that he has been described in the management file as being disruptive and showing little respect for staff. On the other hand, I also note that he has received little disciplinary action due to his willingness to apologise for his actions.  46 In spite of some misgivings, I accept that it would appear that SL has a growing insight into the causal connection between drug and alcohol abuse, an itinerant and unfocused lifestyle and the criminal offending that has resulted in him being sentenced as an adult for very serious offending. It would also appear that he has progressively taken the opportunity over the last two years to reflect upon his actions and to formulate new goals to the point where I have some confidence that he can make a new start upon his release. Until his arrest he was resistant to seeing his drug and alcohol use as anything other than a dimension to the hedonistic lifestyle he was apparently enjoying with reckless abandon. Although his prospects for rehabilitation must be somewhat guarded, I am prepared to accept that he is genuinely committed to maintaining his resolve to conduct himself appropriately for the duration of his sentence in preparation for his release into the wider community. I acknowledge the courage that it took for SL to give evidence before me since I understand from other evidence that he is hesitant in speaking openly about matters of an emotional nature. However having heard from him and making my own assessment of his commitment to change, I regard his prognosis as positive and, that to a very real extent and despite the fact that he was 20 at the time of the offence, he is at the crossroads between a life of continued criminality and a life within the law (see R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 per Wood CJ at CL at [9]). 47 I encourage SL to maintain the drug and alcohol counselling that he is offered within the prison system with the view to maximising his prospects for continued abstinence whilst at his liberty in the community. I also encourage him to continue to see the importance of his family and community of the church as a source of support for the adjustments he will have to make upon his release. 48 I am also satisfied, having regard to the fact that the period on remand was lengthy, and that he served a fixed term for breach of the bond as a result, together with the necessity that he have an extended period subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, that special circumstances exist justifying a departure from the statutory ratio that would otherwise obtain pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

    Involvement in the offence 
     
      
    51 This offender also participated in a lengthy record of interview with police on his arrest on 10 June 2006 in which he admitted his role in the robbery. 
     
      
    52 In the interview, and in the course of the more recent interviews with the officer from the Department of Juvenile Justice and Doctor Lennings, WS has repeatedly provided what I am satisfied is a full and frank account of his involvement in the robbery. He has neither sought to avoid responsibility for his behaviour nor minimised the effect that this has had on others, even if he lacked the insight on the night to appreciate the consequences of his actions.  
     
      
    53 It would appear that on the day of the offence, a Friday, he went to school then sought his aunt’s permission to visit friends to watch a football match on the television that evening. In truth he met up with his co-offenders at SL’s brother’s residence at Punchbowl with the intention of consuming alcohol but without any specific plan as to how the night would unfold. It was during the course of the evening, although at a time when he was only slightly affected by alcohol, that he agreed to participate in the proposed robbery. He admitted to being motivated by money and “so I could look good in front of my mates and get a big name”. 54 He told the departmental officer that he obtained the knife (that was later used by his co-offender RT) and the meat cleaver and put them in the car before leaving the flat at Punchbowl. He said that he knew where they were and that no one told him to take them. He said he put them in the car with the intention they would be used in the course of the robbery. He confirmed this account under cross-examination from the Crown prosecutor on sentence. He also frankly admitted under cross-examination that he was aware that there was a shotgun that was to be used in the robbery although he didn’t know whether or not the gun was in working condition.Subjective circumstances55 WS is the eldest of three children. His parents migrated to Australia independently of each other over 20 years ago and have since made their home in this country. He has a brother who is currently aged 15 and a sister who is aged 14, each of whom reside with his parents.56 It would appear from the information provided in the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice, and a report from Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist, together with testimonials from both the pastor of the Seventh Day Adventist Church at Strathfield and various church elders, that he was brought up in a loving and committed family who regularly participate in the fellowship of the church. WS’s family also enjoy the close support of a large network of maternal extended family members who live close to the family home and who share reciprocal visits on a regular basis. It is also apparent that he is a much-favoured grandson of his maternal grandparents.57 According to his parents, up until 12 months prior to the commission of the offence, WS was responsive to parental boundaries and fulfilled their expectations that he commit himself to his schooling with a view to completing years 11 and 12 at the Strathfield Adventist College. In that same time frame however he reported an increasing inability to cope with the workload expected of him from the school authorities and an increasing inability to cope with parental pressure to continue with his studies. He sought his parents’ permission to leave school and take up an apprenticeship as a carpenter, which they refused. I am satisfied that there is a causal connection between his poor performance academically in the twelve months prior to the offence and his developing abuse of alcohol, which was in turn causally connected with truancy and his association with a new peer group including his co-offenders.58 A month prior to the offending, WS was given permission to leave Strathfield Adventist College and look for work, however this permission was then countermanded, and he was sent to the Mountain View Adventist College at Doonside. In order to ease the burden of travel he took up residence with a maternal aunt at Berala. It was whilst he was a student at the Mountain View Adventist College in Year 12, and a guest in his aunt’s home, that he committed the offence for which he stands to be sentenced. I have been provided with a report from the College although it was of little assistance given that he was an enrolled student for only a short period of time before he committed the robbery.  
     
      
    59 Within a month of being in custody WS enrolled at Girrakool Education and Training Unit. Since being in custody he has been actively involved in a variety of school programs, including a General Education course to improve his literacy and numeracy skills and a Furnishings Preliminary Higher School Certificate course. The various units comprising that course are oriented toward the trade qualification he wishes to pursue upon his release. It is clear from the materials tendered on sentence, and WS’s evidence, that whilst he is a competent student in general academe, his preference is to refine his skills as a carpenter by taking up as course of study at a TAFE College with a view to obtaining work in the building trade.60 As I have noted, WS has been in detention at the Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre since his arrest. It would appear that whilst he experienced initial problems adjusting to custody, since then he has consistently displayed a positive attitude towards his custodial situation and to those who have responsibility for him as custodians. He is said to respond well to instructions and directions and to mix well with other detainees. He actively participates in the centre’s recreational sports and music programs and has consistently performed well in that regard.61 Ms Hass, the acting Unit Coordinator at the Detention Centre, described WS as a quiet young man who is a model student and detainee. She does note however that “it’s like he’s here but not here”. Doctor Lennings performed both a psychological assessment and psychometric assessment with a view to providing some insights into why a young man with no previous criminal record would become involved in offending of this kind, and to predict the likelihood of the re-presentation of delinquent behaviour or other social maladjustment upon his return to the community. Doctor Lennings reported that despite the fact that WS is a somewhat inarticulate person with poor communication skills, he has a gathering insight into the triggers to his offending. It would also appear that whilst in custody WS has been proactive in leading other detainees of Pacific Islander origin by example in his active participation in the centre’s recreational and music programs. I am urged to take this into account in his favour as demonstrating self-awareness in the importance of maintaining sound social conduct and behaviour while in detention as a reflection of his determination to conduct himself appropriately in the wider community.  
     
      
    62 I am satisfied that at the time of the robbery, and it would appear in preparation for it, he had not given any thought to the potential consequences of his actions and it is only in hindsight that he appreciates the potentially serious consequences of participating in a robbery with a dangerous weapon while in the company of others who were also armed. In his evidence before me he has demonstrated an appreciation of the shock and fear that the patrons of the hotel must have suffered, when he ran into the bar armed with a meat cleaver in the company of his co-offenders who were also armed. He also reported empathy for the pain and suffering that was occasioned to the deceased’s widow and their children. I accept this as a genuine expression of remorse.  
     
      
    63 Whilst I am prepared to find that WS has also gained a renewed respect and regard for his family, the question is whether he will be able to maintain that line of focus without being deflected by the temptation to drink to excess or to otherwise misconduct himself when at his liberty. It is as much to WS’s credit as it is to his family’s credit that their relationship has survived two years of his being incarcerated. I note that WS has two younger siblings who he tells me he is concerned to mentor in such a way as to ensure that they do not become involved with the wrong peer group or fall prey to peer group pressures in the way that he did.  64 He has not only the support of his family, including their willingness to have him resume his place in the family home, but he also has the support of his church. I have testimonials from Pastor Bavari of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and Mr Lenati, a senior church elder of that church. Both express unqualified surprise that WS offended in the way he has. He was remembered by Mr Lenati as: 
     
      
       
        
        “a quiet attentive lad who was cooperative and polite. He was an active participant in our Pathfinder and youth programs and very much involved in prayer meetings, bible studies, sport and social activities which contributed towards his virtual social and physical wellbeing.”  
        
       
      
    65 Mr Lenati considers that WS has repented his part in the robbery and has a great deal to offer the church community and society at large upon his release. Mr Lenati is also willing to personally assist in his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    66 Pastor Bavari was particularly shocked and disappointed at WS’s conduct since he set up various meetings with WS in an effort to try to divert him from the misconduct which was beginning to manifest itself in the 12 months prior to his arrest. It would appear that he visited WS during his lunch hour at the College at Doonside and also endeavoured to facilitate a meeting with WS and his parents with a view to discussing matters that were obviously at issue within the family. He says: 
     
      
       
        
         “…two weeks later he was in prison: a life of youth and innocence lost forever. As a father of a teenage boy I saw firsthand the spell-like influence his peers had on him. It still haunts my ministry and I’m humbled by the experience.” 
        
       
      
    67 Again the question presents as to whether WS is capable of re-establishing the links to the church to assist him to observe the law and as an expression of respect for those who have supported him. 
     
      
    68 I accept that the trajectory of antisocial behaviour that he was committed to for the 12 months prior to the offence appears to have been uncharacteristic of his behaviour or personality overall. It is perfectly clear that his disregard of the expectations of his family and their support for him has been triggered by alcohol use and antisocial peer associates. In his evidence before me WS acknowledged that alcohol was one of the primary triggers for his failure to apply himself to his studies which in turn led to him mixing with young men, most of whom were older than he. He identified the need for money as another trigger to his becoming involved in the robbery. While he accepts the reality that he will be living with his family until he is completes his trade course and finds work in the building industry, and that for a time at least he will be financially dependent on them, I accept that he is committed to becoming self-reliant and that in the meantime he will make a positive contribution to family life.  
     
      
    69 I am encouraged by the fact that WS also went into the witness box to enable me to gain an appreciation of his change in attitude.  
     
      
    70 In combination, I am of the view that WS’s subjective circumstances should be given weight in the fixing of sentence. In particular, I take into account the fact that this offence is his first encounter with the criminal law, that he has been detained for two years on remand and, as a consequence, he has irretrievably lost two years of his adolescence and the freedom and privileges that that entails. I am satisfied that there is every indication that it has served as a salutary lesson he will reflect upon for the rest of his life. I consider that he has gained valuable insights from what he has been exposed to as a result of his offending and has grown in maturity as a result.  
     
      
    Significance of his age 
     
      
    71 While I acknowledge that WS turned 17 less than a month prior to committing the offence, given the objective seriousness of his offending, inclusive of his willing and active participation in the robbery, the degree of leniency that might otherwise be extended to him as a result of his youth is diminished.  
     
      
    72 In R v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12; 111 A Crim R 306 Sully J at [20] said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…[the] deliberate participation in an armed robbery is, in the sense discussed by the relevant authorities, an adult crime even when committed by comparatively young people. In my opinion, it is timely to make plain, yet again, that youth – whether it is real, or merely comparative, or defined with a generous elasticity – is not a cloak of convenience behind which, relevantly, those who deliberately engage in armed robbery can shelter from the just consequences of their conduct.”  
        
       
      
    73 In R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; 54 NSWLR 300 Spigelman CJ observed at [74] that there are exceptions to the general principle with respect to armed robberies committed by youthful offenders: 
     
      
       
        
        “Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender.” 
        
       
      
    74 Having said that, I do take into account the importance of rehabilitation in the sentencing of young offenders both for the individual offender and for the protection of the community. In WS’s case I consider that he has demonstrated a commitment and willingness to continue along that path. 75 It is vital, of course, that the weight of subjective matters not overwhelm the sentencing discretion thereby diminishing the importance of general deterrence (and to a lesser extent in this case) specific deterrence, or inhibit the role that the passing of sentence plays in reflecting the communities justifiable abhorrence for offending of this kind.  
     
      
    Application of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
     
      
    76 The offence for which WS stands to be sentenced is a serious children’s indictable offence as defined by s 3(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. As a result, pursuant to s 17, it is necessary for him to be dealt with “according to law”. In this way the broad sentencing options otherwise available in Part 3 of the Act are not available in this sentencing exercise. That does not however exclude the application of principles stated in s 6 of the Act. They are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
         
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
         
          
          (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
           
          (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
           
          (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
           
          (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
           
          (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    77 As Giles J noted in R v SDM at 538, these principles are to be applied in light of all relevant circumstances including, in this case, the seriousness of the crime for which WS is to be sentenced. There is no suggestion that the imposition of a full time custodial sentence can be avoided in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    78 As I have noted, WS is currently 19 years of age. Since he is to be sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence, he is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile unless I am satisfied there are special circumstances justifying his detention as a juvenile offender as provided for in s 19(5). In determining whether there are special circumstances, I am entitled to have regard to the availability of services or programs at the place that he will be detained and any other matter I regard as appropriate. I am satisfied that in order to maintain the continuity of his custody and his continued participation in counselling services available within the juvenile detention centre, it is appropriate that the balance of the non-parole period be served in a juvenile detention centre. 
     
      
    79 I am also satisfied having regard to the fact that the period on remand was lengthy, that this offence is the first occasion in which WS has been sentenced for any criminal conduct and the necessity that he have an extended period subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, that special circumstances exist justifying a departure from the statutory ratio that would otherwise obtain pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    80 I am informed by the officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice that the Probation and Parole Service can provide WS with group work counselling as well as being in a position to perform random urinalysis, a function which the Department of Juvenile Justice is not mandated to perform. Performing random urinalysis will serve to facilitate intervention, if necessary, to decrease any risk of WS re-offending. I note that in the view of the Department of Juvenile Justice, that supervision by the Probation and Parole Service will focus on the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Community-based supervision and monitoring; 
         
        2. Referral to community-based counseling to assist WS to resolve the residual alcohol-related issues; 
         
        3. Referral to employment agencies, as well as Job Network agencies, to assist WS to gain secure employment on his release and to be there to assist him with his community reintegration; and 
         
        4. Referral to a TAFE course in order to facilitate WS’s access to the labour market.

    RT’s involvement 
     
      
    83 RT was interviewed on his arrest on the day after the robbery. Having remained silent for the major part of what was a very brief interview the offender when asked what he did last night offered the following admission: “I was just, oh, no, I was at White Horse, I was there, I did do the armed rob, and that’s it”. 84 On the night of the offence, RT says that he was in a divided mind as to whether to spend the night in the company of one of his best friends at a Church event or to join with his brother and other friends. He was at that time subject to a 9 pm curfew. He was concerned that if he spent the night with his friend he would be likely to break the curfew and so instead decided to go to his sister’s flat at Punchbowl with his brother with a view to being home at the appointed hour. He there met SL and WS. Unfortunately the amount of alcohol the others were consuming, and the amount he ultimately consumed, meant that he was destined to break the curfew in any event. He said that he drank beer and undiluted bourbon which he was endeavouring to conceal from his older brother by drinking large quantities in a short period of time out of his brother’s view. He said for this reason he was feeling the effects of alcohol and that it was in that state of mind that he joined with the others, initially to discuss the idea of robbing the hotel. He says that his brother was adamant that he not get involved although another of his co-offenders was of a different view. An argument between RT’s brother and the co-offender resulted in his brother reluctantly agreeing that he could join in. By this time RT reports that he felt “pumped and ready to go”. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “…when they chose me I had no say in anything…I was just lucky to come”.  
         
        
       
      
    He said the role that he was to perform in the robbery was assigned to him.85 RT reported being scared and nervous prior to entering the hotel and he was concentrating on trying to keep his emotions in control. He said that “when we got out of the car everything happened fast” and that following the robbery and after they returned to the car “we were all panicking”. RT reports that while he had the knife when he left the car and entered the hotel he had no intention of using it and certainly didn’t intend hurting anybody. He said the knife was in his custody just to “scare people”.Significance of his age 
     
      
    86 While I acknowledge that RT turned 16 within months of committing the offence, given the objective seriousness of his offending, inclusive of his willing and active participation in the robbery, the degree of leniency that might otherwise be extended to him as a result of his youth is diminished.  
     
      
    87 In R v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12; 111 A Crim R 306 Sully J at [20] said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…[the] deliberate participation in an armed robbery is, in the sense discussed by the relevant authorities, an adult crime even when committed by comparatively young people. In my opinion, it is timely to make plain, yet again, that youth – whether it is real, or merely comparative, or defined with a generous elasticity – is not a cloak of convenience behind which, relevantly, those who deliberately engage in armed robbery can shelter from the just consequences of their conduct.”  
        
       
      
    88 In R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; 54 NSWLR 300 Spigelman CJ observed at [74] that there are exceptions to the general principle with respect to armed robberies committed by youthful offenders: 
     
      
       
        
        “Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender.” 
        
       
      
    89 Having said that, I do take into account the importance of rehabilitation in the sentencing of young offenders both for the individual offender and for the protection of the community. As with WS, in RT’s case I consider that he has also demonstrated a commitment and willingness to continue along that path. 90 It is vital, of course, that the weight of subjective matters not overwhelm the sentencing discretion thereby diminishing the importance of general (and to a lesser extent in this case) specific deterrence, or inhibit the role that the passing of sentence plays in reflecting the communities justifiable abhorrence for offending of this kind. Subjective circumstances91 RT was born in New Zealand on 22 April 1990 and is currently 18 years of age. He is the fourth of six children. Although he was born in New Zealand his family is of Tongan origin. His family moved to Australia when he was four years of age. RT was living with his family at the time of his arrest including his older brother, the fourth person originally indicted for murder and armed robbery. 92 It would appear that after RT’s father died in 2003 parental control over the family was markedly lessened and, over time, both RT and his older brother became involved with a peer group that were either involved in criminal activities or at the very least antisocial activities. RT was aged 12 when his father died. It would appear RT was very much influenced by his older brother and was included as a junior member of the group at his invitation. RT was even at that time a tall and well-built young person who looked older that his actual age.  
     
      
    93 He played representative football for the Canterbury Bulldogs Football Club from age 14 and was regarded as a player with considerable potential. In this connection I have been provided with affidavit evidence from Mr Larry Hunter and Mr Chris Haddad. Mr Hunter is the President of the Padstow Panthers Rugby League Football Club where his son is a coach. I am given to understand that the Padstow Panthers are part of the Canterbury Bankstown District Junior Rugby League Inc. Mr Haddad is a manager/agent for football players.94 In Mr Hunter’s assessment, RT was a particularly talented footballer and had a very bright future in the game reflected by the awards he had won at representative level. Prior to RT’s father’s death, Mr Hunter described RT as a “very respectful kid who was well-mannered and would willingly help out around the club especially with the youngest players”. He was observed to be a focused and fair player and never a bully. When Mr Hunter observed the change in RT’s behaviour after his father’s death he endeavoured to address his concern with RT’s mother but it would seem she had little influence over him. Mr Hunter was nevertheless shocked when RT was arrested and regarded the behaviour reflected in the charge to which he has pleaded guilty as totally out of character.  
     
      
    95 Mr Hunter is encouraged by the fact that RT has been working hard at his schoolwork while in custody and that he has endeavoured to maintain an optimum level of fitness despite the injury to his knee and the slow process of rehabilitation while in detention. He is prepared to take an active role and interest in RT upon his release from custody. This is encouraging, particularly given that, on one view, the absence of a responsible male mentor would seem to explain his capitulation in criminal conduct as a young teenager.  
     
      
    96 Despite the break in his playing career, in Mr Haddad’s view RT continues to have a bright future in rugby league. Of his own volition he has spoken to football clubs about the prospect of RT joining and playing for them when he is released from custody and has received positive response in that regard. Mr Haddad also confirms that there are a number of clubs that are interested in having RT play for them when he is released. This is conditional upon RT’s ability to stay out of trouble and to commit himself to the training and discipline demanded of a professional player. Mr Haddad also expresses the view that the behaviour for which RT is to be sentenced is entirely out of character.  
     
      
    97 Two months prior to his arrest his football career was interrupted as a result of the knee injury to which I have referred. This, together with the negative influence of his older brother, appears to have been a precipitating event in him becoming involved in the robbery. It was also whilst associating with an older group of boys that he was charged with his first criminal offence, namely possession of a prohibited drug. He was dealt with in the Children’s Court and was placed on a good behaviour bond which was current at the time he committed the robbery. This is a matter in aggravation of sentence. I note that he has not been prosecuted for breach of the bond for what might be thought to be understandable reasons given the serious charges that resulted in him being bail refused since June 2006. 98 It would also appear that RT’s first use of alcohol was in the company of his older brother and his friends although he does not appear to drink to excess. He claims to know when to stop having passed out once from drinking too much alcohol and does not wish to repeat the experience. Although the only offence in his criminal record concerns possession of a prohibited drug, it would appear that he is not a drug user but had acquired the drug for a friend. In short, he does not appear to have a drug and alcohol problem.99 I accept that on reflection RT is ashamed of having been impressed by being asked to join in the robbery and by the bravado that was called for. I also accept that he is ashamed of having been an inmate in a detention centre for the last two years when he was well regarded in the community as a talented footballer. Even at this stage, however, as Kathryn Wakeley, psychologist, observes, RT’s emotional maturity remains behind his relative age and is not commensurate with his appearance. As I have already observed, he is a young man of considerable height and physical stature and I suspect that it was for these reasons that he was both included as a member of an older peer group from which he gained a misplaced sense of self-importance. I accept that developmentally RT was at a vulnerable age when his father died and that the previously controlled parental environment dissipated at that time. I can only hope that his older brother is suitably ashamed of the fact that rather than assisting his younger brother to set boundaries in his life, and to learn to exercise the control and restraint that is called for in late adolescence, he led him astray. 100 Despite having what Ms Wakeley regards as some insight into his offending, it is the view of Ms Pick, the Juvenile Justice Officer, and Mr Mariner, the Assistant Manager of the Petersham office of the NSW Department of Juvenile Justice, that RT continues to have a very limited appreciation of the manifold consequences of violent behaviour in the community. This is of concern since it is perfectly clear that RT’s conduct on the night of the robbery reflected little regard for those who were the victims of the threat he personally posed as a masked robber brandishing a large knife, and little appreciation of the potential risk to himself by having participated in an armed robbery in the company of others. It was the view of Ms Pick and Mr Mariner that his peer associations remain an area of concern. Ms Pick and Mr Mariner express the hope that a violent offender program assessment would have been completed in preparation for the sentence proceeding. However, time did not permit that to be done. It was envisaged that an assessment of that kind would enable RT to gain deeper insight into his offending and would enable the Department to assist and guide him in further intervention strategies. It was nevertheless the view of both Ms Pick and Mr Mariner that the absence of such an assessment may be able to be accommodated in the structure of the sentence to be imposed.  
     
      
    101 Without objection by the Crown, I have received a letter from RT where he openly acknowledges responsibility for his actions and extends apologies to those who were most affected by the robbery including the family of the deceased. He says “never again do I want to hurt anyone else”. Without disregarding the views of Ms Pick and Mr Mariner, I accept that that is a genuine statement of his remorse and his future intentions. The question remains however whether upon release RT can maintain his resolve to conduct himself in strict compliance with the law. 102 As I noted earlier, whilst RT has no criminal record, the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice makes it clear that RT was the subject of a 12-month good behaviour bond with departmental supervision which was current at the time of the offending. Departmental records also indicate that during the currency of the bond RT did not maintain regular contact with the Department, was dismissive of efforts to supervise him and unwilling at that time to address his offending behaviour. In light of his past contact with supervisory services, I expressed concern in the course of the sentence proceeding as to how RT might be successfully integrated into the community upon his release in circumstances where I am minded to structure a sentence which involves a lengthy period of supervision. 103 Having reviewed all the materials, and with RT being two years older, I consider that he is able to cooperate and comply with the directions of a relevant supervisory service. In coming to that view, I am encouraged by the considerable effort that RT has committed to utilising his time in custody to the resumption of his academic studies (such that he has now completed year 9 and earned his year 10 School Certificate as well as having undertaken a variety of trade courses with a view to his gaining employment upon release). The Assistant Principal reports that he is a good student who has attained some fine results. She describes him as helpful, enthusiastic, cooperative and well behaved. She strongly recommends that he continue with his studies. 
     
      
    104 In a supplementary report produced by the Department of Juvenile Justice I am informed that it funds a post-release support program through Barnardo’s, a non-government organisation that assists young people released from custody to reintegrate into the community. I am also informed that the administrators of that program have offered RT secure accommodation and access to employment/training/education options and to facilitate any such program or services as I might direct in the sentencing order that is ultimately made. 
     
      
    Application of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
     
      
    105 The offence for which RT stands to be sentenced is a serious children’s indictable offence as defined by s 3(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. As a result, pursuant to s 17, it is necessary for him to be dealt with “according to law”. In this way the broad sentencing options otherwise available in Part 3 of the Act are not available in this sentencing exercise. That does not however exclude the application of principles stated in s 6 of the Act. They are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
         
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
         
          
          (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
           
          (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
           
          (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
           
          (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
           
          (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    106 As Giles J noted in R v SDM at 538, these principles are to be applied in light of all relevant circumstances including, in this case, the seriousness of the crime for which RT is to be sentenced. There is no suggestion that the imposition of a full time custodial sentence can be avoided in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    107 As I have noted, RT is currently 18 years of age. Since he is to be sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children’s indictable offence, he is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile unless I am satisfied there are special circumstances justifying his detention as a juvenile offender as provided for in s 19(5). In determining whether there are special circumstances, I am entitled to have regard to the availability of services or programs at the place that he will be detained and any other matter I regard as appropriate. I am satisfied that in order to maintain the continuity of his custody and his continued participation in counselling services available within the juvenile detention centre, it is appropriate that the balance of the non-parole period be served in a juvenile detention centre. 
     
      
    108 I am also satisfied having regard to the fact that the period on remand was lengthy, that this offence is the first occasion in which RT has been sentenced for any criminal conduct and the necessity that he have an extended period subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, that special circumstances exist justifying a departure from the statutory ratio that would otherwise obtain pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing order for SL

   JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Steven John Maunder, the accused, appeared for trial in the District Court, Tamworth on 10 June 2008. The indictment upon which he was presented contained two counts.2 The first count, for an offence contrary to s 111 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), charged him in the following terms: 
     
      
      “On 30 November 2006 at Tamworth in the State of New South Wales, did enter the dwelling house of Maitland Lea Hinkley situated at unit 5/3 Murray Street with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in company of another person, namely, Brendan Booby.” 
      
    3 The second offence, contrary to s 35 (2) of the Crimes Act was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
      “On 30 November 2006 at Tamworth in the State of New South Wales, maliciously did wound Maitland Lea Hinkley whilst in the company of another person, namely, Brendan Booby.” 
      
    4 Upon arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty to both counts and the jury were selected.5 Before the arraignment, counsel advised that there remained outstanding questions regarding some parts of an electronically recorded interview between the accused and police. The parties asked to delay commencement of the trial to allow the Crown to consider whether it might agree to excise some passages from the document. It was decided that the jury should be selected, and the trial proceed to the stage of opening addresses, and then the parties could pursue their discussions, in the time remaining that day. The trial was to resume the following day.6 When the matter resumed about 12:20 p.m. the Crown advised that shortly before he had been given a document purporting to be notice of an alibi upon which the accused wished to rely, and that there was to be argument about whether the court should allow the evidence.7 The jury were brought into court and I delivered my opening instructions to them. Thereafter they were allowed to separate so that I could hear the application for the admission of alibi evidence.8 The application proceeded, and both parties offered evidence and submissions until late that day, when I adjourned the trial to the following day for final submissions and my decision.9 I decided that the accused should be allowed to present the evidence, but that the Crown was not to be denied the opportunity to conduct its investigation of the alibi asserted. I discharged the jury, vacated the trial from the present sittings, and adjourned the matter for further call over on 25 June 2008.10 The need for this decision, and the inevitable consequences it has and will have for many, could have been avoided if the accused and those representing had complied with s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), enacted to facilitate a just outcome in such circumstances. Their failure to do so was unacceptable. It has caused inconvenience to members of the community called to serve on this jury only to be told on the second day that the trial could not proceed, and has disrupted the work of the court, leaving other litigants with matters pending in subsequent sittings to suffer delay.The History of the Proceedings11 The offences are alleged to have been committed on 30 November 2006. The accused was committed for trial from the Local Court, Tamworth on 7 March 2008. In the committal proceedings his solicitor cross-examined the critical witness to the offences and challenged her recollection of the date of the offence.12 In due course the trial was listed for call over, and was appointed to commence in the District Court at Tamworth on 10 June 2008. The trial was mentioned on the first day of the sittings, 2 June 2008. The accused’s solicitor, who had represented the accused in the committal hearing, and the Crown Prosecutor, advised that the trial would proceed. The accused’s counsel was to appear on the day of trial.The Notice of Alibi13 Section 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides: 
     
      
      “(1) This section applies only to trials on indictment. 
       
       
      (2) An accused person may not, without the leave of the court, adduce evidence in support of an alibi unless, before the end of the prescribed period, he or she gives notice of particulars of the alibi to the Director of Public Prosecutions and files a copy of the notice with the court. 
       
       
      (3) Without limiting subsection (2), the accused person may not, without the leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence in support of an alibi unless: 
       
        
         
        (a) the notice under that subsection includes the other person’s name and address or, if the other person’s name or address is not known to the accused person at the time he or she gives notice, any information in his or her possession that might be of material assistance in finding the other person, and 
         
         
        (b) if the other person’s name or address is not included in the notice, the court is satisfied that the accused person before giving notice took, and thereafter continued to take, all reasonable steps to ensure that the other person’s name or address would be ascertained, and 
         
         
        (c) if the other person’s name or address is not included in the notice, but the accused person subsequently discovers the other person’s name or address or receives other information that might be of material assistance in finding the other person, he or she immediately gives notice of the name, address or other information, and 
         
         
        (d) if the accused person is notified by or on behalf of the Crown that the other person has not been traced by the name or address given by the accused person, he or she immediately gives notice of any information that might be of material assistance in finding the other person and that is then in his or her possession or, on subsequently receiving any such information, immediately gives notice of it. 
        
       
       
      (4) The court may not refuse leave under this section if it appears to the court that, on the committal for trial of the accused person, he or she was not informed by the committing Magistrate of the requirements of subsections (2), (3) and (7) and, for that purpose, a statement in writing by the committing Magistrate that the accused person was informed of those requirements is evidence that the accused person was so informed. 
       
       
      (5) Any evidence tendered to disprove an alibi may, subject to any direction by the court, be given before or after evidence is given in support of the alibi. 
       
       
      (6) Any notice purporting to be given under this section on behalf of the accused person by his or her Australian legal practitioner is, unless the contrary is proved, to be taken to have been given with the authority of the accused person. 
       
       
      (7) A notice under this section must be given in writing to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and may be given by delivering it to the Director, by leaving it at the Director’s office or by sending it in a letter addressed to the Director at the Director’s office. 
       
       
      (8) In this section: 
       
       
      evidence in support of an alibi 
       means evidence tending to show that, by reason of the presence of the accused person at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time, the accused person was not, or was unlikely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission. 
       
       
      prescribed period 
       means the period commencing at the time of the accused person’s committal for trial and ending 42 days before the trial is listed for hearing.” 
      
    14 The accused failed to comply with this provision in a number of respects.15 Firstly, the notice was served on the day the trial commenced. This was so notwithstanding that the solicitor representing the accused must have had firm instructions from the accused that he was not at the place where the alleged offence was said to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission. I shall refer to the evidence leading to this conclusion in due course.16 Secondly, no notice was ever given to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I note however, that delivery to the Crown Prosecutor responsible for presentation of the trial would I believe have satisfied that requirement had the notice been given within the prescribed period.17 Thirdly, a copy of the notice was not filed with the court. The Crown Prosecutor tendered the handwritten notice upon the hearing of the application.18 Fourthly, I do not believe that the notice complied with the terms of the provision. It did not give particulars of the alibi. The notice, so called, does no more than inform the Crown of an intention to call alibi evidence in the trial from the named individual. This does not in my assessment give notice of the particulars of the alibi upon which the accused wishes to rely.19 The document is handwritten and is in the following terms: 
     
     “

    20 The particulars of Mr Hartin’s address appeared beneath his name, but are omitted here to protect his privacy.21 There is an indecipherable signature beneath the date, which I take to be that of solicitor acting for the accused.The Evidence Adduced upon the Application22 The Crown tendered a statement given to the police by the accused’s partner, Rianah Cook (Exhibit 1), which represents at paragraphs [5] and [6]: 
     
      
      “I previously lived in a Tamworth with my mum at …………… I have lived in Tamworth all my life prior to moving to Newcastle. The only other place I lived was in a block of flats at …………… I lived at this location with Steven. We only lived there for 3 months. We moved into the flat in about mid September 2006 and moved out in late November of 2006. It was very late November, but I don't think it was December. 
      
     
     
      
      When we moved out I went to stay at Dads (sic) place in the …………… Caravan Park at Toronto. I stayed at Dads (sic) with Steven and we were there for about one week. After this Steven and I went to Queensland for two and a half weeks. We went up to Queensland so we didn't have to go back to Tamworth. We were both just sick of Tamworth.” 
      
    23 The statement includes the addresses occupied by Ms Cook and her mother and the name of the caravan park occupied by her father, omitted here to protect their privacy.24 Counsel submitted that these paragraphs put the Crown on notice that the accused was intending to rely upon alibi evidence. I do not agree. Although in general terms it might be consistent with the proposition that the accused would assert that he was not in Tamworth at the time of the offence, it could not be said that these paragraphs provide notice of an intention to rely upon alibi evidence, or that their content satisfies the requirement that particulars of the alibi be provided. These passages provide no more than a description of the movements of the accused and Ms Cook, according to her imperfect recollection, at and about the time of the alleged offences.25 The alibi evidence from Donald Edward Hartin upon which the accused wishes to rely was led from him. It is to be noted that this was but some of the evidence that might be adduced by the accused, should the alibi offered by the truth.26 Mr Hartin is Rianah Cook’s father. The difference between their family names was not explained. He repairs and maintains the machinery of his employer’s clients in various places within New South Wales. He travels from place to place in the course of his work, and lives in caravan park type accommodation near to where the work is performed. He has a home at Werris Creek to which he returns intermittently; as I understood his evidence he is absent from his home for periods in excess of four weeks.27 He said that about five or six weeks ago he had a telephone conversation with the accused’s solicitor after the accused and his daughter asked him to make contact. They discussed a visit by the accused and his daughter when they came to Toronto toward the end of November 2006. He was unable to recall the details of this visit immediately, and so contacted his credit card provider to obtain a copy of the statement of transactions for that period. An undated letter from Coles Myer Ltd. was tendered, with an envelope bearing the date “21 May 08”, and the statement of transactions on a credit card in the name Mr D E Hartin for the period from 19 November 2006 to 18 December 2006.28 He said that he looked at this document for the first time the night before attending court. He had not seen it previously because he had not been at home to collect his mail.29 By reference to that document the witness reconstructed the proposition that his daughter and the accused had come to visit him toward the end of the week in which 28 November 2006 fell. He concluded from the record of a significant purchase at the Coles supermarket at Toronto on 29 November 2006, that the accused and his daughter were with him at that time.30 In response to cross-examination he acknowledged that there were time sheets and other records of his employer from which he could confirm his work commitments in this period.31 He said that 28 November 2006 was significant to him because it was the anniversary of his cousin's birth, and said he followed his usual practice of telephoning him to mark the occasion. He conceded however, that he might not have called on that day if he had forgotten to do so, but he certainly would have called no later than the following day. As I understood his evidence, Mr Hartin’s implication was that he telephoned his cousin at a time proximate to the visit of his daughter and the accused.32 He said that his daughter had telephoned him before coming to Toronto to inform him that they were about to leave to begin their journey. He asked her to call into his place at Werris Creek, but because of the lateness of the hour, he said that they should stay there over night and begin their journey the following day.33 Werris Creek is to the southwest of Tamworth, along the road from Gunnedah to the New England Highway which it meets near the village of Murrurundi, well to the south of Tamworth. It is somewhat out of the way for someone travelling from Tamworth to Toronto unless there was a purpose in going there such as was suggested by Mr Hartin.34 He said that he had a recollection of his daughter confirming that they spent the night at his home before continuing their journey.35 He said he had a recollection of meeting his daughter and the accused when he finished work and that together they went to the supermarket to buy groceries before going home to the caravan park. He said that he knew this occurred before the weekend, because he was to work the following day, and he did not usually work on the weekend. The implication was that the day after their arrival in Toronto was another weekday.36 He later added that he bought a quantity of groceries before the arrival of his daughter and the accused, and bought a second quantity on the day they arrived. He conceded that their arrival could have been on either the Thursday or the Friday, and that he could not at this stage be sure whether it was one or the other.37 Mr Hartin’s evidence was qualified and was in my assessment largely a reconstruction rather than a description of his recollection. With this comment I do not intend to suggest dishonesty on his part, but one needs to bear in mind that he is in court in support of his daughter and her partner, and I am satisfied that he was concerned not to cause either of them harm with what he had to say. Notwithstanding this concern, Mr Hartin readily admitted the lack of certainty in his mind as to precisely when they arrived in Toronto.38 A photocopy of a calendar for the financial year ending in June 2007 became Exhibit 4. It records 30 November 2006 as having fallen on Thursday.39 Evidence was also called from the solicitor who has acted for the accused throughout these proceedings. He produced a letter of 12 March 2008 (Exhibit 5) from his firm to the accused in which the following appears: 
     
      
      “As discussed the Alibi Defence notice is very important in your circumstance. In the event that Rianah’s father can assist with verifying your whereabouts on 30th November, 2006 then you are obliged to provide the Crown with his details. 
      
     
     
      
      If he can assist I suggest that you arrange for him to make an appointment to see me so that I may take a statement from him. 
      
     
     
      
      Is it possible for your parents might have knowledge (sic) of your movements at the time. Is it likely that your former landlord/landlady/managing agent of the King Street unit is able to assist. 
      
     
     
      
      I also remind you of the wisdom of reviewing available records (bank accounts, telephone accounts, credit card purchases etc) to determine whether or not there is information within those records that would assist in identifying your whereabouts at that time.” 
      
    40 The notice from the local court of what was required should the accused intend to rely upon an alibi defence was enclosed with the letter.41 Also tendered was a further letter from this firm on 6 May 2008 (Exhibit 6) in which the following appears: 
     
      
      “Further to my recent letter confirming your trial date of 10th June, 2008 I now need your  
      urgent 
       instructions. 
      
     
     
      
      You will recall my letter of 12th March, 2008, in particular the accompanying alibi notice. As you know Rianah's father was considered to be a potential alibi as to your whereabouts on the evening in question. I have not heard from either yourself or Rianah's father since the date of my letter. 
      
     
     
      
      I remind you that if the alibi defence is to be relied upon 42 days notice (prior to the trial date) is required to be given to the Crown detailing the nature of the defence. The time for giving notice has passed. Nevertheless here (sic) may still be an opportunity to give notice, provided it is given promptly. If Rianah's father can assist I need to speak with him urgently. The safe option is to provide me with his telephone number and I will make contact with him.” 
      
    42 The solicitor confirmed that he wrote both letters and believes he may have subsequently received a telephone call but did not have a relevant file note to assist him to remember whether he did so.43 In response to questions from the bench he said that he took the view that unless and until he had spoken to the proposed alibi witness he could not give notice of the alibi. His attention was taken to the distinction that might be drawn between particulars of an alibi and the evidence that might be offered in support of it, and was asked why the particulars of alibi could not be provided in light of instructions that he must have had from his client that he was not present at the scene of the alleged offence. He responded by acknowledging his responsibility for the decision, and said that he thought at the time it was the correct one in circumstances.44 I accept that he honestly held the view that he ought not to give notice of the alibi until he had made an assessment of the evidence available to support it, but it remains that if armed with instructions consistent with his correspondence, he must have had sufficient information to prepare a notice of the particulars of the alibi upon which the accused wished to rely, and that this could have been made available well before the 42 days preceding 10 June 2008 when the trial was appointed to commence.45 The Crown tendered a statement from Wayne Beavan, manager of the company that employed the accused upon a casual basis, with copies of a roster and a time sheet (Exhibit 7). The roster recorded that the accused was to work in Tamworth on the three days between the 29 November 2006 and 1 December 2006. These dates fell on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively. The time sheet is for the week ending 1 December 2006 and records him clocking in at 13:59 and clocking out at 22:00 on Monday, 27 November 2006, clocking in at 13:59 and clocking out at 22:00 on Tuesday, 28 November 2006, and clocking in at 13:49 and clocking out at 22:15 on Wednesday, 29 November 2006.46 According to Beavan’s statement there is no reason recorded for the accused’s absence on the other days when he was rostered for work.47 A statement by Renae Lowe of the Commonwealth Bank became Exhibit 8. She produced a copy of the statement of transactions for the accused’s account held with the bank for the period between 1 November 2006 and 2 January 2007. According to the entries on the statement the account was accessed via an automatic teller machine in Toronto on 6 December 2006, and the last time the account was accessed before then was via an automatic teller machine at Tamworth West on 29 November 2006. There are entries in between those transactions, which relate to the deposit of his salary and a loan repayment automatically debited.48 The statement of Nicole Elizabeth Clare, who is alleged to have been present at the time of the alleged offences became Exhibit 9, and a copy of the transcript of her evidence before the magistrate in the committal hearing became Exhibit 10.49 Her statement bears of the date 1 December 2006. There is no record of the time at which the statement was prepared. The document is of two pages containing 16 numbered paragraphs. At paragraph 4 she represented that about 10:30 p.m. or 11 p.m. on Thursday 30 November 2006 she and her partner, Maitland Hinkley, were at home in their lounge room when they heard a knock at the door, which Hinkley answered. Thereafter, she describes the events from which the charges have been brought, and the response by police and ambulance officers to her call for help. She waited with her partner as he was treated by the responding ambulance officers, and went with him to hospital where he received further treatment. After this, police took them to the police station at Tamworth. She there made her statement. It must be that this was after midnight. The fact that the statement bears the date 1 December 2006 excited cross-examination about the accuracy of the information she provided in the document as to when the offences and other events preceding it occurred. It was misinformed. The evidence before the magistrate that the statement was made the night of the alleged offences must be accepted to be accurate, even though the document bears the date 1 December 2006. The statement must have been recorded in the early hours of the morning on that date.50 Ms Clare recognised the accused and his alleged accomplice. She has known the accused for some years. According to paragraph 14 of her statement she stayed at the accused’s house on Wednesday night, 29 November 2006, and left there about 5:30 p.m. Thursday after she had spoken to the accused‘s accomplice.51 The purpose for having Ms Clare for cross-examination at the committal proceedings was to test what was said to be evidence of identification or recognition (Transcript page 2.), but as noted, the questions extended to test the representations as to the dates upon which various events occurred.52 She maintained that her statement was made on the night of the incident. (Transcript page 2.)53 She at all times maintained that the accused was one of the participants in the home invasion. (Transcript pages 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, and 31.)54 She gave evidence of circumstances from which one might conclude that the accused and his alleged accomplice were well known to her. (Transcript pages 6, 7, 11, 14, and 18.)55 She confirmed that she saw the accused and his alleged accomplice for about half an hour during the daytime on 29 November 2006, the day before the home invasion, at the home unit occupied by the accused and his partner Rianah Cook, after which she went to Maitland Hinkley’s unit. (Transcript pages 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 22, 23, and 24.)56 She gave evidence of events once the offenders left the premises, including attending the Maitland hospital and the police station. (Transcript pages 13 and 14.)57 The transcript from page 21 records cross-examination of Ms Clare suggesting inaccuracies in her statement. As I understand the proposition implicit in these questions, aided by submissions from the accused’s counsel, it is that the witness was mistaken as to the date upon which the incident occurred. The Crown on the other hand submits that there is ample evidence to establish the date upon which the offence is alleged to have been committed in the records of when the call for assistance was made, and from the observations of the attending police and other emergency personnel, and other witnesses.58 I am not persuaded that it can be said with any confidence that the witness made any concession as to the date of the offence as recorded in the statement, nor as to the events that occurred on the day before when, she said, that she attended the home of the accused and Rianah Cook and there saw the accused and his alleged accomplice.59 Upon the analysis of the statement and the transcript of her evidence provided below, I find that the proper conclusion to draw is that she was speaking of the events from which the charges have been drawn on 30 November 2006, and events on the preceding day when she visited the other premises. Any apparent uncertainty in her mind as to these dates should be measured against the nature of the questions put to her in cross examination, some of which focussed upon two paragraphs which do not appear to have been recorded with sufficient care.60 The opportunity for confusion is first demonstrated at page 20 line 3 where in the following is recorded: 
     
      
      “Q. Madam, it is the case isn’t it that you made a statement to the police on of the morning after these events being the morning of 1 December? 
       
      A. The morning after the events? 
       
       
      Q. Yes? 
       
      A. I think I made a, no I made a statement that night.” 
      
    61 Thereafter, from the bottom of page 20: 
     
      
      “Q. Do you recognise that --  
       
      A. Yes that is -- 
       
       
      Q. -- as the statement that you gave to the police on one December? 
       
      A. On 1 December? 
       
       
      Q. Yes. 2006? 
       
      A. Sorry I just have to get something straight. Did the incident happen on the 30th? 
       
       
      Q. Yes? 
       
      A. Yes well I made the statement on that same night. 
       
       
      Q. Just have a look at the statement. See alongside or just below the signature, do you see the date ""1 December 2006""? 
       
      A. Yes it says the 1st yes. 
       
       
      Q. So you accept that’s the day that you made your statement, is that right? 
       
      A. But, yes but I did not make a statement on the 1st. I don't understand what you are saying. 
       
       
      Q. Well tell me this, the incident happened on the night of 30 November? 
       
      A. Right. 
       
       
      Q. Right. The following day -- 
       
      A. Right. 
       
       
      Q. Right, is 1 December? 
       
      A. That's correct. 
       
       
      Q. Did you make your statement to the police on the following day? 
       
      A. No, I made it on that night. 
       
       
      Q. Could it have been in the early hours of the following morning?” 
      
    62 Thereupon her Honour intervened and asked: 
     
      
      “Q. After midnight? 
       
      A. I'm sorry, yes it could have.” 
      
    63 This resolved what might have been confusion in the mind of the cross examiner, which in turn prompted responses from the witness which suggest that she was uncertain as to the time when this incident occurred.64 The cross examiner then took the witness to paragraph 14 of her statement and asked her to read it to herself. She immediately responded that it was not correct. The following exchange that occurred: 
     
      
      “Q. I see. But nevertheless it was the statement that you gave to the police? 
       
      A. That's correct but I don't - I honestly do not remember writing that. It's a mistake, that's incorrect. 
       
       
      Q. So that part of the statement is wrong? 
       
      A. That's right.” 
      
    65 Paragraph 14 contains more than one representation of fact. It describes the length of time the witness knew the accused, the circumstances in which she came to know him, and the following passage: 
     
      
      “I actually stayed at Rianah and Stephen's house on Wednesday night, the 29th of November, 2006 and left there about 5:30 p.m. Thursday after I've spoken to BJ.” 
      
    66 The transcript does not make clear precisely what the witness challenged in that paragraph, but it is a reasonable inference to draw that the quoted passage is the representation she did not accept as accurate. 67 Wednesday did fall on 29 November 2006, and Thursday on 30 November 2006.68 The cross examiner then asked her to read to herself paragraphs 13. Thereafter the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
      “Q. Now Madam, bearing in mind of the statement date is 1 December 2006, is it the case that you spoke with BJ at Riana's (sic) place at 5 p.m. on 30 November? 
       
      A. Yes we did but it was a very basic conversation, it was ""Hi, how are you going, how's life"", that was it. Nothing was said about Maitland or the incident that happened that night after that, if that's what you are trying to -- 
       
       
      Q. Didn't you tell us earlier on that you had not been to Riana's (sic) place on 30 November? 
       
      A. I went there the day before the incident yes. 
       
       
      Q. The incident was on 30 November? 
       
      A. Right. 
       
       
      Q. You say you went there on 29 November? 
       
      A. Right 
       
       
      Q. Want I am asking you - listen to the question carefully - see the statement date is 1 December? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And you see the words in the third paragraphs, or second paragraph, ""The last time I spoke to BJ was yesterday at about 5 p.m."". Was ""yesterday"" 30 November 2006 at 5 p.m. or were you intending to refer to 29 November 2006? 
       
      A. Intending to refer to the 29th. 
       
       
      Q. So does that help you as to what time it was that you were at Riana's (sic) place on the 29th? 
       
      A. I guess so yes. 
       
       
      Q. So it wasn't about midday -- 
       
      A. I am not sure, that's why I say I'm not sure. I really can't remember. 
       
       
      Q. Well you see the statement there, 1 December -- 
       
      A. And that's right, and I also wrote of this statement are long time ago too. 
       
       
      Q. Well what I am asking you, do you accept is the statement paragraph 13, is that correct? (sic) 
       
      A. Yes besides it says ""I have been friends with him"", that's not correct. I was never his friend. 
       
       
      Q. So that's a mistake too is it? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
    69 Paragraph 13 of the statement is in the following terms: 
     
      
      “I’ve known BJ BOOBY for about four years. I haven't been friends with him, I’ve sort of just known him. His girlfriend four years ago was one of my friends and that's how I know him. The last time I spoke to BJ was yesterday at about 5 p.m. I saw him at Rianah COOK’S house in South Tamworth. Rianah is a friend of mine and she lives with Steven MAUNDER. Steven was there yesterday when I was talking to BJ.” 
      
    70 There was a risk of confusing the witness when the cross examiner referred to the third paragraph or second paragraph whilst taking her attention to paragraphs 13 in her statement. His intention no doubt was to refer to the second or third sentences in paragraph 13. It appears that the witness understood this.71 It appears also that part of the confusion in the mind of the cross examiner, implicit in the questions he was asking, arose from the structure of paragraph 13, bearing in mind that it was written in the early hours of 1 December 2006, but with the mind of the person making the statement focused upon the night of 30 November 2006 when the offences are alleged to have occurred. Understood in that context, paragraph 13 represents that the witness attended the other premises on 29 November 2006, a fact from which she has not resiled.72 If paragraph 13 is to be so understood, the second half of paragraph 14 quoted above, must be incorrect as Ms Clare asserted. It might be the product of some confusion in the mind of the person recording the statement, or in what Ms Clare expressed herself, and in either case was not detected when the witness was called upon to adopt the document with her signature.73 Another error is apparent when one notes her comment regarding paragraph 13, asserting that it said she had been friends with BJ Booby. Both the witness and the cross examiner appear to have misread the paragraphs at this point for it states quite clearly (emphasis added): 
     
      
      “I  
      haven't 
       been friends with him,” 
      
    74 This mistake was identified by the magistrate and brought to the attention of the cross-examiner.The Significance of the Alibi Evidence75 I have undertaken this analysis of the evidence to assess the significance the alibi evidence might have in the trial.76 Although the evidence available to the Crown pointing to the guilt of the accused is compelling, without the evidence of Ms Clare the Crown would be unable to succeed. I am not persuaded that the cross examination of Ms Clare in the committal proceedings has diminished her credibility at all, but this must be a qualified perception without having had the benefit of observing her as she gave her evidence.77 Although the evidence of the accused’s employment in Tamworth and the activity upon his bank account is consistent with the Crown's case that the accused was present in Tamworth at the time of the commission of these offences, as presented to the court upon this application it does not of itself prove that the accused was in Tamworth at that time.78 If the accused was elsewhere, clearly he could not have committed these offences, and evidence of an alibi must play a critical part in the trial. This is particularly so if Ms Clare presents with the credibility and reliability which I have inferred from the transcript of her evidence.The Principles79 Counsel for the accused submitted accurately that the proper course when an accused has failed to give notice of an alibi within time is to allow service of the notice out of time and permit the Crown an adjournment to carry out its investigation: Cooper v R (1979) 69 Cr App Rep 229.80 In Skondin v R [2005] NSWCCA 417 it was said at paragraph 47: 
     
      
      “A court should be slow to refuse a leave application under s 150 (2) [of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      ] unless prejudice arises such as is incapable of being addressed without significant disruption of the trial.” 
      
    Prejudice Claimed by the Crown81 The Crown argued that if evidence of an alibi was to be admitted it would suffer substantial prejudice, such that in the proper exercise of the court's discretion it ought not to be allowed, or alternatively, the trial should be adjourned to allow the Crown to requisition inquiries to address the evidence upon which the accused would rely. Those inquiries would include: 
     
      
      (1) Investigations of the credit card provider to confirm the dates identified in the transaction details in the credit card statement, and to ascertain whether they are merely the dates upon which the debit is posted to the account of the credit card holder, or represent the actual date upon which the transactions have occurred; 
      
     
     
      
      (2) Investigations of the supermarket where the transactions occurred to identify and access its records relevant to these transactions; and 
      
     
     
      
      (3) Investigations of the employer of the alibi witness to confirm his working roster for the period. 
      
    82 The Crown said there may well be other matters to investigate, depending upon the terms of the notice when it is properly crafted and served.The Decision83 There can be no doubt that the solicitor representing this accused had clear instructions that his client was not present in Tamworth at the time of the offences with which he is charged. No other conclusion can be drawn from the nature of the cross-examination in the committal hearing and the passages from his correspondence to the accused to which I have earlier referred.84 I have no difficulty accepting that the solicitor made his decision not to provide particulars of the alibi when he ought to have done so for the reasons he has given. Moreover, the terms employed in that correspondence makes clear that he was not intending to disadvantage the Crown or defeat the purposes of s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act.85 However, his decision was ill-advised, and has caused inconvenience to the court, the Crown, the witnesses who were waiting to be called in the trial, and significantly, to the members of the community who answered their summons to serve as jurors, particularly those who were selected for this jury, detained for the first day of the trial, to be informed on the second day that the trial could not proceed.86 I gave consideration to refusing the application to call alibi evidence for it was certain that this trial would be disrupted. The inquiries the Crown is entitled to make could not have been completed during present sittings of the District Court in Tamworth. I came to the view, however, that in the interest of justice the accused should be given the opportunity to present the alibi evidence, but only after proper notice was served upon the Crown so that it might conduct its investigation.87 I contemplated continuing the trial with the Crown to have its investigations carried out as it proceeded, however both counsel agreed that the anticipated inquiries would require much more time than the week or so set aside this trial, and would leave the jury substantially inconvenienced. Both counsel submitted that the jury ought to be discharged, and that the trial be vacated from the present sittings.88 In due course the jury were discharged with the thanks of the court, and an apology for the inconvenience caused to them. The trial was listed for call over on 25 June 2008.89 The accused was not subject to bail until this stage of the proceedings. This arrangement was not appropriate in my assessment of the offences alleged against him, and the outcome should he be found guilty. The accused was required to submit to bail. Upon the application of the Crown, it is a condition of the bail that the accused not approach directly or indirectly any witness to be called by the Crown, except for his partner Rianah Cook.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Darren Richard Jeffries, seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed in the Orange District Court on 12 June 2007 with respect to serious domestic violence offences. Following a trial between 2 and 10 April 2007, a jury convicted the Applicant of detain for advantage and cause actual bodily harm contrary to s.86(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty: 20 years’ imprisonment) and detain for advantage contrary to s.86(1)(b) (maximum penalty: 14 years’ imprisonment). Both offences were committed on 14 September 2006. No appeal is brought with respect to conviction.  
     
      
    3 The victim of the s.86(2)(b) offence was AW, the Applicant’s domestic partner since 2003. The victim of the s.86(1)(b) offence was AW’s 15-year old daughter, KW. Because KW is a minor, pseudonyms are used in this judgment for her and her mother to guard against publication of her name: s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.  
     
      
    4 On 12 June 2007, Woods ADCJ imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      (a) s.86(2)(b) offence - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and six months commencing on 10 April 2007 and expiring on 9 October 2014 with a balance of term of two years and six months expiring on 9 April 2017; 
       
       
      (b) s.86(1)(b) offence - imprisonment for a fixed term of five years commencing on 10 April 2007 and expiring on 9 April 2012. 
       
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    5 The sentencing judge made findings of fact for the purpose of sentence which were not challenged on the present application. What follows is drawn principally from his Honour’s remarks on sentence, together with parts of the evidence of AW to which the Court’s attention was drawn by the Crown.  
     
      
    6 The Applicant was born in 1968 and was 38 years old at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    7 The Applicant and AW had been in a domestic relationship on and off since 2003. They lived in her house in Dubbo together with her daughter, KW, and a female friend. AW told the jury that her relationship with the Applicant was “confusing and hard” (T42.7, 2 April 2007) and was marked by incidents of physical violence.  
     
      
    8 Such an incident occurred on 3 August 2006 when she was assaulted by the Applicant. The police were called and AW obtained an apprehended domestic violence order against the Applicant. AW told the jury that there were times when abuse led to the Applicant being charged, but that before matters went to court, the Applicant had “had enough time to talk me into dropping the charges. Everything was sweet. I get waited on hand and foot” and “then when the charges were dropped then it would go back to the old way” (T43, 2 April 2007). By this, she told the jury she was “stuck inside, weren’t allowed to do anything. Weren’t even allowed to walk to the shop” (T44, 2 April 2007). 
     
      
    9 On 14 September 2006, the Applicant and AW went to Gulargambone for a family funeral. Both the Applicant and AW drank beer at the funeral and AW said she became very intoxicated. Upon returning home to Dubbo, the Applicant started to argue with her in her bedroom about what was going on between her and her cousin.  
     
      
    10 AW left the room and went to her daughter’s room. The Applicant followed her there and attacked both her and her daughter. AW was on the floor as the Applicant slammed KW’s head into the wall.  
     
      
    11 There was a knock on the door during the incident and someone called out “It’s the police”. At that stage, the Applicant had been verbally abusing AW and her daughter. He told them both to sit quietly and not to make a sound. AW complied because she did not want to be hit again. She put her hand over her daughter’s mouth to prevent her from screaming at this time. Whilst these events were going on in KW’s bedroom, the friend who resided in the house returned home and wanted to come into the room. However, AW told her not to do so, as she was frightened that the Applicant would attack the friend as well. 
     
      
    12 At one point during the night, the Applicant had said to AW and KW “Make a noise and I’ll kill you”. 
     
      
    13 The Applicant dragged AW from the side of the bed and commenced to bite her, pull her hair and drag her trousers off. AW was screaming. Her daughter was on the bed observing events.  
     
      
    14 The Applicant held AW on the floor and was choking her. KW then intervened to pull her away. During these events, the Applicant pushed his hand into AW’s mouth and ripped underneath her tongue. Part of the underneath portion of AW’s tongue was ripped out by the Applicant during the incident.  
     
      
    15 KW gave evidence that the Applicant had grabbed her by the hair and swung her into the wall, and had intimidated and threatened to kill her and her mother if they called out for attention. 
     
      
    16 Both AW and her daughter were fearful as to what the Applicant would do to them if they had tried to get out of the house on 14 September 2006.  
     
      
    17 It was not until the next morning that the Applicant left the house. KW then rang the police. Because of the injuries to the inside of her mouth, AW had difficulty speaking to police that morning.  
     
      
    18 Photographs were tendered in the trial showing bruising and swelling to AW’s face and body, and an injury to the inside of her mouth which suggested, in the words of the sentencing judge, “an unusual attack on the victim” (ROS3). The injuries were confirmed by the ambulance officer who attended the house and transported AW to hospital.  
     
      
    19 His Honour found that when the Applicant grabbed AW by the hair, he had done it “so viciously that clumps of hair came out of her head” (ROS3). The police had also noted that tufts of hair were missing from AW’s head. Police who attended observed bloodstains and pieces of hair in rooms in the house. 
     
      
    20 The Applicant did not give evidence at the trial. He did give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. In his evidence on sentence, the Applicant claimed that, on the night of the offence, AW was antagonistic towards him over events at Gulargambone that day, and that AW had threatened him with violence. He claimed that his actions were in self defence.  
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge observed that the Applicant’s account of events had been put to AW during the trial and she had refuted that version (ROS4). His Honour stated that the Applicant had “exhibited an aggressive attitude” in his evidence in the sentencing proceedings (ROS4). The sentencing judge was satisfied that the jury was entitled to find as it did at trial (ROS5). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    22 The Applicant was 38 years old at the time of the offences and at the time of sentence. A pre-sentence report was before the District Court together with a report dated 29 May 2007 of Dr Anthony Samuels, psychiatrist from Justice Health. Both reports had been prepared at the request of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    23 The Applicant and his sister were raised by their parents in the family home in Brewarrina, before moving to Dubbo when the Applicant was about 16 years old. The Applicant reported positive and supportive relationships with both his mother and father. His father and other family members were present on 5 June 2007 when the Applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    24 The Applicant left school at the age of 15 years prior to the completion of Year 9. He has not completed any further educational or vocational training. He stated that he had worked occasionally as a labourer, cotton chipper and boner for local businesses. At the time of the present offences, he was in receipt of Centrelink unemployment benefits. 
     
      
    25 The Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. He stated that he had been using methamphetamine regularly prior to the offences.  
     
      
    26 The Applicant has an extensive criminal history involving repeated entries for offences of violence and contravention of apprehended domestic violence orders. He has convictions for assault female (1988), assault (1996), assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault (1997), assault occasioning bodily harm, assault and contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (1997), assault (1998), contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (1999), assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault and contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (2001), assault and contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (2002), contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (2003), assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault (2005), contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (2005) and assault (2006).  
     
      
    27 These offences have resulted in a range of penalties, including non-custodial penalties escalating to sentences of imprisonment in 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2005. The Applicant was extended further leniency for certain offences of violence and contravention of apprehended domestic violence orders, by way of a suspended sentence in 2002 and a community service order in 2003. As is apparent, despite the efforts by sentencing courts to utilise non-custodial options for his offences of violence, the Applicant’s offending conduct continued. 
     
      
    28 The Applicant’s criminal history contains other entries, including drink-driving offences in 1987, 1993 and 1995 which lend support to a history of alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    29 On 9 January 2007, the Applicant was sentenced in the Dubbo Local Court for an offence of common assault committed on 3 August 2006 against AW. He was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eight months, to date from 18 September 2006. It was this offence which gave rise to the apprehended domestic violence order which was current at the time the Applicant committed the subject offences on 14 September 2006. In addition, the Applicant was on bail on 14 September 2006 for the common assault committed against AW on 3 August 2006.  
     
      
    30 Dr Samuels reported that the Applicant had been seen by a psychiatrist, Dr McClure, in 1997 and that a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder with explosive features had been made, with anger management and psychological counselling being suggested. The Applicant informed Dr Samuels that almost all of his prison sentences had related to offences against women with whom he had been involved. There were two previous partners who had been victims of his violence before AW.  
     
      
    31 The Applicant informed Dr Samuels that he had seven children born of five different women. Dr Samuels observed (page 3) that “He feels that all his problems stem from his relationships and his plan now is not to have any more relationships. He said ‘I’m not proud of hitting women, but I’ll hit men too, don’t you worry’.” 
     
      
    32 It is pertinent to note the Applicant’s response in evidence on 5 June 2007 when the Crown cross-examined him concerning this part of Dr Samuels’ report (T7.29): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you spoke with Dr Samuels do you remember saying to him these words, that you're not proud of hitting women but you'll hit men too, don't you worry? 
         
        A. No. If anyone was to hit me I'd probably hit them back yes. 
         
         
        Q. Do you feel that expression represents how you presently feel about physical violence? 
         
        A. All I know is you know - like enough's enough. I'm on the enough's enough program on my own. That's my own program, enough's enough. I've had enough of gaol. I have had enough of sitting up here explaining myself. You know I know - I don't think that's the right way to deal with it. I'm going to ring the police and the whole lot of them when I get out. They can all get fucked. That's how I feel about it all today in society. I'll ring the police on the lot of them. I'll be a big dog. That's the way I feel.”  
        
       
      
    33 Dr Samuels observed that the Applicant became quite agitated during his interview on 19 May 2007 and was standing up continually in the interview room, apparently causing some apprehension on the part of the officer observing through a window. Dr Samuels could find no evidence of neurovegitative symptoms of depression or anxiety, nor evidence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation. He could find no clear-cut evidence that the Applicant was suffering from a major affective, anxiety or psychotic disorder.  
     
      
    34 Dr Samuels considered the Applicant had a significant poly-substance problem, involving alcohol and “speed”, and that he “certainly has significant antisocial personality features with marked problems of anger and violence, which seem to be particularly precipitated by use of drugs and alcohol”. Dr Samuels observed that the Applicant’s demeanour during interview was “slightly intimidating and my clinical impression was that it would not take a great deal to provoke Mr Jeffries” (page 3). Dr Samuels observed that it appeared “somewhat unrealistic” for the Applicant to state that he was not going to have any more relationships. With respect to risk issues, Dr Samuels concluded (page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view Mr Jeffries will continue to present an ongoing risk of violence and aggression to others, particularly if he continues with this pattern of substance misuse. He is a large and intimidating man and his potential for inflicting harm on others is not insubstantial.” 
        
       
       
      Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    35 His Honour recounted the facts of the offences for which the Applicant was to be sentenced, his extensive criminal history for offences of violence and contravention of apprehended domestic violence orders, the Applicant’s family and work history and referred to the “disturbing psychiatric report” from Dr Samuels (ROS6).  
     
      
    36 His Honour found that KW’s age was an aggravating factor as was the fact that the assaults upon her mother were carried out in KW’s presence. His Honour accepted that this was a terrifying experience for KW which could have an effect on her for years (ROS8). 
     
      
    37 With respect to mitigating factors, his Honour observed that no remorse was expressed at the trial, although the Applicant had expressed regret in his evidence at the sentencing hearing, although his Honour said “It is not clear what his expressions of remorse mean, whether they are genuine for the victims or are for his own actions in the situation he now finds himself in” (ROS8). 
     
      
    38 His Honour observed that the Applicant seemed “to be blaming everyone else for his inability to achieve any steps towards rehabilitation” (ROS8).  
     
      
    39 The sentencing judge stated that s.86 offences often happen in a domestic situation, and that the courts are required to treat such offences seriously. His Honour adverted to the traumatic effect of the offences including “the real fear of out of control violence”. His Honour referred to principles concerning the sentencing of domestic violence offenders in R v Hamid (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 at 191-196, including AW’s entitlement to the protection of the law, her vulnerability, and the frightening violence perpetrated by the Applicant in breach of trust (ROS9-10). 
     
      
    40 His Honour stated (ROS10): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have to be careful to get the right balance of punishment according to the law, the protection of the community, deterrence and the prospects of rehabilitation and with the psychiatric report I must be careful that I do not take undue recognition of the potential threat he may be and therefore use that threat to take the level of seriousness to a higher degree than would be seen when looking at the objective seriousness of the offences.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour referred to the injury to AW’s mouth and the pulling of tufts of hair from her head and the presence of her 15-year old daughter, KW (ROS11). His Honour said that a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years and six months for the s.86(2)(b) offence would constitute (ROS11-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “… appropriate punishment for this offence, and this should give the appropriate message to the others and the community of the seriousness of such an offence especially in a domestic situation. There is nothing in the subjective factors relating to the offender for any special circumstances to consider any leniency from the sentence considered appropriate.  
        
       
       
        
        With his history of assault offences and contravening of apprehended domestic violence orders he has had sufficient experience and understanding of the law for the protection of others and yet has failed to realise his responsibilities in such a domestic situation, and even when given the opportunity through bonds and periods on parole, including a s12 suspended sentence and bond in 2002, he has failed to address any anger and alcohol problems he may have. I note the fact of a breach of a apprehended domestic violence order in February 2005 and a common assault in August 2006. So I find that I cannot very  
        [sic] 
         the normal ratio of parole to non-parole periods and with the periods that I will impose there will still be an appropriate period on parole available for him to exhibit and take any positive steps towards rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    42 With respect to the s.86(1)(b) offence against KW, his Honour said (ROS13): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Count two while relating to another victim aged only fifteen years at the time was in fact of lesser severity and yet part of the overall incident so whilst it incurs its own separate penalty in view of the way I have approached the seriousness of count one and considering the totality I will subsume the penalty for count two into the penalty for count one and will not provide for an accumulation. 
         
         
        Whilst he was arrested following this incident before me now that period of custody has now become part of the sentence for an assault which occurred in 2006 before this incident. That term expired on 17 May 2007, so whilst noting the principle of totality I will date the sentences I will impose now from the date of the jury’s verdict of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour was asked to deal, under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, with a related offence of breach of apprehended domestic violence order on 14 September 2006. His Honour convicted the Applicant but, having regard to the sentences already passed, determined not to impose any additional term of imprisonment and sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment to the rising of the court.  
     
      
    44 His Honour made an order under s.562ZU Crimes Act 1900 for the protection of AW, such order to operate for five years until 11 June 2012. 
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    45 The Notice of Appeal dated 21 January 2008 contained the following grounds: 
     
      
    · Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to consider special circumstances in relation to the question of accumulation. 
     
      
    · Ground 2 - the overall sentence imposed, as accumulated and taking into account totality and special circumstances, is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - Special Circumstances 
       
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    46 Ms Loukas, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that his Honour had erred in failing to consider the question of accumulation in determining whether “special circumstances” existed under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Reliance was placed upon his Honour’s use of the term “special circumstances” in the passage reproduced at [41] above. Counsel submitted that his Honour had erroneously confined factors to be considered as special circumstances to the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, and did not turn his mind to the accumulation of sentences as an available special circumstance. 
     
      
    47 The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was not considering special circumstances, for the purposes of s.44, at the point in the remarks on sentence where the term was used. Rather, the Crown submitted that his Honour was there referring to the Applicant’s subjective circumstances. The Crown also points to the fact that defence counsel in the sentencing proceedings did not submit that special circumstances should be found by reference to accumulation. Further, the Crown submitted that the s.86(1)(b) sentence was made entirely concurrent with the sentence for the s.86(2)(b) offence. There was partial accumulation upon the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment imposed in the Local Court for the assault offence committed against AW a month before the present offences. The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the manner alleged in the first ground. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    48 It is necessary that his Honour’s remarks on sentence be fairly read for the purpose of determining whether the first ground has been established. His Honour’s use of the term “special circumstances”, in the passage cited at [41] above, raises a question as to whether the term was being used at that point in a s.44(2) sense. I am not satisfied that the term was being used by his Honour in that way at that point in the remarks on sentence. Rather, his Honour was adverting to the paucity of subjective factors which could operate in the Applicant’s favour on sentence. 
     
      
    49 It is necessary to have regard to the way in which the matter was argued in the District Court where, as counsel for the Applicant conceded in this Court, the argument advanced on appeal was not put.  
     
      
    50 Further, the present ground must be assessed in the context of a case where the sentences imposed by his Honour were entirely concurrent, and there was a modest and partial accumulation upon the comparatively short sentence imposed for the assault upon AW in August 2006. The accumulation of sentences involved in this case was so limited that, at best, it could have played a small part only in the determination of special circumstances.  
     
      
    51 The Applicant has not demonstrated that his Honour erroneously confined factors which were capable of being considered as special circumstances in the case.  
     
      
    52 In my opinion, the first ground has not been made good. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - Manifestly Excessive Sentences 
       
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    53 Ms Loukas advanced this as the principal ground in oral argument. Counsel submitted that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant exceeded those available, in the proper exercise of sentencing discretion, for the objective seriousness of the offences involved and thus were manifestly excessive. Counsel developed this argument in two ways: 
     
      
       
      (a) by reference to statistical material and sentences imposed in other cases for s.86 (or its predecessor, s.90A) offences, which were said to establish a sentencing range, so as to support a conclusion that the present sentences were outside the range and thus manifestly excessive; 
       
       
      (b) by reference to factors which bear upon the objective seriousness of s.86 offences as stated in earlier cases. 
       
      
    54 Without seeking to diminish the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s s.86 offences, Ms Loukas contended that a series of cases established a range of sentence, and that this range had been exceeded in this case by a considerable degree. A schedule was provided to the Court and a comparison invited with the short facts and sentences imposed in those cases. Counsel made particular reference to R v Stott [2005] NSWCCA 346 and Salvaggio v R [2007] NSWCCA 136, in support of this submission. 
     
      
    55 In addition, counsel referred to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for 21 cases between December 2001 and March 2007 in which sentence was passed for aggravated detain for advantage involving infliction of actual bodily harm contrary to s.86(2)(b) of the Act. Counsel submitted that the Court should utilise these sentencing statistics, in accordance with the principles in R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739, to support a conclusion that the present sentences were demonstrably excessive.  
     
      
    56 It was submitted that the present sentences were inconsistent with the pattern or range of sentences for this type of offence, and by comparison with sentences imposed in other cases where, it was submitted, more objectively serious crimes had been committed. 
     
      
    57 Counsel submitted that application of a non-exhaustive list of factors identified by Roden J, for s.90A offences, in R v Collett (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 June 1979, unreported) also served to demonstrate the manifest excess of the sentences passed in this case. When considered in the context of the present case, it was submitted that the offences were not at a level of objective seriousness that warranted imposition of the sentences passed by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    58 Ms Loukas submitted that the sentencing judge did not apply the principle of totality in that his Honour did not “take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong”: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18]. It was submitted that his Honour’s passing reference to the principle of totality (see [42] above), in the context of accumulation of the present sentences upon that fixed in the Local Court, did not demonstrate this his Honour had taken “a last look” as required and that the sentences ultimately passed reflected such an error.  
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that it was necessary for the sentences to reflect the objective criminality of the present offences. The principle of totality is applied to avoid a crushing sentence, but also to require assessment whether the overall effect of the sentences is sufficient: R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 at [55]. The Crown submitted that his Honour undertook this task in sentencing the Applicant and that no error is revealed. 
     
      
    60 With respect to the table of cases and statistics relied upon by the Applicant, the Crown submitted that cases within the table include a mixture of offences under s.86(1)(a) and (b), as well as offences under s.86(2)(b) of the Act. It was submitted that the present offences were in a different class from those contained in the table. The present offences were committed in a domestic setting by an Applicant with a serious criminal record, and whilst he was on bail and subject to an apprehended domestic violence order in respect of the same victim. The Crown submitted that Salvaggio v R was of limited assistance, given that Smart AJ at [36] observed that the sentence imposed for the s.86 offence lay at the bottom of the permissible range. It was submitted that R v Stott was far removed from the present case factually, and provided no assistance in attempting to assess a range of sentences.  
     
      
    61 The Crown submitted that limited assistance is to be gained by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases: R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]-[49]; R v Zhang [2004] NSWCCA 358 at [26].  
     
      
    62 With respect to the sentencing statistics relied upon by the Applicant, the Crown accepted that the overall sentence imposed on the Applicant fell at the upper end of sentences recorded in respect of offences against s.86(2) of the Act. It was submitted, however, that the range is not established by statistics and care must be taken to ensure that statistics do not dominate the sentencing exercise. In addition, the Crown submitted that care was required in considering sentences imposed for offences under repealed s.90A of the Act, given the different terms of those provisions.  
     
      
    63 The Crown submitted that offences under s.86(1) were committed in a wide range of circumstances which make sentencing statistics of less assistance than in other cases: Heine v R [2008] NSWCCA 61 at [34].  
     
      
    64 The Crown submitted that sentencing is discretionary and there is no single correct sentence: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [27]. It was submitted that care should be taken with respect to the concept of “range”. Judicial Commission statistics do not indicate that range, but reflect what was regarded as appropriate in the wide variety of circumstances in the cases reported in those statistics: R v Lao [2003] NSWCCA 315 at [32]-[33].  
     
      
    65 The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge rightly took as a starting point the maximum penalty and considered the objective seriousness of the particular offences before the Court. It was observed that defence counsel in the District Court accepted that the offences fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness (T10, 5 June 2007). The Crown submitted that the fact that the overall sentence appears to be at the upper end of the range (in a statistical sense) is not demonstrative of error. Rather, it results from the sentencing judge’s finding that the particular offences were so serious as to demand salutary punishment. His Honour gave reasons for this conclusion which, the Crown submits, supported the finding. 
     
      
    66 The Crown submitted that although consistency in sentencing is an important goal, equally important for the administration of justice is the public perception that sentences imposed by criminal courts are appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed: R v Fong (2002) 132 A Crim R 308 at 309-310 [7], 315 [41]. 
     
      
    67 The Crown relied upon R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [32] with respect to factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of s.86 offences. Applying those principles to this case, the Crown submitted that the sentences selected by his Honour were open in the proper exercise of sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    68 The Crown submitted that, although the period of detention of the victims was less than 24 hours, this was but one factor relevant to assessment of objective seriousness. A further factor was the injury inflicted upon AW by the Applicant. It should be borne in mind, the Crown submitted, that s.86(2)(b) of the Act does not provide for a further gradation of offence involving injuries that amount to grievous bodily harm. This was a case, the Crown submitted, which involved infliction of actual bodily harm of a most serious type.  
     
      
    69 Further, it was submitted that the aggravated offence against AW was further aggravated by its commission in the presence of her daughter and with the Applicant threatening both of them with death. 
     
      
    70 The Crown submitted that his Honour correctly applied statements in R v Hamid at 195-197 [86] concerning the importance, in sentencing a repeat domestic violence offender, of specific and general deterrence, the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct, the need for protection of the community and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence. The sentencing judge had given effect to these principles in passing sentence. This assisted a conclusion that the sentences imposed by his Honour were not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    71 The Crown submitted that the Applicant’s criminal history also demonstrated a continual disregard and contempt for the law, further emphasising the importance of deterrence in sentencing the Applicant: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477. 
     
      
    72 The Crown observed that his Honour was careful not to allow the prospect of future criminal conduct to have an impact on the sentencing discretion in the sense of preventative detention of some type (see [40] above).  
     
      
    73 The Crown pointed to the fact that there were no significant matters in mitigation. The Applicant had gone to trial and the victims were required to give evidence. The sentencing judge questioned the value of his belated expressions of remorse and observed that the Applicant seemed to minimise his criminality. The Crown pointed to his Honour’s observation that the Applicant blamed others for his inability to achieve steps towards rehabilitation. It was submitted that these findings added to the importance of specific deterrence in this case. 
     
      
    74 The Crown submitted that his Honour paid due regard to the principle of totality in passing sentence. There was a measure of accumulation with the Local Court sentence, but the two sentences imposed in the District Court were made entirely concurrent. The Crown submitted that none of this reveals error in his Honour’s understanding and application of the principle of totality.  
     
      
    75 In conclusion, the Crown submitted that the function of this Court is to determine whether error is demonstrated. The Crown submitted that no patent error had been demonstrated and that the Applicant had not established that the sentences imposed, although substantial, were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    76 The submission of the Applicant is, in reality, that the final sentences imposed upon the Applicant were manifestly excessive and that a breach of the proportionality and totality principles may be inferred from the final result. In essence, Ms Loukas submits that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant were crushing sentences so as to be unreasonable or plainly unjust. 
     
      
    77 In my view, no patent error has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the sentencing decision in the District Court. No error of principle has been demonstrated in his Honour’s approach to totality. The real question is whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen at 370-371 [25].  
     
      
    78 The offences now contained in s.86 Crimes Act 1900 were inserted by the Crimes Amendment (Gang and Vehicle Related Offences) Act 2001. The second reading speech in support of that Bill (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 17 October 2001, page 17,518) reveals that the provisions previously contained in s.90A of the Act had proven to be “confusing and uncertain”.  
     
      
    79 The movement away from s.90A, and the enactment of the offence now contained in s.86, reinforces the need to concentrate upon s.86 cases for assessment of factors bearing upon the objective seriousness of s.86 offences. In R v Newell, Howie J (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) said at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person. As his Honour noted, there are a number of factors that can be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence under section 86 including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain, is not, in my view, conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    80 An argument was rejected in R v Newell at [31] that the most serious category of s.86(1) offences was confined to offences where the detention was for the purpose of ransom. 
     
      
    81 In R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335, Howie J again placed emphasis on the fact of detention, rather than the purpose of detention. His Honour emphasised at [42] that there are many factors, other than the purpose of the detention, that can be relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of a particular instance of the offence.  
     
      
    82 In R v Newell, Howie J at [43] emphasised the limited use of statistical information with respect to sentencing for s.86 offences: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court has been referred to statistical information, notwithstanding that the applicant’s solicitor appreciates its limited value. Statistical information may have value in an appropriate case to indicate a range of sentences for offences where there is a predictable similarity in the conduct amounting to the offence. I doubt that offences under s 86 will be sufficiently homogenous that a reference to statistics alone will be of much assistance. But even if a range could be established, it does not follow that a sentence for a particular offence or offender has to fall within that range. It is merely a sounding board upon which a particular sentence may be judged. In this case there is nothing in the material that makes this particular sentence ring untrue.” 
        
       
      
    83 In R v Hamid, a s.86(1)(b) offence was committed in a domestic violence context by an offender with a history of domestic violence offences against several victims. At 203 [131], I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect to the s.86 offence itself, the gravamen of the offence, for the purpose of sentencing, is the unlawful detaining of a person:  
        R v Newell 
         [2004] NSWCCA 183 at paragraph 32;  
        R v Falls 
         [2004] NSWCCA 335 at paragraph 42. The s.86 offence was committed in the context of the Respondent’s controlling and violent relationship with Ms Vasconcelos. The fact that the advantage to the Respondent was confined to a form of self-protection does not reduce the seriousness of the crime. An assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence involves an examination of the immediate acts of the Respondent in the context of his violent control of the victim.” 
        
       
      
    84 The seriousness of a s.86(1)(b) offence committed in the context of an offender’s controlling and violent domestic relationship has received recent emphasis from this Court: R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [95]. 
     
      
    85 I do not consider that the Applicant’s reliance upon other sentencing decisions establishes a range of sentences which assists an argument that the present sentences are manifestly excessive. A variety of circumstances is demonstrated in the cases to which the Court has been taken. Few have a domestic violence context. In this regard, I do not consider that the sentences passed in Salvaggio v R or R v Hamid assist the Applicant to establish a range of sentences.  
     
      
    86 Further, the sentencing statistics do not demonstrate a range of sentences to support the contention that the present sentences were manifestly excessive. The function of the courts is to sentence an offender by the application of correct sentencing principles, commencing with the gravity of the offence, and not by reference to the statistical median range of sentences handed down over a period of time: R v AEM and Others [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [116]. 
     
      
    87 It is clear that, in mathematical terms, the s.86(2)(b) sentence was a lengthy one which exceeded many other sentences imposed on other offenders for their crimes. That, however, is not the test.  
     
      
    88 The practice of approaching sentencing appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases is neither helpful nor supported by authority: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George at 47 [48]-[49]. 
     
      
    89 With respect to the extent of injury in a s.86(2) offence, Howie J in R v Newell observed at [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        “While it may be accepted that the victim did not receive any serious injury, it does not follow that the offence was not one falling within at least the middle range of seriousness having regard to all the objective circumstances of the offence. Had the injuries been more serious, the sentence would have approached nearer the maximum sentence for the offence. The offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and the whole of the applicant’s conduct and the consequences for the victim had to be considered when determining how serious the offence was as against the maximum sentence prescribed.” 
        
       
      
    90 The Applicant stood to be sentenced for two serious s.86 offences, with maximum penalties of imprisonment of 20 years and 14 years respectively. Both offences involved the protracted detention by the Applicant of AW and her daughter for the advantage of fending off police intervention with respect to the Applicant’s violence perpetrated against both victims. As in R v Hamid and R v Burton, the offence against AW was committed in the context of the Applicant’s controlling and violent relationship with that victim. As part of the offence, he inflicted actual bodily harm of a serious (and bizarre) type upon AW, in a manner which involved an element of gratuitous cruelty. Separate acts of violence were committed upon KW who, in turn, was subjected to detention and threats. Great fear was instilled in both AW and her daughter. The fact that there were two victims of offences which formed part of the one course of criminality made the total criminality of the Applicant greater than had there only been one victim: Vaovasa v R (2007) 174 A Crim R 116 at 121 [19]. 
     
      
    91 Significant aggravating factors existed, given that the offences were committed whilst the Applicant was on bail for an offence of violence committed against AW and was subject to an apprehended domestic violence order intended to control his conduct towards his domestic partner. The present offences were committed in flagrant breach of both forms of conditional liberty, which were intended to protect AW. 
     
      
    92 The Applicant’s criminal history contained repeated offences of violence against domestic partners, including two partners before AW. The Applicant had been provided with repeated opportunities by the criminal courts in this respect, but his recidivist conduct demonstrated a propensity to act violently towards his partners, irrespective of the existence of legal orders intended to control his conduct and to protect his partners.  
     
      
    93 The Applicant’s prior convictions were pertinent to an assessment as to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, sentences should lie by reference to his attitude of disobedience towards the law and increased weight to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at 574 [26]. 
     
      
    94 There were no real mitigating factors operating in the Applicant’s favour on sentence. He had pleaded not guilty and had required the victims to give evidence at trial. There was a belated expression of regret in the sentencing proceedings but, as the sentencing judge found, the Applicant’s statement was surrounded by efforts to blame the victims. It was both open to his Honour, and appropriate, to pay no regard to such a claim for remorse.  
     
      
    95 The evidence before the District Court, including the report of Dr Samuels, did not suggest that the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were good. To the contrary, the Applicant’s long history of domestic violence and aggressive conduct, demonstrated even during his evidence in Court, provided a basis for real concern about the safety of any future domestic partner of the Applicant and the community generally. 
     
      
    96 Although the sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with a seven-and-a-half year non-parole period was a substantial one for the s.86(2)(b) offence, it was to be served entirely concurrently with the sentence of five years’ imprisonment for the s.86(1)(b) offence. Given the violent conduct of the Applicant towards KW, and the detention of the young woman in terrifying circumstances for a protracted period, it would have been open to his Honour to consider some accumulation of the sentence for this offence: Vaovasa v R at 121 [19]. This must be kept in mind in assessing the Applicant’s principal complaint that the sentences involved were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    97 Each of the purposes of sentencing identified in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 had application in this case, but none in a manner that favoured the Applicant. It was necessary for the court to impose sentences on the Applicant: 
     
      
       
      (a) to ensure that the Applicant was adequately punished for his offences: s.3A(a); 
       
       
      (b) to serve the purpose of preventing crime by deterring the Applicant specifically, and other persons generally, from committing similar offences: s.3A(b); 
       
       
      (c) to protect the community and in particular, women within the community, from the Applicant: s.3A(c); 
       
       
      (d) to make the Applicant accountable for his actions: s.3A(e); 
       
       
      (e) to denounce the conduct of the Applicant: s.3A(f); and 
       
       
      (f) to recognise the harm done to the victims of the Applicant’s crimes and the community: s.3A(g). 
       
      
    98 The promotion of the rehabilitation of the Applicant (s.3A(d)) played a subsidiary role in this case, given the pessimistic state of the evidence concerning his prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    99 Although the total effective period of imprisonment of the Applicant is substantial, that result is explicable by reference to the objective seriousness of his crimes and the absence of any subjective factors operating in his favour.  
     
      
    100 The sentences are not manifestly excessive. They are not unreasonable or plainly unjust. It has not been demonstrated that the sentences lie outside the range of sentences open in the proper exercise of sentencing discretion in all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
       
      An Issue Emerging From Evidence Filed on the Application 
       
      
    101 Although it is not necessary to do so, I should not conclude these reasons without referring to an issue that arose at the hearing of the application. 102 In accordance with common practice on applications for leave to appeal against sentence in this Court, a number of affidavits were filed and read on the conditional basis that the Court might have regard to them in the event that error is found and the Court considers s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]; Baxter v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at 286-287, 295, 299. Those affidavits revealed that the Applicant had undertaken a number of courses whilst in custody.  
     
      
    103 In addition, an affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 28 April 2008 was filed in which, amongst other things, the Applicant expressed sorrow for his offences and stated that he had undergone religious conversion. In reply, the Crown filed and read an affidavit on the same conditional basis. This established that the Applicant had sent a letter from prison to AW shortly prior to 30 January 2008. In the letter, the Applicant said that he knew that he should not be writing to the victim because of the prohibition in the domestic violence order. The Applicant claimed ongoing feelings for the victim, but then turned to the possible consequences for any male partner with whom AW may form a relationship. The letter said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If any man thinks he loves you more than I do well I got news for him. I am training every day for him the man who thinks he loves you more than I do. I have turn  
        [sic] 
         to God but just for one round with the man who thinks he loves you more than I do I will grow horns and a tale  
        [sic]  
        for one round! With the man who thinks he loves you!! And that is when he will find out who God is!! Amen tell him. Show him if there is a man? God help him!! I am cracking my bones just thinking about him if there is one? Your  
        [sic] 
         mine right! I take back the lines I told you! Rember  
        [sic] 
         a 1000 arms can have you but only my hands can hold you! 
          
        Rember  
        [sic] 
         you have taught me all about that!! A green eyes  
        [sic]  
        sense I have been in here. …” 
        
       
      
    104 On 7 May 2008, the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Dubbo Local Court to an offence, arising from the letter, of contravening a prohibition in a domestic violence order, an offence under s.562ZG(1) Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment to commence on 7 May 2008 and to expire on 6 May 2009.  
     
      
    105 A further affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 14 May 2008 was filed and read at the hearing in this Court on 15 May 2008. In this affidavit, the Applicant revealed the fact that he had been charged with, and pleaded guilty to, the offence arising from the letter. Other affidavits filed on the application disclosed that the Applicant had mentioned this charge, at an earlier time, to his solicitor, who had not considered it necessary to include it in his first affidavit of 28 April 2008.  
     
      
    106 I should explain why reference is being made to this aspect of the application. Had the Court found error and moved to resentence the Applicant, it would have been necessary to make findings for the purpose of sentence. 107 The Applicant’s post-sentence conduct, involving an offence of breaching the prohibition order by sending the letter to AW, would have been relevant and admissible, not to increase punishment for the principal offences, but to utilise as part of an assessment of the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation: Douar v R (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at 179 [131].  
     
      
    108 As mentioned earlier, the sentencing judge had (correctly) assessed the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as being poor. The Applicant’s affidavits claimed a level of remorse for his actions and a level of insight, together with a claim of religious conversion, which could bear upon his prospects of rehabilitation. Such a claim would be undermined by a letter such as that sent by the Applicant to AW in January 2008. The facts on sentence in the Local Court recited that AW had believed that she was safe from the Applicant due to his incarceration and the order of the Court, but felt fearful and threatened on reading the letter. Such feelings on the part of the victim were entirely understandable. On its face, the letter constituted an attempt by the Applicant to maintain control and domination of the victim, even when he was in prison serving lengthy sentences for his crimes. 
     
      
    109 If the Court had found error and considered whether some other sentence was warranted and should have been passed (s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), regard would have been given to the evidence admitted before this Court. The January 2008 letter would not have assisted the Applicant. However, that point has not arisen as the Applicant did not establish error on the part of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    110 These events emphasise the need for great care in the preparation of material which is to be placed before this Court in accordance with the practice referred to at [102] above. 
     
      
       
      Proposed Orders 
       
      
    111 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    112 McCALLUM J: I agree with Johnson J.

      2007/2396001 - Regina v Khaled SHARROUF [No 2] 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT - Unfitness for Trial – consequences of finding – s 20B of the  
      Crimes Act (Cth) 1914 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Khaled Sharrouf, (“the accused”), is one of nine men who have each been charged upon a single indictment to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts.  
     
      
    2 The accused was arrested on 8 November 2005 and has been in custody since that time. He is presently detained, as are the others, at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Prison at Silverwater. The accused and his alleged co-conspirators faced committal proceedings during the early part of 2007. He was, along with the others, committed to stand trial on 30 April 2007. On 31 May 2007 he and his co-accused were arraigned before me in the Supreme Court. Each accused pleaded not guilty to the charge in the indictment.  
     
      
    3 The charge arises from ss 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. This is a very serious charge. The legislation provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life for this category of offence.  
     
      
    4 Mr Geoff Bellew SC and Mr C. O’Donnell appear for the Crown on the present application. Mr Brewer and Mr Michael Pickin appear for the accused. Both the Crown and the defence have raised the issue of the accused's unfitness to be tried. A motion filed on behalf of the accused raising the issue was first notified to the Court in November 2007. It is agreed between the parties that this Court is exercising Federal jurisdiction, but that, by virtue of ss 68(1) and 79 of the Judiciary Act (Commonwealth) 1903 a range of state laws relating to procedures for trial are, in general terms, to apply to the accused in connection with the offence with which he is charged.  
     
      
    5 The question of the accused's fitness having been raised, the parties agree that there is a three-stage process to be followed. First, there is an initial determination as to fitness or unfitness. As there is no Commonwealth legislation governing the procedure to be followed on this issue, the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) apply to this first stage. I have earlier decided that this issue may be determined on a Judge-alone basis. (R v Baladjam & Ors 7 March 2008). I have also determined that the provisions of s 11 of the New South Wales legislation (which require trial by Judge alone) do not infringe s 80 of the Constitution (R v Baladjam & Ors [No 13] 1 May 2008). 
     
      
    6 Secondly, in the event of a finding of unfitness, there is Commonwealth legislation dealing with the second stage process to be followed. This is to be found in s 20B(3) of the Crimes Act 1914 CTH (""the Act"") and Division 6 of the Act generally. Essentially, the second stage requires the Court to determine whether a prima facie case has been established. 
     
      
    7 The third stage process arises if a prima facie case has been established and the Court does not otherwise determine that the charge should be dismissed. In that situation, the Act imposes on the Court the need to make a determination as to whether the accused is likely to be fit within a 12-month period (s 20BB of the Act). In that event, the Court must also decide what must be done with the accused in terms of his remaining in custody, his hospitalisation, or release on bail. That question itself involves issues relating to the future treatment of the accused. 
     
      
       
      The relevant provisions of the Act 
       
      
    8 I shall set out the operative and relevant sections of the Act for present purposes. 
     
      
       
        
        “Division 6—Unfitness to be tried 
         
         
         
        20B Consequences of preliminary finding that person unfit to be tried 
         
         
         
        (1) Where, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences, the question of the person’s fitness to be tried in respect of the offence, is raised by the prosecution, the person or the person’s legal representative, the magistrate must refer the proceedings to the court to which the proceedings would have been referred had the person been committed for trial. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (2) If the court to which the proceedings have been referred finds the person charged to be fit to be tried, the court must remit the proceedings to the magistrate and proceedings for the commitment must be continued as soon as practicable. 
         
         
         
        (3) Where a court: 
         
         
          
          (a) to which proceedings have been referred under subsection (1); or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) before which a person appears in proceedings for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences; finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie 
            
          case that the person committed the offence concerned. 
           
           
          
         
        (4) Where a magistrate refers proceedings to a court under subsection (1), the magistrate may order the person charged to be detained in prison or in hospital for so long only as is reasonably necessary to allow the court to which the person is referred to determine whether it will make an order under subsection (2) remitting the person to the magistrate, an order under section 20BA dismissing the charge or an order under section 20BB detaining the person in prison or hospital or granting the person bail. 
         
         
         
        (5) Where a court finds a person, other than a person in respect of whom proceedings have been referred to it by a magistrate under subsection (1), to be unfit to be tried, the court may order the person to be detained in prison or hospital for so long only as is reasonably necessary to allow the court to determine whether it will make an order under section 20BA dismissing the charge or an order under section 20BB detaining the person in prison or hospital or granting the person bail. 
         
         
         
        (6) For the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie 
          
        case is established if there is evidence that would (except for the circumstances by reason of which the person is unfit to be tried) provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (7) In proceedings to determine whether, for the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie 
          
        case has been established: 
         
          
           
          (a) the person may give evidence or make an  
           
          unsworn statement; and 
           
           
          (b) the person may raise any defence that could properly be raised if the proceedings were a trial for that offence; and 
           
           
          (c) the court may seek such other evidence, whether oral or in writing, as it considers likely to assist in determining the matter. 
           
           
          
         
        20BA Upon determining prima facie 
          
        case, court to dismiss charge or to determine fitness within 12 months 
         
         
         
        (1) Where the court determines that there has not been established a prima facie 
          
        case that the person committed the offence, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge against the person and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (2) Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie 
          
        case that the person committed the offence, but the court is of the opinion, having regard to: 
         
          
           
          (a) the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person; or 
           
           
          (b) the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or 
           
           
          (c) the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances; that it is inappropriate to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody. 
           
           
          
         
        (3) Where the court orders that the person be released from custody, the person must be released accordingly. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (4) Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie 
          
        case that the person committed the offence, but the court does not dismiss the charge under subsection (2), the court must, as soon as practicable after making that first-mentioned determination, determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, the person will become fit to be tried, within the period of 12 months after the day the person was found to be unfit to be tried. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (5) A court must not make a determination under subsection (4) unless the court has obtained, and considered, written or oral evidence from a duly qualified psychiatrist and one other duly qualified medical practitioner. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (6) Nothing in subsection (5) prevents a court from obtaining written or oral evidence from such other persons, bodies or organisations as the court considers appropriate. 
         
          
           
          
         
        20BB Persons found by a court to be likely to be fit within 12 months 
         
         
         
        (1) Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person charged with a federal offence who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within a period of 12 months after that finding, the court must, at the time of making that determination, also determine: 
         
          
           
          (a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital; and 
           
           
          (b) if so—whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital. 
           
           
          
         
        (2) Where a court has made a determination under subsection (1), the court must: 
         
          
           
          (a) where the court has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person does not object to being detained in a hospital—order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or continue to be detained in a hospital, as the case requires; or 
           
           
          (b) otherwise: 
           
           
           
            
            (i) order that the person be taken to and detained in a place other than a hospital (including a prison); or 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) grant the person bail on condition that the person live at an address or in a place specified by the court; 
            
           
           
          for a period ending: 
           
           
          (c) when the person becomes fit to be tried; or 
           
           
          (d) when, as soon as practicable after the end of the 12 months referred to in subsection (1), the court makes an order under subsection 20BC(2) or (5) as applied under subsection (4); 
           
           
          whichever happens first. 
           
           
          
         
        (3) Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person charged with a federal offence who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding then, if the person becomes fit within that period: 
         
          
           
          (a) if the person had been indicted on the charge before being found unfit—the proceedings on the indictment must be continued as soon as practicable; and 
           
           
          (b) if proceedings for the commitment of the person had been referred to the court under section 20B—those proceedings must be continued as soon as practicable as if they had not been so referred. 
           
           
          
         
        (4) Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried, within 12 months after that finding but the person does not become fit within that period, then, at the end of that period, subsections 20BC(2) and (5) apply as if the court had originally determined, at that time, that the person would not become fit to be tried and had made, under subsection 20BC(1), a further determination of the kind that it made under subsection (1) of this section. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (5) Where subsections 20BC(2) and (5) apply in relation to a person in the circumstances set out in subsection (4), then: 
         
          
           
          (a) in an order under subsection 20BC(2) as so applied the court must, in fixing the period of detention, have regard to any period of detention already served under paragraph (2)(a) or (b) of this section; and 
           
           
          (b) in an order under subsection 20BC(5) as so applied the court must: 
           
           
           
            
            (i) in the case of a person already on bail—order, in lieu of the person’s release from custody, the continuance of the person’s release on bail; and 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) in fixing the period of the person’s release for which conditions apply, have regard to any period of detention already served under paragraph (2)(a) or (b) of this section. 
            
           
           
          
         
        (6) Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding but the person does not become fit within that period, the finding that there is, on the balance of probabilities, a prima facie 
          
        case for the commission of the offence charged acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person in respect of the offence. 
         
          
           
          
         
        20BC Persons found by a court not to be likely to be fit within 12 months 
         
         
         
        (1) Where a court determines, under section 20BA, that a person who was found unfit to be tried will not become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding, the court must, at the time of making that determination, also determine: 
         
          
           
          (a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital; and 
           
           
          (b) if so—whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital. 
           
           
          
         
        (2) Where a court has made a determination under subsection (1), the court must: 
         
          
           
          (a) if the court has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person does not object to being detained in a hospital—order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or continue to be detained in a hospital, as the case requires; or 
           
           
          (b) otherwise—order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital, including a prison; for a period specified in the order, not exceeding the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed if the person had been convicted of the offence charged. 
           
           
          
         
        (3) The Attorney-General may, at any time, by order in writing, vary the hospital or other place of detention at which a person is detained under this section. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (4) Where, for urgent medical or security reasons, it becomes necessary to do so, an officer of the State or Territory in which a person is detained under this section may vary the hospital or other place of detention of that person but, where the officer does so, the officer must forthwith notify the Attorney-General, in writing, of the variation and of the reasons for the variation. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (5) Despite subsection (2), the court may, if in the court’s opinion it is more appropriate to do so than to make an order under subsection (2), order the person’s release from custody either absolutely or subject to conditions to apply for such period as the court specifies in the order, not exceeding 3 years. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (6) The conditions may include: 
         
          
           
          (a) a condition that the person remain in the care of a responsible person nominated in the order; and 
           
           
          (b) a condition that the person attend upon a person nominated, or at a place specified, in the order for assessment of the person’s mental illness, mental condition or intellectual disability and, where appropriate, for treatment; and 
           
           
          (c) any other condition that the court thinks fit. 
           
           
          
         
        (7) Where a person has been released from custody subject to conditions, the person or the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time, apply to the court to vary those conditions. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (8) Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will not become fit to be tried, within 12 months after the finding, the finding that there is, on the balance of probabilities, a prima facie 
          
        case for the commission of the offence charged acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person, in respect of the offence. 
         
          
           
          
         
        20BD Review by Attorney-General 
         
         
         
        (1) Where a court makes an order under subsection 20BC(2), the Attorney-General must, at least once in each period of 6 months after the day the person is detained under the order, consider whether or not the person should be released from detention. 
         
          
           
          
         
        (2) In considering whether the person should be released from detention the Attorney-General: 
         
          
           
          (a) must obtain and consider: 
           
           
           
            
            (i) a report from a duly qualified psychiatrist or psychologist; and 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) a report from another duly qualified medical practitioner; and 
            
           
           
          (b) may obtain and consider such other reports as the Attorney-General considers necessary; and 
           
           
          c) must take into account any representations made to the Attorney-General by the person or on the person’s behalf. 
           
           
          
         
        
       
      Determination as to unfitness 
       
      
    9 There is no doubt in the present matter that the issue as to the accused's unfitness to be tried has been raised in good faith. The Crown has quite properly agreed with the defence that the Court should undertake the present inquiry to determine fitness. The issue is to be determined on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    10 The test for assessing whether a person is unfit to be tried is that stated in R v Presser (1958) ALR 248. The Presser test was cited with approval by the High Court in Ngataya v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 108. It was applied in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230. See also Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1.  
     
      
    11 The gravamen of the Presser test is that the accused needs to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings and needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in the Court. He needs to be able to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him, and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge and to give instructions to his lawyers.  
     
      
       
      The Evidence 
       
      
    12 There are reports from both Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Bruce Westmore. Each of these gentlemen is a well-qualified and experienced psychiatrist. The reports of Dr Nielssen are dated 22 September 2005, 20 November 2007 and 12 February 2008.  
     
      
    13 In his first report, Dr Nielssen stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Sharrouf is a 21 year (old) disability pensioner with three young children. He was subjected to physical abuse by his father and was affected by his father's desertion of the family during his early teenage years. He reported that his early performance at school was normal. There was a history of conduct disorder in adolescence and he did not return to school after being expelled in year 9. There was a history of substance abuse in adolescence that may have contributed to the onset of mental illness. He reported some employment as a labourer, but none since the onset of mental illness three years ago.  
        
       
       
        
        Diagnosis of schizophrenia is made on the basis of the histories of typical symptoms of the illness, Mr Sharrouf's presentation at interview and the reports of his treating psychiatrist. He appears to have a fairly disabling form of the illness, in that it has resulted in significant impairment in his intellectual performance confirmed in psychological testing performed last year. Control of symptoms may have varied, depending on the dose of antipsychotic medication. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Sharrouf may also have developed epilepsy on the basis of the confirmed history of seizures in the last six months. Epileptic seizures are associated with exacerbations of symptoms of psychotic illness, particularly in the period after a seizure.” 
        
       
      
    14 Dr Nielssen recommended a treatment plan that would include continued close supervision. He suggested that the patient might need a higher dose of Olanzapine than 10 mgs per day.  
     
      
    15 Dr Nielssen saw the accused at his rooms shortly prior to his arrest in November 2005. He also spoke to the accused by AVL to Burwood Court in early March 2006. He then interviewed the accused on 16 November 2007 and provided a report dated 20 November 2007. For the purpose of this report, Dr Nielssen examined the Crown case statement and a summary of the overt acts provided by the Crown.  
     
      
    16 Dr Nielssen took a further history from the accused which revealed hallucinations and paranoid events particularly related to his experience in custody. The conclusion stated in the report was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of the symptoms reported by Mr Sharrouf and his presentation during the recent interview, I believe he is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his chronic mental illness. The further episode of illness is a direct consequence of ceasing treatment with antipsychotic medication some months ago. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Sharrouf reported hallucination of tastes, smells and visions that are often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. There was a history of treatment in hospital after what were thought to be epileptic seizures... 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Sharrouf is currently unfit for trial. The acute exacerbation of psychotic illness has resulted in gross impairment in all areas of intellectual function, in addition to the persecutory beliefs arising from the hallucinations. He would be unable to follow the proceedings or provide reliable instructions in what would clearly be a complex trial.” 
        
       
      
    17 Dr Nielssen recommended that the accused should be transferred to Long Bay Hospital for further investigation and intensive treatment with antipsychotic medication. He thought that, if the accused were to resume treatment, he should recover sufficiently to be considered fit for trial within three months.  
     
      
    18 The final report of Dr Nielssen was prepared following a further interview he had with the accused on 8 February 2008. Dr Nielssen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of the symptoms reported during the interview in November and alluded to by Mr Sharrouf during the recent interview, and his presentation during those interviews, I believe he is experiencing an acute exacerbation of the chronic mental illness schizophrenia...the further acute episode of illness was thought to be due to ceasing treatment with antipsychotic medication in the second half of 2007 and treatment with a relatively low dose of antipsychotic medication since his transfer to the MRRC... 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Sharrouf remains unfit for trial, as he has gross impairment of all areas of intellectual function that would prevent him from following the proceedings, or providing reliable instructions in what would be a very complex matter.” 
        
       
      
    19 Once again, Dr Nielssen recommended that the accused have treatment in a prison hospital. On this occasion, Dr Nielssen expressed the view that Mr Sharrouf's condition was generally amenable to treatment. He thought that there would be a reasonable prospect that, if treated appropriately, he would become fit for trial within twelve months.  
     
      
    20 Dr Westmore saw the accused on 12 March 2008. He has provided reports from 14 and 31 March and 3 April 2008. In the first of those reports Dr Westmore concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “This man appears to have an acute exacerbation of the illness schizophrenia. I have described his clinical presentation when I examined him on 12 March 2008. He appeared to be perplexed, confused and responding to possible auditory perceptual disturbances. I was not able to assess his thought content and cannot say whether he is delusional.  
        
       
       
        
        He provides a very limited history about himself and his current situation. He does not appear to understand the nature of the charges. If he is psychotic it is likely he is not able to plead to the charges or exercise his right of challenge. His presentation suggested he would not be able to understand the nature of the proceedings or to follow the course of the proceedings. Again, based on his clinical presentation, he would not be able to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given in support of the prosecution, nor could he make a defence or answer the charge.” 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Westmore thought that the accused needed to be transferred to a secure psychiatric unit, he considered that he needed monitoring and examination to determine any organic causes for his clinical presentation. Dr Westmore stated that the accused was currently not fit to be tried. He suggested that he might be forensically assessed within the next six months to determine what progress had been made. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the fitness issue 
       
      
    22 Both the Crown and Mr Brewer agreed, as did the psychiatrists, that the accused currently suffers from schizophrenia. It was common between the parties that, by reference to the established legal tests, the accused is not presently fit to stand trial.  
     
      
    23 In view of the material that has been placed before me, and the agreement of counsel in relation to the issue, I am prepared to find that the accused is presently unfit for trial. I stress that this finding is confined, as it must be, to an assessment of his mental health situation at this precise point of time. It says nothing as to his condition at any earlier point of time. 
     
      
    24 The medical evidence accepts that, at present, the accused does not understand the nature of the charge brought against him. It suggests that he would be unable presently to plead to the charge or exercise his right of challenge. It appears to be common ground that were the trial to proceed immediately, he would not understand the nature of the proceedings or be able to follow the course of the proceedings. In those circumstances, he would not be able to give instructions to his counsel or solicitor, nor would he be able to make a defence or have the ability to answer the charge.  
     
      
    25 I am satisfied, in accordance with the tests stated in R v Presser, that the accused is unfit for trial.  
     
      
       
      The second stage process – has a prima facie case been established?  
       
      
    26 I have set out above the provisions of s 20B(3)(b) of the Act. This second stage process requires the Court to determine whether there has been established a prima facie case that the accused committed the offence charged. I draw attention to sub-ss (6) and (7) of s 20B. These deal with the requirements for a finding that a prima facie case has been established.  
     
      
    27 In this regard a preliminary point has been taken by counsel for the accused. The point is this: The defence has argued that the Crown must lead its evidence in the normal way by calling witnesses and allowing the testing of evidence by way of cross-examination. At the very least, counsel argued a number of the Crown witnesses ought to be called and their evidence given in conventional fashion, as if at trial.  
     
      
    28 I am perfectly satisfied that s 20B of the Act, and the provisions of Division 6 generally, do not require that such a procedure be followed. First, what is at issue is whether the Court can be satisfied that a prima facie case has been established that the person committed the offence charged. The Court is not determining the guilt of the accused but is rather dealing with a well-known situation arising during a criminal trial, namely, the existence or otherwise of a prima facie case. It is a situation that also arises at the first stage of the committal process. (Section 62(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986: Wentworth v Rogers (1984) 2 NSWLR 422: (1984) 15 A Crim R 376 at 429, 440). 
     
      
    29 Secondly, s 20B(3) forms part of a legislative scheme enacted for the purposes of allowing the Court to contemplate the issue of fitness of an accused person; and, in particular, to deal with the situation of the accused after a finding of unfitness has been made. The clear purpose of the Division is to enable the Court to determine whether, and in what way, an accused should properly remain within the justice system where a finding of unfitness has been made.  
     
      
    30 Thirdly, it is clear from the language of ss 20B(3) and 20BA(4) that the Court is to move promptly through the various processes consequent upon a finding of unfitness. There is further support for the Crown contention in the fact that, where a person is found to be fit to be tried (and where the matter has come before the Court by way of reference from a Magistrate), the Court must remit the proceedings to the Magistrate's Court to enable committal proceedings to be continued ""as soon as practicable"".  
     
      
    31 Fourthly, it is not to be overlooked in the present matter that there has already been a determination by a Magistrate that a prima facie case could be established against the accused. Indeed, he has been committed for trial. This is not a consideration going directly to the construction of the relevant section but it has practical ramifications for the point at issue. There was, for example, no submission made by the accused's then representatives at the conclusion of the lengthy committal proceedings that the evidence fell below the level of requisite sufficiency.  
     
      
    32 Mr Pickin made three principal submissions. First, he argued that the language of s 20B(3), construed in the light of sub-ss (6) and (7), requires the Court to make a qualitative assessment of the weight of the prosecution evidence. Putting the argument another way, Mr Pickin submitted that s 20B(6) in particular, appears to extend the usual meaning of “prima facie case” to that of a determination in the context of whether the evidence would justify a committal for trial. This means, according to this suggested interpretation, that the legislation envisages a hearing where the evidence is to be tested, witnesses are to be heard, credibility is to be assessed and competing conclusions are to be analysed and assessed. Indeed, Mr Pickin argued that the Court would make an affirmative finding in respect of s 20B(3) only in a situation where there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. 
     
      
    33 Secondly, and essentially for the same reasons, Mr Pickin argued that, in a circumstantial case such as the present, the Court would be required to consider whether there were multiple competing or alternative conclusions open to the tribunal of fact; and would be required to assess the appropriate weight to be attached to each. Counsel argued that the most cogent method of assessing the weight of the evidence is to hear the witnesses on oath, as opposed to the mere tender of out of court statements. 
     
      
    34 Thirdly, the defence submitted that the historical fact of committal was of no material significance to the exercise of the Court’s determination under s 20(B). Mr Pickin submitted that the Court cannot substitute the Magistrate’s decision for its own. He also referred to the fact that, in the present matter, there may be a real question as to whether the committal was a nullity as a consequence of the Crown’s failure to obtain the Director’s relevant consent before it was heard. (This last proposition has now been put to rest by the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Baladjam & Ors v R [2008] NSWCCA 85 
     
      
    35 For all these reasons, it was submitted that a tender of a Statement of Facts, or proof by a similar procedure, was impermissible. 
     
      
    36 I shall deal with each of these submissions separately. The first appears to me to involve a misconception of the language of s 20B(3) and (6). Section 20B(3) is clear enough. The obligation on the Court is to determine whether there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence concerned. As I said earlier, this is a well-known concept. It is, for example, part of the ordinary committal procedure in New South Wales that is now contained in s 62(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (CPA 1986). Mr Pickin argued that this “prima facie” test is extended by the provision of s 20B(6) but, in my view, this argument unjustifiably distorts and extends the language of the relevant sub-section. 
     
      
    37 At the outset, it might be noted that the language of s 20B(6) does not require the Court to determine, to use Mr Pickin’s phrase, “whether the evidence would justify a committal for trial”. In New South Wales, the ultimate test, as to whether to commit or not, is contained in s 65(1) of the CPA 1986. It is clear that there is a considerable difference between determining, on the one hand, whether a prima facie case exists; and determining, on the other hand, whether there is a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury would convict the accused person of an indictable offence. Mr Pickin’s construction of the relevant section appears to fall somewhere between these two separate and distinct tests. 
     
      
    38 In reaching an opinion for the purposes of s 65 CPA 1986, there can be no doubt that a committing Magistrate is required to make a forecast or prediction of some kind of the outcome of the trial. This he or she must do upon all the evidence and must give attention to the weight and acceptability of the evidence in relation to the character of the evidence itself and the credibility of the witnesses who gave it: Saffron v DPP (1989) 16 NSWLR 397; 43 A Crim R 1. The Magistrate is not debarred from making his own assessment of the evidence and forming a view as to the credibility of witnesses as a basis for that opinion. 
     
      
    39 Here, however, the statutory position seems to me to be rather different. The precise task is to find whether a prima facie case has been established. Sub-section 6 requires the Court, in effect, to identify evidence that would (except for the circumstances by reason of which the person is unfit to be tried) provide “sufficient grounds” to put the person on trial in relation to the offence. Importantly, it is no part of the Court’s task to commit the person for trial. That, to my mind, is a complete answer to Mr Pickin’s submission. The task is two-fold. The evidence must first be identified. Secondly, it must be capable of establishing a prima facie case in the sense that it would, in terms of its capacity, provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence. If there is no such evidence, or if such evidence as there is does not have that capacity, the obligation is to dismiss the charge. What is critical is, first, the identification of evidence; and secondly an examination of its capacity, or its incapacity, to sustain the charge in the indictment. This does not require the Court to assess the credibility or reliability of any witness. The evidence is taken at its highest. 
     
      
    40 It is a different function than that ultimately entrusted to a committing Magistrate. By way of contrast, where under the Commonwealth legislation a committing Magistrate has referred the matter to the superior court under s 20B(1), and the superior court has found that the accused is fit to be tried, the matter then goes back to the committing Magistrate for a full and proper committal hearing. In the superior court, however, because there has been a finding of unfitness, the second stage of the process requires the Court to dismiss the charge unless the evidence to be relied on by the prosecution has the capacity to establish a prima facie case against the defendant. Where a prima facie case has been established (and the charge has not otherwise been dismissed), the Court must then determine whether the person will become fit to be tried within the 12-month period from the time unfitness was found. The clear legislative purpose is to remove an unfit defendant from the criminal justice system altogether, unless a prima facie case has been established. Even where a prima facie case has been established, the Court may dismiss the charge where, for example, it involves a trivial matter. 
     
      
    41 It is true that sub-s 7 sits somewhat oddly with the concept of demonstration of a prima facie case. I do not consider, however, that the provisions of sub-s 7 require the Court to do other than to determine whether there is a prima facie case against the defendant. The Court is required to take into account the evidence of a person or an unsworn statement he or she may make. The Court is also entitled to have regard to any defence that could properly be raised if the proceedings were a trial for that offence. This seems to me, whatever its ambit, to make it clear that what is occurring in the process is something that is not a trial for the offence, nor is it a committal for trial for the offence. It clear that the proceedings are not a trial because no question of guilt or innocence is determined. It is equally clear that the proceedings are not a committal for trial because the section does not require the Court to move forward to, and determine, the second limb of a committal proceeding, namely to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury would convict the accused person of the offence. In my view, the section stops well short of that requirement, and this is so notwithstanding the presence of sub-s 7. 
     
      
    42 Mr Pickin’s second argument is also answered by the same analysis. Gleeson CJ (in Saffron at 401 lines E to G) pointed out that it does not follow that simply because it is possible, looking at the objective circumstances established by the evidence in the case, to construct an hypothesis consistent with the innocence of an accused person, that the case is not one fit to go to a jury. As his Honour observed, that would entirely overlook the role of the jury in a criminal trial. Those observations carry even weight against the background of a search that must end in a finding of no greater dimension than the existence or otherwise of a prima facie case. 
     
      
    43 A further possible answer to both these arguments resides in the written submissions of the Crown. In short, the Crown submitted that a comparison of s 20B in the Commonwealth Crimes Act with comparable, but different provisions, in both the United Kingdom and New South Wales showed plainly that the present process is quite distinct to the procedures available in other jurisdictions. For example, the Crown referred to the special hearing provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. Let me take the New South Wales legislation to postulate, in short form, the Crown submission. 
     
      
    44 In New South Wales, upon a finding of unfitness being made, the Court is required to refer the accused person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. This Tribunal is then required to make a determination as to whether the person is likely to become fit within a period of 12 months. If such a determination is made, the Court is given consequential powers as to the detention of the accused in a Mental Health facility for a period not exceeding 12 months. If a contrary determination is made, the Court is required by the operation of s 19(2) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act to hold a special hearing. These provisions were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Svonaric [2001] 54 NSWLR 1. In that case Spigelman CJ and Sully J were in agreement that it was permissible, although not desirable, in such a hearing, for the substantive evidence in those criminal proceedings to be given by means of witness statements (Adams J did not agree with the Chief Justice and Sully J on this point). The Court did, in the ultimate, consider that an error had been made by the trial judge but the availability of such a procedure, in a special hearing, was found to exist. 
     
      
    45 The Crown in its submissions made the point that, by way of contrast with the present legislation, the express purpose for holding a special hearing, (as well as the use of the phrase (in s 19(2) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act) “prove to the requisite criminal standard of proof”), reflect a clear intention on the part of the New South Wales Parliament. This is that, subject to the provisions of the Evidence Act, formal trial procedures should generally apply to a special hearing. The Crown made the point, correctly in my view, that the Commonwealth legislation contains no equivalent provision in relation to the consequent procedure where unfitness is found. That is to say, the Commonwealth legislation does not, in any sense, indicate the presence of a similar parliamentary intention. Indeed, the Commonwealth procedure involves no higher level of determination other than whether there is a prima facie case. This finding, again by way of contrast with the New South Wales legislation, is not expressed to be for the purpose of ensuring an acquittal “unless the Crown case can be proven beyond reasonable doubt”. 
     
      
    46 As I say, I think there is a considerable degree of force in the Crown submission. But, in the ultimate, I prefer to base my decision on the clear language of s 20B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, and on the clear nature of the task entrusted to the Court in this second stage of the process. 
     
      
    47 As to Mr Pickin’s third point, I agree that the Court cannot, and should not, substitute the Magistrate’s committal decision for its own. The Court is required to perform the task set for it in s 20B(3) and it must do this. I fail to see however, why the Court cannot take into account the material relied upon by the committing Magistrate; and cannot take into account the basis on which the Magistrate has made a committal order. This seems to me to be permissible as a matter of commonsense and also because of the language of s 20B(7)(c). It would be wrong for the Court simply to rubber stamp the decision of the committing Magistrate. Equally, it would be an affront to commonsense to ignore the fact that a lengthy and extensive committal hearing has been held and that at the end of it, without demur by the defence as to jurisdiction or any other matter, the Magistrate made a committal order. It may be properly assumed that the Magistrate, prior to making a committal order, was satisfied that a prima facie case existed against the accused as well as against the other men. Indeed, as I understand it, no submission was made to the effect that a prima facie case had not been established. 
     
      
    48 I should also repeat that the suggestion that the committal proceedings may have been void or a nullity is a matter that was raised in separate argument in earlier proceedings before me. I gave a decision about this matter on 19 March 2008. The apparent question mark over the committal proceedings has, as I remarked earlier, been dispelled by the subsequent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    49 Overall, it seems to me that it cannot remotely be said that the determination of the prima facie case issue is, in any sense, a trial of the accused for the offence charged. Nor can it be said to be a committal procedure. For that reason, it does not seem to me that the Crown must bring forward “evidence” to establish a prima facie case, as if a trial were in progress.  
     
      
    50 What has to be shown is that there is evidence that would provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence. It is the capacity of that evidence to do so that is in issue. The Court has a broad power to seek any other evidence, whether oral or in writing, as it considers likely to assist in determining the matter, that is, the issue as to whether a prima facie case has been established; and whether, even if there be a prima facie case, the charge should be dismissed. For all these reasons, I consider that the preliminary argument should be resolved in favour of the Crown. 
     
      
       
      The test for a prima facie case 
       
      
    51 As I have said, the task facing the Court during this second stage process is to determine whether a prima facie case has been established against the accused. This is similar to the question, which sometimes arises during trial at the close of the Crown case. In that situation, the accused may ask the trial Judge to direct the jury to acquit on all or any of the counts in the indictment on the basis that there is no prima facie case. Whether there is a prima facie case is a question of law and the question is whether there is sufficient evidence upon which the accused may be convicted (May v O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654; (1955) ALR 671; Zanetti v Hill (1962) 108 CLR 433; (1963) ALR 165), that is whether there is evidence capable of proving each of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    52 A verdict of not guilty can only be directed if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty: Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207; 96 ALR 539. Where the Crown case is a circumstantial one, the trial Judge is to decide the question on the basis of such inferences that are reasonably open as are most favourable to the Crown and should not choose between the available inferences or direct an acquittal on the basis that other reasonable inferences are open: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. As to the position at committal; see Gleeson CJ in Saffron v DPP at 401 (E-G). 
     
      
    53 These principles appear to me to be generally applicable to the nature of the determination, which I have to make in the present matter. Of course, there is a difference in the fact that a verdict by direction is determined without the accused deciding whether to call evidence. Here, s 20B(7) enables the accused to give evidence or make an unsworn statement if he or she wishes to do so. Similarly, the accused may raise a defence that could properly be raised if the proceedings were a trial for that offence.  
     
      
    54 These extensions to the accused's entitlements, and to the Court's obligations sit, as I have said, somewhat oddly with the concept of a determination of a prima facie case. Indeed, they may be equally thought to sit oddly with the position of an accused who has been found unfit. But, nevertheless, they may be thought to have scope and meaning, particularly in relation to s 20BA(2). That, of course, is not their only function and I do not intend to limit the accused's entitlement in that way in this application. 
     
      
       
      The material relied on by the Crown 
       
      
    55 Essentially, the Crown has placed before the Court the prosecution brief of evidence; and the Crown case statement.  
     
      
    56 From all this, a narrative of the Crown evidence may be pieced together. It is a detailed narrative and I shall take some little time to set it out, albeit in summary form. It is not intended to be by any means exhaustive. This will entail an examination of the activities of the accused himself; his activities in association with his alleged co-conspirators; his activities in connection with persons beyond those who are alleged to be co-conspirators; and there will, in addition, be reference to actions alleged by the Crown to have been taken by the co-conspirators in the absence of the accused but in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy. In addition, there will be a brief summary of some of the instructional and other material accessed by the accused and his alleged co-conspirators on his and their computers; or otherwise located at their premises. It will be convenient to list some of these last mentioned matters at the outset. Throughout this section – the analysis of the evidence – I shall call the accused “Sharrouf” to distinguish him from the other men charged with the same offence.

    57 This section is taken from the Crown case Statement. It is however, supported by evidence and statements in the Crown brief. The following are examples of the nature of the instructional material accessed by the alleged conspirators and/or located at their premises.58 On 8 July 2004, a computer which was located at the premises of Khaled CHEIKHO accessed and downloaded from a website 3 documents in Arabic, as follows: 
     
      
    (a) a 1 page document showing Osama Bin LADEN and containing links to “military lessons, Jihad websites, Jihad chat rooms, scholars of Jihad and news”; 
     
      
    (b) a 1 page document containing “a few advices” inciting Muslims to engage in Jihad; and 
     
      
    (c) a 12 page document in Arabic containing instructions on various types of explosives (including the speed, force, ferocity and sensitivity of explosives), how to construct a detonator and manufacture improvised explosives from commonly available products.59 On 27 June 2005, during the execution of a search warrant upon ELOMAR’S vehicle and premises, the authorities seized 4 boxes of compressed hexamine and a USB memory stick which contained a 60 page document in Arabic entitled “The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two”. The document is in the form of a series of written lessons, accompanied by photographic illustrations of matters relating to the text and contains a session in the form of “Questions and answers”. The document contains step-by-step instructions on the manufacture of a series of chemical mixtures/specific explosives and detonating devices. It includes details and advice on: how to source ingredients or precursors, on chemical properties, on how to extract, prepare, store, dispose of and use the explosives described. It provides alternate ingredients and advises how these may be sourced from non-laboratory/scientific sources, such as chemist shops. The document outlines information about car bombs, with reference to “the Riyadh explosions” and “explosions in Bagdad”, and includes material from “one of the Jihadist Encyclopaedias” concerning placement of explosive devices and selection of targets for car bombs. 
    60 The document appears to be directed to a terrorist audience. For example, the writer asks: 
     
      
       
        
        “What exactly are you thinking of: an embassy a complex, terrorising? State what is your mind and hopefully I will try to answer it. As for now I am giving a general illustration as the specified target determines everything from directing the detonators to the amount required…”. 
        
       
      
      
    61 The document contains instructions for the manufacture of Tri-Acetone Tri-Peroxide (“TATP”) using various commercially available items, including hydrogen peroxide, sulphuric acid and acetone. The instructions and images relating to the manufacture of TATP found in this document were consistent with items obtained, or attempted to be obtained, by a number of the accused. The process of manufacturing TATP requires various chemicals to be cooled continuously while mixing. TATP must also be kept cool after manufacture. By relying on the recipe contained in the “The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two” and only using the chemicals and equipment sourced (or attempted to be sourced) by the accused, TATP could be manufactured.62 On 27 June 2005 also located during the execution of the search warrant on ELOMAR’S premises was a CD containing a 1,064 page document in Arabic. Moustafa CHEIKHO’s fingerprints were on the CD cover. The document is entitled “Security and Intelligence”. The document contains chapters including, “Security and Islam”, “Sabotage and Counter Espionage”, “Surveillance”, “Audio and Visual Taping”, “The Hierarchy of the Security Department of a Jihad Organisation”, “Secret Communication”, “Topography” and “The Primary Rules of Sabotage”. Again this document contains instructions relating to the manufacture and detonating of various improvised explosive devices. As with the previous document, it contains step-by-step instructions on how to manufacture explosives from commercially available products, with details and advice on how to source the ingredients, extract and prepare them for use. The requirements specify the use of beakers, thermometers, pipettes, etc. One of the types of explosive devices in these instruction is TATP. This document also provides instructions on how to manufacture Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (“HMTD”) using various commercially available items including hexamine, hydrogen peroxide and citric acid. 
    63 Both TATP and HMTD are highly sensitive explosives, which are relatively simple to manufacture, and specialist equipment, knowledge or experience is not required to do so. Following the instructions provided in these documents a person is capable of manufacturing both TATP and HMTD. Both TATP and HMTD could be manufactured using only the chemicals and equipment obtained or attempted to be obtained by the accused. 
    64 On 27 July 2005 and on 12 August 2005, ELOMAR’S niece Oula AWAD asked the authorities to return various items, including the USB drive (the item containing The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two). She said: “...and I really importantly need that memory card, I really need it, there is like um, my uncle has got stuff on it, drawing and that he has to submit it to people, that’s work for him”. The USB drive (which still contained The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two) was returned to ELOMAR on 19 August 2005. Upon the execution of a further search warrant at ELOMAR’S premises on 8 November 2005, the USB drive was seized again. Analysis of the USB drive showed that The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two had been removed on 19 August 2005. This was the only item deleted from the USB drive. 
    65 There is evidence from a Forensic Chemist that:  
     
      
       
      (a) the type of explosives capable of being produced from the chemicals obtained, or attempted to be obtained, by the accused fall into the category of “ 
      primary high explosives 
      ”; 
       
       
      (b) primary high explosives are explosives that may be readily initiated by heat, shock or friction to detonate; and 
      
      
       
      (c) the explosive effects of TATP and HMTD can cause death, serious injury, and/or result in damage or destruction to property. 
        
      
    66 The above documents are illustrations of very large number of instructions/documents/manuals, which were located in the possession of the accused. Such instructional material covered topics, which included the production and use of explosives, firearms and covert methods to thwart detection by the authorities, and dealing with the authorities in the event of detection or arrest. Where such instructional material was found on an accused’s computer or computers, invariably material of an extremist nature was also found on that computer or computers. Other examples of such instructional material include the following: 
     
      
      (a) A document showing a diagram of an electrical circuit involving a mobile phone and explosive material was found on Moustafa CHEIKHO’S computer. This document was obtained through a Jihadi forum website which invites the reader to have a look at a way to explode objects by using an Ohmmeter and a mobile telephone. 
       
      (b) A document providing specific instructions on how to make the following explosive devices: Molotov cocktails, eagle fireballs, eagle cocktails, towed charge, pole charge, and satchel charge. This document was found on HASAN’S computer. In order to construct some of these devices, the document states that it is necessary to know how to prime charges electrically and non-electrically. 
      
      
       
      (c) A document providing information on how to construct an M14 Antipersonnel Mine was found on HASAN’S computer. 
       
      
    (d) Document identifying the 11 steps required to prepare a non-electric firing system was found on HASAN’S computer. This document refers to the non electric firing system in the context of demolition work such as breaching minefields, breaching wire obstacles, clearing landing zones, blowing holes in walls of buildings and blowing down trees to create obstacles. 
     
      
    (e) A number of documents relating to surveillance tactics was found at Khaled CHEIKHO’S premises. This included a book entitled: “The Layman’s Guide to Electronic Eavesdropping: how it’s done and simple ways to prevent it” by Tom Larsen. [This book was also located at Moustafa CHEIKHO’S premises]; 
     
      
    (f) A video containing instructions on how to build and detonate a remote anti-personnel explosive device was found at Sharrouf’s premises. 
     
      
    (g) Material in the form of a number of “lessons”, apparently for the training of someone to join the “military organisation” of an Islamic group to undertake militant Jihad. The lessons covered topics such as “Training”, “Weapons: measures related to buying and transporting them”, “Special Tactical Operations” (which include “assassinations, bombing and demolition”), and “Kidnapping and Assassinations Using Rifles and Pistols” (with detailed instructions on the use of various firearms), “Interrogation and investigation at prison and detention centres”. This material was found at Sharrouf’s premises stapled inside the cover of a booklet entitled “Choice Islamic Stories” [for children] distributed by the Islamic Welfare Centre, which appeared to have replaced the original contents of the booklet. [Khaled CHEIKHO’S fingerprints were located on several pages of the document.] 
     
      
    (h) A VHS Cassette Tape entitled “Sheikh Osama’s Training Course” and a document entitled “Lessons by Al-Qaeda and Taliban in the art of hitting and frightening the Americans” was found on a computer at TOUMA’s premises. 
     
      
    (i) Audio and video files displaying the beheading and execution of Westerners and other captives, attacks on the forces of the United States of America (US) and the Coalition in Iraq, images and desecration of dead soldiers, bombings of buildings and vehicles with Islamic chants and cheers and images of deceased martyrs found at MULAHALILOVIC’S premises. Other items found included songs and speeches urging Muslims to engage in militant Jihad including the killing of “disbelievers”; “Treaties in getting prepared for Jihad” and audio files which include discussing the manufacture and detonation of car bombs. 
     
      
    (j) Military documents relating to sniper training were found on JAMAL’S computer. A number of documents relating to sniper weapons and training, and images of snipers were located on HASAN’S computer. 
     
      
    (k) A number of training documents on topics including the manufacture of silencers for firearms, making grenades and mines, “electronics, explosives and poisons” and “explosives engineering” were found on a thumb drive located at the premises of ELOMAR. 
     
      
    (l) An instructional article relating to the kidnapping of nationals of a “hostile country” as part of Jihad was found on BALADJAM’S computer. A number of other documents relating to sniper weapons, physical training and survival skills in the context of military operations were also found. 
     
      
    67 There is evidence that the alleged conspirators shared extremist/instructional material. A number of them had the same items. 
     
      
       
      Analysis of the evidence and the Crown case statement 
       
       
      (b)  
      Activities of the accused men “in furtherance of the conspiracy 
       
      
    68 I propose to summarise a number of alleged details of the accuseds’ activities. These are actions or words alleged by the Crown to be relevant to the existence of the conspiracy or in furtherance of the conspiracy. The summary, once again, is not intended to be exhaustive. There are a number of unresolved arguments relating to these issues in which the defence and Crown submissions have not been completed. There are others where argument has not been heard. In addition, the determination as to whether actions are capable of being regarded as acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy awaits decision at a later time. For those reasons, reference to any of those matters in the following summary is not to be taken as an acceptance or rejection of the unresolved arguments. Nor is it a determination of the question as to whether the acts were done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Indeed, this is not a fact-finding exercise at all. For that reason the following narrative is not intended to reflect any factual findings as to the activities of the various accused. It is not intended to reflect any view of the evidence. All the accused have, as does Sharrouf, the presumption of innocence is their favour. The present exercise is confined to an examination of the statements and evidence in the Crown brief, against the background of the Crown Case Statement, to identify the evidence capable of establishing a prima facie case against Sharrouf. I have placed the evidence into narrative form to make this part of the decision manageable and intelligible. 
     
      
    69 I turn now to set out in summary form a broadly chronological narrative. The starting point is the alleged activity of one of the co-conspirators, Moustafa Cheikho in attending a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) training camp in Pakistan in September and October 2001. The Crown case is that this gentleman underwent physical, religious and firearm training as part of the preparation for undertaking jihad. LeT was proclaimed as a terrorist organisation for the purposes of the Criminal Code Act on 8 November 2003. This evidence is admissible only against Moustafa Cheikho. It is not admissible against Sharrouf. 
     
      
    70 I move now to approximately the middle of 2004. The narrative begins in this year with purchases by Abdul Rakib Hasan (Hasan) of large quantities of camping equipment. Apparently he told those at the shop that he was buying for a youth group and he gave his name as “Rick”. Hasan also purchased maps covering various areas within two to three hours drive from Sydney using an expired membership card with a post office address at Lakemba. In July 2004 Hasan and another person made inquiries at Dick Smith Electronics at Bankstown. The inquiries were about the purchase of CB radio scanners and about night vision equipment.  
     
      
    71 On 9 August 2004 Khaled Cheikho was overheard during a telephone conversation talking about glycerine and information he had been told by his nephew. (Material downloaded from his computer included instructions for preparing the explosive nitro glycerine.)  
     
      
    72 (Much later, in September 2005, an order for 20 litres of glycerine was to be placed by Jamal with Chemical Cleaning Solutions).  
     
      
    73 In August 2004 there commenced negotiations and conversations with Haines Educational Pty Limited, a secondary school science supplier based in Victoria. Hasan's wife asked for one of the company’s catalogues and gave a post office address in Lakemba. The catalogue included laboratory equipment (instructions for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices were accessed by various of the accused, including the use of laboratory equipment).  
     
      
    74 Later, on 23 February 2005, Sharrouf, in the company of others, discussed ordering laboratory equipment from Haines. In fact, an order was placed with the company on 2 June 2005. The order was sent by fax from Sayers Road Pharmacy at Hoppers Crossing, Victoria. This pharmacy was located a short distance from the premises of one Joud, allegedly an associate of the conspirators, although not one of them. The order was in the name of ""Peter Dravjic"". The fax was typed and contained an order for 55 different types of items. The items would have cost over $2,900.  
     
      
    75 On 22 June 2005 a handwritten list of these items, with the Haines code numbers and quantities required, was found at Joud's premises during the execution of a search warrant. The contents of the list correlated with discussions that had previously occurred between Hasan, Elomar, Sharrouf, Joud, and one Benbrika as to what items were to be ordered and the quantities of those items. The document was in the handwriting of Elomar. Hasan's and Joud's fingerprints were found on the document. There was also written reference to “Adam George” and to a mobile telephone in the false name “Adam Sharp”. 
     
      
    76 There was a later follow-up call in relation to the Haines order from a male who gave a telephone number. This phone had been activated on 14 June 2005 in a false name “Anfony Commito”. The receipt for this telephone was later located at Hasan's premises on 27 June 2005. On 15 June 2005, the sales attendant from Haines attempted to contact the number without success. The order was never filled. 
     
      
    77 On 17 September 2004 an earlier search warrant had been executed at Joud's residence in Victoria. Among other things found there were instructions on the manufacture of IEDs, firearms and other weapons. There were also instructions on the storage of weapons and ammunition using PVC pipes and their being sealed with PVC cement.  
     
      
    78 On 21 October 2004 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and another person. They were discussing a television program on terrorism. Sharrouf said ""Let the people accept that we're this, but we're doing it for a proper cause, you know"".  
     
      
    79 On the weekend commencing 5 December 2004 Joud and two other men from Melbourne travelled to Sydney. The next day Benbrika travelled to Sydney. Some of the men attended a barbecue at Sharrouf’s house on 5 December and on the next day, after visiting a camping store, all of the men spent the afternoon at his home. Hasan was also present.  
     
      
    80 On 29 December 2004 there was a telephone conversation between Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf relating to the former downloading “about a thousand lessons” from a website associated with an imprisoned Cleric Abu Hamza.  
     
      
    81 On 10 January 2005 arrangements were made for one of the Melbourne men to book Sharrouf's travel from Sydney to Melbourne. Later that day Sharrouf flew to Melbourne, using a false name. The trip was paid for with a credit card in the name of Tannous.  
     
      
    82 Sharrouf then visited Benbrika at his residence. Their conversations were captured by listening device. The conversations were, the Crown said, of an extremist nature.  
     
      
    83 On the next day there was a conversation between Sharrouf and Hasan, during which the former indicated an awareness of the possibility of ASIO intercepting their conversations.  
     
      
    84 On 27 January 2005 Elomar purchased a considerable amount of ammunition from the Horsley Park Gun Shop. He gave a telephone number that ultimately was not able to be contacted. Elomar attended this shop on a number of occasions over the next few months. He purchased at least two rifles. He always paid cash.  
     
      
    85 On 23 February 2005 Hasan and Sharrouf drove down to Melbourne to visit Benbrika. Joud was there as well. Their discussions included CDs and books dealing with martyrdom operations and “a guide for the mujahideen”. A listening device picked up Benbrika saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Everyone has to prepare himself. Or to die or to be gaoled...but we have to be careful. If we want to die for jihad, we do maximum damage. Damage their buildings with everything and damage their lives just to show them that's what we're waiting for. You be careful. Trust no-one.""  
        
       
      
    86 It was during this meeting that there was further discussion about the purchase of laboratory equipment from Haines. Sharrouf returned to Sydney that night.  
     
      
    87 On 27 February 2005 there was a telephone call by Hasan to Benbrika. This was from a public telephone in Sydney. Later Benbrika told Joud to ""leave him out of it from now on"".  
     
      
    88 A telephone service had been activated on the previous day, 26 February 2005, in the false name of Eviki Soto - 64 Liverpool Street, Liverpool. (This telephone was later used to book a camping trip at Curranyalpa). The handset used with this mobile telephone was located at Jamal's premises during the execution of a search warrant on 9 December 2005. Another mobile telephone number, 0410-735-241, was stored in the memory of the first mobile under the name ""George"". That second telephone number had been activated on 28 September 2005 using the false name of ""George Markis"". This telephone was to be used by Hasan and Jamal on later occasions.  
     
      
    89 There was another mobile telephone 0401-089-268. This was connected in the false name ""Adam Sharp"". This telephone was also used by Hasan later and the number was handwritten on the back of the ""Haines list"" located at Joud's premises.  
     
      
    90 On 28 February 2005 there was a meeting at Touma's house attended by Sharrouf, Hasan and Sharrouf's brother. They also met later that evening.  
     
      
    91 On 2 March 2005 there was a conversation between Sharrouf and Touma, during which Touma indicated his reluctance to talk over the telephone.  
     
      
    92 On 3 March 2005 there was a night meeting organised between Sharrouf and Touma.  
     
      
    93 On 5 March 2005 Touma, while speaking to Jamal on the telephone, indicated that he had just found a tracking device under his van. Touma later arranged to meet with Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho. He also made a call to his wife, in which he discussed the item he had found under his van. He asked his wife whether she had been followed home that day.  
     
      
    94 On two occasions, (16 to 18 March 2005; and 12 to 14 April 2005) various of the accused, and three Melbourne men, attended shooting and camping trips. Both camps were in remote locations. They were booked under a false name, were booked using mobile telephones obtained in a false name and the participants, despite requests to do so, failed to complete the necessary paperwork. The Crown case is that, it may be inferred, that these camping trips were part of “training” being undertaken by Sharrouf and his co-conspirators in preparation for undertaking jihad.  
     
      
    95 The first camp occurred as I have said, between 16 and 18 March 2005. A few days earlier a number of calls had been made from two mobiles to Inland Hunting Properties. The first mobile number had been connected on 31 January 2005 in the false name of Mark Johnson. The second mobile telephone was the mobile connected in the false name of Eviki Soto.  
     
      
    96 On 14 March 2005 a rural property, Curranyalpa, 56 kilometres south of Louth and 140 kilometres southwest of Bourke was booked. The bookings were made under the false name of Adam Georges. The person who identified himself by this name said that he wanted to take his father and uncles fishing and that he was the only hunter in the group. (Moustafa Cheikho had used the name Adam Georges when connecting a landline telephone. This name was also handwritten on the Haines order list located at Joud's premises on 22 June 2005. Moustafa Cheikho used the name “George” when making certain inquiries with Soul Pattinson Pharmacy in Menai on 9 June 2005.)  
     
      
    97 On 14 March three of the Melbourne group travelled by car to Sydney. They stayed at a hotel at Casula.  
     
      
    98 On 15 March a receipt for the deposit paid for the country trip was faxed to Inland Hunting Properties. The deposit slip in the name ""A Georges"" had Khaled Cheikho's fingerprint on it.  
     
      
    99 During the evening of 15 March 2005 Sharrouf, Hasan, Khaled Cheikho and the three Melbourne men left Sydney and travelled in convoy to the country property. It appears that Elomar was there as well, as DNA of his was located on a drink can found buried at the camp site. Cartridges located at the camp site were fired using a weapon located at Elomar's premises during the execution of a search warrant.  
     
      
    100 On 20 March 2005 police attended the camp site at Curranyalpa and seized a number of items, including spent cartridges, bullets, a battery and sparkplugs which had been burnt, and a number of empty drink cans, food wrappings, et cetera. There was evidence to suggest that a number of bullets had been fired at various tree trunks.  
     
      
    101 On 24 March there were conversations between Touma and Baladjam, apparently of an extremist nature.  
     
      
    102 On 1 April 2005 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Moustafa Cheikho, during which they discussed burning CDs, which depicted ""slaughtering"" in Iraq. Later that day there was a further telephone conversation, during which Cheikho warned Sharrouf not to drive because ""There are pigs outside. I saw them now."" 
     
      
    103 Between 5 April 2005 and 3 June 2005 there were an extensive number of telephone calls between Touma and George Lord arranging for Touma to purchase a large amount of ammunition. I will not attempt to summarise the details of these telephone conversations. There were also conversations between Touma and Lord relating to the making of a device, which would cause an explosion. See, for example, a telephone call on 9 April 2005. 
     
      
    104 During this same period, there were meetings between Touma and a number of the other alleged co-conspirators. Sharrouf, for example, invited Touma to attend a family celebration on 11 April and various of the men met that day at 34 Kent Street. 
     
      
    105 On 25 April 2005 Touma made inquiries about copper pipes used on building sites. Touma made these inquiries stating that he was on a job site and needed the information for this purpose. (During the later execution of a search warrant at Touma's premises on 8 November 2005 four lengths of copper pipe (three with one end crimped - closed) were located.) Also located was a plastic box with two bottles with gunpowder inside. There were 13 rounds of ammunition cut in half and the gunpowder removed; (see also a document in Arabic on CD found at Elomar's premises on 27 June 2005 containing details for an explosive pipe filled with gunpowder and other materials). 
     
      
    106 On 2 June 2005 there were discussions between Touma and Khaled Cheikho and later a discussion between Sharrouf and Touma. 
     
      
    107 On 3 June 2005 Touma made final arrangements to collect the ammunition from Lord. Baladjam and Touma went to Lord's house and loaded boxes of ammunition into Touma's van. The house was at 95 Griffiths Street, Punchbowl. A short time later Touma and Baladjam abruptly drove off in Baladjam's vehicle, leaving the ammunition van parked outside Lord's premises. There was a further telephone conversation between Touma and Lord relating to the number of boxes that had been available for collection. 
     
      
    108 On 3 June 2005, at approximately 1.30pm, police approached Touma's van outside the Punchbowl address. They found fifteen boxes of ammunition containing 7,500 rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm calibre ammunition. This type of ammunition is used in SKS or AK-47 type semiautomatic weapons. 
     
      
    109 Police interviewed Touma on 15 June 2005 in relation to the ammunition. He claimed he was simply holding it on Lord's behalf for a short period of time because Lord was locked out of his house. In the afternoon, after the ammunition had been found, Touma called Khaled Cheikho. 
     
      
    110 (There is evidence that others of the alleged conspirators attempted to purchase ammunition. For example, Baladjam attempted to purchase 20,000 rounds of the same type of ammunition from the Condell Park Gun Shop in late July 2005. Earlier, in January 2005, Elomar had attempted to purchase 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the Horsley Park Gun Shop. In fact, on 27 June 2005, during the execution of a search warrant at Elomar's premises, 12,000 rounds of the same type of ammunition was located. There was other ammunition there as well.) 
     
      
    111 I have moved somewhat away from the chronological narrative. I shall now return to it. There was a second camping trip that took place between 12 and 14 April 2005 at a property named Mulga Creek Station. This was located approximately 70 kilometres southeast of Bourke. 
     
      
    112 On 6 April 2005, there had been a telephone call to Inland Hunting Properties from a person identifying himself as ""Andrew Scott"". He provided the contact details of 56 Marion Street, Georges Hall; mobile telephone number 0423-203-794. (This mobile had been connected on 1 April 2005 in the false name of Andrew Scott). The address did not exist. The handset used to contact the booking company was the same handset used in the booking of Curranyalpa. That handset was also used with a telephone number activated in another false name (Tom Clincley) used by Khaled Cheikho in communications with Elomar. 
     
      
    113 ""Andrew Scott"" stated that he wanted to camp on the property and that there would be four people going. On 7 April 2005 a deposit of $95 was paid for the booking at the Bankstown branch of the Commonwealth Bank. The signature on the deposit slip was ""A. Scott"". Under the name for the account holder was written ""M. Chi"", which was crossed out and the name of the account holder entered. The deposit slip had Moustafa Cheikho's fingerprint on it. 
     
      
    114 On 12 April two four wheel drive vehicles arrived at Mulga Creek Station. It appears that Hasan, Touma, Elomar and the two Cheikhos attended. It does not appear that Sharrouf was in attendance on this trip. The owner of the property and another man spoke to the group that day. One of the campers introduced himself to the owner, Mr Fairey as ""Andrew Scott"" and did most of the talking. He was later identified as Khaled Cheikho. 
     
      
    115 At the conclusion of the camping trip police examined the camp site at Mulga Creek and found a number of fired cartridges and other items. (The .308 rifle located during the execution of a search warrant on Elomar's premises on 27 June 2005 matched shell casing - spent cartridges located at both Curranyalpa and Mulga Creek.) 
     
      
    116 On 4 May 2005 Sharrouf, Hasan and Elomar travelled to Melbourne and later attended Benbrika's residence on a number of occasions before departing for Sydney on 5 May 2005. There was further discussion about the ordering of laboratory equipment from Haines during these visits. In particular, there was a discussion between Hasan and Elomar about the items they needed to order. The discussions were consistent with an item found on the list at Joud's house on 22 June 2005. 
     
      
    117 On 8 May 2005 Sharrouf, Khaled Cheikho, Hasan and another person had a conversation of an extremist nature while in a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    118 On 15 May 2005 Hasan telephoned a person he knew from a halal butchery at Lakemba and asked him about the possibility of hiring a place to go for hunting. This telephone call was made on the “Adam Sharp” telephone, which had been activated on 2 April 2005. 
     
      
    119 On 26 May 2005 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and another man, during which they discussed CDs, including one, which dealt with the detonation of an explosive in a car. 
     
      
    120 On 9 June 2005 Moustafa Cheikho, using the name ""George"", ordered 24x400 ml bottles of six percent hydrogen peroxide solution from a Soul Pattinson pharmacy in Menai. He provided a mobile number, which had been connected two days earlier. A $10 deposit was left and on 13 June 2005 a man collected the order. He was, in general terms, partially identified as Moustafa Cheikho by the person who had served the customer. The balance of the purchase money was paid in cash. 
     
      
    121 (On 18 August 2005 New South Wales Police seized 24x400 ml bottles of six percent hydrogen peroxide solution stored on public land directly behind the residence of Sharrouf. The hydrogen peroxide was on the dirt embankment directly behind the fence. There were two boxes. The bottles found there were of the same number, size and brand as those that had been purchased from the Soul Pattinson pharmacy at Menai and collected by Moustafa Cheikho on 13 June 2005.) 
     
      
    122 In late June there were various search warrants executed. There was the warrant at Joud's premises mentioned earlier. There was a warrant executed at Hasan's premises. Seized during the execution of this warrant were the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) a box of hexamine, 
         
         
        (b) a document relating to industrial thermometers, and 
         
         
        (c) a receipt for the mobile telephone purchased from Strathfield Car Radios connected in the false name of “Commito”. 
        
       
      
    123 There was also a search warrant executed at Elomar's premises. This produced the USB stick containing instructions in Arabic for the manufacture of explosives, to which I have made reference earlier. There were also seized four boxes of hexamine, firearms and ammunition. 
     
      
    124 On 27 June there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Joud, discussing the raids on premises that had occurred both in Sydney and Melbourne. The conversation included a reference to Sharrouf’s concerns about phone tapping. 
     
      
    125 On 20 July 2005 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Joud, during which the accused indicated that he did not want to mention the name of a ""brother"" on the phone. 
     
      
    126 On 25 July 2005 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf, Atik and Benbrika, during which there was a discussion about people who give information to the government. 
     
      
    127 On 26 July 2005 Hasan and another man went to a store in Marrickville. Various laboratory type equipment was ordered and paid for by Hasan in cash. Hasan and Vetter returned to the store months later on 18 October 2005 but no purchase was made on this later occasion. 
     
      
    128 On 26 July 2005 Benbrika came to Sydney and stayed overnight with the accused. Hasan, Elomar, Jamal and other persons met with Benbrika at Sharrouf's residence. 
     
      
    129 On 27 July 2005 there was a further extremist conversation captured between Sharrouf, Benbrika and other persons in the car. 
     
      
    130 On 28 July 2005 Benbrika and Jamal drove from Sydney to Melbourne. 
     
      
    131 During late July 2005 Baladjam and a friend went to the Condell Park Gun Shop and asked about purchasing approximately 20,000 rounds of ammunition. No firm order was placed. 
     
      
    132 On 15 August 2005 Baladjam telephoned the gun shop and inquired about orders of ammunition that he said had been placed about four weeks earlier. The operator of the shop informed Baladjam that the ammunition had not arrived. 
     
      
    133 On 31 July 2005 Sharrouf picked up Jamal and Benbrika from Sydney domestic terminal. Sharrouf drove them to the ASJA Prayer Hall. Hasan and Elomar were there as well. During this visit, Benbrika went to Sharrouf's residence and gave a sermon. There were extremist discussions during this visit. 
     
      
    134 On 4 August 2005 Benbrika telephoned Sharrouf to tell him to watch The 7.30 Report. There was an interview with Benbrika that night, in which Benbrika praised jihad, spoke highly of Osama bin Laden and deprecated religions other than Islam. 
     
      
    135 On 5 August 2005 there was a discussion between Sharrouf and Adam Houda, solicitor, in which they discussed Benbrika and his views. On the same day there was a discussion between Sharrouf and his brother about collecting “magazines” that night. Later there was also a conversation between Sharrouf and Touma, expressing extremist views about the role that America played in the Middle East, et cetera: 
     
      
       
        
        “Forget Australian law...Australian law, get stuffed, finished...give us all back our passports we'll leave. I swear to God I will be the first one to get out of this stuffed up country. Sons of dogs...listen here, I swear I'd rather be locked up and tortured and everything in a Muslim country rather than be locked up one day in this country."" 
        
       
      
    136 On 11 August 2005 Sharrouf, during a meeting with Benbrika, discussed a video interview with Sheikh Omran. 
     
      
    137 On 22 August 2005, Joud telephoned Sharrouf. The latter asked Joud about obtaining his videos because ""a lot of brothers wanna watch 'em"".  
     
      
    138 On 23 August 2005 there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho, during which they discussed an imprisoned Muslim Cleric and how people were hypocrites for not adhering to his views.  
     
      
    139 On 25 August 2005, a search warrant was executed at Sharrouf's premises at 11 Bradley Crescent, Wiley Park. A number of items were seized, including a computer hard drive. Examination of the hard drive revealed, as I have earlier indicated, a video containing instructions as to how to build and detonate a remote antipersonnel explosive device; 
     
      
       
        
        (a) a file depicting the ambush of US soldiers; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a file depicting various violent scenes from Iraq; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) various files containing material related to jihad.  
        
       
      
    140 (The video referred to above is a step-by-step guide to the construction of an IED containing metal shrapnel. The steps in the video include the use of explosives comprising ""uric nitrates...mixed with nitroglycerol."")  
     
      
    141 During the execution of this search warrant, Jamal and the two Cheikhos arrived at the premises in Jamal's vehicle.  
     
      
    142 On 27 August 2005, using the telephone connected in the false name of Commito, Hasan contacted Techni Ice, a Victorian company which specialised in the distribution of ice packs and ice boxes. Hasan made inquiries about purchasing an ice-box and asked for details and the catalogue. Eventually he asked that the material be sent to Post Office Box 120 Lakemba 2195.  
     
      
    143 (The Crown case is that the documents containing instructions for the manufacture of TATP and HMTD include that the process of manufacture requires various chemicals to be cooled while mixing and kept cool after manufacture.)  
     
      
    144 On 28 August 2005, there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Atik discussing the raid by ASIO. Sharrouf asked Atik to send him a phone card.  
     
      
    145 On 1 September 2005, there was a conversation between Sharrouf and Touma, in which there was mention of ""20 grand"" being brought around.  
     
      
    146 Later that day Sharrouf travelled in company with Hasan, Elomar and Jamal from Sydney in Hasan's Tarago van, apparently to support Benbrika after he was allegedly bashed. They arrived in Melbourne in the early hours of 2 September and went to Benbrika's house before spending a number of hours in a hotel.  
     
      
    147 On 1 September 2005, Baladjam had gone to a firing range in Bankstown for shooting practice.  
     
      
    148 On 5 September 2005, there was a telephone conversation between Lord and Touma discussing obtaining ""drums"" of ammunition.  
     
      
    149 On 8 September 2005, there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho, during which they discussed Muslim extremist beliefs in the context of discussions they had participated in during Internet chat room sessions.  
     
      
    150 On 8 September 2005, Baladjam went to the Horsley Park Gun Shop, where he purchased a conversion kit to convert a 9 mm pistol to a .22 calibre. (A .22 calibre Beretta pistol was located at Moustafa Cheikho's premises during the execution of a search warrant on 8 November 2005.) 
     
      
    151 On the same day there were discussions between Sharrouf and other of the defendants about mujahideen material on CDs and the Internet. There were further such conversations on 14 and 15 September 2005.  
     
      
    152 On 16 September, there was a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho, during which they discussed communicating by Internet chat room.  
     
      
    153 On 18 September, there was further conversation between Touma and Lord about the purchase of 45 litre drums of white paint (the Crown says this was a conversation about ammunition).  
     
      
    154 On 19 September, there was a conversation between Touma and Khaled Cheikho about how to communicate with one another by use of a private chat room (Paltalk).  
     
      
    155 On 20 September 2005, there was a telephone conversation between Baladjam and another person discussing the purchase of surveillance equipment. That evening, Touma telephoned Lord and asked ""Did you get everything?"" When Lord replied that he had, Touma told him that he would come past.  
     
      
    156 On 22 September 2005, Baladjam was the subject of surveillance. He was observed using an ATM machine in Auburn and making telephone calls from a public telephone box in Pendle Hill.  
     
      
    157 Later, he entered the Soul Pattinson pharmacy at Pendle Hill and purchased 3 x by 400 ml bottles of six percent hydrogen peroxide (located on 8 November 2005 during the execution of a search warrant at Baladjam's premises was a ""to do"" list which included a reference to peroxide). Baladjam told the shop assistant ""It's for my grandmother"".  
     
      
    158 Baladjam then drove or manoeuvred his car in an unusual fashion for the next ten minutes, ultimately parking at Toongabbie. He went into the Soul Pattinson chemist shop at Toongabbie and purchased another three bottles of hydrogen peroxide. Again, he drove in an unusual fashion, the Crown case being that this was done for the purpose of counter-surveillance.  
     
      
    159 On 22 and 23 September, there were conversations between Sharrouf and Moustafa Cheikho, and later Benbrika, concerning chat room conversations to discuss jihad and Islamic teachings.  
     
      
    160 On 24 September, Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho discussed downloading extremist material from the Internet. There were further discussions on 26 September between Sharrouf and Jamal on the same topic.  
     
      
    161 On 28 September 2005 Jamal and Hasan attended Auto King, an automotive parts retailer in Punchbowl. Orders were placed for the following items: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) 10 x 20 litre drums of 45% strength sulphuric acid; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 5 x 10 litres of distilled water; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 12 x 1.5 litres of distilled water. 
        
       
      
    162 The Crown case is that it was Jamal who made the initial request for battery acid (sulphuric acid). Initially he requested 20 litres, but then while the owner was on the telephone to his supplier, he requested much more. Jamal did most of the talking in the shop, although Hasan was also involved in the discussions. As to the strength of the sulphuric acid, Jamal requested ""the more concentrated, the better"". He told the owner that he wanted the acid because he had in mind a second-hand battery business. He said that his name was “Adam” and when asked where he came from, he said ""Jordan"".  
     
      
    163 The owner requested a deposit and Hasan provided $200 in cash. Jamal was asked for his contact details and provided a mobile telephone number, which was connected in a false name “Sarah Saavri”. This service had been connected on 7 January 2005 in the false name. The Crown case is that it was used by Jamal on other occasions. Having given this number, Jamal, according to the Crown case, briefly left the store, returned and provided a second mobile telephone number 0410735241. This was a mobile telephone that had been connected that day in a false name, the name being “George Markis”.  
     
      
    164 On 28 September 2005 Auto King placed the order for the distilled water with another organisation and it was supplied that day. Auto King also placed the order for sulphuric acid with its supplier, a business called Autoquip. The orders having been placed, the owner of Auto King later attempted to contact the two men who had placed the order, using the two telephone numbers provided. Despite repeated attempts on that day and others, neither telephone was answered. Between 28 September and 13 October 2005, the Crown case is that on a number of occasions Jamal attended Auto King enquiring about the order, repeating a phrase like, or similar to, ""I need it"".  
     
      
    165 To return to the 28 September 2005, later on that day the Crown case is that Jamal attended Chemical Cleaning Solutions, a commercial chemical supplier at Campsie, where he enquired about the purchase of certain chemicals. He was told that he would have to place an order and pay a deposit. He then left the store, but returned a few minutes later and placed an order in the name of George Markis. He provided the telephone number 0410735241 and paid the deposit of $150. It will be recalled that this telephone number was one of the telephone numbers provided earlier that day to Auto King in relation to the attempted purchase of sulphuric acid. The order placed with Chemical Cleaning Solutions was for: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) 200 litres of 98% methylated spirits; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 50 litres of hydrochloric acid; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 25 kilograms of citric acid; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) 20 litres of glycerine.  
        
       
      
    166 When placing the order Jamal is said to have told the sales person that he wanted the chemicals because his uncle had a cleaning company, although he was not able to give the name of that company; and that the chemicals were going to be used for cleaning. The order, however, was never collected. Attempts to contact him on the telephone number he had supplied were unsuccessful.  
     
      
    167 On 28 September 2005 the Crown case is that Hasan, using the name Adam, attended Peter's Hardware at Greenacre. He ordered 60 litres of acetone for a cost of $415. He paid a deposit of $110 in cash and was given a receipt. The owner of the store, however, ordered from his supplier a lesser amount of acetone, which was covered by the deposit, and not the 60 litres ordered by Hasan. Hasan gave a telephone number and it was the number 0410735241. Once again, it will be noted that this was the same telephone number that had been provided to Auto King and Chemical Cleaning earlier that day.  
     
      
    168 A couple of weeks after 28 September 2005 Jamal, using the name George, attended at Peter's Hardware at Greenacre. He produced the receipt that had been given to Hasan on 28 September 2005. He said that he had come to pick up the acetone, which had been ordered on the earlier day. The owner of the store informed him that he had only obtained four cans of acetone and he wanted to discuss the cost and confirm the price. Jamal said he did not know about the price and wanted to ""talk to the boss"". The owner handed him the customer order book and Jamal wrote down his name as ""George"" and gave a contact number being 0410735241. He told the owner to call him at 12.30pm and left the store.  
     
      
    169 At about 12.40pm the owner called the telephone number that he had been given and spoke to a male there. He asked, ""What's happened, George?"" The person on the other end replied, ""I get back to you. I can't get in touch with the boss"". Over the next few days the owner did not hear back from George, so he rang the mobile number several times from his shop. Each time it rang out to voice mail and to a recorded message which stated the name ""Adam"". He left several messages, but finally gave up doing so.  
     
      
    170 On 13 October 2005, the Crown case is that Jamal and another male attended Auto King to pick up the distilled water and sulphuric acid, which had been ordered on 28 September 2005. Jamal spoke to the owner and said, ""We have paid for the stuff, we need it"". He was told ""Just pay me the rest of the money and I'll send you to my supplier and you can go and pick it up, otherwise I'll have to deliver it to you"". Jamal responded that he would go and pick it up. The rest of the money was paid and Auto King sent one of their employees with Jamal to the supplier. Before leaving Auto King, Jamal collected the distilled water, which had been ordered on 28 September 2005. He and the other male loaded the distilled water into a white station wagon.  
     
      
    171 I should interrupt this narrative to say that containers of Refresh brand distilled water, which were consistent with those produced on 28 September 2005, were later located in a Musso registration number FDT 113, which was found on fire in the early morning of 10 November 2005. The Crown case is that this vehicle was the one used by Hasan when he attempted to collect chemicals he had ordered from a company called Padstow Hardware on 5 November 2005. There were other items found in the burning car and the Crown case is that there is a connection between at least one of these further items and Jamal. 
     
      
    172 In relation to the white station wagon, which was used on 13 October 2005, this is said to be a vehicle registration number TVD 473. This vehicle was located on 8 November 2005 outside the premises of a co-accused Moustafa Cheikho. Located within the vehicle were items, including mail with Cheikho's name on it. There were other items in the car and the Crown case is that there is a connection between some of these items found in the car, and Jamal.  
     
      
    173 The Crown case is that Jamal and the male person he was with on 13 October 2005, accompanied by an employee of the automotive parts retailer, attended the supplier Autoquip on that day to collect 200 litres of sulphuric acid, which was being stored at Autoquip's warehouse at Condell Park. While waiting for the order, Jamal is alleged to have made enquiries concerning the purchase of brake fluid. One of the employees commented that the combination of sulphuric acid and brake fluid was ""a lethal mix"". Following this conversation, the men said they would return the following day to collect the sulphuric acid. It was, however, never collected.  
     
      
    174 During the week commencing 17 October 2005 Hasan attended Padstow Station Hardware in Padstow and made enquiries about ordering a large quantity of methylated spirits and acetone, about 200 litres and sulphuric acid. Hasan subsequently introduced himself as “Adam”. When asked where he was from, he stated ""India"". When this was challenged, he said he was from “Bangladesh”. Hasan provided a contact number, which was written down by the owner as 0410735214. It will be noted that this number is very similar to, but not precisely the same as the number which had been used in the previous week when the orders or enquiries were made with Auto King, Chemical Cleaning Solutions and Peter's Hardware at Greenacre. On this occasion 17 October 2005 Hasan paid a deposit of $100 in cash.  
     
      
    175 On the same day at about 2.30pm, the Crown case is that Hasan, Khaled Cheikho and Jamal attended Jaycar Electronics at Bankstown. They enquired about purchasing wireless, CCTV security cameras that had night vision capabilities with a 30 metre viewing capacity.  
     
      
    176 On 22 October 2005 Hasan attended Peter's Hardware store at Greenacre and collected acetone, which had been ordered on 28 September 2005. The owner of the store told Hasan that he had only ordered four cans because he was not sure how to contact him. Hasan agreed to take the 16 litres. The store owner said he could supply more acetone, but that he would be away the following week. Hasan said he would be back, but he never returned.  
     
      
    177 On 5 November 2005 at about 11.30am, Hasan attended Padstow Station Hardware. At about this time the police observed a maroon coloured Musso bearing the New South Wales registration plates FDT 113 parked behind the store. On entering the store Hasan informed the store owner that he would collect his order of chemicals and requested that they load the vehicle at the rear of the store. The owner said it was not possible to load at the rear of the store, but that he would assist Hasan in loading the chemicals out from the front of the store. Hasan then commenced moving the chemicals to the front door of the store and, while doing so, enquired with the owner about sulphuric acid. A short time later Hasan advised the owner that he would get his vehicle. At about 11.40am he was observed to depart the store. He did not return.  
     
      
    178 On 8 November 2005, search warrants were executed at the premises of each of the accused involved in the present charge and upon certain vehicles associated with each accused. On the same day they were arrested and each remained in custody, with the exception of Jamal who was released on that day. I have earlier made reference to the fact that the Musso registration number FDT 113, which the Crown alleges Hasan was driving on 5 November 2005, when he attempted to collect the chemicals ordered at Padstow Hardware, was observed on a later date burning in Northern Avenue, Bankstown.  
     
      
    179 I have mentioned the fact that there were a number of items located within the vehicle. These, I will repeat, included 9 x 10 litre Refresh brand of distilled water, being the same brand as those purchased at Auto King; other items including shovels and mallets, maps of the Blue Mountains area west of Sydney and a book entitled ""Fortress of the Muslim"". There was a fingerprint identified as being that of Jamal located on page 96 of this book. There was also DNA analysis of items and in relation to some of them Jamal could not be excluded as a source of the DNA profile.  
     
      
    180 On 7 February 2006 another Musso vehicle Registration number ATE 40N was located in a car park in a block of units at Meredith Street, Bankstown. It was covered in dust and cobwebs and had a flat battery. The key to this vehicle had been located, on 8 November 2005, during the execution of the search warrant I have already mentioned at Khaled Cheikho's premises. There were a large number of items in the vehicle and fingerprint analysis and DNA analysis was carried out. It is suggested there was one fingerprint identification that connected Jamal to the UBD brand state map of New South Wales and he was not able to be excluded in relation to other items where DNA profiling occurred. It is fair to say that a number of the other co-accused were linked to items in this vehicle.  
     
      
    181 Searches were conducted at Jamal's premises in November and December 2005. Some of the items seized on one or other of these occasions included a mobile phone handset, including an IMEI number which was identified as 351263009624040. The Crown case is that this handset was used in conjunction with a number of telephones activated in false names. There was also a bum bag containing two boxes of 45 calibre ammunition; one box contained 50 rounds of ammunition, the other box contained 35 rounds of ammunition.  
     
      
    182 There were also located numerous print-outs from various web sites or printed texts from other sources, including an article in which the author sought to disabuse the reader in relation to misconceptions that it would be allowable to hand in Osama Bin Laden; a typewritten text ""Fighting for the cause of Allah (Jihad)""; excerpts from the Qur'an that support Jihad and ""The Islamic Ruling on defending Muslim land under attack"".  
     
      
    183 There was also material found on a computer in the premises. This included material of an instructional nature, including, as I mentioned at the outset, military documents relating to sniper training and weaponry; military documents relating to minefields and other military obstacles; a document entitled ""Appendix D Urban Areas; how to move; how to enter a building; how to use hand grenades; how to use fighting positions"". There was also a document entitled ""Appendix H; field expedient anti-armour devices, contents on how to make expedient devices, eg Molotov cocktails, Eagle fireball; Eagle cocktail and other explosive devices"".  
     
      
    184 To return to the chronological narrative: on 28 September 2005, there was a general spate of activity among certain of the accused. First, there were SMS communications between Baladjam using a phone in a false name and Elomar using a service in a false name. The Crown case is that these were covert communications, in code, planning a meeting.  
     
      
    185 There was a further conversation between Touma and Lord about ammunition and a conversation between Sharrouf and Khaled Cheikho during which arrangements were made for Moustafa Cheikho to pick up the accused later that evening.  
     
      
    186 At about 8.42pm, Sharrouf informed Touma that ""all the boys"" were at the prayer hall and asked if Touma was coming down. Shortly afterwards Touma contacted Lord and was told that everything was there for him to pick up either then or tomorrow. Arrangements were made to meet the following day.  
     
      
    187 There were a further series of telephone conversations in code between Baladjam and Elomar using the false telephone services. These essentially related to proposed meetings.  
     
      
    188 On 7 October 2005, Sharrouf, Touma and Khaled Cheikho attended the Big W store at Chullora. Sharrouf was stopped at the cash register attempting to steal six clocks/timers and at least 132 batteries of various types. These were secreted within chip boxes. The accused ran down the road with batteries falling from his pockets. He was subsequently charged with attempting to steal those items.  
     
      
    189 On 9 October 2005, at about 2.20pm, Hasan, the two Cheikhos, Sharrouf, Jamal and another person travelled in Hasan's vehicle to Sutton Forest, New South Wales. They parked for 10 or 15 minutes, travelled on for 20 minutes before parking on a grass strip next to the road for approximately ten minutes before travelling back to Sydney.  
     
      
    190 On 9 October 2005, Baladjam spoke to Touma on the telephone. They discussed whether Touma's telephone was being tapped.  
     
      
    191 On that day and the next, there were discussions between Baladjam and Elomar using the fictitious phone services using code. These continued between 10 and 13 October 2005. These conversations again continued on 18 and 19 October 2005.  
     
      
    192 The “Tom Clincley” phone was used by Khaled Cheikho on 18 October to send covert messages via SMS.  
     
      
    193 Baladjam and Elomar continued to communicate on 20 and 21 October 2005.  
     
      
    194 On 21 October 2005, Sharrouf told another person that he had been picked up by the police at Big W because “ASIO was monitoring his conduct”.  
     
      
    195 On 22, 23 and 24 October 2005, there was further communication in the same manner as described above between Baladjam and Elomar.  
     
      
    196 On 24 October 2005, Baladjam used the Jeffrey Leydon phone to contact Pope Batteries and make an inquiry about purchasing distilled water and sulphuric acid. He asked which wholesaler was used by Pope Batteries and whether they would deliver or whether it had to be picked up.  
     
      
    197 On the same day, later in the afternoon, using the same telephone service, Baladjam telephoned Consolidated Chemicals and made inquiries in a false name for purchasing sulphuric acid. Other false details were given. He rang back a few minutes later to clarify the price for the acid.  
     
      
    198 There was a further series of covert calls on 25, 26 and 28 October 2005 between Baladjam and Elomar.  
     
      
    199 On 25 October 2005, surveillance showed that Sharrouf and Hasan were travelling in convoy in covert fashion with Moustafa Cheikho's car to a meeting at Revesby.  
     
      
    200 On 26 October 2005, Baladjam and Mulahalilovic went to the Horsley Park Gun Shop. Baladjam entered the shop and had discussions with a sales assistant there concerning ammunition.  
     
      
    201 On 28 October, Baladjam went to the Gunsmith Shop at Chester Hill. On the same day, Baladjam was observed purchasing a backpack from the Big W store at Carnes Hill.  
     
      
    202 On the same day, at about 4.04pm Baladjam, using the Jeffrey Leydon telephone service, spoke to a representative from Western Firearm Company of Beverly Hills. He inquired about purchasing ammunition. He said he would purchase all they had in stock, about 900 rounds.  
     
      
    203 Some time after this call, a person matching Baladjam's description purchased 900 rounds of ammunition, paying $270 in cash. The person used a backpack similar to that purchased by Baladjam to carry the ammunition away from the store. Shortly after, Baladjam had another telephone conversation with the Beverly Hills company about the ammunition he had bought.  
     
      
    204 On 28 October 2005, Moustafa Cheikho, Khaled Cheikho and another person went to the Miners Den in Parramatta and hired a metal detector. They then attended a nearby Map Centre in Parramatta and purchased maps of the Sofala region.  
     
      
    205 On 29 October, there was a conversation between Baladjam and Mulahalilovic, which the Crown alleges was in code and which referred to the purchase of “fruit and vegetables”.  
     
      
    206 There were further calls between Baladjam and Elomar using the false telephones on 30 and 31 October 2005.  
     
      
    207 On 30 October, there was a further telephone conversation between Baladjam and Mulahalilovic, once again referring to the purchase of “fruit and vegetables”.  
     
      
    208 On 31 October, Baladjam, using the Jeffrey Leydon service, telephoned Autoquip. This was the same commercial supplier which Jamal attended on 13 October 2005 in relation to the collection of 200 litres of sulphuric acid ordered through Auto King. It will be recalled that they did not return to collect the order. An assistant at Autoquip gave Baladjam the address as being 27 Harley Crescent, Condell Park.  
     
      
    209 On 31 October 2005, Baladjam, using the Jeffrey Leydon telephone service, contacted Vodafone directly and inquired about details for any courier companies. Later, Baladjam telephoned ""Courier One"". He stated ""I've got a battery manufacturing company. I need to get 15 litre drums delivered, say about 30 of them. Can you transport 30...15 litre drums?"" The courier company indicated that they did not have trucks large enough for that amount. They provided the name of another company who might assist.  
     
      
    210 On 31 October 2005, Benbrika travelled from Melbourne to Sydney. Hasan arranged for Moustafa Cheikho to pick him up. Sharrouf and Moustafa Cheikho collected Benbrika from the airport and took him to Hasan's house. 
     
      
    211 Between 1 and 3 November 2005, there was ongoing communication between Baladjam and Elomar; and between Baladjam and Mulahalilovic. There were also meetings involving these two men, Hasan and Jamal. (All of this, according to the Crown case, was suggestive of the men being conscious of the fact that they were under surveillance and attempting to avoid that surveillance while continuing with their activities).  
     
      
    212 On 1 November 2005, Baladjam made an inquiry of “A Class Couriers” but did not leave his name or contact telephone number with the courier company.  
     
      
    213 On 2 November 2005, Baladjam contacted two firearms dealers, one in Terrey Hills and the other in Bexley. In relation to the latter inquiry, he asked about ammunition for his Beretta. Business records of the store indicate that, on that day, 300 rounds of ammunition and other equipment were purchased. Baladjam also made an inquiry from Vodafone for a gun dealership in Ryde but no listing was found.  
     
      
    214 I will not detail the somewhat complicated movements of the various parties in and around Lakemba, Punchbowl and other places at this time. But a vehicle in which Sharrouf had been seen earlier to be in the passenger seat was seen parked at 29 Myall Street, Punchbowl, on 2 November. The next day this same vehicle was driven from Sharrouf's street to an address in Wiley Park. A minute or so later, another vehicle, registered to Sharrouf's partner, was driven from Wiley Park to South Terrace, Punchbowl. Shortly afterwards, a motorcycle was observed parked on South Terrace, Punchbowl, and Baladjam was seen standing next to the motorcycle, using a mobile phone. There were other movements as well, which I will not pause to detail here.  
     
      
    215 The Crown case is that it will be inferred from the surveillance material that the accused were conscious of the fact that police surveillance was increasing and that there was a possibility of an imminent raid and/or arrest.  
     
      
    216 On 3 November 2005, Elomar, Moustafa Cheikho, Sharrouf and others attended Bunnings Warehouse, Bankstown. Khaled Cheikho waited in a motor vehicle in the car park. Elomar purchased two rolls of aluminium foil insulation tape and twelve plastic screw top antibacterial containers. Moustafa Cheikho purchased two rolls of the same insulation tape and placed it in a box being carried by a third person who was with Elomar.  
     
      
    217 At 5.30pm a vehicle SBW88A, with Moustafa Cheikho as driver, Khaled Cheikho as front passenger and Sharrouf as rear passenger, left the car park of Bunnings Warehouse. At the same time a second vehicle, with Elomar as the driver and another person as front passenger, left Bunnings. This second vehicle then went to Bankstown Centro shopping centre, where Elomar attended Ronnie's Discount Store and purchased five containers. Elomar then drove to his home, arriving at about 6.28pm.  
     
      
    218 On 3 November, at about 6.18pm, Mulahalilovic purchased a number of items from Bunnings Warehouse at Bankstown airport. These included priming fluid, cement, solvent, push on caps and six metres of PVC piping. (A receipt for these items was found in Mulahalilovic's premises on 8 November 2005.) 
     
      
    219 There was a meeting arranged at Hasan's premises for that evening. Present at various stages that afternoon and evening were Hasan, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Sharrouf, Touma, Jamal and Mulahalilovic.  
     
      
    220 During that same evening there were further SMS communications between Elomar and Khaled Cheikho using false name phones.  
     
      
    221 On 4 November there was a telephone conversation between Mulahalilovic and Baladjam relating to materials purchased the day before and the need to purchase more of them on that day.  
     
      
    222 On 4 November, in the early morning, Baladjam went into Discount Mania at Green Valley and purchased a single large roll of clear packing tape. Later in the morning Baladjam collected Mulahalilovic from his house and they went to the Trade Link Hardware store at Lakemba. Mulahalilovic went into the store and purchased a number of PVC caps to be used on the end of PVC piping. They were of the same size as those purchased the previous day. The two men were seen later unloading Mulahalilovic's vehicle and placing into Baladjam's vehicle a number of items which appeared to be PVC pipes.  
     
      
    223 In the afternoon of 4 November, Baladjam's brother and another man went to Mulahalilovic's premises in a white van. Mulahalilovic loaded a number of items from his premises into the back of the van, including two cardboard boxes and two full plastic bags. The van and Baladjam's vehicle travelled in convoy to Hoxton Park and then later the van was driven towards Liverpool.  
     
      
    224 There were further covert calls on 4 November between Baladjam, Elomar, Khaled Cheikho and other persons.  
     
      
    225 At 7.25pm Baladjam telephoned Mulahalilovic and said he had a headache and could not come to “lessons” and he would leave it until the next day.  
     
      
    226 Later that evening, there was a meeting between several of the men in Lakemba and later Elomar and the two Cheikhos were observed walking through the car park towards Greenacre.  
     
      
    227 On 6 November 2005, Baladjam's wife went to Bunnings Warehouse at The Crossroads and purchased six PVC caps. Further meetings were sought to be arranged between the men for 6 November, although the surveillance does not appear to make any reference to Sharrouf.  
     
      
    228 On 7 November, at 3.55pm, shortly after Hasan left his premises, a group of men arrived there and loaded into a van what appeared to be a half-barrel, 2 x 1.5-inch pipes and a number of unknown items.  
     
      
    229 Later that afternoon Elomar, Sharrouf, the two Cheikhos and Touma were observed on Chapel Road, Bankstown, outside the offices of Adam Houda, solicitor. The men dispersed in different vehicles and reassembled at Elomar's home at Condell Park.  
     
      
    230 At about 6.15pm Baladjam telephoned Mulahalilovic to arrange a meeting that evening.  
     
      
    231 On 8 November, as I have earlier noted, search warrants were executed on the premises of each accused and upon certain vehicles associated with each accused. All except Jamal were arrested and charged that day. Jamal was arrested on 20 December 2005.  
     
      
       
      A more confined examination of the material 
       
      
    232 Although the Crown has asked me to read the entirety of this material for the purpose of determining whether a prima facie case can be established, the Crown has accepted that there should necessarily be a primary focus upon the evidentiary material which constitutes direct evidence of the accused's participation in the alleged conspiracy. Mr Brewer and Mr Pickin have agreed with this approach. In addition, counsel stated that there was no objection to all to the Crown material being placed before the Court in paper form, to the extent that such material reflected the Crown case as the Crown anticipated it would be led. In making this very fair statement, Mr Pickin was aware, as indeed was the Court, that some type of consent would be necessary before statements in non-sworn form could be placed before the Court. The evidence directly focusing on the accused's participation in the alleged conspiracy was divided into three categories. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The overt acts; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) intercept material; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) surveillance.  
        
       
      
    233 The Crown submitted that a number of the overt acts provide direct evidence of the accused's participation in the conspiracy: These matters are already contained within the chronological “narrative”. 
     
      
       
      The Overt Acts 
       
      
    234 The following overt acts, according to the Crown case, provide direct evidence of the accused’s participation in the alleged conspiracy:

       – the possession, by the accused, of a large volume of extremist material.  
       
      
    235 The Crown submission then placed emphasis upon the totality of the intercept material proposed to be relied upon by the Crown. It placed special reliance, however, upon a number of specific conversations to which the accused was a party. These are mentioned in the narrative. They include the following:  
     
      
      (1) a conversation with an unidentified person on 21 October 2004 at 7.11 pm in which, in the context of a discussion about a television program on terrorism the accused said: 
       
       
        
        “Yeah, yeah, let the people accept that we’re this but we’re doing it for a proper cause, you know?” 
        
       
       
      (2) a conversation on 10 January 2005 with Benbrika in Melbourne when they discussed (inter alia) martyrdom; 
       
       
      (3) a conversation at Benbrika’s premises on 23 February 2005 regarding the order to be placed with Haines; 
       
       
      (4) a conversation with Moustafa Cheikho on 1 April 2005 which included the following: 
       
       
        
         
         KS

      (5) a conversation on 4 May 2005 with Benbrika about the Haines order; 
       
       
      (6) a conversation on 27 June 2005 between the accused and Joud in which they discussed the fact that  
      “brothers had been raided”  
      in both Sydney and Melbourne; 
       
       
      (7) a conversation on 20 July 2005 between Sharrouf and Joud during which the accused told Joud that he did not wish to make mention of a  
      “brother”  
      on the telephone; 
       
       
      (8) a conversation on 27 July 2005 between the accused and Benbrika in which they discussed the necessity to attack people; 
       
       
      (9) a conversation on 5 August 2005 between the accused and Adam Houda, Solicitor in the course of which, in relation to an interview with Benbrika which had been aired on television on the previous day, the Accused said: 
       
       
        
        “I mean, this is something, Almighty God he said this in the Qu’ran ….. if people see this as trouble they might as well leave Islam, go to Christianity, go to Judaism ….. this is from God’s word”. 
        
       
       
      (It is noted that in the course of the interview, Benbrika had spoken about (inter alia) jihad and Osama Bin Laden). 
       
       
      (10) a conversation on 5 August 2005 between the accused and his brother in which they discussed the acquisition of  
      “magazines”  
      (on the Crown case, a reference to ammunition); 
       
       
      (11) a conversation on 5 August 2005 between the accused and Touma in which the accused in the course of which, in the context of a conversation about the deployment of Australian troops to East Timor, the Philippines, Afghanistan and Israel, the accused stated: 
       
       
        
        “Forget Australian law, Australian law get stuffed, finish; give us all back our passports and we’ll leave; I swear to God I will be the first one to get out of this stuffed up country; Sons of dogs, listen here I swear I rather be locked up and tortured and everything in a Muslim country rather than be locked up one day in this country”. 
        
       
       
      (12) a conversation on 22 August 2005 between the accused and Joud in which Sharrouf sought the return of his videos because  
      “a lot of brothers want to watch them” 
      . Joud made reference to this being for

      (13) a conversation on 28 August 2005 between the accused and Atik in which the Accused spoke of having recently been raided by ASIO, telling Atik  
      “I will tell you when I see you, God willing” 
      ; 
       
       
      (14) an attempted call on 9 September 2005 from Sharrouf accused to Hasan when, whilst waiting for the telephone to be answered, the accused said: 
       
       
        
        “they are on the internet; everyone is on the internet ….. yeah, download from the internet …. Where can I get like Mujahideen pictures and all that …..” 
        
       
       
      (15) a conversation on 15 September 2005 between Sharrouf and Moustafa Cheikho in which they discussed downloading material from the Internet. The Accused said in the course of that conversation: 
       
       
        
        “….. because I need to do something on the Internet – I need to print some books out – I’ve been dying to do it man. ….. Remember the sayings – about disbelief – Abu Bakr he called the ones that doesn’t pray and that eh, infidel ….. just press Hadith software – and it comes up – you get the call to prayer – Qu’ran – I downloaded Qur’an and all the books of sayings…….” 
        
       
      
    236 Finally, the Crown relied upon the body of evidence as to surveillance to establish ""association"" between the accused, his alleged co-conspirators and others. There is no need for me to do other than to mention this material. I have scrutinised it in a general way to satisfy myself that there is a high level of association. 
     
      
       
      Has a prima facie case been established that the accused committed the offence charged in the indictment? 
       
      
    237 It is appropriate at the outset to note that Mr Brewer did not submit that it would not be open to find that the evidence I have specifically identified had the capacity to establish a prima facie case against his client. Mr Pickin, who had addressed on the preliminary point identified at an earlier stage in this judgment, adhered to his argument that the Commonwealth legislation posed a higher threshold than the establishment of a mere prima facie case. Mr Pickin also agreed, however, that it would be open to the Court to find, even against the higher threshold claimed by him to exist, that a prima facie case, in the terms of the section, had been established.  
     
      
    238 I should also note that I was informed the accused did not wish to make a statement, to give evidence, or raise a defence. It will be recalled that these were matters of entitlement provided for in s 20B(7) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    239 At the commencement of this judgment, I set out the nature of the charge brought against the accused. The accused stands charged upon an indictment on a single count as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts).""  
        
       
      
    240 In order to prove the charge against the accused, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that he: 
     
      
       
      (a) Entered into the agreement alleged by the Crown with one or more other persons (physical element); 
       
       
      (b) did so intentionally (fault element) and the Crown must further prove that: 
       
       
      (c) the accused and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement (intention required by s 11.5(b) of the  
      Criminal Code Act 1995 
      ); and 
       
       
      (d) at least one party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement (s 11.5(c) of the  
      Criminal Code Act 
        
      1995 
      ).  
       
      
    241 Under the Criminal Code Act, a terrorist act is an act which possesses certain identified characteristics and which does not have certain other identified characteristics.  
     
      
    242 At the outset, a terrorist act is an act of such a character that it is to be done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and is to be done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation governments, or intimidating the public or a section of the public.  
     
      
    243 The identified characteristics that a terrorist act must have are that it must be an act that: 
     
      
    · causes serious harm, that is physical harm to a person; or· causes serious damage to property; or· causes a person's death; or· endangers a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or· creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public. 244 The identified characteristics which a terrorist act must not have is that the action cannot be characterised as advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action.  
     
      
    245 The agreement alleged by the Crown here, as I have said, is an agreement between the accused and the other alleged co-conspirators to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts.  
     
      
    246 Generally, the Crown case is that the accused and the other men, in accordance with the holding of certain common extremist religious beliefs, entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or terrorist acts. In furtherance of the agreement, the Crown case is that various of the accused, amongst other things:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used, directly and/or indirectly in the construction of an explosive device; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) obtained or attempted to obtain weaponry and/or ammunition; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material.  
        
       
      
    247 I accept that the material I have identified (together with the evidence of the acts of the other co-conspirators) is capable of establishing a prima facie case against the accused. I find that a prima facie case that the accused committed the subject offence has been established. In this regard, the evidence has the capacity to provide sufficient grounds to put the accused on trial in relation to the offence. I should make it clear that this finding expresses no view, one way or other, as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. He remains entitled, in every respect, to the presumption of innocence. 
     
      
       
      The determination of fitness within twelve months 
       
      
    248 The third stage process arises if a prima facie case has been established and the Court does not otherwise determine that the charge should be dismissed. I have already found that a prima facie case has been established. I determine, however, that the charge should not be dismissed.  
     
      
    249 In relation to this latter determination it cannot be said that the offence is of a trivial nature. The charge is a very serious one, as I indicated at the outset. No submission has been made to me relating to any matter arising under s 20BA(2) that would warrant a dismissal of the charge. Of course, I have found that the accused is suffering from schizophrenia and that this condition presently renders him unfit for trial. It does not warrant, however, the charge being dismissed. Nor is there any other reason why that course should be followed.  
     
      
    250 The legislation then requires the Court to determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, the accused will become fit to be tried within the period of twelve months from today's date. The Court is prohibited from making a finding of this kind, unless the Court has obtained and considered written or oral evidence from a duly qualified psychiatrist and one other duly qualified medical practitioner. In the present matter the Court has the benefit of the views of two experienced and highly qualified psychiatrists. Their evidence focuses upon the issue to be determined under s 20BA(4) of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914.  
     
      
    251 It is clear that Dr Nielssen believes that the accused's condition is generally amenable to treatment; and that there is a reasonable prospect that if he were to receive appropriate treatment he would become fit for trial within twelve months. Dr Westmore was, in one sense, a little more guarded. He was asked specifically his opinion regarding the likely effect of appropriate treatment on the accused's mental health situation. Dr Westmore wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Assuming he has a schizophrenic illness, then theoretically he should respond to appropriate treatment, provided he complies, within a period of twelve months. Based on that, it should be said at this stage that he will become fit within a period of twelve months.""  
        
       
      
    252 The opinions of the two psychiatrists agree that the accused, if treated appropriately, will become fit to be tried within the period stated in the statute. Accordingly, I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused will become fit to be tried within a period of twelve months from today. 
     
      
       
      The consequences of this finding 
       
      
    253 It is clear from the findings I have already made that I accept the accused is suffering from schizophrenia. That term, in my view, clearly embraces the concepts of ""mental illness"" and ""mental condition"" referred to in the legislation.  
     
      
    254 The Court is then required to examine whether treatment is available for the accused in a hospital; and if so, whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital. Alternatively, the Court may order that the accused be detained in a prison or it may grant bail (no bail application has been made). 
     
      
       
      Is treatment available for the accused within the prison system?  
       
      
    255 Counsel for Mr Sharrouf told the Court that their client had not indicated that he had an objection to being detained in a hospital. He has, however, expressed a strong preference to remain where he is at Silverwater. As an AA classified remand prisoner, he is able to communicate with the co-accused and this is a matter of considerable importance to him. The issue as to whether treatment is available for the accused within the prison system is one that has taken some little time to unravel. I will not, in this decision, detail the problems that have emerged in relation to obtaining information which, according to its nature, should have been readily available to the Court. For one reason or another, it was not readily obtainable and a number of adjournments were necessary before the Court could be seized of a comprehensive picture of the position.  
     
      
    256 On 29 May 2008, Mr Singleton of counsel appeared for the Department of Corrective Services and provided considerable assistance to the Court in implementing its understanding of the facilities available for Mr Sharrouf, were he to be hospitalised within the prison system. It will be convenient if I summarise that material at this stage.  
     
      
    257 Mr Singleton confirmed that, from his client's perspective, Mr Sharrouf could be transferred to a secure psychiatric unit within the Corrective Services system. Counsel explained that there are two prison hospitals with psychiatric wards. The first is at the Long Bay Detention Centre. The second is the Mental Health Screening Unit in the MRRC at Silverwater. Notwithstanding its title, this unit does include a full psychiatric ward for care after provision of screening.  
     
      
    258 Mr Singleton indicated that the Department's present preference is to keep Mr Sharrouf in his present location at Silverwater with his being, in effect, an outpatient at the Mental Health Screening Unit. It is anticipated that a treating psychiatrist would be assigned to Mr Sharrouf, and that he would make a decision, after acquainting himself with the history of the matter and examining Mr Sharrouf, whether Mr Sharrouf should be transferred from being an outpatient to an inpatient situation, either at Silverwater or at Long Bay. Mr Singleton also confirmed that the various tests and assessments recommended by the psychiatrists would be capable of implementation within the prison system. For example, an assessment could be made to see whether Mr Sharrouf had any organic causes for his presentation. Blood tests could be done within the prison hospital system. An MRI, if the treating doctor required it, would have to be done outside in a public hospital, but that could be done and achieved within the present security classification for Mr Sharrouf. 
     
      
    259 Mr Singleton's observations were made within the confines of the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrective Services. His client's principal concern is one of security rather than with medical treatment. Consequently, Mr Singleton was not able to bind Justice Health with the helpful information he gave the Court. In short, Mr Singleton assured the Court that, so far as his understanding of the medical requirements were concerned, the prison system could cope with them all, including, for example, removing Mr Sharrouf to a public hospital for an MRI or other needed requirements.  
     
      
    260 He also confirmed that, from the point of view of the Corrective Services, there would be no difficulty with regular and individual monitoring of the accused. That would be able to be done physically if Mr Sharrouf were to be transferred into the hospital as an inpatient. If he remained, at least for part of the time, as an outpatient, the Correctional Services staff could be briefed to include in their running notes observations of day-to-day events and the like. Prescribed medication would be available to him, but it would need to be administered through proper Justice Health arrangements. 
     
      
    261 Finally, Mr Singleton indicated that if it were necessary to take Mr Sharrouf to a neurologist, that could be done in a secure fashion. Rehabilitation services, within limits, would also be available within the prison system. The detail of treatment would, of course, be a matter for the treating psychiatrist from Justice Health. 
     
      
    262 On 19 June 2008 Associate Professor John Basson gave evidence on behalf of Justice Health. Professor Basson is the Director of Forensic Mental Health within Justice Health and, in that capacity, his task is to oversee all mental health issues pertaining to persons held within the prison medical service.  
     
      
    263 Professor Basson had familiarised himself with all the medical reports and associated material relating to Mr Sharrouf. Based on the material he read, Professor Basson expressed the view that Mr Sharrouf suffers from anxiety and has some paranoid beliefs. These have emerged from time to time. Professor Basson thought it would be desirable to determine the pathology that is actually underling these systems. 
     
      
    264 Professor Basson addressed the issue as to whether treatment would be available for Mr Sharrouf in a Prison Hospital. He identified, as Mr Singleton had done, facilities within the Silverwater Complex (MRRC) and at Long Bay Prison. In relation to the former, there is a Screening Unit which is quite new. It was opened two years ago and it is available to complete all investigations necessary to treat a person such as Mr Sharrouf. This would include both investigation and treatment. The facility caters for both in-patients and out-patients. It is a 40-cell unit having two wings of 15 and one of 10.  
     
      
    265 The high dependency unit (10 cells) is, with the other facilities, operated by the Department of Corrective Services in a joint agreement with Justice Health. The latter organisation supplies trained nursing staff and medical staff who work 12 hours per day, five days per week. The relative intensity of the attendance of these trained personnel means that a fairly in depth and specific assessment can be made at the MRRC Screening Unit. 
     
      
    266 Professor Basson was quite confident that the necessary investigations for determining Mr Sharrouf’s pathology could be undertaken in and from the MRRC Screening Unit. For example, he confirmed that technical investigations could be carried out at other places in conjunction with the co-operation of the Corrective Services personnel. This had been achieved in the past and no problems had been detected. Similarly with medication, Professor Basson thought that the medication could be both supplied and observations made to ensure that compliance was made with any medication regime. There were trained mental health nurses and trained consultant psychiatrists available to do work in the unit. 
     
      
    267 Professor Basson also described the facilities available at Long Bay. The environment there was a different one, he said. The Long Bay Prison Hospital which is currently operative is an old one, and is due shortly to be demolished. It is to be replaced with a new Prison Hospital and a new Forensic Hospital. The new Prison Hospital will have mental health facilities and it is likely to be opened in the next month or six weeks at the latest. The new Forensic Hospital will probably not open until early 2009. 
     
      
    268 In relation to Mr Sharrouf, Professor Basson is confident that Dr Westmore’s requests could be carried out. He regarded those suggestions by Dr Westmore as “standard”. He said that he would consider that it was the duty of Justice Health to carry out and complete those investigations. He also considered that the accused could be transferred into the Screening Unit within about a week. Priority could be given to his situation. Professor Basson said he was in charge of the service and that now he was acquainted with the case, he would ensure that the clinical staff looking after Mr Sharrouf complied with the undertakings that he gave to the Court. 
     
      
    269 Finally, Professor Basson said that he thought it would be appropriate to review Mr Sharrouf’s mental state in about three months time. He accepted that the testing for an organic cause would be likely to determine whether medication, counselling and rehabilitation would be sufficient.  
     
      
    270 The material I have received through Mr Singleton and from Professor Basson satisfy me that treatment is available for the accused within the prison system. At this stage, the preferred hospital is the Screening Unit at MRRC. This is the preference of both Mr Sharrouf and the Department of Corrective Services Mr Sharrouf’s classification as an AA inmate will not prevent him from being adequately treated within the hospital system. It will not, in addition, prevent him from receiving testing and any other treatment that is necessary outside of the MRRC facility, provided that appropriate security safeguards are taken by Corrective Services. 
     
      
    271 Accordingly, I state my satisfaction as to each of the following matters. 
     
      
       
      1. The accused is presently unfit to be tried. 
       
       
      2. I am satisfied that the accused will become fit to be tried within 12 months from today’s date. 
       
       
      3. I am satisfied that the accused is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a Prison Hospital. 
       
       
      4. I am satisfied that the accused does not object to being further detained at MRRC Silverwater and to receiving treatment at the MRRC Screening Unit at Silverwater. 
       
      
    272 In those circumstances, I order that the accused be taken to, and detained in, the MRRC Screening Unit from today, or as soon as his transfer to the unit can be reasonably achieved, and that he be kept there for a period ending when becomes fit to be tried. 
     
      
    273 I grant liberty to apply to the parties in case any variation of this order, or any further order is required.

     PHILLIP JOHN PORTER v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: This is an application by Phillip John Porter for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Finnane QC at the Orange District Court on 26 April 2007. The Applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of break, enter and steal under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty - 14 years’ imprisonment) and five counts of maliciously damaging property by fire under s.195(b) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty - 10 years’ imprisonment). 
     
      
    3 On each of the seven counts, his Honour imposed identical and wholly concurrent sentences of imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of three years to commence on 1 March 2007. 
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    4 What follows is drawn essentially from an Agreed Statement of Facts tendered at the sentencing hearing in the District Court together with statements and reports tendered by the Crown and uncontested evidence given by the Applicant. 
     
      
    5 Soon after 12.30 am on Friday, 7 July 2006, the Applicant (then aged 19 years) left the Royal Hotel, Orange where he had been drinking alcohol for some time. According to the Applicant, he “wasn’t legless” but “was affected by alcohol” (T3.46, 1 March 2007). He rode his skateboard down Summer Street in the direction of the Realty Building.  
     
      
    6 Shortly prior to 1.00 am, the Applicant broke into shop premises of Bradley’s Florist in the Realty Building at 36 Sale Street, Orange by smashing a window with his skateboard and entering the premises. The Applicant said in evidence “I just … had a heap of anger and I smashed the window” (T10.51, 1 March 2007). In later evidence, he said “I’m not real sure why I was angry, I was in a pretty confused state I think” (T4.32, 26 April 2007). Once inside, the Applicant stole about $50.00 in coins. Before leaving the shop, the Applicant used his cigarette lighter to set fire to a curtain which separated the office from the retail part of the premises. In later interviews with a probation and parole officer and a psychiatrist, the Applicant could provide no explanation for starting the fire. He could provide no explanation for this act in his evidence before the District Court (T10.20, 1 March 2007). The Applicant said he thought the curtain would “fall off onto the ground” but he “didn’t think it would burn the whole shop down” (T11, 1 March 2007).  
     
      
    7 Bradley’s Florist shop was one of a number of business premises located in the Realty Building in Sale Street, Orange. Also located in the building were Swish Home and Living, Mosaic Boutique Ladies Wear, Robert Bruce Photography (above Bradley’s Florist), Radio Rentals, the Wing Wah Chinese Restaurant and J&J Bridal and Formal Wear. 
     
      
    8 Shortly after 1.00 am, the Applicant entered a service station opposite the Realty Building where he exchanged a large amount of stolen coins for paper currency. The Applicant then rode his skateboard away from the service station. 
     
      
    9 Soon after, the Applicant returned to the Realty Building and broke into the premises of Swish Home and Living, again using his skateboard to smash glass on the door. He entered the shop and stole about $20.00 in coins. He told the District Court that he “just decided to break into it as well. … I think I had a bit of adrenalin” (T14, 1 March 2007). He said that at this time “there wasn’t such a fire that [he] could see” (T14, 1 March 2007). He saw some flames in Bradley’s Florist shop but proceeded to break into Swish Home and Living and steal money from there (T16, 18-19, 1 March 2007). He didn’t report the fire as he “just wanted to get out of there” (T16.44, 1 March 2007).  
     
      
    10 At about 1.10 am, a security patrol man responded to a motion alarm activated at Swish Home and Living and, upon arrival, saw smoke and flames coming from Bradley’s Florist shop. The security patrolman contacted emergency personnel. The Fire Brigade arrived soon after and found both Bradley’s Florist and the Mosaic Boutique Ladies Wear shops on fire. The fire then spread along a space between the ceiling and the first floor affecting both Robert Bruce Photography and Radio Rentals. As a result, the Fire Brigade personnel evacuated two residents who were sleeping in separate first-floor units. 
     
      
    11 In due course, the fire was extinguished and a crime scene was declared. The Bradley’s Florist shop and the Mosaic Boutique Ladies Wear premises were totally destroyed by fire. The remaining business premises mentioned in the preceding paragraph were all severely damaged by the effects of smoke and/or water and the building structure itself was severely damaged. 
     
      
    12 Police investigations revealed closed-circuit television footage from the service station depicting the Applicant entering the service station after the burglary on Bradley’s Florist shop and exchanging coins for cash. Further closed-circuit television footage depicted the Applicant speaking to the security guard outside the Royal Hotel, Orange at 12.37 am and thereafter, riding his skateboard along Summer Street in the direction of the Realty Building. 
     
      
    13 On 14 July 2006, police executed a search warrant at the Applicant’s home and located clothing depicted in the closed-circuit television footage, together with a skateboard containing glass fragments in the wheels and damage at one end of the board. Soon after, on 14 July 2006, the Applicant was arrested and interviewed. He denied any knowledge of the break, enter and steal and arson offences committed on 7 July 2006. He denied going anywhere near the subject premises on the night in question. 
     
      
    14 In due course, the Applicant pleaded guilty in the Orange Local Court on 5 December 2006 and was committed for sentence in the District Court. 
     
      
    15 Following his arrest on 14 July 2006, the Applicant was released on bail the next day and remained on bail until remanded in custody by his Honour Judge Finnane QC on 1 March 2007. 
     
      
       
      Evidence from the Victims 
       
      
    16 At the sentencing hearing, a number of victim impact statements were tendered by the Crown, without objection. As will be seen, a ground of appeal relates to the admission and use of this evidence from the victims. 
     
      
    17 The statements were made by the proprietors of Bradley’s Florist shop (Ms Sally Louise Wright), Robert Bruce Photography (Mr Robert Ian Bruce), Mosaic Boutique Ladies Wear (Ms Merrilyn Joy Adams) and Swish Home and Living (Ms Marissa Strom-Bennie).  
     
      
    18 Ms Wright read her statement in the District Court, without objection. Ms Wright stated that she purchased Bradley’s Florist in July 2001 and had built the business up from then. She recounted the emotional effect upon her flowing from the destruction of the business including accusations by others that she, herself, had started the fire. Her business relocated to other premises with detrimental consequences, including unrecoverable monetary loss of some $40,000.00. She spoke of the psychological suffering and distress, as well as financial loss, affecting her family and herself resulting from the Applicant’s acts. 
     
      
    19 Mr Bruce was 67 years old and had been a professional photographer for 22 years, working for about 11 years from the subject premises. The fire seriously affected his business and caused him great personal stress. His darkroom was above the seat of the fire and was totally destroyed, along with all of its equipment, with severe smoke and fire damage resulting to the rest of his studio. His business was shut down for several months. The loss incurred as a direct result of the fire, the removal of his records and equipment, the finding and re-equipping of a new studio after some months together with loss of income, exceeded $40,000.00. He stated that stress and hardship had resulted from the fire. 
     
      
    20 Ms Adams and her sister, who were both widows, had opened the Mosaic Boutique Ladies Wear in 2000. They placed all their monies into the business which, by the time of the fire, had become successful. Ms Adams stated that the fire had completely devastated her. After receiving an insurance payment and paying out all operating accounts, tax and final accounts, there was no money left to refit a new shop and purchase all the stock required. The only way that she could reopen the business was to mortgage her home. As her home was her only asset and as she was almost 60 years of age, this placed her under a great deal of stress. Ms Adams’ intention had been to defer the aged pension and continue working in her own business with her sister (who was 10 years younger) for as long as possible. However, her only income now is a carer’s pension. 
     
      
    21 Ms Strom-Bennie opened her gift and home ware business in February 2003. Initially, the idea behind opening the store was to help provide her children with better opportunities. In November 2005, the store relocated to the Sale Street premises. She and her husband (a self-employed truck driver) spent a great deal of time preparing the Sale Street premises. The business opened its doors on 25 November 2005 with a very promising Christmas period pointing to a positive future. After the fire, it was necessary to meet with the insurance company loss adjuster. After cleaners had attempted to clean the premises, Ms Strom-Bennie and her husband had to physically itemise every item in the store for the insurance claim. Her husband had to take a week off work for this purpose. A great deal of stock was not salvageable. Many weekends were spent clearing everything out and sorting through paperwork. Ms Strom-Bennie’s insurance covered only stock and contents, with no insurance cover for loss of income or business interruption. Ms Strom-Bennie recounted the personal, financial and emotional suffering of her family as a result of the Applicant’s acts. She could not afford to re-establish the business and financial difficulties had placed emotional strain on the family. She concluded “I cannot convey enough in words how this selfish act of stupidity has impacted on our lives”. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    22 The Applicant was 19 years of age at the time of the offences and 20 years at the time of sentence.  
     
      
    23 The Applicant was born in Bathurst and has lived in different towns in the central west of New South Wales. His parents separated when he was nine years of age. He has a younger brother. 
     
      
    24 After leaving school at the age of 16 years, the Applicant completed a traineeship in hospitality and worked thereafter as a roof plumber and then at a fast-food outlet in Orange. He was unemployed before going into custody on 1 March 2007.  
     
      
    25 The Applicant’s criminal history includes appearances on 14 February 2005 at Bathurst Children’s Court, where a 12-month good behaviour bond was granted for offences of assault police, resist arrest, intimidate police and consuming liquor in a public place. On 10 August 2005, the Applicant was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for an offence of entering prescribed premises without lawful excuse. On 16 January 2006, he was fined $100.00 in the Bathurst Local Court for shoplifting. 
     
      
    26 After sentence was imposed in the present matters on 26 April 2007, the Applicant appeared in the Orange Local Court on 1 May 2007 where he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for break and enter with intent to steal and imprisonment for one month for shoplifting, with both sentences to date from 1 May 2007. Although the material before this Court does not make it clear, it seems likely that these offences were committed after the offences which are the subject of the present appeal. 
     
      
    27 According to a presentence report before the District Court, the Applicant reported episodes of alcohol abuse and a serious gambling problem involving use of poker machines.  
     
      
    28 Doctor David Greenberg, a psychiatrist with Justice Health, provided a report dated 17 April 2007 to the District Court, at the request of the learned sentencing judge. Dr Greenberg described the Applicant as an alert 20-year old man who was coherent in his speech. The Applicant was initially irritable and reluctant to engage in a psychiatric interview. However, after a period of time, he settled down and was co-operative in the psychiatric assessment. There was no disorder of flow or form of thought, nor any evidence of delusion.  
     
      
    29 Dr Greenberg concluded that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the Applicant suffered from a mental illness nor a mental disorder nor from a developmental disability. Diagnostically, the Applicant appeared to have personality problems associated with use of alcohol and cannabis with no evidence of any major psychiatric illness. It seems that a psychiatrist who examined the Applicant in early 2007 diagnosed mild attention deficit disorder and prescribed medication. Dr Greenberg observed that it is extremely difficult to make a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactive disorder in an adult. Dr Greenberg observed that, at the time of his assessment, the Applicant displayed no evidence of any attention deficit difficulties nor any other active behaviour. The Applicant was coherent and able to give a coherent account of himself during the time period surrounding the alleged offences.  
     
      
       
      Some Findings by the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    30 His Honour Judge Finnane QC adverted to the evidence of loss and damage suffered by the small business persons as a result of the fire initiated by the Applicant. His Honour observed that the arson offences were “directed against a series of people who were conducting shops in Orange for the benefit of the community and of course in the hope that they might make an income” (ROS1). The fire had caused “enormous damage” and driven “each of the shopkeepers away from their businesses” (ROS2). Each of the shopkeepers had “suffered very grievously” (ROS2-3). 
     
      
    31 His Honour observed that to “deliberately set fire to a place is to do something which is extremely dangerous and a threat to human life and safety” (ROS3). 
     
      
    32 His Honour said (ROS3): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender in this case, from my hearing him give evidence on two occasions  
        [is] 
         a quite intelligent young man who appears to have little if any appreciation of the seriousness of what he has done.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour accepted that the Applicant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and allowed a discount of 25% in this respect (ROS4-5).  
     
      
    34 His Honour observed (ROS4): 
     
      
       
        
        “… it seems to me that all these events are linked in a way that makes it impossible to disentangle them and the principles of sentencing require in my opinion, that although I must impose sentences for each matter, I have to regard them all as part of one large event.” 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour referred to the Applicant’s criminal history and the fact that the present offences were committed whilst he was subject to a s.10 good behaviour bond for trespass. His Honour concluded that the Applicant was “a person of no significant previous criminality” and stated that he did “not propose to treat him as someone who was on conditional liberty” (ROS5).  
     
      
    36 His Honour said that the Applicant was to be treated as someone who “coldly and callously broke into a shop and deliberately set fire to curtains in it and then left” and then made “a deliberate decision” to go back and smash into another shop for the purpose of getting money. His Honour continued (ROS5): 
     
      
       
        
        “He could see after the second occasion a fire was spreading. He did nothing about it. He has acted coldly and callously and I think that although he is only 20 years old, he has to be sentenced on that basis.” 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour observed that the fire was “deliberately set”, was “not accidental” and “did not happen as a result of a prank gone wrong” (ROS5). 
     
      
    38 After reciting the maximum penalties for the offences, his Honour concluded that a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment should be imposed in relation to each matter after taking into account a 25% discount (ROS5). His Honour continued (ROS5): 
     
      
       
        
        “However because he is young, it is necessary, in my opinion, that I should find special circumstances and much reduce the sentence which I would otherwise give.” 
        
       
      
    39 A non-parole period of three years was fixed for each offence. His Honour recommended that the Applicant be placed in a young offenders programme and that “he be given assistance to overcome what appears to me to be deep seated though completely non-admitted psychological problems” (ROS6).  
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    40 The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (1) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      (2) The sentencing judge failed properly to consider the maximum penalties applicable to the offences. 
       
       
      (3) The sentencing judge failed to consider the appropriate sentence in relation to each individual offence. 
       
       
      (4) The sentencing judge failed to take into account that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity (pursuant to s.21A(3)(b)  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ). 
       
       
      (5) The sentencing judge failed properly to consider the quantum of damage to property. 
       
       
      (6) The sentencing judge wrongly admitted into evidence, and took into account, victim impact statements. 
       
      
    41 As there is some overlap between the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to consider the grounds under grouped headings. 
     
      
    42 It is appropriate to consider first Grounds 4, 5 and 6, which raise discrete issues, before returning to Grounds 1, 2 and 3 which, in different ways, contend that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground (4) - Offences Not Part of Planned or Organised Criminal Activity 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    43 Mr Wilson, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to treat as a mitigating factor the fact that the Applicant’s offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s.21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He acknowledged that no submission was advanced in the District Court on the Applicant’s behalf that this mitigating factor ought be found in this case. 
     
      
    44 The Crown submitted that no error has been demonstrated in this respect. It is not necessary for a sentencing judge to refer to each of the s.21A factors. Rather, it is necessary to take them into account only to the extent that they are relevant to the case before the Court: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193; R v Lilley (2004) 150 A Crim R 591 at [41], [53]; R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [5]. Further, the Crown submits that the fact that any aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the Court does not require the Court to increase or reduce the sentence for an offence: s.21A(5); R v FD [2006] NSWCCA 31 at [94].  
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    45 Counsel for the Applicant in the District Court did not ask the sentencing judge to find that a s.21A(3)(b) mitigating factor existed in this case. In these circumstances, it is difficult for the Applicant to make good the submission that error has been demonstrated in his Honour not making a finding to that effect.  
     
      
    46 In any event, it could not be said that all of the offences were spontaneous. The Applicant broke into the first premises, stole money and started the fire. He then returned a short time later and broke into the second premises from which money was stolen. 
     
      
    47 This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Grounds (5) and (6) - Damage to Property and Evidence from Victims Concerning Loss and Damage 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    48 In support of Ground (5), Mr Wilson submitted that the learned sentencing judge did not appear to have calculated exactly how much damage was occasioned by the offences either individually or globally. He acknowledged that the agreed facts sheet stated that the total cost of the damage to the building, and its contents, had been estimated at between $1.2 and $1.5 million. Mr Wilson pointed to the fact that the particular arson charges for which the Applicant was to be sentenced concerned five discrete retail premises and not the building as a whole. He submitted that it was not open to a sentencing court to have regard to damage to property extending beyond the specific property charged, relying by analogy upon sentencing principles concerning representative counts in sexual offences: R v JCW (2000) 112 A Crim R 466. Mr Wilson acknowledged that the material before the District Court demonstrated that the value of property damage to the five business premises (excluding economic loss) was in a total sum of $177,748.66.  
     
      
    49 With respect to Ground (6), Mr Wilson submitted that the learned sentencing judge wrongly admitted into evidence, and took into account, the victim impact statements from the five business persons. He submitted that the nature of the offences for which the Applicant stood to be sentenced lay outside the victim impact statement provisions in Division 2 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Wilson acknowledged that the statements had been tendered without objection in the sentencing proceedings. Nevertheless, he submitted that they were not admissible and ought not to have been relied upon by the sentencing judge. He submitted that an examination of his Honour’s remarks on sentence revealed that significant weight had been given to the contents of the statements, which disclosed substantial harm and loss experienced by the victims.  
     
      
    50 The Crown submitted that there was no objection to the tender of all material concerning quantum of loss in the District Court proceedings, including the victim impact statements, and that this material was available to be utilised on sentence. 
     
      
    51 With respect to the victim impact statements, the Crown did not contend that the statements were admissible pursuant to Division 2 of Part 3 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Rather, the Crown submitted that the material was admitted without objection, and was relevant to demonstrate the harm done to the victims which was relevant, at common law, on sentence: Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at 666 [29]. Further, the Crown submitted that his Honour was entitled to take into account that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offences was substantial: s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    52 The evidence concerning loss and harm to the five business persons was admitted without objection in the District Court sentencing proceedings. It is clear that the present offences were not offences to which the victim impact statement provisions in Division 2 of Part 3 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 had application. However, to succeed on the present grounds, the Applicant needs to demonstrate that the evidence concerning loss and harm to the victims ought not to have been taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    53 The fact that the statements were entitled ‘victim impact statements’, and were prepared on forms which were not appropriate technically to the offences, does not mean that the content of the statements was inadmissible. This is especially so as no objection was taken to the material tendered. It is not uncommon for material concerning loss and harm to victims of burglary and arson offences to be included in statements taken by police from victims, or in statements of facts used on sentence. 
     
      
    54 It is well established at common law that loss or damage suffered by a victim is a factor to be taken into account in the sentencing process: R v Webb [1971] VR 147 at 150-151; R v P (1992) 64 A Crim R 381 at 384-385; Siganto v The Queen at 664-666. Further, the evidence in this case was admissible with respect to the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(g) that the injury, emotional harm, loss and damage caused by the offences to the five business persons was substantial. In the District Court, the Crown submitted that the evidence of the victims supported a finding that the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(g) was demonstrated in this case (T9, 26 April 2007).  
     
      
    55 The purposes of sentencing include recognition of the harm done to the victim of crime and the community: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It has been said that the crime of arson may have profound consequences for innocent victims: Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Bright (2006) 163 A Crim R 538 at 540 [2]; 545 [22]. The monetary value of damage, and the loss of personal records, bear upon the objective seriousness of the crime: R v Davies (2006) 164 A Crim R 353 at 370 [97]. 
     
      
    56 I am satisfied that the evidence of the victims concerning harm and loss was both relevant and admissible in the sentencing proceedings. It bore upon the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s crimes and was properly taken into account on sentence. 
     
      
    57 No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s approach to evidence of loss and harm admitted, by consent, in the sentencing proceedings. These grounds of appeal ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Grounds (1), (2) and (3) - The Sentences Were Manifestly Excessive  
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    58 Mr Wilson submitted that the sentence for each offence was manifestly excessive having regard to the available maximum penalty, and by reference to sentencing statistics, in particular with respect to the arson offences under s.195(b) Crimes Act 1900. On each of the five s.195(b) counts, his Honour had imposed a head sentence of seven years after applying a 25% discount, meaning that the undiscounted head sentence in each case was nine years and four months as against a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    59 Likewise, he submitted that a head sentence of seven years for each of the break, enter and steal offences indicated an undiscounted starting point of 67% of the maximum penalty of 14 years. 
     
      
    60 A comparison of sentencing outcomes in other s.195(b) cases, it was submitted, reinforced the excessive sentence imposed on each of the five s.195(b) offences for which the Applicant stood to be sentenced. In this regard, counsel for the Applicant referred to cases including R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156, R v Glover [2002] NSWCCA 376 and R v Elzakhem [2008] NSWCCA 31. 
     
      
    61 Given that the five arson offences stemmed from a single act of setting fire to a curtain in one set of premises, Mr Wilson submitted that concurrent sentences were appropriate on those counts, but not concurrent sentences of the order imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    62 Counsel submitted that the act of arson was not premeditated and was spontaneous in nature. Although no explanation had been advanced by the Applicant for setting the fire beyond a type of anger, Mr Wilson emphasised that this was not a case involving financial gain or revenge on the part of the Applicant. He submitted that, although the Applicant intended to set fire to the curtain, it was his evidence that he did not intend to cause wider destruction. As a result, although the Applicant was guilty of maliciously destroying property, his conduct ought be characterised as reckless and not intentional with respect to the wider damage caused. Accordingly, Mr Wilson submitted that the arson offences, although serious, could not be characterised as being at a level of objective seriousness as to attract the sentences imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    63 Mr Wilson submitted that the break, enter and steal offences were otherwise unremarkable (leaving aside the arson offences) so that sentences of the order imposed in the District Court were manifestly excessive. As the arson offences were committed in the course of one of the break, enter and steal offences, he submitted that concurrency was appropriate with that offence. He acknowledged that the second break, enter and steal offence was a separate incident, but emphasised that it occurred soon after the first break, enter and steal offence and in nearby premises. 
     
      
    64 With respect to the Applicant’s submissions based upon statistical material for s.195(b) sentences, the Crown submitted that such material was of limited utility: R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739; Wong v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; R v AEM and Others [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [116]. 
     
      
    65 The Crown emphasised that the Applicant was being sentenced in relation to multiple offences and not one offence. 
     
      
    66 The Crown submitted that his Honour had correctly taken into account, adversely to the Applicant, the serious harm and loss suffered by the small business persons affected by the fire. The Crown submitted that the arson offences were aggravated by the fact that they were committed without regard for public safety (s.21A(2)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) and that the emotional harm, loss and damage caused to the victims by the offence was substantial (s.21A(2)(g)). Further, the Crown submitted that substantial sentences were appropriate to recognise the harm done to the victims of the crime and the community: s.3A(g). 
     
      
    67 The Crown submitted that his Honour was clearly aware of the maximum penalties in relation to the offences, and that it was necessary to keep in mind that sentences were being imposed for multiple offences which otherwise would have required a measure of accumulation.  
     
      
    68 The Crown submitted that these offences were objectively serious and led to the destruction of valuable property, and that a considerable element of personal and general deterrence was warranted. The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    69 I do not consider that the Applicant’s reliance upon other sentencing decisions establishes a range of sentences which assists an argument that the present sentences are manifestly excessive. The practice of approaching sentencing appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor supported by authority: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]-[49].  
     
      
    70 Nor do sentencing statistics advance the Applicant’s case. The function of the courts is to sentence an offender by the application of correct sentencing principles, commencing with the gravity of the offence, and not by reference to the statistical median range of sentences handed down over a period of time: R v AEM and Others at [116]. 
     
      
    71 Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated error with respect to the sentences passed in the District Court.  
     
      
    72 The approach adopted by his Honour is similar to that which has been criticised by this Court in a number of cases including R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at 265-267 and R v Merrin (2007) 174 A Crim R 100 at 107-108. In R v Knight, I observed at 266-267 [78]-[79] (with the concurrence of Mason P and Barr J): 
     
      
       
        
        “To select a sentence appropriate to the overall criminality and impose that sentence, in particular, in respect of all of the s.112(1) charges is an approach which cannot survive the application of the principles in  
        Pearce 
        . An examination of the facts of the 27 offences under s.112(1) reveals that the offences varied in significant respects in their objective seriousness. An identical sentence for each of the 27 offences cannot be supported in principle. On this approach, as Simpson J observed in  
        Hammoud 
         at paragraph 10, all sentences would appear excessive for the specific charges to which they related even when the ultimate term to be served was unimpeachable.  
         
         
        Indeed, a submission advanced by Counsel for the present Applicant illustrates this very difficulty. Having regard to the aggregate 50% discount allowed by the learned sentencing judge for the pleas of guilty, remorse and assistance to the authorities, Counsel contended that sentences of nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years would clearly be an excessive starting point for each of the s.112(1) offences. The fact that such an argument is available to be advanced points to the difficulty which has arisen from his Honour’s failure to approach the imposition of sentence in accordance with  
        Pearce 
         and  
        Hammoud 
        .” 
        
       
      
    73 In R v Merrin, Howie J (Giles JA and Fullerton J agreeing) said at 107 [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no justification for imposing a sentence for one offence that is increased to encompass the criminality of all offending. Such an approach, apparently adopted by the Judge, runs contrary to sentencing practice that has been followed since  
        Pearce 
         and for nearly a decade. As counsel for the respondent pointed out, a single offence of break enter and steal committed by an 18 years old youth with limited record would not ordinarily warrant a sentence of imprisonment for four years. Yet that is the sentence that the Judge imposed for each of the offences of non-aggravated break, enter and steal. Although it has been recognized by the High Court that the principle in  
        Pearce 
         is not the only method of achieving totality when sentencing from multiple offences; see  
        Johnson v The Queen 
         (2004) 78 ALJR 616, no appellate court has authorised the manner in which the sentencing judge approached the task before him since  
        Pearce 
         was decided.” 
        
       
      
    74 The approach to sentence adopted in this case does not comply with the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. Further, the imposition of a type of “one size fits all” set of sentences will serve to distort sentencing statistics which are retained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and made available to assist sentencing courts. 
     
      
    75 It does not always follow that this Court will intervene and resentence when an error such as this occurs: AJO v R [2008] NSWCCA 28 at [33]; Kerr v R [2008] NSWCCA 133 at [34]-[36]. It is necessary for the Court to consider whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    76 I am satisfied that the individual sentences imposed for each offence in this case are manifestly excessive. With respect to the arson offences, the head sentence imposed for each offence is close to the maximum penalty for the offence.  
     
      
    77 Making all due allowance for the principle of totality, in my view, the head sentences are manifestly excessive having regard to the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the offender.  
     
      
    78 Accordingly, with respect to head sentence, I am satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been imposed: s.6(3). I will return to the issue of the non-parole period later in this judgment.  
     
      
      Resentencing the Applicant 
       
      
    79 As it is necessary to resentence the Applicant, I have regard to the affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 22 April 2008 together with the affidavits of the Applicant’s solicitor, John Pearson, affirmed 2 May 2008 and 6 May 2008. This evidence relates to courses and employment undertaken by the Applicant whilst in custody together with psychiatric assistance being provided to him in the prison setting. I have regard to that evidence in determining appropriate sentences to be passed upon the Applicant in this Court. 
     
      
    80 The gravity of a s.195(b) offence is recognised by the maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment, twice that available for a s.195(a) offence where property is damaged or destroyed other than by fire or explosion: R v Baker at [13]. The circumstance of the possible spread of fire may be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence: R v Baker at [16]. It is appropriate to take into account the potential risk of physical injury to other persons in determining sentence for a s.195(b) offence: R v Glover at [53]-[57]. 
     
      
    81 The crime of arson may be committed in a variety of circumstances. It is an extremely serious and dangerous crime: R v James (1981) 27 SASR 348 at 351; R v Davies at 358 [44]. The motive of the offender is relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence: Newton v State of Western Australia [2006] WASCA 247 at [13]. Courts have observed that arson is very easy to commit, usually with destructive (if not tragic) consequences: R v Catts (1996) 85 A Crim R 171 at 176; Newton v State of Western Australia at [12]. It has been said that arson is often a difficult crime to detect: R v Davies at 370 [97]. Consideration of factors such as these has led courts to emphasise the importance of general deterrence in arson cases. 82 In this case, the Applicant was affected by alcohol to some extent, but not to an extent that affects his culpability in any significant way. Having broken into the first premises and stolen $50.00 in coins, the Applicant set fire to a curtain in circumstances where the spreading of fire was almost inevitable. The Applicant was aware that the first shop formed part of commercial premises with other businesses in the building. No explanation for setting the fire has been proffered beyond a state of anger. The Applicant was thinking coolly enough to cross the road to the service station to change the stolen coins for paper currency. Although he could see that the fire was burning in the first shop, he then decided to break into a second shop to steal more money. He then departed the scene with a fire developing in the first shop. It is clear that the fire spread quickly. The Fire Brigade was sufficiently concerned about the fire to evacuate persons living in adjacent residential premises. Not only was very substantial property damage caused, but persons were placed at risk by the Applicant’s conduct in setting the fire. 
     
      
    83 The very substantial loss and personal stress experienced by each of the five business persons may be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s crimes. In R v Knight at 269 [93], it was observed that owners of small business premises in rural areas may be hit especially hard by burglary offences and are entitled to the protection of the law. This statement has application to the present case with respect to both the break, enter and steal offences and the arson offences. In my view, the substantial detrimental effect of the Applicant’s crimes on these victims constituted an aggravating factor with respect to the arson offences: s.21A(2)(g). 
     
      
    84 The lack of motive for the arson offences beyond an arbitrary act of destruction is both puzzling and concerning. The fact that the Applicant lit a fire, with most serious consequences, without any reason being proffered for his conduct, does not mitigate the seriousness of the crime. The Applicant’s present inability to explain why he engaged in such dangerous and destructive criminal conduct does not assist him when issues of personal deterrence and his prospects of rehabilitation come to be considered.  
     
      
    85 At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Wilson submitted that the learned sentencing judge was correct in concluding that the present offences were not committed whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty for the purpose of s.21A(2)(j). He contended that the Applicant was subject to a s.10 good behaviour bond for an offence of trespass for which the maximum available penalty was a fine, and not imprisonment. In this way, Mr Wilson submitted that the Applicant was not subjected to “conditional liberty” for the purpose of this provision.  
     
      
    86 In Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81 at [24], it was held that the commission of an offence, whilst the offender was subject to a s.10 good behaviour bond, constituted the aggravating factor listed in s.21A(2)(j) of the Act regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed. However, it was not the case in Frigiani v R that the offence for which the s.10 good behaviour bond had been granted was one for which imprisonment was not an available sentence. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the purpose of s.21A(2)(j) is to capture the common law principle that an offence committed whilst a person is subject to conditional liberty, whether on bail or whilst subject to a good behaviour bond or a community service order or periodic detention or parole, constitutes an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentence. The essence of the provision is that the offender commits a further offence whilst subject to an order of a court in criminal proceedings requiring, amongst other things, that the offender be of good behaviour. I do not consider that the term “conditional liberty” in the section is confined to circumstances where the foundational offence giving rise to the conditional liberty is one which itself must be punishable by imprisonment.  
     
      
    87 Even if this view was wrong, however, the common law principle remains applicable given that s.21A does not purport to codify the law in this area: s.21A(1). Even if the commission of the offences whilst the Applicant was subject to a s.10 good behaviour bond for trespass did not constitute the statutory aggravating factor, it would constitute an available aggravating factor at common law. I approach the sentencing of the Applicant upon the basis that his commission of these offences, whilst being subject to a good behaviour bond, was an aggravating factor on sentence.  
     
      
    88 I have regard to the Applicant’s youth and limited criminal history and the fact that this constitutes his first term of imprisonment. Any assessment concerning the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded having regard to the absence of explanation for his serious criminal conduct reflected in the arson offences. The first burglary offence and the arson offences appear to have been unplanned. However, the characterisation of these offences as a random burglary, accompanied by a wanton act of arson, does not assist the Applicant on sentence. The second burglary offence was a considered act undertaken by the Applicant for personal financial gain. His departure from the premises knowing that a fire had been started, without any concern on his part as to the quelling of the fire, does not assist him on sentence.  
     
      
    89 No challenge was made by the Crown to the 25% discount referable to the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, and I will apply a similar discount on resentencing the Applicant. I am satisfied that special circumstances exist having regard to the youth of the Applicant, the fact that this is his first sentence of imprisonment and the appropriateness of supervision in the community for an extended period upon his release. 
     
      
    90 In my view, the relevant principles with respect to accumulation, concurrency and totality will be satisfied by the imposition of concurrent sentences for the arson offences. It was the single act of setting the fire which caused these offences, although several offences resulted with substantial harm and loss resulting to multiple victims. I consider that the first break, enter and steal offence ought be partially accumulated upon the sentences for the arson offences. The second break, enter and steal offence ought also be partially accumulated given that it was a second and separate burglary offence, although one committed soon after the first offence. 
     
      
    91 Although the head sentences ought be reduced, I am satisfied that an effective minimum term of imprisonment for three years is appropriate and a non-parole period of that duration ought remain. 
     
      
    92 Where a finding is made that a head sentence is manifestly excessive, it is necessary to consider whether the non-parole period is, in turn, manifestly excessive. In many cases, this may follow almost as a matter of course. If the sentencing judge has retained the statutory ratio under s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, then a finding of manifest excess in the non-parole period may be clear. In this case, his Honour applied a very substantial s.44 variation with a head sentence of seven years and a non-parole period of three years. The non-parole period comprised about 43% of the head sentence. Of course, the balance of the term must not exceed 33⅓% of the non-parole period unless the court decides that there are special circumstances: s.44(2). As I have said, the balance of the term here constituted a very substantial variation of the statutory ratio. 
     
      
    93 The sentencing judge gave brief reasons (set out at [38] above) for varying the statutory ratio. In my view, those reasons are not persuasive so as to explain a non-parole period which is 43% of the head sentence. A finding of special circumstances authorises a reduction in the otherwise appropriate non-parole period. It does not authorise an increase in the term of the sentence. It would be erroneous to extend the length of the head sentence beyond that which would otherwise be called for to allow for a protracted period of supervised liberty to the offender: R v Mauri [2005] NSWCCA 272 at [37]. 
     
      
    94 In my view, there is something of a disconnect between the head sentence and the non-parole period in this case. Although error has been demonstrated with respect to the head sentence, no error has been demonstrated concerning the non-parole period. It would be wrong to reduce the non-parole period, in an automatic way, because error had been demonstrated in the head sentence: R v Porteous [2005] NSWCCA 115 at [44]. A non-parole period of three years represents the minimum term of imprisonment which ought be served by the Applicant: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; R v Porteous at [53]. 
     
      
    95 A total head sentence of five years and three months will be imposed. The result will see an effective non-parole period of three years remaining as part of the sentence. In my view, this is the minimum period that the Applicant should spend in prison having regard to all the elements of punishment, including the objective seriousness of his crimes, deterrence, denunciation, protection of the community and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances: R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at 440-441 [33]-[34]. 
     
      
    96 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) leave is granted to appeal against sentences imposed on 26 April 2007 in the Orange District Court; 
       
       
      (b) appeal allowed and sentences imposed on 26 April 2007 are quashed; 
       
       
      (c) in lieu thereof, the Applicant is sentenced: 
       
       
        
        (1) for the offence of break, enter and steal on Bradley’s Florist shop - imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months to date from 1 March 2007 and to expire on 29 February 2008; 
         
         
        (2) with respect to each of the five offences under s.195(b)  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         - imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 1 September 2007 and expiring on 28 February 2010 with a balance of term of two years and three months commencing on 1 March 2010 and expiring on 31 May 2012; 
         
         
        (3) for the offence of break, enter and steal on Swish Homes and Living - imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to date from 1 December 2007 and to expire on 31 May 2009. 
        
       
      
    97 The earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 28 February 2010. I confirm the recommendation made in the District Court that the Applicant be placed in a young offenders programme and that he be provided with psychological counselling whilst in custody.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for extension of time for seeking leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed on 30 July 2004 and, if granted, to proceed with that application. At the hearing the Court received argument on the merits and indicated that the issues of extension of time and leave would be dealt with when judgment was delivered. The Crown opposed the granting of an extension. The magnitude of the sentences which I will shortly detail supplies sufficient reason not to apply a time bar nor to refuse leave to appeal. It is not necessary to explore the procedural failures whereby the applicant did not comply with time limits for filing notices and grounds of appeal and I would grant the extension and leave to appeal and proceed to a determination of the merits. 
     
      
    3 The appellant pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court before Davidson AJ to two counts of murder, for each of which a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for life was available. Both killings took place at Sutherland on 28 May 2002. On the first count for the murder of Mark O’Callaghan the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total term of 26 years commencing on 29 May 2002 with a non parole period of 19 years 6 months expiring on 28 November 2021, and on the second count for the murder of Tammy Lee (Tamika) MacKenzie to a total term of 35 years commencing on 29 May 2014 with a non parole period of 26 years 6 months expiring on 28 November 2040. The overall result was a total sentence of imprisonment for 47 years with a non parole period of 38 years 6 months. 
     
      
    4 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the learned sentencing judge and there was also tendered, as his Honour’s remarks on sentence demonstrate, a bundle of documents which included a number of witness statements.  
     
      
    5 During the course of 28 May the appellant with others including one Lachlan Black were at Unit 1 of a residential block. The victims, Mark O’Callaghan and Tammy Lee MacKenzie occupied Unit 4, the entrance to which was directly opposite that of Unit 1. The appellant and Black, together with Ian Donovan the regular occupant of Unit 1, were consuming alcohol from early that day. 
     
      
    6 Sometime after 6 pm O’Callaghan entered Unit 1. Black grasped him in what was described as a “bear hug” and both Black and the appellant remonstrated with him, suggesting that in some way he had been involved in actions and interference concerning drug dealing in which they had an interest. They commenced to beat O’Callaghan with their fists. 
     
      
    7 Another man (Arens) entered the unit and called on them to stop. They did not desist and the appellant armed himself with a cricket bat. He ignored a plea from Arens to give the bat to him. O’Callaghan had put his hands about his head for his protection and the appellant jabbed him in the stomach with the bat which caused O’Callaghan to move his hands and the appellant then began to strike him on the head with the bat causing an apparent loss of consciousness. 
     
      
    8 O’Callaghan slumped to the floor and the appellant dragged him into Unit 4 where he deposited him into a lounge chair and then resumed striking him with the bat. Ms MacKenzie was in the unit at the time. She was crying and asking the appellant (and Black who had joined him) to cease. A witness to these events (Ms Rawhiti) had come from Unit 8 with others to see what was causing the commotion and she counted 15 blows which the appellant rained on O’Callaghan with the bat. Thereafter Ms Rawhiti saw the appellant adjust the blinds in Unit 4 and switch off the lights.  
     
      
    9 She returned to Unit 8 where a number of people including the appellant then gathered. Some marijuana was smoked. Among other things the appellant said, “Come on, give me a cone, I need it to do this shit, I need to kill Tamika. Justin, come down and help us.” (His Honour found that Justin was a Justin Brennan, who was acquitted of any complicity in the murders). 
     
      
    10 Next the appellant, Ms Rawhiti and some others who had been in Unit 8 departed in a car driven by Mr Fogarty, who was apparently the regular occupant of Unit 8. The excursion included obtaining some goods from a fast food outlet. While on the journey the appellant was heard to say on numerous occasions, “I killed Mark, Mark is dead.” After returning to the unit block the appellant entered Unit 1 and Ms Rawhiti noticed Ms MacKenzie in there and that her face appeared bloodied. 
     
      
    11 Given the circumstance that many, if not all, of the witnesses were partaking of alcohol or marijuana or both, it is unsurprising that his Honour chronicled their statements rather than attempting to extract therefrom a precise chronology. It is clear, however, that the appellant expressed his motive for intending to kill Ms MacKenzie to be preventing her from reporting the murder of O’Callaghan to the police. His Honour expressly found that the appellant harboured this motive. 
     
      
    12 In Unit 1 the appellant had armed himself with a filleting knife which he obtained from the kitchen. He threatened Ms MacKenzie with the knife and ordered her to take off her clothes. She complied. He then told her to put them back on and she did so. Thereafter she was dragged from the unit into a garage and while she was on the ground in there, the appellant and Black took hold of her. Black was described as ramming her head against a door after which he and the appellant dragged her further to the inside of a meter room. In that room Ms MacKenzie died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries and knife wounds. It was the appellant who was responsible for the stabbing and it was noted that the broken blade of the knife which he used was found nearby when the body was later located. Black had been wielding a piece of timber which was also found nearby and noticed to be in a bloodstained state. It was a powerful demonstration of the appellant’s callousness that on the following morning 29 May in reference to killing O’Callaghan he was heard to remark, “I hit him for six. Don Bradman would have been proud of me.” His Honour’s remarks on sentence recite considerable detail from the content of the witness statements including other quotations of what the appellant was heard to say from time to time. I will not pause to recapitulate all this material which was to similar effect to the foregoing. 
     
      
    13 Police came to the unit on 29 May in response to a number of telephone calls to the 000 service. O’Callaghan’s body was still on the lounge in Unit 4 and MacKenzie’s body was in the meter room.  
     
      
    14 As is apparent from the above descriptions Black was a joint participant with the appellant in the killing. He was also charged with the murders and was found not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    15 The first ground of appeal asserted that each of the sentences was manifestly excessive. His Honour referred to the appellant’s motive for killing O’Callaghan: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the Crown does not view the killing of Mr O’Callaghan as being related to drug-dealing activities, in my view it is the only hypothesis which appears from the evidence as a motive for the killing of Mr O’Callaghan.” 
        
       
      
    16 Whether the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs by the appellant prior to the commission of the murders might be a matter of mitigation is debatable, however, his Honour made a significant finding in those regards, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst the consumption of alcohol and of illegal substances, namely cannabis, may have contributed to the prisoner’s participation in the killings, I am not persuaded, even on the balance of probabilities, that his acts are explicable solely in terms of that consumption of even substantially in terms of it.” 
        
       
      
    17 The total term which his Honour would have imposed for the murder of O’Callaghan was stated to be 30 years, but he reduced this to 26 years for this reason: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the head sentence to be imposed and dealing firstly with count 1 relating to Mr O’Callaghan, subject to an appropriate discount for plea of guilty I will impose a sentence of thirty years imprisonment. Whilst twenty per cent discount for such a plea might otherwise be regarded as appropriate, if applied in this case it would have, in my view, the effect of bringing the sentence below the level warranted by the objective circumstances of the offence after taking into consideration all other relevant circumstances. Accordingly, I propose to allow a discount of four years for the plea of guilty which represents a discount of just over thirteen per cent.” 
        
       
      
    18 In reaching that conclusion his Honour found that the murder of O’Callaghan by the appellant did not fall into the category of a worst case nor were the statutory requirements of s 61 (1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 met so as to mandate imposition of a life sentence. 
     
      
    19 The submission by senior counsel for the appellant was that an “unpremeditated murder” did not justify a 30 year sentence in the circumstances. 
     
      
    20 At the sentencing hearing the Crown Prosecutor had accepted that the appellant had joined in an attack on O’Callaghan which was initiated by Black. Potential mitigation by reason of this circumstance, even if it were thought appropriate, was counterbalanced by the possession of the motive harboured by the appellant which, although not precisely defined, was related to O’Callaghan’s asserted interference in his drug dealing activity. It was found that he harboured a specific intention to kill. Pleas by the victim for the appellant to desist from his attack were ignored.  
     
      
    21 The brutality applied by the appellant was extreme and, although there have been expressions of remorse later, the appellant’s statements at the time, one of which I have quoted, demonstrated a high degree of callousness. 
     
      
    22 Little relevant guidance can be derived from attempting to compare the commission of one murder with any other and caution needs to be exercised in looking at statistics, but it can be observed that in a survey of 203 cases of murder in a schedule attached to the appellant’s written submissions, 49 offenders who received determinate sentences had total terms exceeding 20 years imposed. This survey included “all offenders” and the terms would have been imposed after any “discounts” such as recognizing pleas of guilty. Nineteen of the 203 offenders received life terms.  
     
      
    23 It was not submitted that the learned sentencing judge took into account some matter which he should not have nor that he omitted to take into account some matter which he should. I am unpersuaded that his assessment lay outside the discretionary range nor outside any established sentencing pattern. It may be, as counsel observed, that the overall sentence in this case is the longest (excluding life terms) which his researches were able to detect but the observation ignores the critical circumstance that any pattern must take account of the life sentences. The submission that the individual sentence imposed upon the first count was excessive should be rejected. 
     
      
    24 The written submissions on behalf of the appellant canvassed a number of cases in which sentences for murder had been imposed. Subject to the references I will later make, there is nothing to be gained by summarizing the invariably distinguishable circumstances of offences and offenders which led to impositions different from those under present challenge. 
     
      
    25 In the course of the sentencing hearing the Crown Prosecutor put to his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first one was very close to the worst category. The second one even closer to the worst category to murder, in the Crown’s respectful submission, due to the protracted nature of the killings, in both cases; the fact that both killings were done by the prisoner with another assailant and the begging for mercy that both victims did during the course of the savage and horrific course of events which led to their deaths.” 
        
       
      
    26 It is observed that in a later exchange when the issue of cumulation for the second killing was under discussion, the following occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: …we know what the suggested motivation for is so far as Ms Mackenzie is concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, a completely different motivation which would call for a very substantial measure of accumulation in the Crown’s submission because it was a killing of a very different character which took place. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: When you say that does that mean the Crown does not press upon me the maximum? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I am instructed that it is a policy of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to press that in any case.” 
        
       
      
    27 Of course it is not disputed that it was for his Honour to make findings and he was not bound by any Crown concession. He gave express consideration both to the concept of the worst case category and to the statutory provision abovementioned. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Mandatory life sentences for certain offences 
        
       
       
        
        61 (1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    28 The relevant finding was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A sentence of life imprisonment under that section is required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest and the combined effect of the community interest in one or more of retribution, punishment, community protection or deterrence can only be met, and I stress the word only, by a sentence of life imprisonment. In my view the level of culpability having regard to the circumstances surrounding and causally connected with the murder of Ms MacKenzie has reached this level. The circumstances of her death also meets the worst category case test at common law.” 
        
       
      
    29 As above noted, an indeterminate sentence was not imposed for the second murder but a term of 35 years imprisonment. His Honour’s reasons were stated thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “An indeterminate sentence as to Ms MacKenzie’s murder is justified leaving aside, as I have already indicated, consideration of the plea of guilty and the relative youth of the prisoner in combination. I have come to the conclusion, however, that, having regard to those factors in combination, an indeterminate sentence ought not to be imposed for the murder of Ms MacKenzie either but that a lengthy determinate sentence is justified.” 
        
       
      
    30 In R v Lo [2003] NSWCCA 313 an offender whose crime of murder (a “contract killing”) was found by the sentencing judge to meet the requirements of s 61 (1) was nevertheless given a determinate sentence, the departure from the mandatory life term being based upon mitigation arising from a plea of guilty and assistance to authority. In the present instance, as above noted, the factors were a plea of guilty and the youth of the appellant. In Lo O’Keefe J with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “31 Where an indeterminate sentence would otherwise be appropriate, a plea of guilty or assistance to the authorities or a combination of the two may in an appropriate case have the effect of reducing an indeterminate sentence to a finite sentence, that is a sentence for a term of years. Whether a plea of guilty or assistance or both or any other appropriate factors will have such an effect will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. 
        
       
       
        
        32 When confronted with the problem dealt with in the preceding paragraph, Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that the considerations which may lead to an indeterminate sentence that would otherwise have been imposed being reduced to a sentence for a finite term of years, should be looked at for a second time, once the decision had been made to effect such reduction. In my opinion this submission fails. Once the factors of the pleas of guilty and the assistance given to the authorities have brought about a reduction in the sentence their force is spent. To allow them to be used again would be to allow a ‘double dipping’ in relation to them. That does not accord with notions of justice. Furthermore, there is no warrant in the statutory regime for such a process, nor any warrant in the common law for it.” 
        
       
      
    31 In a separate judgment Greg James J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “48 I consider that in fixing the length of that determinate sentence passed in lieu of a life sentence in these circumstances it would still be appropriate to have regard to the plea of guilty and any assistance that had been forthcoming. 
        
       
       
        
        49 But in doing so, it would be important to avoid the double dipping to which O’Keefe J refers. If the sentencing process is not conducted in discrete stages, in my view, that end should be capable of being attained.” 
        
       
      
    32 Although the qualification in the second paragraph just quoted is to be observed, his Honour appears to be dissenting from the view that factors which reduce what would otherwise be to a life sentence to a specific term of years are thereby spent of force. The view of the majority must prevail. 
     
      
    33 In expressing his assessment of penalty for the murder of Ms MacKenzie his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the second count involving the murder of Ms MacKenzie, I decline to impose a penalty of life imprisonment because of, as I have already indicated, the plea of guilty together with a consideration of the prisoner’s youth. I propose, in respect of the second count of the indictment involving Ms MacKenzie, a sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment with no discount for pleas of guilty in light of the decision in  
        Lo’s 
         case. I will set a non-parole period of twenty six and half years as to that count.” 
        
       
      
    34 The approach which his Honour applied conforms with authority and no error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    35 Ground 2 asserted error in his Honour’s direction that the sentence for the second murder commence after 12 years have been served in respect of the first murder. 
     
      
    36 The remarks on sentence show that his Honour paid express attention to the relevant issue. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Turning now to questions of totality and of concurrence or accumulation in whole or in part. The principle of totality has some application in so far as these offences were part of one course of criminal conduct being connected in point of time and other circumstances. In terms of motive, however, there is a clear distinction. Further, in my view making these sentences wholly concurrent would result in an overall sentence below that required by an assessment of the totality of criminality disclosed by the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, I propose that the sentences should be partly concurrent, the sentence on the second count commencing twelve years after the commencement of the sentence imposed on the first count which is to commence from date of arrest, 29 May 2002.” 
        
       
      
    37 Although, as his Honour found, the two killings took place as part of one course of criminal conduct, the correctness of which finding was not challenged by the Crown, it is important to recognize that his Honour did not find that the two deaths arose out of a single eruption into violence as in some circumstances may be the case. There was a significant separation in that the attack on O’Callaghan was motivated by something relating to drug dealing and his Honour found it was accompanied by some lack of premeditation in contrast with the express motivation and intention to remove Ms MacKenzie as a potential source of a report to police. The existence of the connection between the two crimes is obvious but they were neither contemporaneous in any sense, nor were they a result of some unity of criminal behaviour. The second murder was an independent crime which sought, however unlikely it was to succeed, to remove the appellant from some risk of retribution for what he had done to O’Callaghan. 
     
      
    38 In a submission comprehending challenge to individual sentences as well as the combined result, senior counsel for the appellant drew attention to the several references throughout the remarks on sentence to the appellant’s substance ingestion and his state of intoxication and he submitted that the reduction thereby of the appellant’s capacity for right judgment ought to have mitigated his Honour’s assessment. The references to affectation and intoxication are compatible with what his Honour had said and I have above quoted, namely that although consumption may have contributed to the appellant’s participation in the crime, it was not substantial.  
     
      
    39 On both the issues of total term and the direction for accumulation, counsel referred to R v Folbigg [2005] 152 A Crim R 35. In that case the offender had been convicted by a jury on four counts of murder (counts 2 to 5) and one count of manslaughter (count 1). In the judgment of this Court, Sully J (Dunford and Hidden JJ concurring) stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “…That some cumulation was warranted is, in my opinion, plainly correct. But the structuring of the sentences passed in connection with counts 4 and 5 entails that the sentence on count 4, a heavy sentence in any event, does not commence until 7 years after the commencement of the sentence on count 3, and 10 years after the commencement of the sentence on count 1; while the sentence on count 5, an even heavier sentence, does not commence until 8 years after the commencement of the sentence on count 4, and 18 years after the commencement of the sentence on count 1. 
        
       
       
        
        These are quite extraordinary cumulations. The prospect that they offer the appellant is so crushingly discouraging as to put at risk any incentive that she might have to apply herself to her rehabilitation. That seems to me to indicate, without more, error.” 
        
       
      
    40 Sully J added that a head sentence (as the total effectively was) of 40 years with a non parole period of 30 years was so “crushing” as to manifest covert error. Although that offender was liable on each of four counts to a sentence of life imprisonment, it is self evident that the sentencing judge had determined that such sentences not be imposed. Sully J agreed with his reasons for so concluding. It scarcely needs to be said that if one were to engage in comparative descriptions, a life sentence would be more “crushing” than any determinate sentence, at least if it is scheduled to expire before the attainment of anticipated life expectancy. 
     
      
    41 It was observed in Folbigg that the situation of the individual offender was such as to lead to prediction that she may have been 66 to 76 years of age before she might be paroled. The appellant was born on 13 December 1981. 
     
      
    42 Courts are not unfamiliar with descriptions of sentences as “crushing” but that does not articulate some applicable test. A life sentence would presumably fall within the ambit of that description but the legitimacy of availability of a life sentence is not open to challenge. Whilst the language in Folbigg is general in terms it does not purport to, nor could it, detract from the well established principle that justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment. The judgment in that case was, of course, delivered after his Honour’s impositions in this instance but it did not reveal any principle demonstrating that there had been error in the assessment of sentences received by the appellant. 
     
      
    43 His Honour recorded his consideration of subjective matters advanced on behalf of the appellant but necessarily had to implement his findings about the objective seriousness of these crimes. Included in his remarks there is a poignant expression: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that these killings were perpetrated with extreme brutality in which the prisoner took at least an equal part with Mr Black. Indeed the evidence supports the conclusion that he took the leading part. The victims were, to all intents and purposes, defenceless and each of them was pleading for his and her life before and during the acts causing death. The image conjured by the evidence of Ms MacKenzie being dragged screaming in terror to be slaughtered in the meter room in particular raises for consideration whether the acts causing death exhibited by the evidence here, together with the other circumstances relating to her death, fall into the worst case classification at common law and the provisions of s 61 of the  
        Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    44 I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
    45 Grounds 3 and 4 relate to the specification of the non parole periods. His Honour made express reference to s 44 of the sentencing legislation, which it is not necessary to recite. He expressly declined to find special circumstances so as to vary the proportion of non parole period by reducing it below 75 percent of total term. That some of the circumstances may have sufficed to enable such a finding to be made did not oblige his Honour to make it and he committed no error in this regard. 
     
      
    46 The Crown did not dispute the arithmetical error raised by ground 4 which shows that, if, as is apparent, his Honour intended to apply the proportion mentioned in the statute then the non parole period in respect of the sentence for the second murder should have been 26 years 3 months rather than 26 years 6 months. This will cease to be of significance if the adjustment which I will propose is implemented. 
     
      
    47 A challenge is directed to the consequence that, as a result of the direction for cumulation, the overall period to be served before eligibility for consideration for parole represents a little over 81 percent of the total term. The statutory provision does not require the giving of reasons for setting a non parole period which exceeds 75 percent of the total term but it has been said to be expected that they will be provided as, especially when cumulation has been ordered, the omission may be regarded as a demonstration of error: R v Dunn [2006] NSWCCA 12. All the indications are that his Honour did not intend to depart from the 75 percent ratio and the consequences after cumulation were overlooked. I consider that there should be an adjustment to achieve this in respect of the total term as well as the individual sentences. I perceive no reason for a greater than 75 percent ratio. 
     
      
    48 In a practical way an appropriate outcome can be achieved by recognizing the result of the cumulation as a special circumstance itself and reducing the non parole period in respect of the second count so as to establish an eligibility date for parole at the point of 75 percent of the overall term. 
     
      
    49 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) Application for extension of time and leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      (b) Appeal allowed in part. 
       
       
      (c) That the order specifying a non parole period of 26 years 6 months commencing on 29 May 2014 and expiring on 28 May 2040 in respect of the conviction for the murder of Tammy Lee MacKenzie be quashed and in lieu thereof there be specified a non parole period of 23 years 3 months commencing on 29 May 2014 and expiring on 28 August 2037. 
       
       
      (d) The earliest date of eligibility for consideration of parole specified as 28 August 2037.

   Judgment1. The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation for two publications by the Newcastle Herald on 22 and 23 December 2005. As they were published prior to the commencement of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) the defendants’ challenge to imputations needs to be considered under the law applicable to actions brought under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). 
    2. The plaintiff pleads that the first matter complained of (the text of which is annexure “A” to this judgment) gives rise to the following imputations: 
     
      
     (a) That the plaintiff took unauthorised rest periods whilst working in his professional capacity as nurse. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff was responsible through his negligence for the death of Leona Escreet. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff was grossly negligent in his professional capacity as nurse. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff’s denial through counsel that he was sleeping whilst on duty was a lie, and he in consequence a liar. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff was a person who would lie under oath. 
      
    3. The plaintiff pleads that the second matter complained of (the text of which is annexure “B” to this judgment) gives rise to the following imputations: 
     
     (a) That the plaintiff was negligent in his professional capacity as nurse in that he took unauthorised rest periods. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff lied under oath. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff made fraudulent entries into a patient’s records. 
      
     (d) That the gross professional negligence of the plaintiff led to the death of Leona Escreet at Gosford Hospital’s Mandala Clinic on October 3, 2002. 
    4. I shall deal with the objections to the capacity and form of the imputations in accordance with the principles set out in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 254 and Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37. 
    Capacity5. Each of the matters complained of is an account of a coronial inquiry. The defendants challenge the capacity of all of the imputations on the basis that an imputation of suspicion, at best, was made out.6. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that regard should be had to the whole of the published matter (Malcolm at [10]). While counsel for the defendants agreed that this was so, great emphasis was placed on the headlines and captions which, it was submitted, made it clear that there were two sides to the story: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin (2003) 77 ALJR 1657 at 1662 per McHugh J.7. Each matter must be considered separately from the other.  
    The First Matter Complained Of8. The heading of this article is “Claims senior staff asleep on the job” and a series of pictures appear under the caption “Fight”. It is certainly clear from these parts of the publication that there are allegations which are being investigated.9. The problem lies in the way the first three paragraphs of the article are presented. I have highlighted the relevant words: 
     
     “ 
     A junior nurse fled a court in tears yesterday after evidence of unauthorised two-hour “breaks” by two senior staff  
     on the night a Central Coast mental health patient took her own life. 
      
      
     A barrister for the two male nurses said they would deny sleeping on the job  
     at Gosford Hospital’s Mandala mental health unit, or attempting to coerce the junior nurse to withhold or change her evidence to hospital executives or police. 
      
      
     But Gosford coroner Gary Cocks told the court that “somebody behind a locked door may not be overly attendant on what’s going on in the outside world…and may not be paying attention to their job.” 
      
      
     The longer bow that could be drawn is that they were sleeping” he said. 
      
    10. This crying witness fleeing the court (after giving evidence) is followed by the denials of the plaintiff’s barrister, but it is not clear from the matter complained of whether the barrister’s subsequent denials are made in court or out of court as the crying witness runs away, or indeed whether those denials will ever be a part of the coronial inquiry, as opposed to the coroner making up his mind on the evidence he has already heard. 11. Whether the denials have been, or will be, made in or out of court, is only part of the problem. The denials are followed by the paragraph commencing “But”, in which the coroner “told the court” that the plaintiff and his colleague “may not be overly attendant” and “may not be paying attention to their job”. The “longer bow” (i.e. the unresolved issue) is whether they were in fact sleeping.12. The use of the word by the journalist “But” contradicts what the barrister is saying by putting forward what the coroner “told” the court. The coroner’s statements come close to sounding like a concluded view or even a finding. To the ordinary reasonable reader, these statements may be capable of creating the impression that negligence may have been decided by the coroner, and that all that remains in doubt is whether or not the plaintiff and his colleague were sleeping.13. The rest of the publication describes the other part of the conduct of the plaintiff and his colleague of a concerning nature, this being the conduct towards the witness who left the court in tears after giving evidence. This arises from paragraph 9, where the coroner told the court that “matters of a grossly concerning nature” had been raised “after” the whistleblower’s evidence and that he was concerned that there was a “hint of duress”. This evidence is described in some detail, and followed by the comment of the dead woman’s sister that she was “disgusted” (paragraph 23).14. The article concludes with the words that the inquest “continues today”, which makes it clear that this is an ongoing saga. 15. As the Court of Appeal noted in Dennis at [8], whether or not an imputation is capable of arising from a publication is, to a significant degree, a matter of impression. The test to apply is explained by the Court of Appeal in Malcolm at [10], [14] and [15]. The correct approach to determining the question of whether an imputations of guilt or merely suspicion are conveyed is explained at [16] – [22].16. The facts in Malcolm were similar to the present. Some of the words in the matter complained of spoke clearly of suspicion only (“suspected”; “detectives believe this man… may be the person they are looking for”) while the headline stated categorically “Sex attacker caught on camera”.17. The ordinary reasonable person, reading about events in court, well knows that there are two sides to every story. The mere fact that a person is under investigation is not enough to impute guilt: Mirror Newspapers v Harrison (1982) 149 CLR 293. However, where a newspaper account is accompanied by an account of the suspicious circumstances that have aroused authorities, or where the likely result is telegraphed by the use of flavoured language (e.g. the “whistleblower” who came forward, the witness running away from court in tears, the “disgusted” relatives of the deceased, the “concerned” coroner who “told” the court) it is more likely than not for it to be best to leave the question of whether suspicion or guilt is conveyed to a jury.18. Having noted these general principles, I now turn to a consideration of the submissions in relation to each of the imputations of the first matter complained of.19. Imputation (a), which states that the plaintiff took unauthorised rest periods whilst working in his professional capacity as a nurse, arises directly from paragraphs 10 – 12. The use of the phrase “the court was told…” that the hospital authorised two breaks of twenty minutes is not the language of suspicion, having regard to the whole of the article as analysed above. This imputation will go to the jury.20. Imputations (b) and (c) arise from paragraph 6. Although the magistrate uses the word “may” and the article concludes by saying that the inquest will continue, the ordinary reasonable reader, who does not understand the niceties of a judge or coroner not making up his/her mind until hearing all the evidence at the end of the proceedings, could draw the conclusion that the coroner had “told the court” what his views on this issue were, and that the only area of doubt was whether the plaintiff and his colleague were actually sleeping as opposed to not paying attention to their job.21. It is important, when lawyers and judges consider whether imputations of suspicion or guilt, that they should not factor in their own expert knowledge of the legal system. Reasonable minds may differ as to whether or not the passages in which the coroner “told the court” (paragraph 6) his views, even though the coroner used the word “may” twice. These imputations will go to the jury.22. Imputation (d) is, however, very much on the borderline. The headline refers to “claims” of sleeping on the job, and the coroner excludes this from his more strongly expressed views, calling it the “longer bow” that could be drawn. The ordinary reasonable reader would read this as a suspicion only, not as fact, in that it sounds as though the coroner is saying that this “longer bow” is what he is looking into. In addition, the plaintiff’s barrister is quoted as saying that this (and the allegation of intimidating a witness to cover it up) is what the plaintiff will deny. Accordingly, this imputation is not conveyed; what is conveyed is an allegation of suspicion only.23. If the plaintiff wishes to plead an imputation of suspicion in relation to the allegation of sleeping, he should seek leave to do so promptly: Dennis at [26]ff.24. Imputation (e) does not simply relate to allegations of sleeping on the job. It relates to the evidence generally of the plaintiff, including his barrister’s statements that he would deny attempting to coerce the crying witness (paragraph 5). The crying witness’s evidence is both the highlight (paragraph 4) and the bulk of the story (paragraphs 10 – 22) and is the evidence which “disgusted” the deceased’s family member (paragraph 23). This imputation is, in the context of the whole article, capable of conveying more than suspicion, and will go to the jury.Objections to form of the imputations25. The defendants raise a number of objections as to form of imputations. As I have struck out imputation (d) I shall not deal with the objection to form for this imputation.26. The first objection raised in the letter from Freehills of 15 May is that imputation (b) fails to specify with any or sufficient clarity an act or condition that is defamatory. Secondly, it is rhetorical, because it poses the question of how the plaintiff is responsible. Thirdly, as an allegation of negligence, it does not differ in substance from (c).27. The imputations says that the plaintiff was responsible “through his negligence” for the death of the patient. That is sufficiently precise, when the imputation is viewed against the context of the matter complained of: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137 per Gleeson CJ. 28. No authority was provided in support of the submission that imputation (b) is rhetorical. In Viney v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1273 Simpson J at [22] – [24] criticised the bringing of this kind of submission. Imputation that is clear in its content as opposed to a rhetorical restatement or repetition of another imputation, and I endorse Simpson J’s plea that the time has come for defendants’ counsel to bury the practice of attacking imputations pleaded by plaintiffs on the basis that they are “rhetorical”. I have taken into account, on the issue of costs, the defendant’s raising of this unmeritorious argument notwithstanding Simpson J’s admonitions.29. Imputations can be either an act (“the plaintiff stole two chickens”) or a condition (“the plaintiff is a thief”). Imputation (b) is an act and imputation (c) is a condition. It has always been permissible to frame imputations in this way: Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Hunt J, 20 February 1980, unreported).30. The defendants draw my attention to the decision of Levine J in Hamblin v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 9 February 1998, unreported). The reasons for Levine J’s findings relate to the facts of that case. Levine J was not stating that an act and a condition cannot be pleaded as both arising. In the present case, the coroner’s statement that “the issues raised after the whistleblower’s evidence” raised issues of a “grossly concerning nature” is not restricted to the death of the patient. This is not a case, unlike Hamblin, where the act and condition are the same. I reject the submission that these two imputations do not differ in substance.31. Freehill’s letter of 16 May asserts that imputation (e) gives rise to “an impermissible ambiguity” as whether the plaintiff had committed the act in question or would merely be prepared to do so should the occasion arise was not spelled out.32. I reject this submission. This imputation is framed as a condition, not as an act. There is no need for a temporal component. In fact the matter complained of also uses the word “would” (“A barrister for the two nurses said they would deny…”) in paragraph 3.33. In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688B Hutley JA commented that it seemed disingenuous for a defendants to assert a word it had used was a word without meaning. The correctness of Hepburn has never been doubted and it is applicable to the arguments in question here. Second matter complained of34. The second matter complained of is headed “Gaps in patient care”. The subheading “Anger at witness accounts prompted nursing head’s evidence, inquest told” appear on the next line. In paragraph 3, the nursing head is described as a “whistleblower”, and this word appears in capital letters. It is made clear that this witness has come forward after being “incensed” by reading about the evidence of witnesses at the inquest, after having herself complained at the time to the hospital staff and being told the matter was being looked into.35. Although much of the matter complained of consists of restatements of her evidence from her statement, parts of the matter complained of appear to come from other sources, such as the second last paragraph, which recites that in the weeks after the death of the patient, the whistleblower released a policy to the staff reiterating that staff were allowed only two 20 minute breaks.36. This passage is particularly relevant to the capacity of imputation (a), which Freehills assert, in their letter of 16 May, conveys only that “the allegations have been made but have yet to be tested”. The plaintiff points to the combination of the heading, the reference to unauthorised rest periods and the reference to contemporaneous supporting documentation of this in the second last paragraph are capable of conveying that the plaintiff did take unauthorised rest periods. It is not clear from the publication if this is in the statement or if this is agreed fact.37. I note the reference to the inquest being adjourned in the final paragraph. However, for the reasons set out in more detail above, it is important not to make the mistake of attributing to the ordinary reasonable reader the sophistication to understand that the coroner would wait until he had heard all the evidence and that these were allegations only. 38. A great deal of weight must be attached to the reference to “alleged” in paragraph 5 and to “alleged” comments (paragraph 9) from a junior nurse that the plaintiff was “sleeping on the job”. In addition, Ms Crowley is quoted as having conceded she did not use the word “sleeping” in her statement (paragraph 15).39. The ordinary reasonable reader, reading the whole of the publication, would take into account that these were matters that were being looked into, and were not yet decided. The references to the failure to take departmental action because the hospital and the lawyers were also “looking into” this matter tend to reinforce this impression. 40. This publication conveys that the plaintiff was suspected of taking unauthorised rest periods by Ms Crowley, but the overall impression is one of suspicion, not guilt. The basis for the suspicion was the reference to the deceased having a “restless night” when she had in fact hanged herself at 4 am, which Ms Crowley said was an indication that the night report had been written well before her death.41. Taking all of these features into account, the allegations in (a) convey suspicion but not guilt and accordingly imputation (a) is not capable of being conveyed. Imputation (a) is struck out. 42. Imputation (b) is asserted to arise from paragraphs 2 and 3, and from the language of the headline, which speaks of “gaps”, not alleged gaps.43. Paragraph 5 says that the plaintiff is “alleged” to have taken the unauthorised breaks and paragraph 9 refers to allegations by a junior nurse that the plaintiff and his colleague were sleeping on the job.44. For the same reasons as (a), this imputation is not capable of being conveyed and is struck out.45. The first objection to (c) is that it would require the drawing of an inference that the person who made the fraudulent entry was the plaintiff. 46. This is not an inference case but a group libel case, where the plaintiff is one of two persons who could be the author of the fraudulent entry: McCormick v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 485. Not only should this imputation be pleaded as arising as suspicion, but it should be pleaded in accordance with the principles for allegations against a member of a small group where one of that group is asserted to be the person who did something. For the same reasons as imputations (a) and (b), this imputation is not capable of being conveyed.47. Imputation (d) suffers from the same problem. In addition to the problem of suspicion rather than guilt, I note the objection of form concerning the use of the phrase “led to”. If this imputation is to be repleaded as an imputation of suspicion, it needs to be drafted with greater precision.Costs48. The defendants have been entirely successful concerning the second publication but successful in relation to only one of the imputations in the first publication. However, the defendants made some quite unmeritorious objections, such as the claim that one of the imputations was rhetorical. Taking all of this into account, the costs order I have made is that the costs be the defendant’s costs in the cause, but I grant liberty to apply to the parties if they wish to address me further on costs.49. The plaintiff should provide any amended Statement of Claim within 14 days, so that a s 7A jury trial can be set down for hearing. Orders1. Imputations 4(a), (b), (c) and (e) are to go to the jury.2. Imputations 4(d) and 6 (a) – (d) are struck out with leave to plead imputations of suspicion.3. Plaintiff’s Further Amended Statement of Claim (if any) to be filed and served in 14 days.4. Objections to this pleading to be notified 14 days thereafter.5. Matter re-listed for Friday 8 August 2008 at 9:00am for argument or for allocation of a s 7A jury trial.6.

    1. Claims senior staff asleep on the jobBy Joanne McCarthy2. [Main picture]3. [FIGHT: Leona Escreet’s sister Tracey, left, and mother Val Carter outside the coroner’s court in Gosford yesterday. Four other smaller pictures with captions from top to bottom – Leona Escreet – Yvonne Wilson – Shane Buckley – Hendrik Holtman]4. A JUNIOR nurse fled a court in tears yesterday after evidence of unauthorised two-hour “breaks” by two senior staff on the night a Central Coast mental health patient took her life.5. A barrister for the two male nurses said they would deny sleeping on the job at Gosford Hospital’s Mandala mental health unit, or attempting to coerce the junior nurse to withhold or change her evidence to hospital executives or police.6. But Gosford coroner Gary Cocks told the court that “somebody behind a locked door (for two hours) may not be overly attendant on what’s going on in the outside world… and may not be paying attention to their job”.7. “The longer now that could be drawn is that they were sleeping” he said.8. Two further Northern Sydney and Central Coast Health Service staff were subpoenaed to give evidence after a statement by a “whistleblower” who came forward after newspaper articles about the inquest into the hanging death of Leona Escreet, 32, in October 2002.9. In court yesterday Mr Cocks said he was concerned about the “hint of duress” about the matter, and described issues raised after the whistleblower’s evidence as “matters of grossly concerning nature”.10. The court heard Shane Buckley took a “break” between 12:30am and 2:30am on October 3, 2002, and junior nurse Yvonne Wilson took her break between 2:45am and 3:50am.11. The breaks were not recorded.12. The court was told the hospital authorised two breaks of 20 minutes each.13. Senior nurse Henk Holtman planned to take his break between 4am and 6am after telling Ms Wilson a patient round had “not long been don”.14. Ms Wilson could not tell the court why she went to check on Ms Escreet a few minutes later, despite Mr Holtman’s statement.15. The court had earlier heard evidence of Ms Escreet’s severely depressed condition and suicidal comments in the weeks leading to her death.16. Ms Wilson told the court she went to the locked room where Mr Holtman had retired and knocked on the door for unknown period until he opened the door.17. She told him Ms Escreet was not in her room and was probably in a locked bathroom.18. Ms Escreet’s body was found hanging from a shower rail.19. Ms Wilson said she told nursing unit manager Helen Crowley about the breaks when she was interviewed on the day of Ms Escreet’s death, and of her concerns about Mr Holtman’s practice of not including all patients in nightly observation rounds.20. Ms Wilson said Mr Buckley left a message on her answering machine after the incident “along the lines of wanting to get together” in relation to the matter.21. She told the court she did not read “something Henk did up of what they (Mr Holtman and Mr Buckley) were going to say” when they were interviews by hospital executives.22. Mr Holtman gave it to her but she did not read it until after she gave her police statement, she said.23. Ms Escreet’s sister Tracey, who fought for three years to have an inquest, said yesterday she was “disgusted”.24. The inquest continues today. 
     
     Annexure B 
    1. Gaps in patient careBy Joanne McCarthy2. Anger at witness accounts prompted nursing head’s evidence, inquest told3. A WHISTLEBLOWER who told senior hospital management that staff were on unauthorised two-hour breaks the night a mental health patient took her life told police she stopped pursuing the matter because “it appeared that nothing was happening”.4. She told police she came forward three years later because she was “incensed” after reading what witnesses were saying at an inquest on the patient’s death.5. “To my knowledge no departmental action has been taken against either Shane Buckley or Henk Holtman,” nurse unit manager Helen Crowley said in a statement to police about two mental health nurses alleged to have taken the unauthorised breaks.6. The statement was tendered at an inquest on the death of Leona Escreet at Gosford Hospital’s Mandala mental health unit on October 3, 2002.7. The court was told yesterday that Ms Crowley, who retired in July, continued to ask Mandala service director Sandie Carpenter about “what was happening (but) she kept giving me vague responses telling me that they were looking into it and that the lawyers were looking into it as well”.8. “After a while I just let it be, as it appeared that nothing was happening,” Ms Crowley said.9. In her statement, she said she spoke informally with hospital lawyers “and told them everything”, including alleged comments from a junior nurse that the male nurses were sleeping on the job and that a surveillance video showed a gap of more than 1½ hours in nurse rounds, during which Leona Escreet died.10. “The lawyers actually told me that they would try and stop Henk from leaving the country, as he was going overseas at the time,” Ms Crowley said in her statement.11. “I actually thought, great, something is going to happen.”12. Ms Crowley said she checked hospital records when she arrived at the unit two hours after Ms Escreet’s body was found hanging from a shower rail in a bathroom.13. She said she was surprised to find a note on Ms Escreet’s records timed at 6am and stating the patient had had a “restless night”. Ms Escreet is though [sic] to have died soon after 4am.14. “This indicated to me the night report had been written well before her death,” Ms Crowley said.15. In court, she agreed she had not used the word “sleeping” in a report to the hospital’s critical incident review team in 2002 but had referred to the two-hour breaks.16. In the weeks after Ms Escreet’s death, Ms Crowley released a policy to Mandala staff reiterating that staff were allowed two 20-minute breaks each shift.17. Gosford coroner Gary Cocks adjourned the inquest to April 26 and 27.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Jay Phillip Parslow who has pleaded guilty to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on John McMaster. The offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in the form that Mr Parslow has been charged with has now been repealed. It was under s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was the law which applied at the time the offence was committed and therefore the law according to which I sentence him. The offence carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment. 
    2. There are two issues which are more prominent than others which I need to deal with. One is to resolve a dispute of fact as to what occurred in the course of the events. The second is to assess the significance of an injury which Mr Parslow sustained in a car accident some years before this crime.  
    3. First I should give a brief account of what happened. Mr Parslow was riding a motor bike. He had his five year old son with him as a passenger. It was a Mini motor bike. He was driving along Greenbank Drive in Werrington. This was on Sunday 17 December 2006 at 4pm in the afternoon. Mr McMaster, the victim of this offence, was driving his car along the same road. Mr McMaster said he slowed down to make a U-turn so that he could go back to check a house where he thought his friend might be. Mr McMaster’s account is that he heard a noise and found that Mr Parslow had collided with the back of his car. Mr Parslow’s account is that there had been some exchange between Mr Parslow and Mr McMaster for some moments before this incident. Mr Parslow said that Mr McMaster offered him an aggressive expression and clearly displayed an attitude of dislike towards Mr Parslow and his son. Mr Parslow said that what happened is that Mr McMaster overtook Mr Parslow and then slammed on his brakes causing Mr Parslow’s bike containing his son to collide with the back of the car. I will return to those varying accounts shortly. 
    4. There was a collision between the bike and the car in the sense that the bike went over and slid under the car. The result of that was that Mr Parslow’s son Jonah fractured his leg. His fractured leg was obvious. What happened then was that Mr Parslow asked Mr McMaster to drive his son to a house nearby where Mr Parslow had some acquaintances. This occurred. When they got to the house a few minutes later Mr Parslow’s son Jonah was transferred to another car. That was to enable him to be driven to hospital but before they drove off to hospital Mr McMaster approached Mr Parslow to see if Jonah was all right. Mr Parslow grabbed Mr McMaster and punched him on the upper left part of his cheek. He punched him again on his lower right jaw. The second punch knocked Mr McMaster to the ground. Mr Parslow verbally abused Mr McMaster and blamed him for intentionally slowing down.  
    5. The boy was then taken to the hospital. Mr McMaster was taken to another hospital. It was found that Mr McMaster had sustained a fractured cheek and a fractured eye socket. In addition he had a number of teeth removed. Mr Parslow’s son had indeed sustained a serious break to his leg.  
    6. Mr Parslow was arrested on 9 January 2007 and has been in custody bail refused since then. I have heard evidence from Mr McMaster and from Mr Parslow. In addition I have read the exhibits which have been tendered in these proceedings.  
    7. I turn now to the first issue which I mentioned at the commencement of these remarks, namely the resolution of the differences in accounts between Mr Parslow and Mr McMaster. A preliminary question is where the onus lies in satisfying me about which account should be accepted. I am of the opinion that the onus lies on Mr Parslow. He has been charged with the offence and the basic facts are admitted by Mr Parslow to the effect that he assaulted Mr McMaster resulting in the injuries which were caused. The prosecution does not seek or does not agitate any point of view which would aggravate those circumstances.  
    8. On the other hand Mr Parslow through his counsel Mr Baffsky invites me to view the sequence of events in a way which would mitigate their severity. Mr Baffsky invites me to conclude that the offence occurred in the way suggested by Mr Parslow. That in turn would provide an explanation for the offence and some mitigation in the sense that the behaviour of Mr Parslow was provoked by Mr McMaster deliberately slamming on the brakes. Alternatively Mr Bavski invites me in the event that I am not satisfied that his client’s account should be accepted to conclude that his client believed that the accident was the result of Mr McMaster’s behaviour even if that was not the case. 
    9. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities, which is a standard by which I need to be satisfied in order to establish a mitigating feature, that the events occurred in accordance with the way that Mr Parslow said. I regard his account is inherently unlikely. His explanation was that Mr McMaster, until then a complete stranger, took a dislike to the fact that he and his son were riding on a motor bike. Such was the dislike that Mr McMaster took it upon himself to behave in a way that would obviously result in a serious accident between a motor car and a motor bike.  
    10. I would have been assisted in resolving this dispute had the detail of the allegations made by Mr Parslow about the behaviour of Mr McMaster been put to Mr McMaster. I say the detail because what Mr Parslow claimed was that Mr McMaster was behaving like a vigilante and glaring intently at him and his son. He even suggested that Mr McMaster may have been drinking. He said that Mr Master was behaving like a lout and had in a violent manoeuvre simultaneously swerved and slammed on his brakes. As I said, I regard the account given by Mr Parslow as inherently unlikely. Had this account been put in detail to Mr McMaster I may have been assisted in resolving it but because it was not put in detail I am reluctant to conclude against Mr McMaster that events occurred in the way which he flatly denied. Nor do I accept that Mr Parslow believed that events occurred as he asserted. I do not see any rational basis for Mr Parslow entertaining such a belief. I do see a rational basis for him asserting that the events occurred as he said they did. That rational explanation is that he had reconstructed the events. I think that is more likely. He had, after all, inflicted significant violence upon a complete stranger and in my opinion the more likely explanation is that Mr Parslow needed to reconstruct an account which would in some way explain his behaviour.  
    11. Even if I were to accept that the events occurred as Mr Parslow said or were the result of his belief, I would accept the submission of Ms Graham who appeared for the prosecution to the effect that the resulting reduction in the severity of the offence would be not great, that is because of the time delay between the events and the assault. 
    12. I make the following findings about the objective seriousness of this offence. The injury was a bad injury. The consequences were serious for Mr McMaster. I have read and taken into account exhibit B, his victim impact statement which lists a large number of serious consequences which this assault has had on Mr McMaster’s life. I should say about the injuries that they are not the worst examples of grievous bodily harm. This offence is not in the worst category of offences. On the other hand I find in accordance with s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the injury and damage caused by the offence to Mr McMaster was substantial.  
    13. I will return in a moment to the objective seriousness of this offence. In the meantime I mention two other aggravating features: one is that this offence was committed by Mr Parslow whilst he was on conditional liberty. This offence occurred on 17 December 2006. On 31 January 2006 Mr Parslow had been convicted of assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty. He had been sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment and that sentence was suspended. Accordingly at the time of committing this offence he was enjoying the liberty which had been granted to him by the previous court to enable him to rehabilitate himself. The abuse of that conditional liberty is a serious aggravating feature. A second aggravating feature is his own criminal record. It involves a number of offences of common assault as well as offences of assaulting police in the execution of their duty and one assault of occasioning actual bodily harm. I regard that record as aggravating in this sense: it indicates the need for Mr Parslow to become more aware of the importance of containing his own behaviour. It is important that a sentence imposed upon him reflect the fact that further violent behaviour will not be tolerated. 
    14. I return now to the assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence. A significant factor in this case is a diagnosis by a Dr Ronald Rowe, a consultant neuropsychologist and clinical psychologist. In a report dated 16 June 2008 which became exhibit 3 Dr Rowe referred to a car accident which Mr Parslow had had in 2003. Dr Rowe was trying to assess whether there was any brain injury which might have been sustained in that accident. He administered various tests on Mr Parslow. He diagnosed Mr Parslow as being afflicted with a chronic pain disorder with depression and most significantly with a traumatic brain injury which led to a post concussive disorder. In addition he had a personality related disorder as a result of his exposure to childhood domestic violence. Dr Rowe’s opinion was that these conditions led to a significant impairment in Mr Parslow’s judgment and his ability to inhibit an impulsive response to a novel and unexpected situation which had developed at the time of the accident. He thought that had Mr Parslow’s condition been adequately monitored and treated earlier then he most likely would not have reacted in the way that he did. Dr Rowe prescribed a treatment program for Mr Parslow and offered the opinion that if he complied, then his risk of re-offending would be negligible. That report is supported by an earlier report of a psychologist Mr Gorrell dated 10 May 2008 who had concluded that it was likely that Mr Parslow was suffering frontal lobe damage. 
    15. I accept those reports, in particular Dr Rowe’s report. That has a significant impact on the finding which I make so far as the objective seriousness of this offence is concerned. It needs to be taken into account that Mr Parslow’s behaviour was causatively related to the brain injury which he had sustained. This is not to say that it is justified or excusable but it reduces an otherwise very serious assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
    16. So far as Mr Parslow’s subjective circumstances are concerned I have read the pre-sentence report, exhibit C, which records his background confirming that he had had a childhood which had featured physical and psychological abuse. Mr Parslow has his own son with whom he is very close. He has previously been employed in real estate management for some five years and has a positive reference from a person who worked with him in that occupation. The pre-sentence report noted a reluctance from Mr Parslow to accept responsibility for his offending behaviour. In his evidence before me he did acknowledge his own role in the sense that he ought not to have been where he was when he was. I should record at this stage that when the accident occurred Mr Parslow was riding an unregistered and uninsured motor bike. The pre-sentence report noted that he had been unemployed since 2003. That I note is the date of his car accident. Anger management was seen to be by the probation officer a significant criminogenic factor. The report assessed him as suitable for a medium level of intervention but with a focus on anger management and neuropsychological issues.  
    17. I do not find that it is unlikely that Mr Parslow will re-offend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I hasten to add that I do not make those findings because I think it is likely that he will re-offend or because I think his prospects of rehabilitation are poor, I am guarded in my assessment of both those factors. It will depend upon whether Mr Parslow co-operates with the long term treatment program suggested by Dr Rowe. I cannot make, in light of that condition, a positive assessment that he is unlikely to re-offend or has prospects of rehabilitation which are good. 
    18. He has however pleaded guilty. Normally a plea of guilty would, at the earliest opportunity, attract a discount of twenty five percent. In this case however I propose to reduce that discount to fifteen percent. That is because I accept Ms Graham’s submission that the discount is reduced because the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty was substantially eroded by the fact that he called and had cross-examined Mr McMaster. In addition there were two other witnesses who were called who in the end were not cross-examined. He is still entitled to a significant discount of fifteen discount because of the value of his plea to the criminal justice system but in my opinion he is not entitled to the maximum of twenty five percent.  
    19. The maximum sentence for this offence is seven years. A sentence of seven years of course would be reserved for a most serious example of this offence, in other words a worst case. I regard this offence as very serious, it is very serious because of the nature of the injury and because of the impact which it has had on Mr McMaster. In addition it was committed on conditional liberty. I would regard an appropriate sentence for this offence as five years. However because of the impact which the diagnosed brain injury condition has had on Mr Parslow’s behaviour and because that means that the element of general deterrence is reduced somewhat I regard an appropriate overall sentence as four years. I reduce that four year sentence by fifteen percent because of his plea of guilty. That is a reduction of some eight months from the forty eight months which is the four years. Hence I regard an overall sentence which is appropriate in this case as forty months or three years and four months.  
    20. I accept Mr Baffsky’s submission that there are special circumstances in this case which warrant an adjustment in the normal relationship between a non-parole period and a parole period. Normally a non-parole period is fixed at three quarters of the overall sentence. Mr Bavski has argued in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that there are special circumstances which would justify my lengthening the parole period and at the same time reducing the non-parole period. He says that those special circumstances are the diagnosis of the brain injury and the treatment plan which Dr Rowe recommended. Ms Graham did not dispute the fact that special circumstances exist warranting a departure from the normal ratio. 
    21. I do not propose to reduce the overall sentence by half but I propose to reduce it by more than two thirds. The non-parole period which I propose to impose is twenty two months, that is one year and ten months. That means that the parole period will be eighteen months, that is one year and six months. I regard a period of eighteen months as important in order to assist Mr Parslow in rehabilitating himself in accordance with the plan proposed by Dr Rowe. 
    22. Now Mr Parslow would you stand up please. Mr Parslow in sentencing you I set a non-parole period for your sentence of one year and ten months that is to date from when you went into custody on 9 January 2007 and will expire on 8 November 2008. The balance of the term will be one year and six months commencing on 9 November 2008 and expiring on 8 May 2010. The earliest date upon which it appears that you will be eligible for release is therefore 8 November 2008. I recommend that the Parole Authority when giving consideration to your parole, take into account the report of Dr Rowe dated 16 June 2008 and any other reports concerning the impact which the car accident had on you and in particular I recommend that the Parole Authority give serious consideration to fixing as conditions of parole the elements of the treatment regime set out by Dr Rowe under item 12 of his report dated 16 June 2008. Have a seat Mr Parslow.  
    In a moment I will discharge my statutory report of making sure that Mr Parslow understands the sentence but first are there any other orders or directions which I need to make?GRAHAM: Your Honour I’d ask that you impose the condition that commonly annexed to parole he place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and they--HIS HONOUR: I can’t impose that because it’s not for me, I’m not fixing parole I can only recommend because it’s over three years.GRAHAM: It’s over three years, I beg your pardon.HIS HONOUR: I think that’s for the Parole Authority really.GRAHAM: Sorry yes, it’s over three years.HIS HONOUR: That’s why they’re in terms of recommendations. No other orders I need to make?23. Mr Parslow your overall sentence is three years and four months, that’s forty months and it starts from 9 January 07 which is when you were arrested. You’ve been in custody since then. I fixed a non-parole period of twenty two months so that expires on 8 November 2008 so that’s just under five months time. At that stage you are eligible for parole. I can’t order you to be released on parole because your sentence is over three years. Whether you’re released on parole depends upon the Parole Authority. After you are released on parole you will be on parole until 8 May 2010 and I have recommended that in fixing parole the Parole Authority take into account Dr Rowe’s report and give serious consideration to making conditions of parole the treatment regime which  
     
      
      the doctor recommended for you because this could be the way out of the pattern of criminal behaviour which you’ve had for the last few years, because Dr Rowe may have found an explanation for what happens and his treatment may assist,  
       
      
    HIS HONOUR: do you understand?OFFENDER: I do.24. I recommend that the Parole Authority facilitate Mr Parslow’s continuing treatment by Dr Rowe if both Dr Rowe and Mr Parslow agree in a way that Mr Parslow can afford. That is a recommendation only of course, it may not be possible.GRAHAM: Your Honour sometimes judges require that a photocopy of the psych report be attached to his gaol file.HIS HONOUR: That’s right, my associate normally recommends that. 25. I direct that the reports of Phil Gorrell dated 10 May 2008 and Donald Rowe dated 16 June 2008 that photocopies of those two reports be attached to Mr Parslow’s warrant and travel with him.Thank you for your assistance Ms Graham I appreciate it, and thank you for appearing today.

      2007/1797 Regina v Wade John Stewart 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 6 February 2008, the trial of the Offender, Wade John Stewart, commenced before a jury upon an indictment alleging that on 24 July 2006 at Port Macquarie, he did murder Brian Sawtell. On 18 February 2008, the Offender was acquitted of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 A hearing on sentence proceeded before me on 2 May 2008 following which the Offender was remanded for sentence until today. 
     
      
       
      Facts of the Offence 
       
      
    3 It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment and, for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. Any findings of fact against the Offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Cheung v The Queen [2001] 209 CLR 1 at 12-13 [14]. Any findings of fact adverse to the Offender in these remarks have been reached by application of the criminal standard of proof. 
     
      
    4 As will be seen, an issue for determination is whether the verdict of guilty of manslaughter arose by way of provocation (as submitted by the Crown) or excessive self-defence (as urged by the Defence). 
     
      
    5 The Crown called a number of witnesses in its case at trial and the Offender gave evidence before the jury. There were limited areas of factual dispute, although the areas in dispute were of considerable significance. 
     
      
    6 In June 2006, the Offender entered into a shared lease arrangement for a house in Lake Road, Port Macquarie with a friend, Tania Ross. I should mention that the Offender and Ms Ross were not in a relationship and shared the house as friends. The Offender had previously been in a relationship with Marnie Scowen which had terminated by June 2006. At the time when the Offender and Ms Ross leased the Lake Road premises, there was an agreement between them that Ms Scowen was not to enter the premises. It is clear, on the evidence, that aspects of Ms Scowen’s prior conduct had caused difficulties for Ms Ross and others so that Ms Scowen was excluded from entry to the Lake Road house. 
     
      
    7 On 18 July 2006, Ms Ross came home and heard Ms Scowen’s voice. Conversation ensued between Ms Ross and the Offender in which the Offender informed Ms Ross that Ms Scowen was to attend court the following Monday (24 July 2006) and would thereafter go to Queensland. The evidence revealed that Ms Scowen remained at the Lake Road premises from 18 to 24 July 2006.  
     
      
    8 On Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 July 2006, celebrations of Ms Ross’ birthday took place both in and away from the Lake Road premises. Involved in these celebrations were Ms Ross, her partner (Mr Kain Tuffin), the deceased (Mr Sawtell who was 35 years of age), his partner (Ms Clare Williamson) and others who came and went. Evidence adduced in the trial revealed that alcohol and various drugs were used by persons in the course of these celebrations. Neither the Offender nor Ms Scowen took part in these birthday festivities.  
     
      
    9 In the early hours of Monday, 24 July 2006, the party was continuing to celebrate Ms Ross’ birthday with music being played in the house. A loud argument took place between Ms Scowen and the Offender in the Offender’s room. According to the evidence of the Offender, Ms Scowen was upset because of loud music emanating from the party and the failure of those involved to pay regard to the Offender’s request that the music be turned down. During the course of the argument, Ms Scowen threw an object which smashed a fish tank located in the Offender’s room.  
     
      
    10 Other persons in the house came to the Offender’s room in response to the disturbance between the Offender and Ms Scowen. The deceased, Mr Sawtell, came into the room with Ms Ross and others. I am satisfied that there was some agitation on the part of Mr Sawtell and others at that time given the events which had transpired between Ms Scowen and the Offender. The Offender produced a knife (which I accept was a Bowie knife) and presented it to those who had entered the room, including Mr Sawtell. Ms Williamson’s four-year old daughter was at that time asleep in another room in the house. I accept the evidence of Ms Williamson that Mr Sawtell said words to the effect “If you want to use weapons” (T115.18) to the Offender and obtained a sword from a cupboard in the house. I am satisfied that an incident then ensued in which the Offender held the Bowie knife and Mr Sawtell held the sword whilst facing each other, but that no weapon fight or other physical interaction took place between the two men using these weapons. 
     
      
    11 Soon after, Ms Ross asked the Offender and Ms Scowen to leave the house. Ms Ross made a 000 call to police at 4.35 am on 24 July 2006 in which she said that she wanted Ms Scowen removed from the house and that “she’s thrown something and smashed the fish tank” (Exhibit D).  
     
      
    12 Thereafter, Ms Scowen and the Offender departed the premises. There was some dispute between the evidence of Ms Ross and the Offender concerning what precisely had been said by her and the Offender at this stage. Ms Ross’ evidence was to the effect that the Offender was departing the house and would not return to live there. The Offender stated that, although he left the house with Ms Scowen, he did not intend to abandon the premises. Given that the possessions of the Offender remained at the house, it seems clear that he would return there at some time. However, it was probably not clear when and for how long the Offender would return to the house, given the heated atmosphere existing prior to the sudden departure of the Offender and Ms Scowen.  
     
      
    13 The Offender and Ms Scowen had left the premises by 5.18 am on 24 July 2006, as Ms Ross made a further 000 call at that time indicating that the Offender and Ms Scowen had departed by taxi and that police attendance was no longer required (Exhibit F). 
     
      
    14 Following the departure of the Offender and Ms Scowen, Ms Ross observed areas of damage in the Offender’s room including water damage resulting from the smashed fish tank and burn marks on the floor from candles which had been lit in the room. Ms Ross and her companions packed up the Offender’s possessions and placed them in bags and boxes before moving them to the front outside veranda of the house. I accept the evidence of Ms Williamson that these items were stacked neatly at that time (T116.24).  
     
      
    15 When the Offender left the Lake Road premises after 5.00 am on 24 July 2006, he had with him a push dagger - a knife with a transverse handle designed to be gripped in the fist so that the blade protrudes from between the fingers. The push dagger had a nine-centimetre blade. I am satisfied that it was designed for use as a fighting weapon. The Offender admitted in evidence that he had owned this knife for some time. He said that he carried it on him on 24 July 2006 “for safety” (T256.25). He explained that he carried it from time to time as “our families have had problems with Aboriginals in Port Macquarie and I’d received numerous threats that I was going to get bashed and I had it for safety purposes” (T256.37). The Offender said that he carried the knife “because it can be concealed … down the front of [my] pants” (T256.45). The push dagger was carried by the Offender in a leather sheath which was concealed in his trousers. I am satisfied that no person in the house was aware at that time that the Offender was taking the concealed push dagger with him when he left the house. As will be seen, it was the push dagger which the Offender used to lethal effect upon Mr Sawtell later that day.  
     
      
    16 After leaving the house on 24 July 2006, the Offender sent a text message to Ms Ross containing words to the effect “I hope that copper dog is not there when I get back” (T58.15; T275.39). The Offender admitted in evidence at the trial that he sent such a text message soon after he left the Lake Road premises and that the message referred to Mr Sawtell (T259.26).  
     
      
    17 Under cross-examination, the Offender said that the description of Mr Sawtell as a “copper dog” was meant to be insulting (T275.49). He denied the suggestion in cross-examination that he had called Mr Sawtell a “copper dog” because he (Mr Sawtell) had been using his past experience as a security guard to defuse the situation earlier on 24 July 2006 after the fish-tank incident (T275-276). After initially asserting that he did not know how to explain his use of the term “copper dog” (T275.52), the Offender, when pressed under cross-examination, said “When I mean copper dog I meant it in general, because he had been busted growing hydroponics and anyone else that I know who has been busted growing hydroponics gets gaol time” (T276.8). Whatever may be the reason for the Offender’s selection of this term, it is clear that this text message demonstrated a significant level of ill-feeling on the part of the Offender towards Mr Sawtell. 
     
      
    18 The Offender accompanied Ms Scowen to Port Macquarie Local Court on 24 July 2006.  
     
      
    19 Some time after 3.00 pm that day, the Offender and Ms Scowen returned to the Lake Road premises. He had not given any prior notice of his intention to return at that time, let alone that he would be in the company of Ms Scowen. 
     
      
    20 The Offender observed his possessions packed up and located on the outside veranda. It had been raining that day and it is likely that some of the Offender’s possessions had become wet, although their location on the veranda was in a largely sheltered position. I accept that the Offender became upset when he saw his possessions on the veranda. I am satisfied, however, that the possessions were stacked neatly on the veranda at that time. Later, they were scattered onto the lawn by police when emergency access was required to the premises to treat Mr Sawtell.  
     
      
    21 As the Offender and Ms Scowen approached the front door of the Lake Road premises, a number of persons were located in the house. Mr Sawtell was seated on a chair in the lounge room. Across from him were Ms Williamson and another friend, Ms Donna Schubert. Ms Ross was in the lounge room and Mr Tuffin was also in the house. Ms Williamson’s four-year old daughter was also there. 
     
      
    22 The Offender entered through the flyscreen and front door, both of which were unlocked. An argument ensued between the Offender and Ms Ross. I accept the evidence of Ms Williamson that the Offender was asking Ms Ross why his belongings were out the front and that Ms Ross replied that she just wanted him out. Ms Williamson grabbed her daughter and took her to the kitchen. By that time, the Offender and Mr Sawtell were arguing.  
     
      
    23 Having regard to the verdict of the jury, I am satisfied that Mr Sawtell moved towards the Offender who was, at that time, just inside the front door. According to Ms Williamson, whose evidence I accept, Mr Sawtell was angry and upset with the Offender (T172). I accept that Mr Sawtell was upset with the Offender for what he had done earlier in the morning whilst Ms Williamson’s daughter was in the bedroom next door and because the Offender had returned unannounced to the house with Ms Scowen. Mr Sawtell was not carrying any weapon at this time (T119.25).  
     
      
    24 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender said to Mr Sawtell at this time “Do you want a go mate?”, with Mr Sawtell responding “Yeah, as long there’s no weapons” (T60.51), as testified by Ms Ross. My assessment of the jury’s verdict, against the background of the totality of the evidence in the trial, leads me to the conclusion that the jury did not accept Ms Ross’ account of this part of the incident. I am satisfied that Mr Sawtell moved towards the Offender, probably for the purpose of preventing him from moving further into the premises and laid hands on him. Mr Sawtell was unaware that the Offender was carrying the concealed push dagger. Immediately, the two men were punching each other in a manner described, in particular, by Ms Williamson (T118, T174) and Mr Tuffin (T142).  
     
      
    25 As might be expected, the descriptions of the various witnesses vary as to events during the fatal struggle. Some witnesses were anxious to leave the lounge room, in particular, to shield the four-year old girl from the fight.26 I am satisfied that the Offender extracted the push dagger from the sheath concealed in his trousers and used it in the course of the struggle with Mr Sawtell, striking him on some 12 occasions. According to the evidence of the forensic pathologist, Dr Nadesan, Mr Sawtell sustained 12 wounds, of which 10 were in the chest and abdomen, one on the roof of the neck and one on the left forearm. Injury No. 1 penetrated the left jugular vein resulting in severe bleeding. According to Dr Nadesan, this was the fatal wound (T201.12). Of the other wounds, two were potentially fatal being an incised stab wound which had penetrated the right lobe of the liver to a depth of about 9-12 centimetres from the skin surface (T202.5) and an incised stab wound which entered the abdominal cavity and cut the spleen (T203.16). A further incised stab wound which penetrated the abdominal cavity was serious, but not potentially fatal (T202). In cross-examination, Dr Nadesan agreed that the nature of the injuries indicated that the weapon struck the victim in different angles and that some of the injuries indicated more of a slashing than a stabbing motion (T213). 
     
      
    27 Dr Nadesan considered that several injuries to Mr Sawtell could be considered as “defence wounds to ward off a blow” (T204.17). It was Dr Nadesan’s opinion that Mr Sawtell died very quickly and the most obvious reason for death was severe bleeding from the neck wound which severed the left jugular vein (T213.57). 
     
      
    28 I accept Ms Williamson’s account that Mr Sawtell fell on top of the Offender and was up against the lounge during the struggle when a picture fell down from the wall (T118). I am satisfied that Mr Sawtell fell on top of the Offender as a result of injuries he had already sustained from the Offender’s use of the push dagger. 
     
      
    29 I observe that photographs taken by police of the Offender on 27 July 2006 (Exhibit J) depicted minor injuries to him, comprising an abrasion to the right knuckle, a bruise to the left upper arm and faint abrasions to the right and left forearms. Mr Sawtell, on the other hand, had sustained the repeated wounds to various parts of his body as explained by Dr Nadesan and summarised above.  
     
      
    30 The fatal interaction between the Offender and Mr Sawtell happened quickly. Those present saw profuse bleeding from Mr Sawtell’s wounds.  
     
      
    31 I am satisfied that the Offender was well aware that he had inflicted very severe injuries to Mr Sawtell at the time when the Offender and Ms Scowen fled the premises.  
     
      
    32 Mr Sawtell was seen to pick up a glass which he used to apply pressure in an unsuccessful effort to stem the flow of blood from his wounds. He told Ms Williamson that the Offender had stabbed him (T118). 
     
      
    33 At 3.29 pm on 24 July 2006, Ms Ross made a 000 call seeking urgent assistance. As it happened, a police vehicle attended the house at that time following receipt of information that there may be some drug activity occurring there (T157). Senior Constable Brunyee and Constable Williams entered the house whilst Ms Ross was making the 000 call. That call, which was played at the trial, provided a graphic and contemporaneous record of events in the house, including efforts to assist Mr Sawtell.  
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that police disturbed the neatly stacked piles of the Offender’s possessions on the veranda to permit access to the house by ambulance officers (T159). Unsuccessful efforts were made by ambulance officers to revive Mr Sawtell during the ambulance journey to Port Macquarie Hospital. A medical practitioner pronounced Mr Sawtell dead upon arrival at the hospital.  
     
      
    35 The Offender was not affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    36 After the Offender fled the Lake Road premises, he went to the home of his stepbrother in The Bowsprit, a street in Port Macquarie. According to a Crown witness, Justin Milkovitch, the Offender had blood on his shirt. The Offender told another Crown witness, Adrick Mobbs, that he had had a fight with Mr Sawtell. According to Mr Mobbs, the Offender “looked like he’d been in an argument … he looked a bit aggravated” and he “had cuts on his hands” (T188). The Offender produced the push dagger and asked Mr Milkovitch to get rid of it (T186). Mr Milkovitch threw the push dagger and sheath into bush in a park near The Jib, a street in Port Macquarie. He later took police there and the push dagger and sheath were recovered. 
     
      
    37 At about 4.00 pm on 24 July 2006, Mr Mobbs contacted his roommate, Brendan Tudhope, who met the Offender later that day at Sancrox, near Wauchope. At the request of the Offender, Mr Tudhope drove the Offender to the Queensland border where he left him.  
     
      
    38 Police enquiries revealed that the Offender was in Queensland. On 27 July 2006, the Offender was extradited from Queensland to New South Wales. He was charged with murder and remanded in custody where he has remained until the present time. 
     
      
       
      Manslaughter by Way of Provocation or Excessive Self-Defence? 
       
      
    39 As mentioned earlier, the Crown submitted that the Court should conclude that the verdict of manslaughter was based upon provocation. Mr Bodor QC submitted that the Court should conclude that the verdict was based upon excessive self-defence. 
     
      
    40 Manslaughter by way of provocation or excessive self-defence were both left to the jury. I should note, however, that the Crown initially opposed provocation being left to the jury upon the basis that it had not been raised on the evidence. After hearing defence submissions on that issue, however, the Crown withdrew its objection (T303-307) and provocation was left to the jury.  
     
      
    41 I am satisfied that the verdict of guilty of manslaughter was reached in this case by way of excessive self-defence, and not provocation. The factual matters which led me to leave provocation to the jury were relatively slight, including the removal of the Offender’s property and its placement on the veranda and earlier events involving the Offender and Mr Sawtell in the context of the fish-tank incident.  
     
      
    42 On the other hand, there was evidence in both the Crown and Defence cases which provided some support for the account that Mr Sawtell was moving towards the Offender shortly prior to the physical altercation during which the Offender stabbed Mr Sawtell. I am satisfied that the jury proceeded to acquit the Offender of murder, but convict him of manslaughter, upon the basis of excessive self-defence. 
     
      
    43 I am satisfied that the jury was of the view that there was a reasonable possibility that the Offender personally believed his conduct was necessary to defend himself, but was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the Offender was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the Offender perceived them because that response was excessive. 
     
      
    44 The jury, of course, was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a deliberate act of the Offender which caused Mr Sawtell’s death and that the act causing death was done with an intention to kill or, at least, an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    45 I will return later in these reasons to assess the objective gravity of the Offender’s crime of manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statements 
       
      
    46 Victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing by Ms Barbara Sawtell, the victim’s mother, and Ms Clare Williamson, the victim’s partner. In addition, a victim impact statement was read to the Court on behalf of Mr Glenn Sawtell, the victim’s brother.  
     
      
    47 I acknowledge the victim impact statements and make the following comments about them: s.29(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The statements reveal the profound consequences upon Mr Sawtell’s mother, partner and brother resulting from his death. I express the sympathy of the Court and the community to each of them for their loss. One of the purposes of reading victim impact statements publicly in the sentencing proceedings is to bring home to the Offender, and others who might act in a similar way, the appalling consequences of the Offender’s actions extending beyond the death of Mr Sawtell. The profound consequences upon those close to Mr Sawtell will be entirely clear to the Offender. The law of this State makes clear that a greater sentence cannot be passed because of the impact of the crime on the victim’s family: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87; R v FD and JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392 at 415-416, 428. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    48 The Offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. A pre-sentence report dated 22 April 2008 was tendered together with a report dated 29 April 2008 of Marcelo Rodriguez, psychologist, which was tendered in the Defence case. 
     
      
    49 The Offender was 27 years old at the time of the offence and is now aged 29 years. He was born in Sydney and his parents separated when he was about 12 months old. Thereafter, he remained in his mother’s care. His childhood was marked by frequent moves from Sydney to Queensland and Victoria. He experienced difficulties with schooling and did not learn to read or write over the course of his formal education. He left school at the age of 13 years after failing to complete the first year of high school. 
     
      
    50 He commenced working as a trolley boy for a local supermarket chain. He worked in a number of short-term casual positions until the age of 19 years and was largely unemployed during his 20s. From time to time, he worked as a plasterer or in fencing, labouring and powder-coating positions. He was unemployed and in receipt of a Centrelink Newstart benefit at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    51 The Offender has been involved in two long-term relationships, the first being with the mother of his seven-year old son. That relationship ended in 2002. The Offender’s son resides with his mother and, prior to July 2006, the Offender saw the boy from time to time. The Offender’s current partner is a young woman (not Ms Scowen) with whom he commenced a relationship about one month prior to the commission of this offence. According to the pre-sentence report, this young woman stated that she cared for the Offender and will wait for him whilst he serves his sentence. 
     
      
    52 The Offender has taught himself to read and write whilst in custody. He informed the probation and parole officer that he intends to do a small business course either in custody or upon release, and then gain his formal plastering qualifications. 
     
      
    53 The Offender has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. It was common ground, however, that the Offender was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the present offence.  
     
      
    54 The Offender came into custody on 27 July 2006 and is currently an inmate of Parklea Correctional Centre classified as an A2 unsentenced inmate. Since November 2007, he has been employed as a wing cleaner. He is said by correctional officers to be a good worker who is quiet and polite. 
     
      
    55 The Offender has a number of criminal convictions. These include a bond for break, enter and steal in the Children’s Court in 1995, fines for a range of driving offences and fines for possession and use of prohibited drugs.  
     
      
    56 He has convictions for offences of violence. In 1999, he was sentenced in the Campbelltown Local Court to three months’ periodic detention for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In evidence at the sentencing hearing, the Offender stated that this offence occurred in the context of an argument over the sale of a car and that he used a wheel brace which caused injury to the victim. In 2003, the Offender was given a 12-month suspended sentence for dangerous driving and was fined and placed on a good behaviour bond for resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and intimidating a police officer, as well as being fined and disqualified for driving under the influence of alcohol or a drug. In 2004, a two-year s.9 bond was imposed in the Port Macquarie District Court for an offence of assault. Again in 2004, a 12-month suspended sentence was imposed in the Port Macquarie Local Court for malicious damage to property. In 2005, the Offender was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for dangerous driving, with a concurrent term of imprisonment for one month for failing to appear in accordance with his bail undertaking. 
     
      
    57 The probation and parole officer observed in the pre-sentence report that the Offender had a “moderate history of supervision” with the Probation and Parole Service since 1999 and that “his response to supervision could be best described as superficial”. 
     
      
    58 The Offender is taking anti-depressant medication prescribed by a psychiatrist at Parklea Correctional Centre, but there is no evidence of any pre-existing mental illness or mental disorder which relates in any way to the commission of the offence. The Offender suffers from Shwerman’s disease which results in severe back pain on a generalised basis, but more severely when engaging in repetitive tasks involving lifting or bending. 
     
      
    59 Mr Rodriguez recommended that the Offender receive ongoing treatment for depression and anxiety, drug and alcohol counselling, assertiveness training and occupational rehabilitation. 
     
      
    60 The author of the pre-sentence report stated that the Offender expressed what appeared to be genuine remorse for having committed the offence and expressed concern for the impact of his offence on the victim’s family and friends. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s Offer to Plead Guilty to Manslaughter 
       
      
    61 As mentioned earlier, the Offender was arrested and charged with murder on 27 July 2006. On 5 July 2007, he was committed for trial from the Port Macquarie Local Court on the charge of murder. On 3 August 2007, the Offender appeared before this Court and his trial was fixed to commence on 4 February 2008. He was arraigned formally on 14 September 2007 and the trial date of 4 February 2008 was confirmed. 
     
      
    62 On 7 December 2007, the matter was mentioned before me as trial Judge. Mr Bodor QC appeared on that occasion for the Offender as did the Crown Prosecutor who appeared at trial. Mr Bodor QC said “I have spoken to the Crown about a plea of manslaughter and the Crown indicated they are not interested” (T3.14). 
     
      
    63 Mr Bodor QC submitted that the Offender’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter as at 7 December 2007 ought be taken into account in his favour on sentence. Mr Bodor QC acknowledged that this was not an early offer to plead guilty, and likewise accepted that this was a case where the Crown quite reasonably determined that it should be left to a jury to decide the case. The Crown accepted that the Offender is entitled to some credit in this respect, albeit for an offer to plead at a late stage.  
     
      
    64 Where an offender is facing a murder charge and offers a plea of guilty to manslaughter, but the offer is rejected by the Crown and the offender is ultimately convicted of that lesser offence, a reduction in sentence may be warranted: R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at [15]-[16]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [118]-[121].  
     
      
    65 In my view, the Crown’s rejection of the offer on 7 December 2007 was perfectly understandable. On any view of it, this was a case for determination by a jury whether the Offender was guilty of murder or manslaughter.  
     
      
    66 The Offender did not plead guilty to manslaughter in the presence of the jury. He went to the jury (somewhat faintly) upon the basis that he ought be acquitted of both murder and manslaughter. The trial proceeded and a number of witnesses who were present in the house during the fatal incident were further distressed by the process of giving evidence.  
     
      
    67 Nevertheless, the Offender’s willingness to plead guilty to manslaughter two months prior to trial is a factor to be taken into account for its utilitarian value, albeit as a late offer made after committal for trial, arraignment and the fixing of a trial date in this Court. I consider that an appropriate discretionary assessment in this case leads to a 12.5% discount on sentence (see R v Forbes at [121]). 
     
      
       
      Assessment of Objective Seriousness of Offence 
       
      
    68 The Crown submitted that this was a grave offence of manslaughter, in particular, by reference to the number and nature of the wounds inflicted and the nature of the weapon used by the Offender including its concealed nature. The Crown submitted that, if this be a case of manslaughter by excessive self-defence, then the acts of the Offender went far beyond any reasonable response. The Crown submitted that this was a most serious case of manslaughter by excessive self-defence. 
     
      
    69 Whilst acknowledging the intrinsic gravity of an offence involving loss of life, Mr Bodor QC submitted that the present offence lay at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. He pointed to the limited nature of the majority of wounds which, he submitted, had been inflicted in a fast-moving eruption of violence.70 I am satisfied that this was a most serious case of manslaughter by excessive self-defence.  
     
      
    71 In assessing the objective seriousness of the Offender’s crime, an aggravating factor arises from his use of a weapon: s.21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This was not a case where the Offender, in the course of an argument, reached for a knife which happened to be in the vicinity at the time. Rather, the Offender left the house in the early hours of 24 July 2006 armed with the concealed push dagger. His text message to Ms Ross was intended to be insulting to Mr Sawtell. It provides some insight into the Offender’s thought processes at that time. It carries with it the suggestion that, if Mr Sawtell was present in the house at the unspecified time when the Offender returned, then some confrontation with Mr Sawtell was likely. I do not accept that the Offender believed that Mr Sawtell would be gone from the premises. 
     
      
    72 The Offender carried the push dagger back to the house when he returned. This was a frightening weapon which the Offender had acquired and had carried before in the event that he needed to resort to it.  
     
      
    73 When the Offender and Ms Scowen returned without notice to the house after 3.00 pm on 24 July 2006, it was expected by the Offender that there would be some dissatisfaction and resistance to their return, given the circumstances of their departure earlier in the day. The Offender’s text message to Ms Ross was not expressed in conciliatory terms. Indeed, the contrary was the case. 
     
      
    74 Upon entering the house, a verbal argument ensued between Ms Ross and the Offender and Mr Sawtell stood up and moved towards the Offender and took hold of him. Mr Sawtell was a large and solidly built man. The jury accepted that there was a reasonable possibility that the Offender believed that it was necessary to do what he did in defence of himself. What followed, however, involved a response by the Offender which the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the Offender perceived them. The Offender extracted the push dagger and used it on a number of occasions with lethal effect. I am satisfied that this was a grossly excessive response. 
     
      
    75 Given the jury’s verdict, I am satisfied that Mr Sawtell moved towards the Offender and laid hands on him. However, Mr Sawtell was unarmed. It would not have been apparent to Mr Sawtell, or anyone else in the house, that the Offender was armed with the push dagger. It was concealed in the Offender’s trousers. He did not produce it until after the physical struggle with Mr Sawtell had commenced. Even then, it was not obvious to others that the Offender had and was using the push dagger until the blood flow from Mr Sawtell made it obvious that the Offender was using a weapon of some type. 
     
      
    76 The Offender drew and used the push dagger, striking Mr Sawtell some 12 times, with two wounds being potentially fatal and one actually fatal. Although some of the wounds inflicted on the deceased may be explicable as wounds caused during a struggle, the repeated use of the weapon, including the infliction of deep wounds, demonstrated a clear, repeated and grossly excessive level of violence directed by the Offender to the deceased. 
     
      
    77 The earlier incident in which the Offender brandished a Bowie knife and Mr Sawtell obtained a sword, resulting in a stand off between the two men, does not, in my view, assist the Offender on sentence. I am satisfied that it was the Offender who reached for a weapon first in that incident. Although Mr Sawtell responded by obtaining a sword, there was no actual fight between the two men using the weapons. 
     
      
    78 The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender acted with intent to kill or, at least, intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Although the number of wounds caused to Mr Sawtell may suggest an intent to kill, it is necessary to keep in mind the nature of the majority of the wounds. There were, of course, three wounds which were potentially or actually fatal. The incident occurred within a short period of time. Not without some hesitation, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender acted with intent to kill. I conclude that the Offender acted with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    79 Although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill, this is not always the case: R v Hillsley (2006) 164 A Crim R 252 at 258 [16]. In this case, I accept that the Offender’s intent is less culpable, but given the nature and number of wounds inflicted, it is a grave case of manslaughter involving intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
       
      Determining An Appropriate Sentence 
       
      
    80 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900. I have been referred to other sentencing decisions for manslaughter in the course of submissions. Comparison with sentences in other cases must be undertaken with caution: R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter with the consequence that it is impossible to establish a pattern or tariff. This applies not only to manslaughter generally, but also to cases of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence: R v Forbes at [135]-[136]; Ward v R (2006) 166 A Crim R 273 at 289 [71]. To the extent that cases involving manslaughter by excessive self-defence provide some guidance, I am assisted most by R v Forbes, R v Cakovski [2005] NSWSC 1001 and Ahmad v R [2007] NSWCCA 177. 
     
      
    81 In R v Forbes, Spigelman CJ observed at [133]-[134] that manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence, that a wide range of circumstances may constitute the crime and that matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. Of course, a constant factor is that manslaughter involves the felonious taking of a human life. This constitutes a starting point for consideration of the appropriate penalty and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case: R v Blacklidge (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995); R v Forbes at [124].  
     
      
    82 In the circumstances of the present case, I am satisfied that the objective gravity of the crime was of a high order. Grossly excessive self-defence was involved. The Offender was armed with a concealed weapon designed for fighting purposes. He resorted to it, in the context of self-defence, thereafter inflicting multiple wounds to the deceased. 
     
      
    83 The Offender’s record of prior convictions for offences of violence does not assist him on sentence, although I am not persuaded that the record of offences constitutes an aggravating factor for the purpose of s.21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    84 I take into account in the Offender’s favour his offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in the manner referred to earlier in these remarks.  
     
      
    85 With respect to remorse, the Offender fled the scene and took immediate steps, involving others, to dispose of the push dagger and leave the State. None of this assists the Offender on the issue of remorse. It was not until his counsel raised an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter on 7 December 2007 that the Offender took any step involving an acceptance of criminal responsibility for Mr Sawtell’s death. I accept that there is some evidence of recent remorse on the Offender’s part, although it is mixed with an element of self-justification extending beyond what is truly available to the Offender on the jury’s verdict: s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Offender’s explanation at trial of his description of Mr Sawtell as a “copper dog” in the text message does not assist him on the issue of remorse.  
     
      
    86 I accept that the Offender has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, in particular given steps he has taken in custody so far to improve his education. However, some caution must be exercised in making this assessment given the Offender’s superficial response to earlier efforts by way of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.  
     
      
    87 I find special circumstances for the purpose of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by reference to the need for an appropriate level of management in the community to aid the Offender’s rehabilitation upon release and matters raised in the psychologist’s report. However, the adjustment of the ratio will not be substantial because I consider that the Offender should not have the opportunity of serving any lesser period in custody than the minimum term I am about to impose. 
     
      
    88 The sentence to be imposed must reflect the objective gravity of the Offender’s crime and ensure that the Offender is adequately punished for the offence: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. An element of both general and specific deterrence is particularly important in this case given the Offender’s carrying and use of a concealed weapon: s.3A(b). The sentence must also have regard to the Offender’s subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    89 After applying the discount of 12.5%, I am satisfied that a head sentence of 10 years and six months with a non-parole period of seven years and three months ought be passed. The sentence should date from 27 July 2006 when the Offender was taken into custody for this matter. 
     
      
    90 Wade John Stewart, for the crime of manslaughter of which you have been found guilty by a jury, I sentence you to a non-parole period of seven years and three months to date from 27 July 2006 and to expire on 26 October 2013 with a balance of term of three years and three months to commence on 27 October 2013 and to expire on 26 January 2017. The earliest date upon which the Offender will be eligible to be released to parole is 26 October 2013.

   Judgment1. The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation for a publication in the Daily Advertiser headed “Football Wagga president must go” on 2 August 2007.2. The plaintiff pleads the following imputations: 
     
     (a) That the plaintiff rules Football Wagga in a dictatorial style. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff has turned Football Wagga into a ruthless and possessive regime. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff acted dishonestly in performance of her duties as President of Football Wagga. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff is of a callous nature. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff suffers a psychological condition involving feelings of insecurity. 
      
       
      
    3. Imputation (e) was withdrawn during argument.4. The defendants challenge only the form of imputations (a) and (b). I have heard argument this morning and made rulings. The parties have kindly agreed that I should provided reasons for my rulings by email by reason of time constraints caused by a long-running trial.5. The defendants challenge imputations (a) and (b). I should first note that any determination of issues of form and capacity should be dealt with in accordance the principles of the Court of Appeal enunciated in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-915; [2007] NSWCA 254 and Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37. This last decision is of particular significance, as the Court of Appeal has explained the appropriate test on a strike out application as well as on a separate trial on the issue of capacity in clear and simple language.Imputation (a)6. The references to the plaintiff ruling Football Wagga in a dictatorial style can be found in paragraph 3 (“Donna Baker’s Football Wagga regime”), paragraph 4 (“Donna Baker’s ruled with iron fist”), paragraph 6 (“unrepentant management style”), paragraph 22 (“Baker’s ruthless and possessive regime”), paragraph 29 (“the dictatorship Baker is running”), paragraph 42 (“She is trying to dictate”) and paragraph 44 (“hell-bent on running the competition with an iron fist”).7. I have set out these passages because an understanding of the portions of the matter complained of which give rise to this imputation is necessary to deal with the defendants’ objection to its form.8. The defendants, relying on Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd (1998) 193 CLR 519 at [52]-[60] and Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [118]ff, assert that a plaintiff can rarely, if ever, encapsulate the sting of the matter complained of by merely pleading words used in the matter complained of as the imputation for which the plaintiff contends. It is asserted that the word “dictatorial” contains ambiguity, and that the plaintiff must identify what aspect of dictatorial style is being referred to.9. In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688, Hutley JA noted: 
     
     “Though a defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet, it is strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used, so that it is embarrassed in justifying it. This must mean it does not know what it is alleged an ordinary reasonable hearer would make of it.” 
    10. This is the first of many statements by the New South Wales Court of Appeal concerning the entitlement of a party to plead an imputation using the language of the matter complained of. The correctness of Hepburn was restated forcefully by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 148. Ten years later, Hodgson JA in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme & Co Ltd v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52]-[54] referred to both Hepburn and Drummoyne Municipal Council when holding that there were instances where a pleader could use the words of the matter complained of. Another such example is Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 where at [29] McColl JA noted that the use of the words of the matter complained of is permissible. Finally, in Malcolm, it should be noted that the imputation in question, namely that the plaintiff “had abducted and indecently assaulted a seven-year-old boy” is directly drawn from the matter complained of, which referred to the plaintiff as someone who was suspected of “abducting and indecently assaulting a seven-year-old boy”. The entitlement of the plaintiff to use this form appears not even to have been questioned in Malcolm.11. The technical arguments about forms of imputations should be looked at with particular care in relation to actions brought under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) as the imputation is no longer the cause of action.12. In Holmes v TCN Channel Nine Ltd (2007) 4 DCLR (NSW) 394; [2007] NSWDC 137, I noted at [16] that if there was any philological basis for claims that words such as “dictatorial” were ambiguous, it was surprising that there had never been any references to works on philology or semiotics (other than the dictionary, if that can be called a philological work) in any judgments on this topic. This application is no exception. Mr Sibtain asserts, in an ex cathedra style, that the word “dictatorial” is ambiguous because it is possible for there to be a “benevolent dictatorship” without referring me even to the dictionary.13. I see no ambiguity in the word “dictatorial”. When seen in the context of the matter complained of, it is quite clear that the plaintiff is being called a dictator. The language of the matter complained of is such that the plaintiff can best encapsulate the defamatory sting of the repeated references to a dictatorial regime by the use of the words “dictatorial”. Accordingly, the application to strike out imputation (a) must fail.Imputation (b)14. Again, the capacity of the imputation is not challenged; the objection is to form. The relevant passages for this imputation include many of those set out above.15. The defendants submit that no act on the part of the plaintiff is specified and that in those circumstances it is possible that the plaintiff has turned Football Wagga into a ruthless and possessive regime by accident, or by some well-meaning act on her behalf. The defendants submit that saying that the plaintiff has done something which has a consequence that Football Wagga has become a ruthless and possessive regime can convey nothing in terms of an act, and further that as a result the imputation cannot be defamatory.16. To say of any person that they had turned a football club into a ruthless and possessive regime is permissible in circumstances where the matter complained of is similarly non-specific. As Gleeson CJ explained in Drummoyne Municipal Council at 137, an imputation need only be as specific as the matter complained of. Gleeson CJ went on to note that if the matter complained of said “X is disgusting” then the appropriate imputation was that “X is disgusting”. This article is a good example of that principle.17. I note that imputation (e) was withdrawn during argument. I have taken that into account in relation to submissions on costs.18. In Viney v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1273 Simpson J deplored the bringing of unnecessary technical arguments (in that case an assertion that an imputation was rhetorical). It is to be hoped that the introduction of the new Defamation Act, the provisions of s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and the wise counsel of the Court of Appeal in Dennis as to the special statutory requirements for parties to conduct defamation cases in an efficient way ensure that arguments of this nature will become less frequent in defamation proceedings. Orders1. Defendants’ application to strike out imputations (a) and (b) as deficient in form dismissed.2. The plaintiff pay the defendants’ costs thrown away by reason of amendments to the Statement of Claim.3. Defendants pay two thirds of the plaintiff’s costs of the argument today.4. Gibson DCJ’s reasons for judgment to be forwarded to the parties by email.5. Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 8 August 2008 at 9:00am.

     The bottom line 
     1. Football Wagga President must go2. [photograph of football players] 
    3. Caption : DOWN AND OUT : The Riverina’s football community must support Sam Stedman in a bid to topple Donna Baker’s Football Wagga regime.4. Donna Baker’s ruled with iron fist for too long, says columnistTOM NIGHTINGALE 
    5. In the past fortnight, Football Wagga president Donna Baker’s integrity has been brought into direct question.6. The association’s reputation has been dragged through the dirt and those linked with its control blind to the misguiding ways of its unrepentant management style.7. While Cootamundra’s captain-coach Sam Stedman was hung out to dry, Baker and her committee encountered little resistance over their decision to suspend the much-loved striker for eight weeks.8. It’s a ban which permits Stedman minimal contact with the club and its players until the second week of this season’s final series.9. He has been stripped of his role as coach, his passion for the game bottled up and taken away.10. Stedman’s comments, the association claims, were a direct and loaded attack on Football Wagga and the rules and regulations governing the game.11. The captain-coach did little more than question the cancellation of a fixture and suggested his team would feel hastened to travel to Wagga for its completion.12. The punishment doesn’t fit the crime, despite Baker’s best efforts in justifying the heavy-handed suspension.13. The Football Wagga boss says the association made the correct decision, following strict guidelines set down by the game’s governing body, Football NSW.14. She claims the association worked closely with Football NSW in delivering a suitable punishment for the so-called lippy Cootamundra skipper.15. Guidelines were adhered to and fundamental processes followed during the judicial hearing, according to Baker.16. She has openly lied to Wagga’s football community for the past fortnight.17. People have taken Baker’s word as gospel. She has many faults as an administrator; dishonesty is one of them.18. When contacted by the Advertiser late last week, Football NSW claimed they knew nothing of Stedman’s battle with Baker and the association-run judiciary.19. “That was the first time we heard about the suspension”, Football NSW spokesperson Angela Habashy revealed last week. “Football NSW didn’t have anything to do with directly suspending the player involved.”20. Habashy dismissed suggestions that the game’s governing body played any role in rubbing out Stedman for the remaining weeks of the home-and-away season.21. Despite falling under the same banner, Football Wagga and Football NSW are worlds apart.22. Football NSW is as much to blame for Stedman’s current situation as Baker’s ruthless and possessive regime.23. They refused to speak on the matter, instead replying through a short three-paragraph email, 24 hours after initial contact was made seeking clarification on the suspension.24. Football NSW did everything they could to distance and remove themselves from Stedman’s case.25. It was a pathetic showing of leadership, considering the severity of the ban.26. The head office in Sydney appears to have a set method of dealing with its member associations. They hand out a complimentary booklet with a list of dot points and imaginary guidelines at the start of each season.27. Football Wagga, Baker continues to tell us, regularly turns to the colourful brochure when making important decisions.28. Given the developments of the past fortnight, Football NSW doesn’t know what is happening in its own backyard.29. They are blind to the dictatorship Baker is running in the Riverina and, rightly or wrongly, has [sic] no intention of intervening.30. In essence, Football Wagga is calling the shots, not the state’s governing body in Sydney.31. Stedman will launch an appeal in the coming weeks. However, his chances of having the suspension overturned seem unlikely.32. The captain-coach needs the support of the Riverina’s football community.33. Letters and emails backing Stedman have been endless. Few lauded Baker’s decision to ban him. 34. One Pascoe Cup first-grade coach did. Wagga United’s Andrew Douglas took a swipe at those who questioned the outcome.35. He placed his full support behind the under-siege association.36. He also refused to let the comments run in the Advertiser. He wished to remain unnamed.37. Douglas is out of touch with his own club; two of his most senior players have slammed Baker on countless occasions.38. Shame on you. Your comments serve little purpose.39. Supporters of football in the Riverina must find their voice. Too long have they feared being targeted by Baker and her callous actions.40. The code remains a laughing stock while the current plight is allowed to continue.41. Baker has barred Stedman from speaking to the media for the next eight weeks.42. She is trying to dictate terms and manage the competition like it’s her own personal playground.43. We run the agenda, not Football Wagga.44. Football and the Advertiser will last far longer than an insecure president, hell-bent on running the competition with an iron fist.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL in draft. Save in two respects, I agree with them and am content to adopt them. The two respects are first, that I take a different view of the respective responsibilities for Mr Sutton’s loss, and secondly, I will state my own reasons in relation to cl 11 of the sub-contract. 
     
      
       
      Apportionment 
       
      
    2 Mr Woodward was a Dalma employee and its representative on the Work Safety Committee. He knew of the projecting ties and that they presented a danger. He must have known, and through him Dalma must have known, that the danger was not minuted, and that although Erect Safe may have been aware that it should rectify the problem, the “system” by which the minutes stood as directions to the relevant sub-contractors meant that Erect Safe might omit to do so because the problem was left out of the operation of the system. It was necessary that Dalma itself follow up to see that the danger to its employees was removed.  
     
      
    3 Erect Safe created the problem and failed to rectify it, and I agree that its responsibility for Mr Sutton’s loss was greater than that of Australand and Dalma. However, in my opinion Dalma’s responsibility was equal to that of Australand. Australand as head contractor with obligations to workers on the site failed to take reasonable care to see that the danger was dealt with within the system; Dalma with its obligation to its employees also failed in that respect. In my opinion, the apportionment should be 50 per cent to Erect Safe and 25 per cent each to Australand and Dalma. 
     
      
    4 This is a minority view, and does not affect the result. 
     
      
       
      Clause 11 
       
      
    5 The operation of any contractual indemnity must be found in the application to the facts of the words of the relevant clause, construed as part of the contract as a whole. Decisions on the operation of contractual indemnities in different words in different contracts are likely to be of limited assistance.  
     
      
    6 It is convenient to repeat cl 11 - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Clause 11: 
         
         
        INDEMNITY 
        
       
       
        
        The Subcontractor must indemnify Australand Constructions against all damage, expense (including lawyers’ fees and expenses on a solicitor/client basis), loss (including financial loss) or liability of any nature suffered or incurred by Australand Constructions arising out of the performance of the Subcontract Works and its other obligations under the Subcontract.” 
        
       
      
    7 Australand incurred liability to Mr Sutton. It was necessary that the liability meet the description of one “arising out of the performance of the Subcontract Works and its other obligations under the Subcontract”.  
     
      
    8 In the extended phrase “its” referred to Erect Safe. “Other” was important; to give it effect, the reference to performance of the Subcontract Works was to performance as an obligation of Erect Safe. “Subcontract Works” was relevantly defined in the subcontract to mean the design and work to be executed in accordance with the sub-contract, and there were indeed other obligations than simply performance of the Subcontract Works, such as avoidance of pollution (cl 10.3). That is, the phrase was to be understood as “arising out of the performance by Erect Safe of the Subcontract Works and of its other obligations under the Subcontract”.  
     
      
    9 Australand incurred liability because it owed to Mr Sutton a duty to take reasonable care to see that the site was safe, and breached that duty by failing to take reasonable care to see that the danger presented by the protruding ties – of which it was aware through the Work Safety Committee “walk around” - was minuted and attended to. Erect Safe created the problem, and failed to rectify it, in its performance of the Subcontract Works. Did Australand’s liability arise out of the performance by Erect Safe of the Subcontract Works? 
     
      
    10 In Dickinson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust (1987) 163 CLR 500 it was held that injury caused when a child left temporarily in a parked car played with matches arose out of the use of the car. The Court said at 505 - 
     
      
       
        
        “The test posited by the words ""arising out of"" is wider than that posited by the words ""caused by"" and the former, although it involves some causal or consequential relationship between the use of the vehicle and the injuries, does not require the direct or proximate relationship which would be necessary to conclude that the injuries were caused by the use of the vehicle:  
        State Government Insurance Commission v Stevens Bros. Pty. Ltd  
        [(1984) 154 CLR 552, at 555, 559] 
        .“ 
        
       
      
    11 There is no easy test for the nature or extent of the causal or consequential relationship involved in the words “arising out of”, and a substituted form of words should not be devised to replace the words chosen by the parties to the subcontract The words are wide, but the relationship with Australand’s damage etcetera which they require is informed by their presence in an indemnity clause. So far as ambiguous, the clause should be construed in favour of Erect Safe (Andar Transport Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [17]-[23] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; F & D Normoyle Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 193; (2005) 63 NSWLR 502 at [47] per Ipp JA, McColl JA agreeing). The relationship should not be remote, but one of substance albeit less than that required by words such as “caused by” or “as a result of”; beyond that, it is a question of judgment on the particular facts.  
     
      
    12 The incurring of liability by Australand directs attention to why the liability was incurred, and particularly to whether an act or omission of Australand itself brought the liability upon it. Here it did. Although Erect Safe created the problem and failed to rectify it, the basis for Australand’s liability was breach of its own duty of care owed to Mr Sutton. The breach was by its own default and not because it was fixed with liability by reason of the default of Erect Safe. Australand’s own breach of its own duty of care brought the liability upon it, although Erect Safe’s performance of the Subcontract Works provided the occasion for it to incur liability. In my opinion, that is insufficient for the liability to have arisen out of the performance by Erect Safe of the Subcontract Works and of its other obligations, within cl 11. 
     
      
    13 I see no conflict in this with any of the decisions to which we were referred. The result is consistent with Steele v Twin City Rigging Pty Ltd (1992) 114 FLR 99, although that case did not turn on “arising out of”; the necessary relationship was expressed in the more readily satisfied words “arising out of or in the course of or caused by the execution of the works or in any way relating thereto”. The result in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Smith [2000] NSWCA 55 was otherwise, but there the indemnity clause as a whole was very different and on the reasoning of Mason P and Fitzgerald JA it was irrelevant that the act or omission of the subcontractor was not the cause of the head contractor’s liability. Once the clause in Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Palmer [2003] NSWCA 58 was construed so that the damage or claim had to arise out of the contractor’s performance of the works, the effect given to “arising out of” was similar to that at which I have arrived in the present case. 
     
      
    14 In F & D Normoyle Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd the Joint Venture was liable to the worker for breach of statutory duty in not providing safe access, a passageway being obstructed by stored pipes. The words in the indemnity clauses were “arising as a result of any act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor … relating to its execution of the works”. It was held by the majority that “act” did not extend to an act which was neither a neglect nor a default, and that neither of the sub-contractors had been in neglect or default. Ipp JA added, however - 
     
      
       
        
        “90 Further, in my view, while the phrase “arising as a result of”, in cl 12, is a particularly broad expression of the notion of causation, it is not open ended. The clause plainly does not connote “proximate cause” or “direct cause”, but it could not be construed so as to import an unlimited concept of causation. The clause does involve some causal or consequential relationship (cf  
        Dickinson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust 
          
        (1987) 163 CLR 500 at 505). Remoteness must form an element of the meaning of “arising as a result of”; more is required than the mere existence of connecting links between an act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor and the liability incurred by the Joint Venture.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        91 In my opinion, the acts of Normoyle in bringing the pipes on to the ground level of the construction site and storing them in their proper place are so remote from the accident which caused Mr Vranjkovic’s injuries that the liability which the Joint Venture incurred in consequence of those injuries could not be said to arise as a result of those acts.” 
        
       
      
    15 The present case is similar.  
     
      
    16 I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL, but the short minutes will reflect the majority view of apportionment. 
     
      
    17 BASTEN JA: As explained by McClellan CJ at CL, this matter involved appeals by Australand Constructions Pty Ltd (“Australand”) and Erect Safe Scaffolding (Australia) Pty Ltd (“Erect Safe”) in relation to a judgment of Goldring DCJ in favour of the respondent, Mr Sutton. There is also a cross-appeal brought by Erect Safe against Australand in relation to the order of the trial judge that Erect Safe indemnify Australand in respect of the latter’s liability to Mr Sutton. 
     
      
    18 In relation to the appeals, I agree with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and with the orders which his Honour has foreshadowed. In particular, I note my agreement with the apportionment of liability as between Australand, Erect Safe and Mr Sutton’s employer, Dalma Formwork Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    19 In relation to the cross-appeal, I have come to a different conclusion. For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the cross-appeal and uphold the order with respect to indemnification of Australand. 
     
      
       
      Cross-appeal: indemnification 
      
    20 In June 2002, Erect Safe tendered for the scaffolding work in respect of a building known as “The Nexus” being constructed at 13-19 Atchison Street, St Leonards in Sydney. The tender was successful and, by an agreement entered into on or about 9 September 2002, Australand sub-contracted the scaffolding work to Erect Safe. For the purposes of considering the claim for indemnification, it is sufficient to note three provisions of the agreement, namely those headed “Indemnity” (cl 11), “Insurance – Public Liability” (cl 12.1) and the definition of “Subcontract Works” in cl 19.1. These provisions were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “11 The Subcontractor must indemnify Australand Constructions against all damage, expense (including lawyers’ fees and expenses on a solicitor/client basis), loss (including financial loss) or liability of any nature suffered or incurred by Australand Constructions arising out of the performance of the Subcontract Works and its other obligations under the Subcontract.” 
        
       
       
        
        12.1 Public Liability 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Before commencing work, the Subcontractor must effect and maintain during the currency of the Subcontract, Public Liability insurance in the joint names of Australand and the Subcontractor to cover them for their respective rights and interests against liability to third parties for loss of or damage to property and the death of or injury to any person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ‘Subcontract Works’ means the whole of the design and work to be executed in accordance with the Subcontract, including variations … .” 
        
       
      
    21 In addition, cl 12.2 required that the sub-contractor have workers compensation insurance for its employees. The provision continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The insurance must be extended to indemnify Australand Constructions for their statutory liability to persons employed by the Subcontractor. The Subcontractor must ensure that every sub-subcontractor to the Subcontractor is similarly insured.” 
        
       
      
    22 The issue which arises in this context is whether the indemnity conferred by cl 11 extends to a liability of the head contractor which arises not merely from the activities of the sub-contractor in performance of the works, but also as a result of a breach of an independent duty owed by the head contractor to the injured third party. 
     
      
       
      Principles of construction 
      
    23 Before considering the proper construction of the indemnity clause, it is desirable to identify the principles governing the exercise. These were set out in the joint judgment in Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424 at [17]-[23] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). Their Honours affirmed the principle stated by Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in Coghlan v S H Lock (Australia) Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 88 at 92 in relation to “certain well-known principles of construction in relation to guarantees”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Such a document falls to be construed strictly; it is to be read contra proferentem; and, in case of ambiguity, it is to be construed in favour of the surety.” 
        
       
      
    24 Those principles were restated in Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 561, in the joint judgment of Mason ACJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “At law, as in equity, the traditional view is that the liability of the surety is strictissimi juris and that ambiguous contractual provisions should be construed in favour of the surety.” 
        
       
      
    25 In this respect, Andar Transport followed Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd (1989) 168 CLR 242 at 256 which, in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ, set out with approval the passage just quoted from Ankar. The principles were applied in Chan so as to relieve a guarantor of the obligations of the lessee under a lease in circumstances where the lease, though executed, was not registered and thus had no effect in law, as opposed to giving rise to equitable rights flowing from the execution of the agreement. 
     
      
    26 In Andar Transport, the application of the principles resulted in an indemnity clause being read down so as to limit the indemnity given by the appellant to “the indemnification of Brambles against any vicarious liability which Brambles might incur against third parties”: at [24]. That result was achieved primarily because of the contractual context which allowed that “a suit against Brambles premised upon vicarious liability was, in these circumstances, a distinct possibility”: at [25]. 
     
      
    27 It is also convenient to note at this stage the decision in Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 500. Darlington entered in to a contract with Delco whereby Darlington would act as a broker for Delco in the commodity futures market. Clause 6 of the contract required Delco to acknowledge that the broker “will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the client whether pursuant to this agreement or not”. Pursuant to cl 7(c) of the agreement any liability of Darlington “for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it … shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed $100”. 
     
      
    28 In affirming the principles of construction which applied in relation to exclusion clauses, the Court (Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ) remarked that recent English authorities had been at pains to establish an approach which did not rely upon the doctrine of “fundamental breach” to impose a limit on such provisions. The Court noted that it had not adopted such an approach and had relied upon principles of interpretation of the contract. After referring to the relevant authorities, their Honours stated (at 510): 
     
      
       
        
        “These decisions clearly establish that the interpretation of an exclusion clause is to be determined by construing the clause according to its natural and ordinary meaning, read in the light of the contract as a whole, thereby giving due weight to the context in which the clause appears including the nature and object of the contract, and, where appropriate, construing the clause contra proferentem in case of ambiguity.” 
        
       
      
    29 In applying those principles, the Court held that the exclusion of responsibility for loss achieved by clause 6 did not extend to unauthorised trading activity but concluded that the limit on liability contained in cl 7(c) did operate, in particular because it was broadly expressed to “comprehend claims arising out of or in connexion with the relationship established by the agreement”: p 511 (emphasis in original). 
     
      
    30 Although, as will be noted below, there have been suggestions that Ankar and Chan, as followed in Andar Transport, turned away from the principles stated in Darlington Futures, that seems unlikely to be correct. Not only was no such suggestion to be found in any of the later cases, but the hearings in Darlington and in Ankar were within a month of each other and the Court was constituted by the same members, three of whom were also in the majority judgment in Chan and four of whom were in Dickinson v The Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust (1987) 163 CLR 500, to which reference will be made below. 
     
      
       
      Application of principles 
      
    31 Three factors should be taken into account in construing the scope of the indemnity and the insurance obligation. First, it is clear that Erect Safe was to be an independent contractor. It follows that there can have been no expectation that Australand would be liable vicariously for any negligence or other tortious conduct on the part of Erect Safe, unless possibly it was conduct undertaken at the specific direction of Australand. 
     
      
    32 Secondly, it is clear both from their position adjacent to each other in the agreement and from the inter-relationship of their content, that the clauses relating to indemnity and the obligation to maintain insurance were inter-related. It should follow that Erect Safe’s obligation to take out public liability insurance, in so far as that insurance covered Australand, was intended, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, to be co-extensive with its obligation to indemnify Australand. It follows that the clauses should be read together and the construction of one may be influenced by the construction of the other. 
     
      
    33 Thirdly, the clauses should be construed in their broader contractual context which, as expressly recognised in various clauses of the agreement, involved the need for co-ordination of activities involving more than one sub-contractor operating on the site at one time and co-operation between the sub-contractors, for the purpose not only of the efficient administration of the contract, but also for ensuring safety of all persons on the site: see, eg, cl 2.2 and cl 16, dealing with occupational health and safety. 
     
      
    34 It is convenient to commence by considering the categories of liability of the head contractor, against which indemnity might be sought. These will, in any event, be limited to circumstances of liability arising out of “the performance of the Subcontract Works”. Assuming for present purposes that the relevant works were the erection of and dismantling of scaffolding, the first question is whether the relevant liability arose only out of performance by Erect Safe of the relevant works. Erect Safe contended that such a reading was required, consistent with the reference to “its other obligations under the Subcontract”, as appeared in the following phrase. The relevant activity involved the erection of scaffolding and there is no suggestion that it was carried out otherwise than by or on behalf of Erect Safe. Accordingly, the categories of liability may be limited to those arising out of the erection of scaffolding by Erect Safe. 
     
      
    35 In general terms, there are three ways in which Australand could become liable for an act carried out by Erect Safe. First, it could be vicariously liable in the sense that the law imposed upon Australand liability for the tortious conduct of Erect Safe. Secondly, it could be liable because the conduct of Erect Safe resulted in a contravention of a legal duty imposed on Australand. Thirdly, the act of Erect Safe might form the physical cause of an injury to a third party for which Australand was liable because of its failure to take appropriate steps to avoid the risk materialising.  
     
      
    36 Erect Safe in effect accepted that the indemnity would operate in the first two classes of case, but not in the third. The third case was distinguishable, it contended, because Australand was liable on the basis of its own act or omission, which constituted a breach of the duty which it, Australand, owed to the injured party. It would not be sensible, so it was contended, to read the indemnity as extending to conduct over which Erect Safe had no control. 
     
      
    37 The construction proposed by Erect Safe does not reflect the natural and ordinary meaning of the language of cl 11 and there are a number of factors which favour rejection of that construction. 
     
      
    38 First, the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause identifies an indemnity defined by reference to two elements; one is the performance of the works (by the sub-contractor), the other is a legal liability of the head contractor, relevantly to a third party. The performance of works is a reference to physical activities or a state of affairs. There is no third element, such as the liability of the sub-contractor. Nor is there any exclusion, as might arise if it required that the contractor’s liability be derived solely from that of the sub-contractor. The two identified elements are linked by a connecting phrase, “arising out of”, which connotes a weak causal relationship, rather than a direct one (as might the term “caused by”) or an exclusive one (as might “caused solely by”). In the ordinary sense of the connecting words, the physical activity or state of affairs must contribute in a material way to the legal liability. 
     
      
    39 Secondly, if the indemnity were restricted to the first two categories noted above, it would have no obvious work to do, or perhaps none at all. Because Erect Safe was undoubtedly an independent contractor, Australand would generally not be liable vicariously for the tortious conduct of Erect Safe. Indeed, it is arguable that it would never be so liable, because the exceptions to the general principle of non-liability (such as work carried out at the specific direction of the head contractor) are in reality examples of a breach by the head contractor of a duty which it owed to the injured party. Accordingly, understood in its commercial and legal context, a construction which limited the indemnity to cases of vicarious liability would be largely if not entirely ineffective. 
     
      
    40 Thirdly, cl 11 did not refer to Australand’s liability “for” the performance of the sub-contract works, but referred rather to a liability “arising out of” such performance. That phrase is consistent with a broader causal relationship than that proposed by Erect Safe. Its scope will be considered further below. 
     
      
    41 Fourthly, the reference to liability “of any nature” suggests a more expansive reading than that proposed by Erect Safe. It could be limited to the description of the relief which follows from liability, but it could also refer to the basis of the liability, namely whether direct or vicarious, independent or consequential. 
     
      
    42 Fifthly, the language of the insurance obligation in cl 12.1 is consistent with a broader construction of cl 11. Thus the insurance must not only be taken out in the joint names of Australand and Erect Safe, but must cover both of them “for their respective rights and interests” against liability to third parties. Accepting that the obligation to ensure Australand’s rights and interests will not extend beyond those to which the indemnity applies, nevertheless, the description in cl 12 is in unqualified terms and is not limited to joint or derivative interests. 
     
      
    43 Sixthly, the obligation to hold workers compensation insurance, contained in cl 12.2 of the contract, expressly extends to the statutory liability of Australand under the Workers Compensation Act. Although it is possible that the particular insurance obligation extends beyond the scope of the indemnity, the wording of the indemnity was apt to extend to such a liability. As will be seen below, the cases dealing with the phrase “arising out of”, of long standing in the workers compensation legislation, are inconsistent with the interpretation proposed by Erect Safe. 
     
      
    44 Adopting this approach, it may be understood that the performance of the contract by Erect Safe gave rise to duties of care imposed by law on Australand. The duty to the injured worker, specifically, arose out of the performance of the sub-contract by Erect Safe. It was the unsafe condition of the scaffolding created by Erect Safe that gave rise to a contingent liability on the part of Australand, if it failed in its duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the worker. As will be seen below, the cases recognise different degrees of causal connection required by different language. Thus, a question may arise as to whether there is a sufficient causal connection between the performance of sub-contract works and the liability of a head contractor where the only causal link is the presence of the injured party on the construction site as a result of the performance of the sub-contract. There is no doubt that the causal link will be stronger in circumstances such as the present where the default of the sub-contractor both contributes to the injury to the worker and creates the pre-condition of the liability of the head contractor. It is convenient, therefore, to turn to the authorities dealing with the nature of the connection required by the phrase “arising out of”. 
     
      
       
      Scope of “arising out of”: statutory examples 
      
    45 The phrase “arising out of”, in the context of an insurance policy, was given extensive consideration by Einstein J in Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2006] NSWSC 223, particularly at [990]-[1004]. 
     
      
    46 The phrase is also commonly used in relation to claims for damages for injuries which are said to result from or arise out of the negligent conduct of the defendant. In such cases, it is sufficient that the negligence materially contribute to the injury. Similar language was used in Smith v Australian Woollen Mills Ltd (1933) 50 CLR 511, a case involving workers compensation legislation, which required a personal injury “arising out of and in the course of employment” to base a claim for compensation. A diabetic worker fainted on the job, purely as a result of his diabetic condition. At the time he was moving between wool-carding machines and fell injuring himself on the machinery. The Court (Gavan Duffy CJ, Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ) stated at 511-512: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true question appears to us to be whether these conditions of the employment so materially contributed to the injury that it can be said to have arisen out of the employment.” 
        
       
      
    47 The joint judgment continued at 513: 
     
      
       
        
        “Many cases have occurred when the causal connection between the employment and the accident … consists in the presence of the workman at a particular place in the fulfilment of his duties. In such cases, of which the present is an example, it appears to have been felt that something more was required than the mere conjunction of the two circumstances, that at that place the physical object, moving or stationary, existed to work the injury, and to that place the workman came in the course of his duties.” 
        
       
      
    48 Their Honours concluded that if an additional element or consideration were needed (p 515), it was supplied by the fact that the workman’s fall brought him into contact with something which “like plant or machinery, is peculiar to the work or occupation, and is not common both to industrial and private life”. In that case, “the employment materially contributed to the injury, which accordingly arose out of it”: p 516. 
     
      
    49 In Dover Navigation Co Ltd v Craig [1940] AC 190 at 193, Viscount Maugham noted that the words “arising out of”, “connote a certain degree of causal relation between the accident and the employment”: see generally Kavanagh v The Commonwealth (1960) 103 CLR 547. In Murray v Favelle Mort Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 230, again in the context of workers compensation legislation, Hutley JA stated at 230B-C: 
     
      
       
        
        “’Arising out of employment’ and events ‘to which the employment was a contributing factor’ are synonymous or virtually so.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      Murray 
      , Moffitt P gave the language a somewhat narrower connotation at 226F, stating: 
       
       
        
        “Despite the lenient causal link admitted by the words ‘arising out of the employment’: per Viscount Haldane in  
        Thom v Sinclair 
         [1917] AC 127 at 135, 136, these words postulate a more direct causal connection than the words ‘contributing factor’ which are apt to admit remoter causes.” 
        
       
      
    50 As noted in Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GFS Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; 221 CLR 568 at [84]-85], the phrase “arising out of” was common in statutes providing for third party motor vehicle insurance in New South Wales over many years, but has since been “banished from the legislation”. In that context, it was a phrase adopted to indicate the relevant relationship with use of a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    51 Thus, in Government Insurance Office (NSW) v R J Green & Lloyd Pty Ltd (1965) 114 CLR 437, the Court considered whether a third party insurance policy for a motor vehicle covered an injury suffered by a workman in seeking to load a building hoist onto the tray of a stationary table top truck. The Court unanimously held that the injury was covered as a liability incurred “in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle”. Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Taylor JJ agreed) stated at 442-443: 
     
      
       
        
        “The phrase ‘arising out of’ is not here found in the same collocation as it is in workers' compensation legislation, where it is in juxtaposition to a temporal expression. In that sphere the words ‘arising out of’ clearly point to a causal relationship. The words ‘arising out of’ in s 10 of the Act and in the indemnity clause of the policy are not merely, if at all, explicative of the words ‘caused by’; they are really used in contrast to them; and in the total expression are extensive in their import. Bearing in mind the general purpose of the Act I think the expression ‘arising out of’ must be taken to require a less proximate relationship of the injury to the relevant use of the vehicle than is required to satisfy the words ‘caused by’. It may be that an association of the injury with the use of the vehicle while it cannot be said that that use was causally related to the injury may yet be enough to satisfy the expression ‘arise out of’ as used in the Act and in the policy.” 
        
       
      
    52 Statements to similar effect appear in the judgments of Menzies J at 445 and Windeyer J at 446 and 447: each of the latter considered that the relevant relationship had “some causal element in it” (Menzies J) or more than “a merely casual concomitant, not considered to be, in a relevant causal sense, a contributing factor” (Windeyer J). 
     
      
    53 Further, as Barwick CJ noted at 444: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Act does not evidence any intention to limit the injury against the liability for which the insured is to be indemnified to injury caused by or arising out of a negligent use of the motor vehicle. Of course, the liability of the owner to the injured person may require some tortious act, usually negligence for which the owner is responsible though many cases of liability will arise out of workmen's compensation legislation. But the necessity for some tortious or other basis of the liability of the owner does not require any qualification of the word ‘use’ in the statutory expression. It is the injury which must be caused or arise out of the use, not the liability for the injury.” 
        
       
      
    54 The last proposition was expressly affirmed in the later decision of Dickinson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust (1987) 163 CLR 500 at 504 (Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ). The negligent act of the father in Dickinson was in leaving two children in a vehicle, one with a box of matches, with which he managed to start a fire in the car, leading to injury of his sister. As the Court pointed out, although the negligence of the father may have had a merely coincidental relationship with the use of the motor car, the relationship of the injury to the use of the car, which was the statutory test, fell into a different category. The judgment of the Court stated at 505: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether or not the appellant's injuries were actually caused by the use of the motor car, it is sufficient to say that they arose out of such use. The test posited by the words ‘arising out of’ is wider than that posited by the words ‘caused by’ and the former, although it involves some causal or consequential relationship between the use of the vehicle and the injuries, does not require the direct or proximate relationship which would be necessary to conclude that the injuries were caused by the use of the vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    55 Because the indemnity in the present case is wide enough to extend to the statutory liability of Australand for workers compensation, the authorities with respect to the use of statutory language have direct relevance. The language of both cl 11 and cl 12.2 suggests that the indemnity was intended to extend to liability for workers compensation payments. It may therefore be assumed that the indemnity, using similar language to that used in the Workers Compensation Act, was intended to cover the full extent of the liability which arose under that Act. 
     
      
       
      Scope of “arising out of”: contractual indemnities 
      
    56 It is convenient to turn next to the authorities which have construed the relevant terminology in the context of contractual indemnity clauses. The first authority in the line is Davis v The Commissioner for Main Roads (1967) 117 CLR 529. The case involved a sub-contractor doing trucking work for the Commissioner for Main Roads (the respondent). The sub-contractor in carrying out the relevant work, collided with a train, causing damage to the train for which the Commissioner for Railways sued him. The sub-contractor sought to recover contribution from the respondent, alleging that the accident had been due to the separate negligent conduct of the respondent. The respondent relied upon an indemnity clause in the sub-contract which read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Contractor shall undertake the whole risk of carrying out the contract, and without limiting the generality thereof, shall - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) hold the Commissioner indemnified against all claims arising out of - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) damage to the property of the Contractor or any third party;  
           
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          whether such damage … is caused by the use of a motor vehicle or by goods falling or projecting therefrom or otherwise howsoever …. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Contractor shall insure any motor vehicle used on the contract in the joint names of himself and the Commissioner under a policy unlimited in amount covering liability for damage to the property of third parties ….” 
        
       
      
    57 The Court held that the indemnity was engaged for the reasons given by Menzies J (Barwick CJ and McTiernan J agreeing). The matter came on by way of demurrer, the issue being explained by Menzies J in the following terms at p 536: 
     
      
       
        
        “The short question is, therefore, whether the contract between the contractor and the Commissioner [for Main Roads] does entitle the Commissioner to be indemnified by the contractor in respect of the liability in relation to which contribution is sought, viz. liability to the Commissioner for Railways for the damage done to his locomotive by reason of collision with the contractor's truck. 
        
       
       
        
        The simplest way to test the matter is to disregard any negligence on the part of the contractor, and to assume that the Commissioner for Railways sued the Commissioner [for Main Roads] alleging that the damage caused to the locomotive in collision with the truck was caused by the negligence of the Commissioner [for Main Roads] and, then, to ask whether cl 7 of the contract would, in the circumstances afford the Commissioner an indemnity against the contractor for any damages awarded to the Commissioner for Railways against the Commissioner.” 
        
       
      
    58 Menzies J considered an argument that the clause could not be understood as conferring an indemnity upon the Commissioner against liability for its own negligence. The contention was dismissed on the basis that no claim could be maintained against the Commissioner in the absence of fault on its part. His Honour concluded (p 537): 
     
      
       
        
        “Accordingly the only purpose, or at least the principal purpose, for taking such an indemnity, would be to protect the Commissioner against liability for its own fault. Furthermore, once it appears that the indemnity does extend to the Commissioner's fault, including negligence, there is no sound ground for limiting the indemnity to particular breaches of the duty of care. The indemnity should be allowed to operate in accordance with its terms which throw upon the contractor the whole risk of carrying out the contract.” 
        
       
      
    59 In dissent, Kitto J (with whom Windeyer J agreed) in turn agreeing with Sugerman J in the Supreme Court, noted the argument that “the clause upon its true construction extends only to claims asserting a vicarious responsibility on the part of the respondent for acts or omissions on the part of the appellant (or his servants) in the performance of the contract, whereas the claim which the appellant alleges that the Commissioner for Railways might have maintained against the respondent was one asserting a responsibility of the respondent for his own acts or omissions or those of his own servants.” That limited construction found favour only with the minority. The minority view, which finds its echo in later judgments, fails to explain satisfactorily how and in what circumstances a head contractor could be liable vicariously for the negligence of a sub-contractor, so as to make out a plausible purpose for an indemnity, so limited. 
     
      
    60 More recently, there has been a series of cases dealing with contractual indemnities, particularly in relation to sub-contractors working on construction sites. In two decisions in 2000, this Court and the Western Australian Court of Appeal separately concluded that similar indemnities given by sub-contractors applied in relation to liabilities of head contractors to which the performance of the contract works by the sub-contractor had been a contributing factor. 
     
      
    61 The decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Speno Rail Maintenance Australia Pty Ltd v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd [2000] WASC 408; (2000) 23 WAR 291, concerned an agreement by which Speno had contracted with Hamersley to carry out rail grinding work for Hamersley on the latter’s railway. A worker employer by Speno was injured whilst travelling on the railway in the course of his work, as a result of the negligence of employees of Hamersley: see [1]-[2] (Malcolm CJ). He was travelling in a car known as an HIRail, which ran on the rail tracks, when the points were carelessly changed against him, causing the vehicle to be derailed, as a result of which he was injured. Hamersley had insurance with Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd in which both Speno and Hamersley were named as insureds, Hamersley being identified as the principal in respect of a contract between it and Speno. Malcolm CJ noted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The claim for an indemnity against Speno was based upon cl 37 of the contract between Hamersley and Speno which provided that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The contractor [Speno] shall be solely liable for, and shall be deemed to indemnify and hold harmless the company [Hamersley] against any and all liabilities, losses, damages ... of every name or nature whatsoever arising whether: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) under any statute or at common law in respect of personal injury ... or death of 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) any and all persons employed by it in the execution of the Work/Services ... 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          resulting either directly or as a consequence of the performance of the Work/Services under the Contract.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    62 As Malcolm CJ further explained at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was accepted by Zurich that Hamersley was an insured under the policy, but only in respect of any liability of Hamersley ‘arising out of the performance by [Speno] of any contract … for the performance of work for [Hamersley]’. It follows that the policy distinguished between the interests of Speno and Hamersley as insureds. Whilst Speno was fully insured in the conventional manner, Hamersley’s cover was limited to its capacity ‘as the principal’ and to ‘liability arising out of the performance’ by Speno of the work the subject of the rail grinding contract with Hamersley. It was in this context that the learned trial judge concluded that the accident would not have happened if Speno had not been performing rail grinding works or services under the contract, with the consequence that the liability of Hamersley to [the worker] arose out of the performance of the contract by Speno.” 
        
       
      
    63 Malcolm CJ rejected an argument that the injury was caused by the negligent operation by Hamersley employees of the points at a siding and that “the performance of the contract by Speno formed no element of [the worker’s] cause of action against Hamersley”: at [10]. His Honour relied upon the passage from Dickinson at 505, set out above. 
     
      
    64 Ipp J dealt with the argument that the accident was not “causally or consequentially related to” Speno’s performance of the contract and therefore that Hamersley’s liability to the worker did not arise out of the performance of the contract: at [64]-[65]. His Honour then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “66 It is true that the negligent act that gave rise to liability was the operation of the switches while the HIRail was travelling on the rail track, and not some aspect of Speno's performance of [the contract]. But the incident giving rise to liability occurred in the course of Speno's performance of the contract. That is to say, the HIRail was on the track and [the worker] was in the HIRail only because Speno required them to be in those places so as to enable it to perform the contract. There is undoubtedly a causal link between Hamersley's liability and the performance by Speno of the contract, namely, the presence of the HIRail (with [the worker] in it) on the tracks at the very moment the switches were negligently operated. 
        
       
       
        
        67 The words ‘arising out of’ are well recognised as being of broad import. Further, in the context of an insurance policy, there is no reason to construe them narrowly. It is difficult to conceive of any situation where Hamersley could incur a liability arising out of the performance by Speno of its contract … in circumstances different in principle to those in the present case. ….” 
        
       
      
    65 Wheeler J (with whom Ipp J generally agreed) dealt with an argument that the sort of case to which the clause was intended to relate might be one not dissimilar to that which arises in the present case. Her Honour noted the contention being put in favour of that approach in the following terms at [128]: 
     
      
       
        
        “128 … If in performing its contract Speno had unloaded from the HIRail some equipment and placed it into a pathway commonly used by people on Hamersley's site, and had been seen by a Hamersley supervisor who was aware that the area was a pathway but who failed to remove the goods, then if some person had walked through the pathway at night and tripped over the goods, Hamersley, as occupier of the site, would have a liability which arose out of Speno's performance of the contract by reason of the fact that Speno had brought the goods to the site and placed them there. 
        
       
       
        
        129 However, if one adopts the strict analysis contended for by Zurich in this case, and asks the question of what is the relevant negligent act or omission on the part of Hamersley, then the answer appears to be that it would be a failure to take reasonable care to remove from the site materials which it should have known were there and should have foreseen to be a hazard to visitors. On that strict analysis, the negligent act or omission does not arise out of Speno's performance of its contract; rather, the presence of the goods has ‘merely given occasion for the operation of’ Hamersley's negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        130 In my view, the reason that one might readily accept that Hamersley's liability arose out of Speno's performance of its contract in the example given, is that the presence of the hypothetical goods, forming part of Speno's performance of its contract, give rise to the duty of care which is owed to visitors to ensure that this type of hazard does not remain on the site.” 
        
       
      
    66 Her Honour’s reasoning was, in substance, that because Hamersley’s duty of care arose from the performance by Speno of its contract, so it followed that Hamersley’s liability arose from that performance. The same reasoning applied in the present case would engage the operation of the indemnity clause, even if Speno were not followed in other respects. 
     
      
    67 In Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Smith [2000] NSWCA 55, this Court (Mason P, Meagher JA and Fitzgerald JA) considered the operation of an indemnity clause in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The subcontractor shall indemnify and keep indemnified the company against all loss or damage including but not limited to all physical loss or damage to property (other than property for which the subcontractor is responsible under clause 16) and all loss or damage resulting from death or personal injury arising out of or resulting from any act, error, or omission or neglect of the subcontractor.” 
        
       
      
    68 The injured worker was an employee of the company (Leighton Contractors) but was working for a sub-contractor securing roof trusses on a building site, when one of the trusses collapsed and the worker suffered serious injuries. Both Leighton and the sub-contractor were found liable to the worker and the Court unanimously held that the natural and ordinary meaning of the indemnity clause required the sub-contractor to indemnify Leighton Contractors for its liability. Their Honours specifically relied upon the statement of principle in Darlington Futures requiring the Court to give the words in the contract their natural and ordinary meaning. 
     
      
       
      Inconsistent authorities 
      
    69 It was partly on the basis that the High Court had subsequently departed from that approach in Andar Transport that this Court in F & D Normoyle Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 193; 63 NSWLR 502 (“Normoyle”) sought to distinguish Leighton Contractors. As noted above, it is far from clear that Darlington Futures is no longer good law. However, prior to Normoyle, both this Court and the Victorian Court of Appeal had reached conclusions at variance with those which might have resulted from the application of Speno and Leighton Contractors. The earlier of the two decisions was Australian Paper Plantations Pty Ltd v J & EM Venturoni [2000] VSCA 71 (“Venturoni”). A worker was struck by a falling tree, whilst working for a sub-contractor in a forest on land owned by APP. The liability of APP was said to have depended upon the land being “unsafe” and APP failing to provide “a safe system for felling trees”. The contract between APP and the sub-contractor included the following indemnity: 
     
      
       
        
        “The [sub-contractors] hereby indemnify and agrees [sic] to keep the Company indemnified against all costs, damages, fines, expenses, claims, actions and suits whatsoever arising out of or in respect of the carrying out of the agreement.” 
        
       
      
    70 The argument against the operation of the indemnity was that the only connection between the claim and the performance of the contract was that the sub-contractors had brought the worker onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the tree felling. Buchanan JA (with whom Ormiston JA agreed) noted that the contract was almost entirely devoted to setting out the obligations of the sub-contractors and concluded that the words “costs, damages, fines and expenses” produced absurd results if the clause applied to the performance of the contract by both parties: at [11]. His Honour also noted that APP had agreed to obtain insurance at its own expense in favour of the sub-contractors. The prescribed form of insurance “provided indemnity against the liability of the insured to pay compensation under the Act and to pay damages at common law in respect of injuries sustained by a worker”, leading his Honour to conclude at [13]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view it would be incongruous if the appellant agreed to provide insurance for the respondents against claims by their workers and at the same time was able to visit upon the respondents liability for injuries sustained by workers engaged by the respondents pursuant to [the indemnity clause].” 
        
       
      
    71 After referring to authorities requiring that the clause be given its natural and ordinary meaning, his Honour noted that the construction adopted by the trial judge, in favour of the sub-contractors, was not strained. His Honour held at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rather, the trial judge interpreted the clause in the manner conceded by the appellant to be appropriate, that is, by requiring that the carrying out of the contract be more than the occasion of the liability in question and held that that requirement was not met in the present case.” 
        
       
      
    72 The reasoning also turned in part upon the proposition that the indemnity should not have been read to extend to carrying out the contractual obligations of APP, as opposed to those of the sub-contractor. However, it was the action of the sub-contractor in bringing the worker onto the land to engage in tree felling that was a step in the chain of events leading to the injury. That, it appears, was conceded to be insufficient to engage the indemnity. The submission of the appellant that there need only be a “discernable and rational link” between the liability or claim and the carrying out of the contract was not expressly rejected, but the possibility of absurd results, combined with the acceptance by APP that it would take out insurance for those working on its land, appear to have resulted in the adequacy of the connection being rejected as no more than temporal. 
     
      
    73 Venturoni was distinguished by Giles and Hodgson JJA in State of New South Wales v Tempo Services Ltd [2004] NSWCA 4 at [20] and disapproved by Meagher JA at [8]. It was referred to by Spigelman CJ in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Palmer [2003] NSWCA 58, as an authority relied upon by the primary judge Wood CJ at CL, in Palmer at first instance, but without expressly applying it. In Palmer, the indemnity was identified by Giles JA at [237] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The immediately relevant words are those in cl 18, ‘… against any claim or action brought by any person against the Principal … in respect of personal injury … of any person … arising out of the construction of the Works by the Contractor’, although the indemnity also deals with damage to the Principal’s property and claims against the Principal in respect of damage to property.” 
        
       
      
    74 Spigelman CJ (with whom Handley JA agreed) held at [213], after expressions of doubt as to the correct result: 
     
      
       
        
        “The concluding words ‘by the Contractor’ perform a function in the nature of the limitation. If cl 18 had ended with the words ‘arising out of the construction of the Works’, it may very well be that the differences between this case and  
        Venturoni 
         would lead to the conclusion that one would not add any further words. In those circumstances, it may have been the case that the proper construction would be to extend the indemnity to acts performed by the Principal. The addition of the words ‘by the Contractor’ were intended to limit the scope of the ‘claims or actions’ for which [the sub-contractor] agreed to indemnify the Council.” 
        
       
      
    75 Giles JA (with whom Handley JA also agreed) identified the alternative constructions in the following terms at [238]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Specifically, is ‘by the Contractor’ only descriptive of the activity of construction of the Works out of which the damage or claim must arise (‘the first approach’), or do those closing words mean that the damage or claim must arise out of the Contractor’s performance of that activity (‘the second approach’)?” 
        
       
      
    76 His Honour further stated at [241]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clauses 18-21 deal with risk allocation and protection against risk. On the first approach, the risk allocation worked by cl 18 would be unbalanced. The Contractor is obliged to indemnify the Principal against damage to the Principal’s property caused by the Principal or by third parties, over whom the Contractor has no control, and whether negligently or wilfully caused; and also against claims against the Principal for wrongs committed by the Principal over which the Contractor has no control, again whether negligently or wilfully committed. The only constraint is that the damage or claim arises out of the activity of construction of the Works.” 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour then considered that such a risk allocation was “not unknown” (at [242]) and considered the operation of the insurance clauses in that context. His Honour indicated that although two constructions were open, the provision for insurance “can be seen as favouring the second approach, with the insurance intended to cover the Principal with respect to its own negligent acts and omissions”: at [244]. Finally, his Honour held at [249]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Perhaps if the only basis for the Council’s liability to the Plaintiff lay in the acts and omissions of Pioneer, without fault of the Council, cl 18 would apply. But that is not so. The Council has one liability only. That liability arises out of the construction of the Works, but it does not arise out of the construction of the Works by Pioneer because one of its bases is the acts and omissions of the Council, the so-called direct breach of the Council’s duty of care. The ‘dual breaches of duty’ takes the Council’s liability outside cl 18 construed according to the second approach.” 
        
       
      
    78 The highly qualified first alternative, where the “only” basis for the Council’s liability lay in the acts or omissions of the sub-contractor, is presumably expressed tentatively because, as noted in Speno, it is difficult to understand how such a liability could arise. The second alternative is inconsistent with an approach that seeks an element of causation which may be a material contributing factor. But not the sole factor. Why such an approach is inadequate or inappropriate was not explained. 
     
      
    79 On the facts the dangerous condition of the road was the consequence of Pioneer spreading gravel on the surface in the performance of its contract. The negligence of the Council was its failure to erect proper warning signs with appropriate speed restrictions. Because the act of Pioneer gave rise to the obligation of the Council, the case is authority for the conclusion that an essential contributory factor will not engage such an indemnity, where the liability of the party indemnified is attributable to breach of its own separate duty. This approach was not consistent with Leighton Contractors (to which the Court in Palmer was not referred) or Speno, even on the restricted reasoning of Wheeler J referred to above. 
     
      
    80 The next case in the series is Normoyle, decided by this Court in 2005. It concerned an injury to a worker involved in the construction of a railway station at Sydney Airport. The worker was employed by Chadwick Buildings Systems Pty Ltd (“Chadwick”), which was installing gyprock ceilings under sub-contract to the head contractors, referred to as “the Joint Venture”. A second sub-contractor, Normoyle, had brought pipes onto the site and stored them on the ground level. In circumstances not revealed in the evidence, the pipes were removed to an upper level where they were a hazard. In the course of his work for Chadwick, the worker tripped on the pipes and suffered injury. The terms of the indemnity given by the sub-contractors, as set out in cl 12 of the contract, were noted by Ipp JA at [43]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sub-contractor shall indemnify and keep indemnified [the Joint Venture] and their respective officers, employees and agents against all claims, demands, proceedings, liabilities, costs, charges and expenses arising as a result of any act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor, its employees or agents relating to its execution of the Works.” 
        
       
      
    81 The majority (Ipp JA, McColl JA agreeing) distinguished Leighton Contractors, but the reasoning in Palmer was not adopted (nor was the case referred to the Court). Rather, the majority rejected the operation of the indemnity clause in relation to the two sub-contractors on the basis that neither had been in breach of its duty under the common law, under contract, nor its statutory duty: at [73]-[75] and [89]. The operation of the indemnity turned upon the meaning of the phrase “any act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor”. The majority held that these words, read together, demonstrated the need for a breach of duty on the part of the sub-contractor. Thus the indemnity only operated if the worker’s injuries “were caused by an act or omission by [the sub-contractor] that amounted to negligence or breach of contract or breach of statutory duty”: at [68]. This was a point of distinction between the indemnity in Leighton Contractors and that in Normoyle: at [62] and [65]. 
     
      
    82 Ipp JA relied upon two further factors in distinguishing Leighton Contractors. One was his Honour’s view that by reason of the decision of the High Court in Andar Transport, the natural and ordinary meaning approach in Darlington Futures “can no longer be relied upon in regard to indemnity clauses”: at [64]. For reasons already noted, it seems unlikely that the relevant High Court authorities, including Andar Transport, should be read as inconsistent with Darlington Futures, in a sense to which no reference was made in the later cases. As Bryson JA noted in Normoyle at [141]-[142], there is no necessary discordance between a rule that ambiguous provisions in an indemnity should be construed in favour of the surety and the rule that ambiguity may properly be detected if it is a reading to which the contractual language “is fairly susceptible without placing a strained construction on it, thereby giving it” its natural and ordinary meaning. The contra proferentem rule is designed to resolve ambiguities, not to create them. 
     
      
    83 Finally, in Normoyle Ipp JA noted as another point of distinction of that case from Leighton Contractors that “the argument in the present case is not that the indemnity applies to liabilities solely arising as a result of any act, neglect, or default of the sub-contractor”. That statement suggested no departure from the usual approach to questions of causation, which will take account of material contributing factors. His Honour referred to this question at [90] in concluding his remarks on the operation of the indemnity provision. 
     
      
       
        
        “90 Further, in my view, while the phrase ‘arising as a result of’, in cl 12, is a particularly broad expression of the notion of causation, it is not open ended. The clause plainly does not connote ‘proximate cause’ or ‘direct cause’, but it could not be construed so as to import an unlimited concept of causation. The clause does involve some causal or consequential relationship (cf  
        Dickinson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust  
        (1987) 163 CLR 500 at 505). Remoteness must form an element of the meaning of ‘arising as a result of’; more is required than the mere existence of connecting links between an act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor and the liability incurred by the Joint Venture. 
        
       
       
        
        91 In my opinion, the acts of Normoyle in bringing the pipes on to the ground level of the construction site and storing them in their proper place are so remote from the accident which caused [the worker’s] injuries that the liability which the Joint Venture incurred in consequence of those injuries could not be said to arise as a result of those acts.” 
        
       
      
    84 The last conclusion, at [91], appears to reflect no more than the absence of evidence that Normoyle was responsible for the presence of the pipes on the upper level. 
     
      
    85 Bryson JA in dissent, was satisfied that the injury to the worker, who was an employee of Chadwick, had a close and direct connection with an act of Chadwick, because his own act was an act of Chadwick and was thus an act attracting the operation of the indemnity. His Honour held that the other sub-contractor, Normoyle, was not required to indemnify the Joint Venture, because there was no evidence which established that Normoyle “had any part in getting the railings to the area where [the worker] tripped, still less that Normoyle had anything to do with their being strewn on the floor in [the worker’s] path”. 
     
      
    86 The other authorities which bear on the subject are a series of decisions of single judges in the ACT Supreme Court which can be traced to the judgment of Blackburn CJ in Canberra Formwork Pty Ltd v Civil & Civic Limited (1982) 67 FLR 66 at 85-87. As explained by Bryson JA in Normoyle at [144], if the appropriate Leighton Contractors is correct, those authorities adopted an inconsistent approach and should not be followed. 
     
      
       
      Resolving the inconsistencies of approach 
      
    87 The authorities stating the principles to be applied in construing an indemnity require that ambiguity be resolved in favour of the surety, but do not require that ambiguity be detected where the natural and ordinary meaning of the language, taken in its contractual context, requires no such conclusion.  
     
      
    88 A court construing a commercial contract, absent statutory authority, has no mandate to rewrite a provision to avoid what it retrospectively perceives as commercial unfairness or lack of “balance”: see Peppers Hotel Management Pty Ltd v Hotel Capital Partners Ltd [2004] NSWCA 114 at [69] (McColl JA) and Kooee Communications Pty Ltd v Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 5 at [26]-[32]. Particularly is that so where the parties have expressly allocated risks of particular kinds between themselves. The overriding commercial imperative in such a case is to give effect to the ordinary meaning of language used (absent use of technical expressions or terms of art) so as to provide certainty as to where responsibility may lie, against which insurance may be obtained. This contract expressly required the sub-contractor to take out insurance; the fact that it was not taken out should not affect the construction of the indemnity. 
     
      
    89 In seeking to identify the proper construction of a contractual provision the Court is not bound by the outcome in another case involving a similar but not identical contract. The Court is, however, bound to apply principles established in such cases. In terms of principle, the point of departure is between those cases in which it has been held that an activity of the sub-contractor which materially contributes to the liability of the head contractor is sufficient to engage the indemnity and the cases where the indemnity has been restricted to the existence of a liability in the head contractor which is derivative from a liability of the sub-contractor and involves no independent breach of duty by the head contractor. 
     
      
    90 If both categories were equally available on the language of clause, the Court should prefer that which gives effect to such an indemnity, rather than that which deprives the indemnity of practical operation. The latter construction, dependent upon the existence of a vicarious liability (however identified) is apt to deprive the clause of any practical operation and should, in principle, be rejected. 
     
      
    91 In this respect, principle is supported by the decision of the High Court in Davis, specifically in the passage set out at [58] above.  
     
      
    92 In addition, High Court authority dealing with the scope of workers’ compensation legislation also supports the broader construction. Because the indemnity in the present case was intended to cover liability of the party indemnified under the Workers Compensation Act, the indemnity should be given a construction consistent with the scope of that liability. 
     
      
    93 Identification of the correct approach does not, of course, dictate an outcome in any particular case. Nevertheless, the application of principles, in accordance with the authorities discussed, is reflected in the outcome in this Court in Leighton Contractors and in the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Speno. It also appears to be supported in Normoyle, although the actual decision in that case turned upon a specific provision of the indemnity, held to require default on the part of the sub-contractors, which was not satisfied. 
     
      
    94 Other cases appear to adopt a narrower approach. Venturoni may be understood in its own commercial and contractual context as providing a more limited indemnity than the language of the clause, taken in isolation, would have suggested. Palmer, however, is not readily distinguishable. It adopted an approach which was inconsistent with the approach followed in Leighton Contractors and, significantly, with that adopted in Davis. Davis was referred to in Palmer, but only as an example of an indemnity which extended to a liability caused by the negligence of the indemnified party: see [2003] NSWCA 58 at [242]. In my view Davis stands for more than that and should be followed by this Court, in the absence of material distinguishing factors. 
     
      
    95 As already noted, Palmer did not seek to overrule Leighton Contractors. Nor has Palmer been followed on this point by any other appellate court. In Normoyle, Leighton Contractors was distinguished but the only suggestion that it might be wrong arose from the suggestion that the approach in Darlington Futures should not be applied in relation to indemnity clauses. For reasons given above, the case-law with respect to the construction of indemnity clauses does not cast doubt on the approach adopted in Darlington Futures (or the correctness of Leighton Contractors). 
     
      
    96 In these circumstances, where there appears to be one decision in this Court, inconsistent with an earlier decision of the Court and not referred to in a later decision, the proper course is for this Court to adopt that authority which is consistent with authority in the High Court and, where available, the preponderance of authority in other intermediate courts of appeal. On that basis, the approach adopted in Leighton Contractors should be followed. 
     
      
    97 Adopting the approach in Davis and Leighton Contractors, the two identified elements conditioning the operation of the indemnity being linked by the connecting phrase “arising out of”, that phrase connotes a weak causal relationship which will be satisfied when the activity of the sub-contractor in the performance of the contract contributes in a material way to the breach of duty by the contractor. It is not necessary to adopt the full extent of the reasoning in Speno in order to conclude that the negligent erection of scaffolding in the present case materially contributed to the liability imposed on Australand. 
     
      
    98 An implied limitation that required the liability of the contractor to be entirely derivative from that of the sub-contractor would deprive the indemnity of any obvious operation and should be rejected.  
     
      
    99 It follows that the indemnity operated in the present case and the cross-appeal by Erect Safe against the judgment on the cross-claim should be dismissed. Erect Safe should pay Australand’s costs of the cross-appeal. 
     
      
    100 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: 
     
      
       
      Preliminary matters and the findings of the trial judge 
       
      
    101 Ian Sutton, the first respondent, was injured at work on 21 October 2002. He was employed as a sub-foreman and leading hand by Dalma Formwork Pty Limited (“Dalma”). At the time he was injured he was working on the construction of a large multi-storey residential and commercial building. 
     
      
    102 The Head Contractor on the site was Australand Constructions Pty Limited (“Australand”), the second respondent. Dalma is a formwork company and was a subcontractor to Australand. It is not a party to these proceedings. Erect Safe Scaffolding (Australia) Pty Limited (“Erect Safe”), the appellant, provided scaffolding services to Australand pursuant to a contract dated 9 September 2002. It was responsible for erecting and maintaining the scaffolding on the site. 
     
      
    103 Mr Sutton was injured when he was constructing formwork to enable concrete to be poured for the external wall of level 9 of the building. He was working with a formwork carpenter. They obtained access to the area where the concrete was to be poured by a scaffold erected on the outside of the building. The scaffold was attached to the building by “ties”, which were metal pipes placed through the previously constructed concrete wall and attached to the vertical members of the external scaffolding. The scaffold was used to position an external formwork wall or “perishutter”. A perishutter is a steel sheet which rested on three steel brackets, fixed to the concrete floor and the internal formwork. When it was required to be moved to a higher level, the formworkers removed the fastenings and it was lifted by a crane. The formworkers then removed the steel brackets from the level below and passed them to the level above where the brackets were fixed in place. The perishutter was then lowered onto the brackets. 
     
      
    104 Mr Sutton and another man prepared the perishutter to be raised from the 8th to the 9th level. They first removed the nuts and the steel bolts. The perishutter was then raised to a position slightly above the concrete floor on the 9th level. Mr Sutton and his fellow worker then climbed downstairs on the external scaffold to access the brackets on level 8. They walked along the planking flooring on the scaffold until they reached a corner. At the corner Mr Sutton was careful to observe the planking because some of it overlapped and could be a trip hazard. About 60 cm to 1 metre around the corner, crossbar ties supporting the scaffolding extended across the walkway at about head height. Mr Sutton did not see a crossbar and struck his head on it. His head was forced back and he fell backwards.  
     
      
    105 Mr Sutton was able to keep working. He removed the brackets and then manually moved them to the level above and fastened them to the floor. The crane then lowered the perishutter onto the brackets and Mr Sutton and his fellow worker bolted them into position. Mr Sutton finished work at about 6 pm and drove home.  
     
      
    106 To ensure that the site was operated safely, Australand had previously formed a Safety Committee. Dalma was represented on the Safety Committee by Mr Mark Woodward, one of its employees. He was elected to that position by the Dalma employees on the site. The Safety Committee included a representative of each subcontractor and some representatives of Australand, including Mr Darrin Lane, the site manager who was employed by Australand.  
     
      
    107 The trial judge found that both Erect Safe and Australand breached their duty of care to the plaintiff. However, his Honour found that Dalma was not responsible as the employer of Mr Sutton. Instead he found that Dalma was entitled to rely on the Safety Committee to ensure that Erect Safe had remedied the hazard. His Honour said of the Safety Committee system that “as all parties conceded (it) was, in theory, a satisfactory system. The failure of the system was due to the fault of either Erect Safe or Australand, or both, and not in any way to the fault of Dalma.” 
     
      
    108 His Honour apportioned responsibility for creating the hazard and in failing to remove it to Erect Safe as to two-thirds and Australand, as principal contractor and supervisor of the site, as to one-third.  
     
      
    109 The trial judge awarded damages to the plaintiff in the following amounts:

    110 The subcontract between Erect Safe and Australand imposed obligations of indemnity and insurance on Erect Safe. Clause 11 required Erect Safe to provide the indemnity to Australand and clause 12 required Erect Safe to obtain insurance in the joint names of Australand and Erect Safe. The clauses are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clause 11: 
         
         
        INDEMNITY 
        
       
       
        
        The Subcontractor must indemnify Australand Constructions against all damage, expense (including lawyers’ fees and expenses on a solicitor/client basis), loss (including financial loss) or liability of any nature suffered or incurred by Australand Constructions arising out of the performance of the Subcontract Works and its other obligations under the Subcontract. 
        
       
       
        
        Clause 12 
        
       
       
        
        INSURANCE 
         
        Public liability 
        
       
       
        
        Before commencing work, the Subcontractor must effect and maintain during the currency of the Subcontract, Public Liability insurance in the joint names of Australand and the Subcontractor to cover them for their respective rights and interests against liability to third parties for loss of or damage to property and the death of or injury to any person. 
        
       
       
        
        The policy must include a cross-liability clause in which the insurer agrees to waive all rights of subrogation or action against any of the persons comprising the insured and for the purpose of which the insurer accepts the term “insured” as applying to each of the persons compromising the insured as if a separate policy of insurance had been issued to each of them (subject always to the overall sum insured not being increased thereby). 
        
       
       
        
        The policy must be for an amount not less than that stated in the Details and the insurer and terms of the policy must be subject to Australand Constructions’ approval.” 
        
       
      
    111 The trial judge found that in the present circumstances clause 11 of the contract between Erect Safe and Australand was engaged with the consequence that Erect Safe was required to indemnify Australand in respect of the verdict which the plaintiff obtained against it. His Honour also found that, in breach of clause 12, Erect Safe had failed to maintain a policy of public liability insurance and accordingly Australand was entitled to damages for the breach of that obligation. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    112 Both Erect Safe and Australand have appealed his Honour’s decision. There are three issues which this Court must resolve. Firstly, Erect Safe submitted that his Honour should have found that Dalma was in part liable for Mr Sutton’s injuries. It was originally submitted that its contribution should have been assessed at 40% and that, having regard to s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, an appropriate reduction should be made in the damages to be awarded. Australand joined in the submission. 
     
      
    113 During the hearing of the appeal, counsel for both Erect Safe and Australand conceded that, in the circumstances of the present case, a finding of negligence against Dalma would not alter the damages to be awarded to Mr Sutton. Not surprisingly counsel for Mr Sutton readily accepted the concession. 
     
      
    114 Later, when an opportunity was available to reflect on the position, counsel sought leave to withdraw the concession. An opportunity was provided to the parties to make submissions as to whether leave should be granted and, if that happened, they were invited to make further submissions with respect to the resolution of the issues in the appeal.  
     
      
    115 In my opinion both Erect Safe and Australand should have leave to withdraw the concession. As I explain below the concession was wrongly made. Its withdrawal has an adverse financial consequence for Mr Sutton but it does not occasion any prejudice to him in resisting the appeal. 
     
      
    116 The second issue which must be determined by this Court is the appropriate quantum of damages to be awarded to Mr Sutton. Irrespective of the consequence, if any, of the application of s 151Z(2), both Erect Safe and Australand submitted that the award of damages made by the trial judge was excessive. 
     
      
    117 The third issue is confined to the dispute between Erect Safe and Australand. As I have already indicated, Erect Safe submitted that the trial judge was in error in finding that it was liable to indemnify Australand pursuant to clause 11 of the subcontract or was liable for a breach of clause 12. 
     
      
    118 Australand also filed a cross-appeal. It submitted that, even if Dalma was not liable, his Honour was in error in finding that Australand was liable as to one-third of Mr Sutton’s loss. As it happens this issue will be resolved by the resolution of the first issue in the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The liability of Dalma 
       
      
    119 The building which was being constructed by Australand at the time of Mr Sutton’s accident was large and comprised of multiple levels. Australand was required to engage many subcontractors whose independent activities had to be coordinated if there was to be a timely completion of the building. On such a project many safety issues will arise, making it necessary to put in place a plan by which those issues can be effectively addressed. In the present case that plan, as is common on complex building sites, provided for a Work Safety Committee. Comprised of delegates of each of the subcontractors and chaired by a representative of the Head Contractor, the Committee carried out regular inspections during which safety issues were identified and recorded. The minutes of the meeting of the Work Safety Committee were circulated and the subcontractor responsible for a particular problem was required to remedy the defect and report that any matter which was its responsibility had been remedied. 
     
      
    120 The trial judge found that the Work Safety Committee was an appropriate response to the safety issues on the site. His Honour also found that Dalma had fulfilled its obligations to its employees by its participation in the Committee. In particular, his Honour found that it was reasonable for Dalma to rely on the fact that its employee, Mr Woodward, had informed the Committee on becoming aware that there was a problem with the scaffold in the expectation that the Committee process would ensure that the appropriate subcontractor, in this case Erect Safe, would rectify the problem. 
     
      
    121 His Honour expressed his conclusion in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “For that argument to succeed, Australand would have to establish that it was the duty of each relevant subcontractor, on receipt of the safety committee document, to examine the whole of the site and to ensure that all safety concerns affecting its workers had been attended to. The evidence of Mr Woodward and Mr Lane was not to this effect. The system required that the subcontractor responsible for any potential hazard, on being notified of that hazard, had the obligation to rectify it. All other subcontractors were entitled to rely on the system, and so that once a hazard had been reported to the safety committee, the system would ensure that the subcontractor responsible for it would rectify it. Therefore trades and subcontractors, other than the trade or subcontractor responsible for the hazard, were not obliged to take responsibility for removal or remedying of hazards outside their own area, where other subcontractors had created those hazards. In this case it was the responsibility of Erect, as scaffolding sub contractor, to rectify any hazard created by scaffolding work. It was not the responsibility of Dalma. Even if Dalma, or the plaintiff personally, had read the safety committee document and was aware that there was a scaffolding hazard on 7th level (sic) it or he was entitled to assume that the scaffolding subcontractor had remedied the hazard. In other words, Dalma performed its duty by participating in the safety committee system, which, as all parties conceded, was, in theory, a satisfactory system. The failure of the system was due to the fault of either Erect or Australand, or both, and in not in way to the fault of Dalma.”  
        
       
      
    122 Mr Woodward gave evidence at the trial. He said that about a week or two before the plaintiff was injured he became aware of the projecting ties on the scaffold. It was noticed during a Safety Committee “walk around”. However, this defect was never noted in the minutes of any meeting of the Committee and as a consequence there is no evidence of a direction to Erect Safe to remedy the problem. Without reference to it in any minute, unless a member of the Safety Committee independently remembered the problem, there was little, if any, likelihood of the Committee following up to ensure that it was remedied. 
     
      
    123 There are difficulties with the minutes of the Work Safety Committee. Minute numbered 11 is recorded as the minute of a meeting held on 3 October 2002. It indicates that the next “walk around” was scheduled for 10 October 2002. No minute numbered 12 has been found. However, the minute numbered 13 is the record of a meeting apparently held on 11 October 2002. The minutes of a number of other meetings were also in evidence at the trial. They indicate that meetings were generally held at approximately weekly intervals. A meeting, minuted as meeting No. 14, was held on 18 October 2002. Mr Sutton was injured on 21 October 2002. 
     
      
    124 The trial judge found that the records of the Work Safety Committee were not maintained “with a high degree of accuracy” or “in any systematic way.” His Honour concluded that the minutes of one crucial meeting - I infer he assumed there was a minute of a meeting numbered 12 – were missing. If it was necessary to resolve the issue and, in my judgment it is not, a different conclusion would be appropriate. The pattern of meetings indicates that they occurred at about weekly intervals. This suggests that a mistake occurred and that the minutes of the meeting held on 11 October 2002 should have been numbered 12 and not 13. However, whether or not the problem with the scaffold was minuted, it is apparent from Mr Woodward’s evidence that the faulty scaffold was identified to the Committee. The absence of any minute means that there is no record of the problem being reported by the Safety Committee to Erect Safe for its attention. It should have been. However, whether or not a formal minute was made, his Honour found that the hazard was not removed or rectified within a reasonable time. 
     
      
    125 The question which divides the parties in this case is whether Dalma could discharge its duty to its employees by relying entirely on the Safety Committee to ensure that the defect was rectified. Senior counsel for Mr Sutton submitted that it could and emphasised the statement by Santow JA in Texcrete Pty Limited v Khavin [2003] NSWCA 337 where his Honour said that the duty to take reasonable care for employees is not a duty to keep them free of all harm. In New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4; (2003) 212 CLR 511 Gleeson CJ confirmed that the duty of an employer is not absolute. Although non-delegable it remains a duty to take reasonable care (at [22]). 
     
      
    126 In Kondis v State Transport Authority (1984) 154 CLR 672 the High Court considered the nature of an employer’s duty for the safety of its employees. In that case an employee of the Head Contractor was injured when a subcontractor who was extending the jib of a crane, deliberately dropped a part which hit the employee. A majority of the High Court, Mason, Brennan, Deane and Murphy JJ, found the Head Contractor liable on the ground that it owed a non-delegable duty to its employee to provide a safe system of work. 
     
      
    127 Deane J expressed the obligation of the employer in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The obligation of an employer to provide a safe system and conditions of work for an employee is not discharged by mere delegation to an independent contractor any more than it is discharged by mere delegation to an employee. It ‘is one of those’ cases in which a person ‘remains liable to third parties for the consequences of the negligence of an independent contractor, just as he would be if it were his own negligence or that of his servant’ (per Windeyer J in  
        Voli v Inglewood Shire Council  
        (1963) 110 CLR 74 at 95)” (at 694). 
        
       
      
    128 Later Deane J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the content of the employer’s duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system and conditions of work for the employee is not discharged by delegation unless the delegate, be he employee or independent contractor, in fact provides the reasonable care which the employer was under an obligation to bring to bear” (at p 694). 
        
       
      
    129 In the present case Dalma did not have exclusive responsibility for the safety of the premises which were under the control of the Head Contractor, Australand. However, as the trial judge recognised, it owed a duty to avoid exposing Mr Sutton and its other employees to an unnecessary risk of injury (Ferraloro v Preston Timber Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 627; 56 ALJR 872 at 873). The question is whether that duty could be delegated to the Safety Committee. In my opinion it could not be. 
     
      
    130 The rationale for the law imposing a non-delegable duty on employers was explained by Mason J in Kondis in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The element in the relationship between the parties which generates a special responsibility or duty to see that care is taken may be found in one or more of several circumstances. The hospital undertakes the care, supervision and control of patients who are in special need of care. The school authority undertakes like special responsibilities in relation to the children whom it accepts into its care. If the invitor be subject to a special duty, it is because he assumes a particular responsibility in relation to the safety of his premises and the safety of his invitee by inviting him to enter them. And in  
        Meyers v Easton  
        the undertaking of the landlord to renew the roof of the house was seen as impliedly carrying with it an undertaking to exercise reasonable care to prevent damage to the tenant’s property. In these situations the special duty arises because the person on whom it is imposed has undertaken the care, supervision or control of the person or property of another or is so placed in relation to that person or his property as to assume a particular responsibility for his or its safety, in circumstances where the person affected might reasonably expect that due care will be exercised. As we have seen, the personal duty which has been recognised in the other cases which I have discussed, such as  
        Dalton v Angus  
        may rest on rather different foundations which have no relevant for the present. 
        
       
       
        
        The foreseeability of injury is not in itself enough to generate the special duty. Before the special duty arises there must exist in the relationship between the parties an element of the kind already discussed.  
        
       
       
        
        That such an element exists in the relationship of employment is beyond serious challenge. The employer has the exclusive responsibility for the safety of the appliances, the premises and the system of work to which he subjects his employee and the employee has no choice but to accept and rely on the employer's provision and judgment in relation to these matters. The consequence is that in these relevant respects the employee's safety is in the hands of the employer; it is his responsibility. The employee can reasonably expect therefore that reasonable care and skill will be taken. In the case of the employer there is no unfairness in imposing on him a non-delegable duty; it is reasonable that he should bear liability for the negligence of his independent contractors in devising a safe system of work. If he requires his employee to work according to an unsafe system he should bear the consequences. Indeed, there is a stronger case for concluding that the employer's duty is non-delegable than there is for reaching the same conclusion in the case of the invitor. It is not immediately obvious that it is appropriate to impose liability on the occupier of a house for injury caused to an invitee by the negligence of an independent contractor, e.g., in making or repairing an electrical installation carelessly, when it is reasonable for the occupier to rely on the reputed competence of the contractor in a field in which the occupier has no expert knowledge. But this is by the way, for it is not an issue that needs to be decided in the present case” (at 687-688). 
        
       
      
    131 In areas apart from employer/employee relationships eg: landlord and tenant (Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris [1997] HCA 39; (1997) 188 CLR 313, Jones v Bartlett [2000] HCA 56; (2000) 205 CLR 166); road authority and users of the road (Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery [2007] HCA 6; (2007) 230 CLR 22); school authority and pupil (New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4; (2003) 212 CLR 511) where the High Court has been required to identify the extent of the relevant duty, the general view has been against imposing a non-delegable duty (Callinan J in Montgomery at [188]). The concern is that by imposing a non-delegable duty the court is, in effect, imposing a form of strict liability (per Hayne J in Montgomery at [153]). On occasions the High Court has questioned whether the law governing non-delegable duties of care is founded upon coherent principles (Lepore per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [246]). Kirby J has accepted that the law is a “mess” comprising a random group of cases (Montgomery at [31]). However, the non-delegable duty of an employer to its employees has not been qualified. 
     
      
    132 When an employer is engaged as a subcontractor on a large and complex construction site, its activities must conform to the requirements for the overall management of that site. Efficiency of effort requires that safety issues are managed by coordinating the efforts of all subcontractors through a body such as a Safety Committee. Because each subcontractor has responsibility for its own tasks and cannot undertake the work of other subcontractors, they are entitled to expect that the Head Contractor will put in place and effectively manage a system of safety appropriate to the needs of the whole site, (see Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1985-1986) 160 CLR 16 at 31). However, this does not mean that when it becomes aware of a problem posing an immediate threat to the safety of its own workers, a subcontractor may discharge its duty by leaving the matter in the hands of the Safety Committee. It has a responsibility to ensure that the Safety Committee responds effectively and rectifies the hazard, removing the danger before its employees are subjected to the identified risk. Until the danger is rectified it has an obligation to ensure its workers are not subjected to it, if necessary, by refusing to allow them to carry out tasks where they may encounter the danger. 
     
      
    133 In the present case the evidence confirmed that Dalma sought to discharge the duty it owed to its employees by relying entirely upon the Safety Committee. It neither took steps to warn its own employees or exclude them from working in the area of danger. In my judgment upon becoming aware of the problem, Dalma should itself have taken either or both of these actions. It would have been a simple matter to have required the height of the dangerous component of the scaffold to be raised before allowing its employees to continue working where a significant risk of injury existed. 
     
      
    134 It was suggested in argument that Dalma also breached its duty of care by failing to ensure that the Safety Committee both minuted the problem and took steps to ensure that it was rectified. Although the argument has considerable force, the issue was not approached in that manner at the trial and appropriate factual findings were not made. There may have been evidence which would be relevant to the resolution of this issue which, if the issue had been raised, could have been tendered. 
     
      
    135 Although Dalma must accept some responsibility for Mr Sutton’s loss, I do not believe its contribution should be as great as that of either Austaland or Erect Safe. In my opinion the greatest share of the loss must fall upon Erect Safe. It was responsible for erecting and maintaining the scaffold which created the danger. 
     
      
    136 As I have indicated, there is no evidence that the problem with the scaffold was recorded in any minute of the Safety Committee. The consequence is that there was no record of any direction to Erect Safe to rectify the problem. This deprived the Safety Committee of any ability to monitor the position and ensure that the work was done. The Safety Committee prepared minutes for at least two purposes. One purpose was to provide a written direction to the relevant sub-contractor to attend to a problem falling within its area of responsibility. The other was so that the members of the Safety Committee could ensure that identified problems had been documented, appropriate instructions given and ultimately effective response made to that problem. 
     
      
    137 The responsibility for the Safety Committee and its effective operation lay with Australand which had responsibility for the entire site. It should have ensured that reported problems were properly minuted and remedial action taken. It failed to do so. Although, in my opinion, its responsibility is less than Erect Safe, it was greater than Dalma. The appropriate apportionment of liablity is 60% to Erect Safe, 25% to Australand and 15% to Dalma. 
     
      
       
      Clause 11 of the subcontract 
       
      
    138 Australand owed a duty of care to Mr Sutton which it breached. His Honour described it as a duty “not to erect or permit to be erected on its site, scaffolding in a way that people walking along planking laid on the scaffolding would strike their heads on protruding ties”. The question which must be resolved is whether, within the meaning of clause 11 of the Subcontract, the liability of Australand “arises out of the performance of the Subcontract Works” by Erect Safe. 
     
      
    139 Erect Safe argued that clause 11 did not impose a liability on it in respect of a breach of duty by Australand. It was submitted that the clause should be read with “a silent ‘its’ [the Subcontractor’s] before the words “performance of the Subcontract Works.” It was submitted that the clause should be understood so that the “performance” was confined to that of the Subcontractor and Erect Safe was only liable for damage occasioned by any act or omission which it committed. It was further submitted that by finding Erect Safe liable to indemnify Australand for the breach by Australand of its duty to Mr Sutton, his Honour effectively turned Erect Safe into the insurer of Australand for Australand’s own acts or omissions as Head Contractor. 
     
      
    140 Similar problems have arisen in contracts considered by this and other courts. In Steele v Twin City Rigging Pty Ltd (1992) 114 FLR 99 Higgins J considered a contract where the project manager, Tekmat, contracted with another company, Senlos, to erect the steel structure for a major building. The plaintiff was a director and employee of a subcontractor to Senlos and was injured when a rope he was using failed. The contract between Tekmat and Senlos provided for Senlos to indemnify Tekmat in various circumstances together with an obligation to obtain insurance. The relevant clauses were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Indemnity  
         
         
        29. The Contractor shall be liable for and shall indemnify the Project Manager against any legal liability loss or claim or proceeding in respect of --  
         
         
          
          (a) Any loss or damage whatsoever to any property real or personal insofar as such loss or damage arising out of or in the course of or by reason of the execution of the Works or in any way relating thereto, and  
           
          (b) Any liability loss claim or proceeding whatsoever arising under any Statute or at Common Law in respect of personal injury to or death of any person whomsoever arising out of or in the course of or caused by the execution of the Works or in any way relating thereto, to the extent that the same is due to any act negligence omission or default of the Contractor his servants or agents or of any sub-contractor his servants or agents.  
          
         
        Insurance  
         
        30.1 (a) The Contractor shall be solely liable for and shall indemnify the Project Manager and employees in respect of and shall insure for a sum not less than that stated in the Fourth Schedule against any liability loss claim or proceeding whatsoever arising under any statute or at common law or assumed under this clause in respect of personal injury to or death of any person or injury or damage to any property real or personal occurring in respect of the Works or arising out of or in the course of or caused by the execution of the Works.  
         
        (b) The Contractor shall effect insurance for --  
         
          
           
            
            (i) Workers' Compensation or Employers' Liability insurance extended to include the name of the Project Manager for an amount not less than stated in the Fourth Schedule against any liability loss claim or proceeding whatsoever whether arising by virtue of any statute relating to Workers' Compensation or Employers' Liability or at common law in respect of any person employed by him or who shall be deemed to be or have been his worker or employed by him in or about the execution of the Works for the purpose of any such statute AND shall ensure that every sub-contractor from him (nominated or otherwise) is insured in like manner.  
             
            (ii) Public Liability Insurance to cover injury to persons and property extended to include name of the Project Manager and the owner of the site of the project and for an amount not less than stated in the Fourth Schedule.""  
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    141 Higgins J construed cl 29 to impose an obligation on Senlos to indemnify Tekmat against legal liability in respect of personal injury to any person. However, his Honour held that the words “to the extent that the same is due to any act of negligence omission or default” operated to confine the liability of Senlos to the consequences of its own negligence. His Honour followed the decision of Blackburn CJ in Canberra Formwork Pty Ltd v Civil and Civic Ltd (1982) 67 FLR 66 and held that Senlos had not, by cl 29, “contracted the cost of Tekmat’s negligence” (at 112-114). His Honour construed clause 30 so that the obligation to insure was confined to the extent of the liability arising under cl 29. 
     
      
    142 In Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Smith [2000] NSWCA 55 this Court considered a contract which included the following term: 
     
      
       
        
        “The subcontractor (ie B&B) shall indemnify and keep indemnified the company (Leighton) against all loss or damage including but not limited to all physical loss or damage to property (other than property for which the subcontractor is responsible under clause 16) and all loss or damage resulting from death or personal injury arising out of or resulting from any act, error, or omission or neglect of the subcontractor.” 
        
       
      
    143 The plaintiff was employed by Leighton, but on the day he was injured, he was working for the subcontractor, B&B, securing roof trusses. One of the trusses collapsed and the plaintiff was injured. Although Leighton owed a duty to the plaintiff as his employer, the “cause” of the plaintiff’s injuries was the faulty erection of the roof truss by B&B. 
     
      
    144 The Court, comprised of Mason P and Meagher and Fitzgerald JJA, reversed the decision of the trial judge and held that the proper construction of the clause meant that B&B was obliged to indemnify Leighton in full for the verdict against it. Informed by the decision of the High Court in Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited (1986) 161 CLR 500, where the court said that the words in a contract must be given their natural and ordinary meaning, Meagher JA held that Leighton was entitled to a complete indemnity. His Honour expressed the view that the trial judge “either added an implication that the ‘act, error, omission or neglect’ had to be solely that of the subcontractor, or he adopted some purposive construction” of the clause. 
     
      
    145 Mason P and Fitzgerald JA delivered joint reasons. Their Honours concluded that the clause was not concerned with the cause of Leighton’s loss or damage, being the cause of its liability to Smith, but rather with the cause of Smith’s personal injury. Their Honours concluded that it was irrelevant to the operation of the clause whether B&B’s “act, error or omission or neglect” was the cause of Leighton’s liability. It was a cause of Smith’s personal injury. Their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, the present clause is not directed to the cause of Leighton’s ‘loss or damage’, ie its liability to Smith, but to the cause of Smith’s personal injury. It is irrelevant to the operation of the clause that B&B’s ‘act, error or omission or neglect’ was not the cause of Leighton’s liability. It was a cause of Smith’s personal injury. 
        
       
       
        
        Second, no implied limitation on Leighton’s right to an indemnity can readily be identified. One suggestion made by B&B was that the word ‘solely’ might be inserted after the words ‘personal injury’, but there is no reason to suppose that it was not intended that Leighton should have an indemnity from B&B if both B&B and some third party caused a personal injury which resulted in loss or damage to Leighton” (at [7]-[8]). 
        
       
      
    146 A similar question arose in Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Palmer [2003] NSWCA 58 which appears to have been determined without reference to Leighton. In that case an indemnity was provided in the contract between the Council and Pioneer, under which the latter agreed to reconstruct part of a road within the Shire of Evans. The plaintiff was injured when her car skidded on a gravel section of the road which was under construction. The court found both the local council (the Principal) and Pioneer (the Contractor) liable for breaches of the duty which they owed to users of the road. The question was whether Pioneer was required to indemnify the Council for the Council’s own breaches of its duty of care. That breach consisted essentially of a failure to provide an appropriate speed limit on the section of the road under construction. The relevant clauses were numbered 18 and 19 and were in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “18. Property Damage and Public Risk 
         
        The Contractor shall indemnify the Principal against all loss of or damage to the property of the Principal (other than the Works but including existing property on which the Works are being carried out) and against any claim or action brought by any person against the Principal or his agents in respect of personal injury or death of any person or loss of or damage to any property, arising out of the construction of the Works by the Contractor. 
         
         
        19. Public Liability Insurance 
         
        Before commencing work under the Contract the Contractor shall at his cost effect a Public Liability Policy of insurance, for an amount not less than the sum stated in the Annexure hereto and with an Insurer approved by the Principal, in the joint names of the Principal, the Contractor and all sub-contractors employed from time to time in relation to the Works for their respective rights and interests to cover their liabilities to third parties including the liabilities set out in Clause 18.” 
        
       
      
    147 This Court determined that clause 18 should be construed so that the liability of Pioneer was confined to acts which it performed and did not extend to acts of negligence by the Council. Although with apparent hesitation, the Chief Justice preferred the view that the concluding words of the clause “by the contractor” were words of limitation and not merely included to indicate that the “construction of the works” was as a matter of contract to be undertaken “by the contractor.” [213] 
     
      
    148 Spigelman CJ referred to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Australian Paper Plantations Pty Ltd v J & E M Venturoni [2000] VSCA 71 where a similar conclusion was reached although in that case, because of the wording of the relevant clause, the court found it necessary to construe it by including the words “by the tenderer”. 
     
      
    149 Giles JA in a separate judgment on this issue said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clauses 18-21 deal with risk allocation and protection against risk. On the first approach, the risk allocation worked by cl 18 would be unbalanced. The Contractor is obliged to indemnify the Principal against damage to the Principal’s property caused by the Principal or by third parties, over whom the Contractor has no control, and whether negligently or wilfully caused; and also against claims against the Principal for wrongs committed by the Principal over which the Contractor has no control, again whether negligently or wilfully committed. The only constraint is that the damage or claim arises out of the activity of construction of the Works.  
         
         
        Such a risk allocation is not unknown. An indemnity can extend to a liability caused by the negligence of the indemnified party, see for example  
        Davis v The Commissioner for Main Roads 
         (1966) 117 CLR 529;  
        Valkonen v Jennings Constructions Ltd 
         (SAFC, 29 November 1995, unreported). But the unbalanced allocation of risk, particularly in that the Principal would have no reason to be responsible for itself or towards others in what it did or failed to do in relation to the construction of the Works, gives some point to further significance in “by the Contractor”.  
         
         
        It is plain enough that an equivalent imbalance in the allocation of risk was not intended in the case of personal injury of workers engaged in the Works. Absent the specific provision in cl 20, cl 18 would cover a claim brought by an injured worker against the Principal, because the injured worker would be within “any person” and the injury would arise out of the construction of the Works. Clause 20 excludes indemnity where the injury results from the Principal’s breach of contract or negligent act. It would be strange if the wider risk of third party claims against the Principal for wrongs committed by the Principal were left with the Contractor. The Council submitted that, when there is the express exception in cl 20 and no such exception in cl 18, it follows that the indemnity in cl 18 is relevantly unconstrained. That does not follow. Clause 20 has the words “during the execution of the Works” followed by the exception; cl 18 has the words “arising out of the construction of the Works” followed by the words “by the Contractor”. It is a sensible reading that the two combinations should be read so as to bring about a similar result, the words “by the Contractor” doing similar work to the express exception.  
         
         
        Risk allocation can be affected by insurance. The public liability insurance effected pursuant to cl 19 would in theory alleviate the Contractor’s burden, in that indemnity to the Principal under the insurance would mean that the Contractor would not be called upon to indemnify the Principal. But theory and reality may be different, depending on the terms of the insurance and the solvency of the insurer. On the first approach the Contractor would still be exposed to an ample indemnity. The provision for insurance can be seen as favouring the second approach, with the insurance intended to cover the Principal with respect to its own negligent acts and omissions. That is the scheme in relation to insurance of employees. The cl 21 insurance covers the Principal’s liability at common law, being a liability outside the indemnity in cl 20. The part played by the cl 19 insurance, it might be thought, is the same.  
         
         
        Each of the approaches to cl 18 is fairly arguable. On the foregoing analysis, however, which I do not think departs from anything said by the Chief Justice, the second approach better accommodates the language of cl 18 and its operation in the contract as a whole, and is to be preferred.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        The Council’s liability for breach of a non-delegable duty of care is a liability for breach of its own duty of care, but the breach of its duty of care is made out by failure of Pioneer to take reasonable care. It can therefore be said that so far as the Council is liable to the Plaintiff for what could be called vicarious breach of its duty of care, its liability arises out of the construction of the Works by Pioneer within the second approach earlier identified. (The language of direct or vicarious breach of duty is not satisfactory, and is sometimes used in a different way, see especially Swanton, “Non-delegable Duties: Liability for the Negligence of Independent Contractors” (1991) 4 JCL 183; (1992) 5 JCL 26. It sufficiently reflects the presently relevant distinction.)  
         
         
        But I do not think that avails the Council. Perhaps if the only basis for the Council’s liability to the Plaintiff lay in the acts and omissions of Pioneer, without fault of the Council, cl 18 would apply. But that is not so. The Council has one liability only. That liability arises out of the construction of the Works, but it does not arise out of the construction of the Works by Pioneer because one of its bases is the acts and omissions of the Council, the so-called direct breach of the Council’s duty of care. The “dual breaches of duty” takes the Council’s liability outside cl 18 construed according to the second approach” (at [241]-[249]). 
        
       
      
    150 The issue was again considered by this Court in F & D Normoyle Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 193; (2005) 63 NSWLR 502 where the contract contained a clause in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sub-contractor shall indemnify and keep indemnified [the Joint Venture] and their respective officers, employees and agents against all claims, demands, proceedings, liabilities, costs, charges and expenses arising as a result of any act, neglect or default of the sub-contractor, its employees or agents relating to its execution of the Works” (at [43]). 
        
       
      
    151 Ipp JA, with whom McColl JA agreed, guided by the High Court’s decision in Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd (1987) 162 CLR 549 to the effect that “a doubt as to the status of a provision in a guarantee should therefore be resolved in favour of the surety” (at 561) construed the clause favourably to the subcontractor. In so doing his Honour distinguished Leighton saying, inter alia, that the approach in Darlington was no longer appropriate following the decision of the High Court in Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles [2004] HCA 28; (2004) 217 CLR 424 which adopted the principles in Ankar and Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd (1989) 168 CLR 242. 
     
      
    152 The issue in Transfield related to whether the “act” referred to in the clause should be understood as meaning an act involving a breach of a legal duty and construed ejusdem generis with “neglect” or “default of the subcontractor”. Ipp JA concluded that it should. Bryson JA, who dissented, took a different view. Finding no ambiguity in the clause, his Honour found no reason to apply the principles of construction in Ankar and Andar. 
     
      
    153 It was submitted by Erect Safe that the construction of the contract favoured by the Court of Appeal in Palmer was appropriate in the present matter. Although Australand originally submitted that Palmer was wrongly decided and sought leave to argue that issue, that submission was later withdrawn. It was ultimately submitted that Palmer was distinguishable by reason of the inclusion of the words “by the Contractor” at the end of the relevant clause. Erect Safe submitted that the words “and its other obligations under the Subcontract” had the same affect as the words “by the Contractor” in Palmer. However, Australand submitted that those words were intended as a reference to obligations other than those arising in respect of the Subcontract Works and did not operate to limit the liability of Erect Safe for damages in its performance of the Subcontract Works. 
     
      
    154 The resolution of any disagreement about a particular clause in a contract must be approached by considering the terms of the relevant document. Although the resolution of disputes in other cases may provide guidance, each dispute must be resolved by the application of the accepted principles of construction to the particular contract. 
     
      
    155 The question in the present dispute is whether clause 11 confines the liability of Erect Safe to indemnify Australand for liabilities arising from Erect Safe’s performance of the Subcontract Works or whether it extends to a liability of Australand which arises in relation to those Works. To my mind the indemnity is confined. Although the appropriate meaning may have been more obvious if the word “its” had been included before the words “performance of the Subcontract Works” I do not believe the clause lacks clarity. However, if the clause is ambiguous, it would have to be construed in favour of the surety, Erect Safe (see Ankar).  
     
      
    156 Clause 11 provides for Erect Safe to indemnify Australand against all “damage etc”. Although the indemnity is initially described in broad terms, it is confined by the word “arising”. The clause provides that the relevant obligation can arise in two situations being: “out of the performance of the Subcontract Works” and “its (Erect Safe’s) other obligations under the Subcontract.” 
     
      
    157 In the present case the liability of Australand does not “arise” out of the performance by Erect Safe of any of its contractual obligations. Although it is true that the occasion for the liability of Australand was the erection by Erect Safe of the faulty scaffold, the liability of Australand arises from its own independent act of negligence in failing to maintain an appropriate safety regime for the site. 
     
      
    158 Apart from the decision in Leighton, there is no decision which would suggest that a contrary construction should be adopted. As I have indicated, the majority of this Court in Transfield adopted a different approach to that adopted in Leighton, inter alia, for the reason that the approach in Darlington Futures applied by the court in Leighton was no longer appropriate. 
     
      
    159 In any event, in my opinion, the decision in Leighton is not inconsistent with the construction that I prefer in the present case. The words in issue in Leighton were “loss etc resulting from death or personal injury arising out of or resulting from any act, error, or omission or neglect (of the subcontractor).” This Court determined that the clause was not concerned with the cause of Leighton’s loss or damage “but to the cause of (the plaintiff’s) personal injury”. The court found that the indemnity extended to loss or damage from personal injury to the plaintiff caused by the subcontractor irrespective of whether the act, error, omission or neglect was the cause of Leighton’s liability. Critical to the decision in Leighton was the fact that it was the act of the subcontractor erecting the scaffold which alone caused the plaintiff’s injury. Leighton was liable only because the plaintiff was Leighton’s employee to whom it owed a non-delegable duty. The plaintiff’s injury was caused entirely by the subcontractor’s act in breach of its duty.  
     
      
    160 In the present case the cause of the plaintiff’s injury was, in part, the negligence of Erect Safe but was also in part caused by the independent act of negligence of Australand. The liability of Australand was as a result of its own negligent act rather than arising out of the performance of the Subcontract Works by Erect Safe. 
     
      
       
      Clause 12 of the subcontract 
       
      
    161 Erect Safe concedes that no insurance policy existed. The trial judge found that Australand was entitled to damages flowing from Erect Safe’s breach of its obligation to obtain insurance. That finding is challenged on two bases. Firstly, it is submitted that by allowing Erect Safe to commence work on the site without requiring evidence of the existence of the contract of insurance, Australand waived its right to insist on compliance with clause 12.1. Secondly, it was submitted that clause 12.1 only required insurance to secure any liability in Australand arising from the negligence of Erect Safe and did not extend to secure any liability of Australand arising from its own negligence. 
     
      
    162 Although in Australand’s written submissions waiver was argued, that submission was not agitated at the trial. It was not pleaded and as a consequence no factual findings were made in relation to it. The success of the submission may have depended on an understanding of the relevant facts. The evidence is silent in respect of these matters. The submission must fail. 
     
      
    163 The obligation imposed on Erect Safe by clause 12.1 was to obtain insurance to cover both Australand and Erect Safe “for their respective rights and interests against liability to third parties for loss of or damage to property and the death of or injury to any person”. 
     
      
    164 Clause 12, of course, follows clause 11 and I have already concluded that the liability of Erect Safe under clause 11 is confined. It would be surprising if, notwithstanding that limitation, the parties intended Erect Safe to obtain insurance for any liability of Australand, even that arising from its own negligence. 
     
      
    165 As I have previously discussed, in Steele v Twin City Rigging Pty Limited (1992) 114 FLR 99 Higgins J in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory concluded that the indemnity in clause 29 of the contract in that case did not extend to the liability of the project manager for its own negligence. His Honour further concluded that the insurance clause was intended to require the subcontractor to obtain insurance to support the indemnity but did not require it to obtain insurance in respect of any liability in the project manager arising from its own negligence. His Honour was urged to follow the decision of Kelly J in Cervellone v Besselink Bros Pty Ltd (1984) 55 ACTR 1 where it was held that the insurance clause was intended to support a complete indemnity. However, the relevant clause in Cervellone provided for a complete indemnity by the subcontractor. The obligation under the insurance clause was construed as requiring insurance to secure that indemnity. 
     
      
    166 Instead of following the decision in Cervellone, Higgins J followed the decision of Blackburn CJ in Canberra Formwork Pty Ltd v Civil & Civic Ltd (1982) 67 FLR 66 (and see also Lyons v Fondi Investments Pty Ltd (1998) 10 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-421; Celik v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] ACTSC 27 and Johnson v The Australian War Memorial [2005] ACTSC 122). The approach taken in each of these decisions is that, in the absence of express words, the obligation under an insurance clause in a contract which is provided to support an indemnity clause will not require the subcontractor to maintain insurance against loss occasioned by the Head Contractor’s negligence. 
     
      
    167 In my opinion it is appropriate to adopt the same approach to the construction of clause 12.1 in the present case. The obligation was to obtain insurance to cover Australand and Erect Safe “to cover them for their respective rights and interests against liability to third parties …”. Australand’s “rights and interests” referred to are those provided by the indemnity provided in clause 11. There being no right in Australand to recover from Erect Safe in respect of damages occasioned by its own negligence, there was no obligation in Erect Safe to obtain insurance to support Australand’s direct liability to another caused by the negligent act of Australand. 
     
      
       
      Damages 
       
      
    168 There was little dispute at the trial as to the injuries which Mr Sutton suffered. Although he was able to continue working, he suffered immediate neck pain which has increased in intensity. He did not see his general practitioner until 5 weeks after suffering the injury when the initial diagnosis was “a whiplash injury” to the cervical spine. He was initially treated by a physiotherapist but this was not successful. 
     
      
    169 Mr Sutton has been left with constant pain radiating down his arms, particularly the left arm and a loss of sensation in a finger of his left hand. At the trial he gave evidence of an increased loss of sensation in the palm of both hands. The trial judge accepted his account of his disabilities.  
     
      
    170 Mr Sutton continued to work until about 12 months after the injury was suffered. At that time he reported that he could not stand the pain any more. The only skill he had was as a formwork carpenter and he has not worked since. He did not seek light duties believing that they were not available in the construction industry. The trial judge accepted that Mr Sutton’s belief that he would not be able to find other employment was reasonable. At that time he was 60 years of age. 
     
      
    171 Mr Sutton has been examined and treated by a number of specialist doctors. He saw a rehabilitation expert and has been treated with physiotherapy. He has also been treated by a pain management specialist and undertook a course of acupuncture. None of these treatments has been able to relieve his symptoms. About 2 years after the accident he developed pain in his left shoulder which continues to trouble him. It is likely that this pain has developed in response to his posture since the accident as he habitually rests his head on his left arm to relieve the neck pain. An MRI scan revealed Mr Sutton has suffered a disc prolapse at C2/3 level with some impingement on the nerves. There is also a musco-skeletal injury at the C1/2 level. The doctors have discussed whether a fusion of the spine may be necessary but Mr Sutton is very reluctant to have this procedure. 
     
      
    172 The trial judge found that Mr Sutton’s life has been significantly affected by his injury. He was a model worker. He loved his job and believed in working hard. Being unable to work has led to intense disappointment and some depression. Before he was injured Mr Sutton enjoyed playing golf, beach fishing, swimming, playing with his grandchildren and gardening. He is no longer able to do these activities. He is now confined to mowing the lawn with a self-propelled lawn mower, but even this causes him pain. Mr Sutton gave evidence that before his injury his relationship with his wife was extremely good. However, in recent years, although able to have an erection, the pain in his neck causes him to lose it and his sex life is significantly impeded. As a result the trial judge found that his overall relationship with his wife has suffered. 
     
      
    173 The trial judge accepted Mr Sutton’s evidence when he said that before his injury he intended to work until aged 68 years. The trial judge also accepted that, but for the injury, Mr Sutton would have been able to work up to his intended retirement date. 
     
      
    174 The trial judge assessed Mr Sutton’s non-economic loss at 38% of a most extreme case. His Honour understood the parties had agreed that Mr Sutton’s past economic loss was $194,103.60. 
     
      
    175 In relation to his future earning capacity, as I have indicated, his Honour accepted that Mr Sutton would have worked until age 68, being a further four years from the date of the trial. When calculating the appropriate award for cost earning capacity, he made a deduction of 15% for the ordinary vicissitudes of life. 
     
      
    176 The trial judge also allowed for regular visits to a pain management specialist and a general practitioner and allowed a sum against the possibility that Mr Sutton may require surgery on his spine. His Honour also allowed 1.5 hours per week for assistance in the garden. 
     
      
    177 Both the appellant and the second respondent submitted that the award of damages was excessive. It was submitted that his Honour erred in assessing the non-economic loss as 38% of a most extreme case. It was submitted that Mr Sutton’s reported symptoms, together with the fact that he continued to work for 12 months after the injury, did not justify this finding. It was submitted that although an award of between 25% and 30% was reasonable, an award of 38% was excessive for a man of the first respondent’s age. At the trial Mr Sutton argued that his Honour should assess his non-economic loss as 45% of a most extreme case. Although his Honour did not accept Mr Sutton’s submission, he found that, because of his injury, the first respondent’s life has been significantly affected and he now suffers constant pain. Although in my opinion assessment of Mr Sutton’s non-economic loss at 38% of a most extreme case was at the higher end of the available range, it was within his Honour’s discretion. I would not disturb that finding. 
     
      
    178 The parties apparently agreed the amount of Mr Sutton’s past economic loss. On appeal, it was submitted that his Honour had misunderstood the terms of that agreement and that, although an arithmetical calculation had been agreed, his Honour was still required to assess an appropriate figure having regard to the first respondent’s retained earning capacity and making allowances for vicissitudes. It was also submitted that his Honour failed to give adequate reasons for finding that the first respondent was totally incapacitated for work from the time he ceased his employment. A reading of the transcript confirms that the parties had agreed that, subject to any reduction required by the application of appropriate legal principles, the amount to be awarded for past economic loss was in the sum of $194,103.60. 
     
      
    179 His Honour did not expressly find that from the time Mr Sutton ceased work he was totally incapacitated but it is clear that the findings which he did make lead inevitably to this conclusion. His Honour found that, although Mr Sutton did not make any effort to seek other employment, his action in the circumstances was reasonable. This was not an unexpected finding. Mr Sutton was aged in excess of 60 years at the time of the accident, was skilled as a formwork carpenter, but in no other trade, and was now suffering constant pain. There was no likelihood of him being able to obtain other employment. 
     
      
    180 Although his Honour found that Mr Sutton had not sought other employment, Mr Sutton in fact gave evidence that he had been to employment agencies and been told that there were no jobs available for persons of his age for limited hours each day. This evidence was not challenged. 
     
      
    181 There is no fixed rule as to whether a reduction should be made in an award for past loss of earnings for vicissitudes. Each case depends upon its particular facts (Nestle Australia Ltd v McDougall (Court of Appeal, 24 June 1998, unreported) per Beazley JA at 9-10). The trial judge found that Mr Sutton would have worked through to the age of 68 if not for his injury. His Honour made this finding notwithstanding evidence of an injury to his left shoulder, and minor incidents which the first respondent had suffered during his working life. The injury to the left shoulder is manifested by the presence of some pain in and restriction of Mr Sutton’s left shoulder abduction. Whether the shoulder was previously injured or has deteriorated as a result of Mr Sutton’s injuries due to the accident is unknown. It is possible that if he had not suffered the accident and the shoulder had nevertheless deteriorated he may have had some difficulty with overhead work. In my opinion, findings which his Honour made were open and justified the conclusion that there should be no reduction for vicissitudes with respect to past loss of earnings. Mr Sutton’s previous medical incidents were minor and although on occasions he required time off work, his response to them confirms his capacity and his determination to continue his employment. 
     
      
    182 With respect to the claim for future economic loss it was submitted that his Honour erred by discounting the award by only 15% for vicissitudes. It was submitted that there was considerable uncertainty as to whether Mr Sutton could have worked through to age 68. It was suggested that having regard to his age and the suggestion of a previous injury to his shoulder, a 30% discount would have been appropriate. 
     
      
    183 Although aware of the issues raised by the appellant, his Honour found that Mr Sutton had a high level of fitness, considerable pride in his physical abilities and loved his work. Even if his capacity had been slightly restricted, there was nothing in the evidence which indicated that there was a risk, beyond the risks normally associated with his employment, that he would not have been able to work to his intended retirement age. In my opinion a discount of 15% for vicissitudes was within the range of his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    184 In my judgment each ground of attack upon the award of damages fails. 
     
      
       
      Section 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 
       
      
    185 Because, in my opinion, Dalma is liable for a portion of the damages, it is necessary to redetermine the appropriate award by reference to s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act. 
     
      
    186 Section 151Z is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a liability in some person other than the worker’s employer to pay damages in respect of the injury, the following provisions have effect:  
         
         
          
          (a) the worker may take proceedings both against that person to recover damages and against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act for payment of that compensation, but is not entitled to retain both damages and compensation, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if the worker recovers firstly compensation and secondly those damages, the worker is liable to repay out of those damages the amount of compensation which a person has paid in respect of the worker’s injury under this Act, and the worker is not entitled to any further compensation, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) if the worker firstly recovers those damages the worker is not entitled to recover compensation under this Act, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) if the worker has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid is entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay those damages (being an indemnity limited to the amount of those damages), 
          
         
         
          
          (e) if any payment is made under the indemnity and, at the time of the payment, the worker has not obtained judgment for damages against the person paying under the indemnity, the payment is, to the extent of its amount, a defence to proceedings by the worker against that person for damages, 
          
         
         
          
          (e1) if any payment is made under the indemnity and, at the time of the payment, the worker has obtained judgment for damages against the person paying under the indemnity (but judgment has not been satisfied), the payment, to the extent of its amount, satisfies the judgment, 
          
         
         
          
          (f) all questions relating to matters arising under this section are, in default of agreement, to be settled by action or, with the consent of the parties, by the Commission. 
          
         
         
        (2) If, in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act:  
         
         
          
          (a) the worker takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from a person other than the worker’s employer, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the worker also takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from that employer,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the following provisions have effect:  
         
         
          
          (c) the damages that may be recovered from the person by the worker in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a) are to be reduced by the amount by which the contribution which the person would (but for this Part) be entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise exceeds the amount of the contribution recoverable, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) the amount of the contribution that the person is entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise is to be determined as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with provisions of Division 3 as to the award of damages, 
          
         
         
          
          (e) if the worker does not take proceedings against that employer or does not accept satisfaction of the judgment against that employer, subsection (1) applies as if the worker had not been entitled to recover damages from that employer, except that:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) if the compensation paid by that employer exceeds the amount of the contribution that could be recovered from that employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise—the indemnity referred to in subsection (1) (d) is for the amount of the excess only, and 
             
            (ii) if the compensation paid by that employer does not exceed the amount of that contribution—subsection (1) (d) does not apply and the employer has, to the extent of the compensation so paid, a defence to an action for such a contribution. 
            
           
          
         
         
        (3) This section applies to proceedings taken independently of this Act by a person to whom compensation is payable under this Act in respect of the death of a worker as a result of an injury. 
         
         
        (4) If a worker is liable under subsection (1) (b) to repay any money out of damages recovered by the worker, the worker is not liable to repay the money out of any damages payable after the date of recovery by way of periodic or other payments for loss of future earnings or earning capacity or for future expenses. 
         
         
        (5) For the avoidance of doubt, this section applies and is taken always to have applied to the recovery of compensation or damages, whether or not the compensation or damages were paid under an award or judgment. For example, compensation or damages may be paid under an agreement.” 
        
       
      
    187 This section has been the subject of consideration in a number of decisions of this Court. It was criticised for its lack of clarity by Meagher JA in Leighton (at [29]).  
     
      
    188 The practical effect of the section was first considered by Allan J in Leonard v Smith (1992) 27 NSWLR 5 and applied in Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (1994) 35 NSWLR 82. The principles were recently affirmed by this Court in Libreri v Ironidol Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] NSWCA 198 per Mason P and Beazley JA at [19].The section operates so that an injured worker who successfully sues a third party, but who could also have recovered against their employer, will generally receive a reduced award of damages compared with the award they would be entitled to at common law. The employer’s contribution is confined to the amount provided by Part 5 of the Act rather than the amount for which it would have been liable at common law and the total damages will be reduced accordingly. 
     
      
    189 The section operates so that if the third party can recover 50% of the damages from the employer, the total damages awarded to an injured employee will be confined to 50% of the damages at common law plus 50% of the damages calculated in accordance with the statute. The purpose is to preclude an employee from recovering 100% of their common law entitlement to damages from a third party who, because of the statute, would only be able to recover a reduced amount (ie less than 50% of the common law entitlement) from the employer. 
     
      
    190 In the present case I have concluded that the damages determined by the trial judge were appropriate and the challenge to them must fail. However, I have also concluded that the trial judge should have found Erect Safe, Australand and Dalma liable in the proportions 60%, 25% and 15%. 
     
      
    191 The trial judge found that Mr Sutton’s injuries resulted in his being 38% of most extreme case. This is sufficient to support a finding that Mr Sutton was impaired so as to be entitled to recover damages under the Workers Compensation Act (s 151H). 
     
      
    192 Damages under the Act are confined to damages for past economic loss due to loss of earnings together with damages for future economic loss due to the deprivation or impairment of Mr Sutton’s earning capacity (s 151G(1)). 
     
      
    193 In order to calculate any award of past and future loss of earnings, the Act requires the court to disregard the amount by which the injured party’s net weekly earnings would, but for the injury, have exceeded the amount, that is, the maximum amount of weekly payments of compensation under s 35 of the Act (s 151I(1)). The maximum amount of weekly payments of compensation under s 35 for a future period is to be an amount which the court considers is likely to be the amount for that period, having regard to the operation of Div 6 of Pt 3 which provides for the indexation of amounts of benefit (s 151I(2)). The maximum weekly payment of compensation for any period of total or partial incapacity for work shall not in any case exceed $1,000 although that amount is indexed. As it happens the indexed amount exceeds the amount agreed between the parties at the trial and so the agreed amount applies to the relevant calculation. 
     
      
    194 In these circumstances it seems to me that the appropriate calculation of the award to which Mr Sutton is entitled is as I have provided below. However, before judgment is entered the parties should have the opportunity of considering whether my arithmetic is appropriate. Mr Sutton ceased work on 9 October 2003 and has not worked since. The award of damages for past economic loss was $194,103.60, which I am satisfied is an appropriate sum. 
     
      
    195 With respect to future economic loss, Mr Sutton was born on 25 January 1943 and at the time he ceased work was aged 60 years and 9 months. At the date of the trial he was aged 63 years and 10 months. However at the date of judgment he was aged 63 years and 11 months. Section 151IA of the Act provides that when awarding damages for future economic loss the court must disregard any earning capacity of the injured worker after age 65. The multiplier for one year and 1 month is 54.9 on the 5% tables. Accordingly future economic loss attracts a discount rate of 5%. Using the rate agreed by the parties of $1,227 per week with a multiplier of 54.9 the total is $67,362.30. From this amount it is appropriate to deduct 15% for vicissitudes which provides a total of $57,257.96. 
     
      
    196 Accordingly the award of damages under the Worker’ Compensation Act would be a total of $251,361.56. 
     
      
    197 The calculation required by s 151Z(2) of the Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Total damages under the Civil Liability Act 
         $663,369.77 
         
         
         Total damages under the Workers Compensation Act 
         $251,361.56 
         
         
         Applying a percentage contribution of Dalma of 15% of the Civil Liability Act damages 
         $99,505.47 
         
         
         15% of the Workers Compensation Act damages 
         $37,704.23 
         
         
         Deduct 15% of the Workers’ Compensation Act damages of $37,704.23 from Civil Liability Act damages gives a total of 
         $61,801.24 
         
         
         The amount of $61,801.24 must then be deducted from total damages under the Civil Liability Act 
         $601,568.53 
         
        
       
       
      Costs 
       
      
    198 This is a case in which the appellants have raised a number of discrete issues, each having succeeded on some issues, but not others. It is appropriate in the exercise of the court’s discretion for costs to be allocated by reference to the event in respect of the separate issues. Both Erect Safe and Australand have succeeded in their claim that their awards should be reduced pursuant to s 151Z of the Workers’ Compensation Act. Accordingly, they would be entitled to an award of costs to a limited extent. However, they have both failed in their challenge to the quantum of damages awarded by the trial judge. 
     
      
    199 Erect Safe has succeeded in its challenge to the trial judge’s finding that it was liable to Australand pursuant to clauses 11 and/or 12 of the subcontract. 
     
      
    200 In my opinion Erect Safe should have the benefit of an order for costs in its appeal against Australand but otherwise each party should pay their own costs of the appeal and cross-appeal. 
     
      
    201 I would not disturb the order for costs of the trial in favour of Mr Sutton. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    202 In these circumstances, short minutes should be prepared which will enable orders to be made in chambers. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Direct the parties to deliver to the Associate to Giles JA, within seven days, short minutes to give effect to these reasons. 
       
      2. Liberty to apply in the event of disagreement in the first instance by approaching the Associate to Giles JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an appeal against a conviction that was entered in the District Court following a trial of the appellant, Joseph Raso, by jury. The charge was that between 7 April and 22 August 2003 at Eastwood he was knowingly concerned in the cultivation of a prohibited drug, namely 60 cannabis plants. The appellant was arraigned before the jury panel together with a co-accused, Angus Menniti. Menniti pleaded guilty and was in due course called to give evidence in the appellant’s case. The appellant was represented by counsel at trial.  
     
      
    3 In April 2003 Northern Districts Developments Pty Limited, a company controlled by Menniti, purchased a house at 39 Norma Avenue Eastwood. The house stood on a battleaxe block and was invisible from the street. On 22 August 2003 police searched the house. The light and a radio were on but there was no one in the house. There were 60 cannabis plants growing in six of the rooms of the house. An extensive system had been set up to cultivate them, including an electricity meter bypass, lighting, ventilation and piping equipment, black plastic sheeting, pots and chemicals. There were an esky and documents bearing the name “P Deloris”.  
     
      
    4 Fingerprints which were in due course matched with those of Menniti were found on pedestal fans installed in each of the rooms in which the plants were being grown, on a light frame and in other parts of the house. Footprints demonstrated to be those of Menniti were found on black sheeting in one of the rooms in which plants were being grown. DNA with a profile matching that of Menniti was found on a slipper and on a soft drink bottle in the kitchen. 
     
      
    5 Fingerprints which matched those of the appellant were found on doors and door frames of rooms in which the plants were being grown, on a pedestal fan in a room which plants were grown, on a mug found in the kitchen and on a lampshade in a room in which plants were grown. The soft drink bottle which bore DNA matching that of Menniti also yielded DNA with a profile matching that of the appellant. 
     
      
    6 Fingerprints were also developed which matched neither the appellant nor Menniti. 
     
      
    7 On 9 September 2003 police saw the appellant at the house. He identified himself and said that he was a friend of Menniti and worked for him.  
     
      
    8 Police searched official records in New South Wales but could find no record of any person called Peter Deloris. 
     
      
    9 It was the Crown case that there was no such person as Peter Deloris and that Menniti and the appellant were both concerned in the cultivation. 
     
      
    10 The appellant did not give evidence but called Menniti. He said that his company had purchased the property in April 2003 with vacant possession. He was intending to redevelop it. He and the appellant had worked on the house, removing doors, windows and floorboards. There were no cannabis plants in the house. Some three weeks after the purchase, a man calling himself Deloris had asked to rent it, offering to pay two months’ rent in advance in cash. Menniti had agreed that Deloris could do so for three or four months. There was no written agreement. There was an occasion when he and the appellant went to the house to retrieve their tools. They found a good deal of equipment there, plastic in a roll and cut into squares, flower pots, things that looked like dog pellets, fans, boxes and big light globes. The side of the house was boarded up. Menniti thought that the occupant was trying to keep the house warm or perhaps maintain privacy. He thought that perhaps the occupant was getting a dog. He and the appellant had to touch the equipment in order to remove the tools and to search for a saw of Menniti’s, which was missing. Menniti’s boots were muddy and he removed them and his socks. In that way he may have put his foot on a slipper on which DNA was found. He said that soft drink bottles had been taken into the house while he and the appellant had been working there. The appellant also moved equipment as he searched for the missing saw. After this discovery Menniti continued to allow the occupant to stay there. He received rent from him on 1 July and 1 August 2003.  
     
      
    11 The Crown prosecutor cross-examined Menniti, suggesting that the story about Deloris was a lie and that there was no such person, and that he and the appellant had been involved in setting up the equipment to grow the cannabis plants. It was put that the appellant’s fingerprints and DNA were present because of his involvement in the cannabis plantation. Menniti denied these things. 
     
      
    12 As the case was left to the jury, there were two possibilities. Either the appellant, like Menniti, was knowingly involved in the cultivation or the cultivation was entirely the work of a tenant called Deloris. Given the control Menniti had as owner, no third possibility was open.  
     
      
    13 The trial judge directed the jury in appropriate terms about the elements of the offence charged and told them that the Crown had to prove each of them beyond reasonable doubt. No complaint was made on appeal about the directions.  
     
      
    14 The first ground of appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable. 
     
      
    15 The question raised by this ground is whether the court thinks on the whole of the evidence that it was open to the jury as judge of the facts to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53. This Court must assess the nature and quality of the evidence, its reliability and credibility. The Court must pay full regard to the fact that the jury was the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, a benefit that this Court lacks: MFA v The Queen. 
     
      
    16 I have read a transcript of the evidence. It seems to me that the evidence of the appellant’s fingerprints, which were not merely on the doors and door frames of the rooms where the plants were being grown but on items of equipment that appeared to have been set up for the express purpose of the cultivation, was capable, in combination with all the other evidence, of proving the case advanced by the Crown. Of course, the jury could not find the appellant guilty unless it rejected the explanation put forward through the evidence of Menniti. It could not be said, I think, that Menniti’s evidence contained internal inconsistencies. If accepted literally, it was capable of explaining how the fingerprints and DNA of the appellant came to be detectable at the scene. However, I do not regard as plausible Menniti’s explanation of how his and the appellant’s fingerprints and DNA came to be deposited or his explanation that having formed the suspicion (he called it a “95 percent inkling”) that the cultivation of cannabis was about to begin, he closed his eyes and continued to collect rent for the next two months. I have come to that view without seeing or hearing Menniti. That was an advantage the jury had, and I am not persuaded that they were obliged to give his evidence any credence at all. 
     
      
    17 A number of other complaints were made by the appellant in written submissions. They may be conveniently dealt with under this ground. The first relates to a question asked by the jury not long after they retired. In a note they said this - 
     
      
       
        
        How much doubt is reasonable doubt? Please define reasonable doubt.  
        
       
      
    18 His Honour drew the note to the attention of counsel and there was discussion about it. With the concurrence of counsel his Honour gave the jury this further direction -  
     
      
       
        
        Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your note. How much doubt is reasonable doubt. Ladies and gentleman, the first point I must say is that I cannot answer the question, I am not able to answer the question. All I can say to you is this, that you are the judges of the facts and you decide what is reasonable doubt. It is exactly a matter for you. Reasonable doubt, beyond reasonable doubt, the words are everyday words and the law is very clear that you, the judges of the facts, you alone decide what is a reasonable doubt. If you the judges decide, that you have a reasonable doubt then you have a reasonable doubt, it is strictly for you, and as I say it is not a question I can answer. You decide it. It is entirely a question for you. If you say I have a reasonable doubt, then you have a reasonable doubt. It is a matter in your province and no person can ask you, no person can ask you why you come to a decision because you are independent judges and to be truly independent it has to be your decision, with no input from on this particular matter. 
        
       
       
        
        I am sorry about that but that is it, it has to be you decide it. If you say yes I have a reasonable doubt, then you have got a reasonable doubt, if you say no I have not reasonable doubt then you have not. Nobody has the right to ask you any further. I cannot say why do you think this or why do you think that. You are the judges, as much as I am a judge, when you make your decision full stop, that is it, I accept your decision. 
        
       
      
    19 The complaint on appeal was that his Honour ought to have reminded the jury that he had told them in his opening remarks that even if they thought that the accused had committed the crime but were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they must find him not guilty. It was submitted that the jury must have had some doubt, otherwise they would not have asked the question. The submission went on to state: “I think any amount of doubt is reasonable”.  
     
      
    20 In my opinion the trial judge was correct in directing the jury that they were the judges of what was reasonable and that no further definition of the expression “beyond reasonable doubt” could be given: Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28. There was no call for any reminder of what his Honour had said to the jury in his opening remarks. The jury were entitled to a plain answer to their question and that is what the trial judge gave them. 
     
      
    21 I do not think that it can be correct to say that any amount of doubt is reasonable. If that were so, juries would not have to be directed in terms of the word “reasonable” at all. 
     
      
    22 The appellant may be correct in his assertion that the jury had some doubt. However, the verdict, given after full and proper directions of law, is seen to be based upon a finding of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    23 As I have said, the appellant did not give evidence. The jury were given a full direction according to Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 and no complaint is made about that direction. Even so, it was submitted that the appellant’s reason for not giving evidence was because of confusion and memory loss experienced following upon a motor vehicle accident. It was submitted that the jury should have been told about that so that they understood why he had decided not to give evidence. 
     
      
    24 Whatever may be said about the wisdom of any attempt to justify an accused person’s not giving evidence, the simple fact is that the jury were directed not to speculate why the appellant did not give evidence. They were told that there may be many reasons why an accused person might not give evidence. On the authority of the Azzopardi v The Queen itself, that direction was sufficient to ensure that the jury should not speculate or draw any inference adverse to the appellant from his not having given evidence. 
     
      
    25 A complaint was made that because of lack of resources, the case against the appellant was not dismissed in the Local Court, as it ought to have been. According to the submissions, the case was adjourned on a number of occasions because of the absence on stress leave of one of the arresting police officers. That does not seem to me to be a matter capable of throwing any doubt on the reliability of the jury verdict. 
     
      
    26 The next submission was that on the morning on the first day of the trial the charges were changed and Menniti pleaded guilty. Menniti was the appellant’s principal witness. He entered his plea in the presence of the jury panel, so the jury knew that he was guilty. That “could have been a major factor swaying the decision of the jury”. A new jury should have been empanelled.  
     
      
    27 The very tenor of Menniti’s evidence was that, in the limited way he was prepared to admit, constituted by his having closed his eyes to the cultivation he strongly suspected was being carried by others, he was guilty. Plainly Menniti could not have given the evidence the appellant wanted him to give without disclosing that he was guilty. His plea of guilty in the presence of the jury panel told the jury no more than his evidence did. As counsel for the appellant informed the trial judge, there was not likely to be any embarrassment from Menniti’s plea of guilty. In my opinion events took place in an eminently sensible and efficient way. No unfairness resulted and there was no need for the empanelment of a fresh jury.  
     
      
    28 The first ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    29 The second ground of appeal complained that the trial was held as if Menniti was on trial, rather than the appellant himself. 
     
      
    30 The complaint was that the Crown kept asking Menniti questions about himself, rather than about the appellant. Menniti should have been asked, it was submitted, more about the appellant’s work at Menniti’s premises and how he came to enter them. It looked as though Menniti, not the appellant, was on trial. He was hardly mentioned.  
     
      
    31 As I have observed, the case against the appellant was circumstantial. If the combination of circumstances was capable of proving the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt, the jury could convict only if they thought that there was no reasonable possibility that Menniti might be telling the truth. In that way there was a stark contrast between two bodies of evidence. The Crown was entitled to attack as incredible the explanation given by Menniti. If Menniti were believed, the jury had an exculpatory explanation of evidence which would otherwise point to the guilt of the appellant. The appellant and his counsel must have realised the importance of Menniti’s evidence and must have realised that it would come under strong attack at trial. What happened was entirely proper. 
     
      
    32 This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    33 The third ground of appeal was that important defence matters were not mentioned or only briefly only touched upon.  
     
      
    34 In written submissions it was asserted that it was not stressed at trial that the majority of the appellant’s fingerprints were on doors and door frames, a fact explained by the action of the appellant in looking at the doors and frames and window frames preparatory to removing them as part of the demolition of the property. It was submitted that the appellant’s fingerprints were on “less than one percent” of the equipment found. Those matters were not mentioned. It was submitted that it was not made clear to the jury that Menniti had called him inside the house to look at things that Menniti thought were strange. It was not made clear that the appellant had been to the property on a number of occasions.  
     
      
    35 In my opinion, defence counsel conducted the case for the appellant in an efficient manner, putting before the jury evidence which would, if believed, exculpate the appellant. In the circumstances the real question was whether Menniti was to be believed. Emphasis on one or other of the several pieces of evidence, and even the omission of the kind of detail pointed to on appeal, was not likely to weigh in the jury’s consideration of the central issue.  
     
      
    36 The next submission was that the appellant did not believe that his solicitor had his best interests at heart. He could have presented a better case. He did not use instructions which were given to him.  
     
      
    37 In the absence of particulars it is impossible to evaluate this submission. 
     
      
    38 Further complaints were made about the conduct of the appellant’s solicitor in the Local Court and at trial. I will say no more about the Local Court. At trial the question of the failure to explain why the appellant did not give evidence was again raised. It seems to me that solicitor and counsel took a tactical decision not to explain why the appellant was giving evidence. Nothing put before the Court on appeal suggests to me why that was not a proper decision that fell within the responsibilities of trial counsel. I have explained why no miscarriage of justice resulted from a failure to disclose the reason.  
     
      
    39 It was submitted that the appellant had handed his solicitor, which must, I think, mean counsel, a list of things to mention in his closing address. None of them was mentioned to the jury. One of them was the lack of fingerprints on the actual equipment as opposed to the doorframes, where the majority of prints were found. In fact there was no lack of fingerprints on the equipment used.Then it was submitted that the jury were not told that the fingerprints were explained by work the appellant had done at the house from time to time.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion none of these complaints is justified. Defence counsel adduced from Menniti such evidence as would exculpate the appellant if believed. A concentration on the kind of detail now brought forward by the appellant might, in the view of counsel, have detracted from the thrust of Menniti’s evidence, which was, first and last, that the appellant had been to the house in circumstances which he explained and had left fingerprints in circumstances which he explained but that the appellant knew nothing of the cultivation of the plants and was not concerned in it. 
     
      
    41 This ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    42 The final ground of appeal against conviction was that the appellant should never have been charged. It was submitted that he was eventually charged only because he went back to the premises to take up the floorboards on the day that the police called in and asked him to identify himself in September 2003. According to the appellant, it was then that the police checked for any criminal record of the appellant, found one and matched fingerprints then held on file with those recovered at the premises.  
     
      
    43 There is a difference between saying that but for those events the appellant would or might not have been charged and that he ought not to have been charged. In my opinion the evidence which the police had demonstrated that there was a case against the appellant and that they were justified in pursuing in.  
     
      
    44 This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    45 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.  
     
      
    46 On 6 March 2007, his Honour, having heard submissions and received evidence on sentence, decided to sentence the appellant to two years’ imprisonment but wholly to suspend that period under the provisions of s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. After his Honour had done so, the solicitor then appearing for the Crown informed his Honour that he was required to set a non-parole period. That information was incorrect. Section 12(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that Part 4 of the Act, which, inter alia, requires the fixing of non-parole periods, does not apply where a sentence is suspended under s12. Accepting the submission, his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 12 months. Later on, after the appellant had left the Court, his Honour was informed of the error. He revoked the portion of the order which had imposed a non-parole period. The result was a wholly suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment without a non-parole period. 
     
      
    47 Two complaints are made on appeal. The first relates to what is said to be the harshness of the sentence imposed. At first sight a suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment is unduly lenient for the criminality contemplated in at least setting up the equipment for such a substantial cultivation program. His Honour heard evidence of the effects upon the appellant of the motor vehicle accident that I have mentioned. His injuries were serious and he was in hospital between December 2003 and June 2004. He resulting orthopaedic disabilities were substantial and he needed a good deal of help to carry out the simplest of tasks in the maintenance of his personal life. I have mentioned also the confusion which the appellant said he felt from time to time.  
     
      
    48 His Honour accepted all those things. Notwithstanding the substantial criminal record of the appellant, including repeated convictions for drug offences, including the supply of drugs, his Honour decided to deal with him in the way I have outlined. In my opinion no complaint could properly be made that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    49 The second complaint related to his Honour’s amendment of the sentence in the manner I have described, removing the non-parole period. It was submitted that the amendment happened in the absence of the appellant and that if he had been present he might have been able to obtain a better result. 
     
      
    50 The amendment was necessary because the imposition of a non-parole period was, as I have explained, contrary to the requirements of s12(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The amendment was permitted by s43 of the same Act which in general terms gives the Court power to reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors. 
     
      
    51 The necessary correction was not a matter which entitled his Honour to exercise any judicial discretion. There could have been no different result if the appellant had been present. His Honour dealt with the matter appropriately in the absence of the appellant and took steps to ensure that the appellant was informed of the amended order. That was a sensible approach. Nothing but the expenditure of further time and expense would have been achieved by adjourning the matter and requiring the appellant to be present.  
     
      
    52 In my opinion neither of the criticisms levelled at the sentence is justified. 
     
      
    53 I propose the following orders - 
     
      
    1. The appeal against the conviction is dismissed. 
     
      
    2. The application for leave to appeal against the sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: This matter involves an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant by Sorby DCJ, the circumstances of which are sufficiently recounted by Barr J, with whose reasons I agree. There were, in substance, two complaints concerning the attention paid by the sentencing judge to evidence of the applicant’s psychological ill-health. That material was relevant in two ways. First, it had the potential to affect an assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability with respect to her involvement in the offences to which she pleaded guilty. Secondly, it provided a basis for an inference that, if she received a custodial sentence, the sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant than would be expected in the case of a reasonably healthy person. 
     
      
    2 At the hearing of the application, further evidence was tendered, by way of a report prepared by a psychiatrist, Dr John Roberts, as to the state of her health in prison. The Director objected to the tender, partly on the basis that he had not had an opportunity to obtain a further report from his own psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt. On the basis that the Director would be given an opportunity to obtain another report, the further psychiatric evidence was admitted. A supplementary report from Dr Allnutt was tendered, with a short submission, on 6 May 2008. A supplementary submission in response from the applicant was received on 8 May 2008. 
     
      
    3 The further material was not before the trial judge and is not relevant to a determination of error on his Honour’s part. As explained by Barr J, there was significant material before the sentencing judge capable of supporting an inference that the applicant would in fact suffer a deterioration in her psychological health from a significant period of imprisonment. His Honour failed to give proper consideration to that factor in his reasons, which was an omission warranting intervention by this Court. The further evidence was admissible in the exercise of this Court’s function in re-sentencing the applicant, error having been otherwise established. 
     
      
    4 Taking the further evidence into account for that purpose, a reduction in sentence is warranted, as demonstrated by Barr J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    5 BARR J: Amelia Du Randt has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence which was imposed in the District Court after she pleaded guilty to the charge that between about 28 December 2005 and 31 May 2006 at Sydney and elsewhere in New South Wales and in Queensland she dealt in money that was proceeds of crime and was reckless as to the fact that the money was proceeds of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more. The resulting sentence was of imprisonment for three years and three months, commencing on 28 September 2007 and expiring on 27 December 2010, incorporating a non-parole period of two years expiring on 28 September 2009. The charge was laid under s400.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Commonwealth). The maximum applicable sentence was imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was acquainted with a number of people who were concerned in the importation of amphetamine and the distribution of the proceeds of its sale. Some of them were Danielle Maio, Medhi Mohammadi, also known as Nick, Andrew Labanon, Lisa Dunn, Taro Zion Joy and Shane Cooper. During the period between June and December 2005 the applicant and Dunn spoke to one another on the telephone a number of times. On 8 June 2005 a certain United States Navy vessel arrived at Townsville and Labanon retrieved from it a quantity of amphetamine and handed it to Maio. Maio and Mohammadi were arrested in possession of it. The weight was 11 kilograms, 7.3 kilograms pure. On the same day the applicant and Dunn spoke on the telephone about a ship coming in. However, it was not asserted that the applicant was involved in the importation. 
     
      
    7 On 9 November 2005 Joy arrived in Sydney from overseas and on 13 November Cooper also arrived from overseas. The applicant later met Joy and Cooper. Joy left Australia on 12 December. On 27 December the applicant travelled by car from Sydney to the Gold Coast and collected from Cooper $100,000 in cash. She drove back to Sydney and delivered the money to a cash dealer. On 30 December Cooper left Australia.  
     
      
    8 In March 2006 Joy returned to Australia. He told the applicant that he was sick and needed help. She visited him at his hotel. Joy had $100,000 in cash. The applicant helped him to count it. Joy left the applicant’s presence and delivered the money to someone else. It was not suggested that the applicant was involved in dealing with that money. 
     
      
    9 Cooper arrived in Australia. On 18 March 2006 the applicant travelled once again by car to the Gold Coast. She collected a further sum of $100,000 in cash from Cooper. She brought it back to Sydney by car. Joy was away from Sydney at the time and the applicant stored it in a cupboard for a couple of days before meeting up with Joy and giving it all to him. Not long afterwards Joy left Australia once again.  
     
      
    10 Early in May Mohammadi, Labanon and Maio appeared in the Supreme Court of Queensland charged with drug offences. Maio pleaded guilty and the other two were convicted of offences concerning the importation. On 12 May the applicant told Joy about the verdicts. On 15 May the applicant spoke to Cooper and on 17 May flew to the Gold Coast and met him. On the following day the applicant and Dunn discussed the sentence just passed on Mohammadi. Cooper had about $50,000 in cash. He and the applicant counted it. The applicant took it and brought it back to Sydney by plane. On 21 May the applicant spoke to Dunn on the telephone, mentioning that she hoped that there were no more buggings and that she had to prepare herself for a knock at the door. On 31 May the applicant delivered the sum of $49,950 in cash to a currency dealer in Ryde.  
     
      
    11 On 24 October 2006 the applicant was arrested. She was interviewed by federal agents on that day and again on 21 November 2006. On 24 October 2006 the applicant said that she had carried money only once, $50,000, which she had taken to a brokerage place. She did not know where it had come from. She assumed that it was for Mohammadi’s legal costs. 
     
      
    12 On 21 November 2006 she admitted transporting cash on the three occasions I have set out. Explaining the carriage of money in December 2005, she said that she believed that the money she was collecting was for legal fees for Mohammadi. She assumed that it had come from the account of a brother of Mohammadi. It never crossed her mind to ask why Cooper, who was already on the Gold Coast, could not simply have paid the lawyers himself. She was chronically depressed and was being treated and was prepared to do any little task that made her feel worthy. She was happy to help her friend and did not question what she was asked to do because it gave her some motivation to get out of bed. She said that she was not suspicious about the money.  
     
      
    13 A substantial subjective case was put to the sentencing judge. His Honour summarised it thus - 
     
      
       
        
        The offender is thirty-three years old and was born in South Africa. Her parents separated when she was about four years of age. Later she went to a boarding school. She was sexually molested at the age of twelve and then she moved to Australia. At sixteen she was sexually assaulted by her then boyfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        In 1990 she returned to South Africa and undertook various ballet, drama and music courses. In 1997 to 2001, she lived in Japan where she worked as a singer. She continued to work as a singer in Australia as well. In early 2005, her band broke up and this distressed her and she found it difficult to find work as a singer. 
         
         
        She started seeing a psychiatrist, Dr Freed around this time who prescribed a medication regime. He considered that she suffered from “a mixed polar” disorder with symptoms of depression and hypomania. Dr Freed noted that the offender was responding to his treatment and medication as he continued to review her throughout 2006. Dr Freed saw Ms Du Randt again on 8 December 2006 noting that she had been arrested by the police on 24 October 2006 and charged with eight counts of money laundering. She informed Dr Freed that she had helped friends and that she believed the monies were needed for a friend and she thought that she had been wrongfully arrested. Dr Freed noted the normal previous sessions. Ms Du Randt had not given any indication that she was involved in any illegal activity. Dr Freed also noted that the offender had been taking a number of medications and also had taken a drug known as base which is an amphetamine. 
         
         
        The offender saw a psychiatrist, Dr John Roberts on 1 December 2006, the report dated 15 January 2007 who diagnosed a bipolar mood disorder. As to the offender’s drug use, Dr Roberts said at p8 of his report: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘As far as substance abuse is concerned, use of a substance in a person predisposed by family history and is as the case here, to the disturbances of mood, would be likely to endanger in them mood fluctuation to a greater degree and severity than would be the case if such a predisposition to mood disturbance did not exist. If a presumption is made of a mood disorder being present, the use of substances would compound mood fluctuation and exacerbate the underlying condition and compounding the tendency of that condition to procure ill considered acts arising as a result of poor judgment’. 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The applicant’s mother gave evidence which impressed his Honour. She said that the applicant had withdrawn from the family and that she, her mother, had no idea about her mental health. She said that the applicant was living with her and could continue to do so. She was confident that the applicant would continue her treatment. 
     
      
    15 His Honour observed that the applicant had not given evidence but referred to a passage in the pre-sentence report, prepared by a Probation and Parole officer, to the effect that the applicant felt highly embarrassed that she did not understand that she was taking part in money laundering. She expressed her regret, having contributed to an illegal activity. She explained that her actions were based upon her having trusted associates that she knew in common with a close friend and had relied on their advice that the activity was legal.  
     
      
    16 His Honour noted the early plea of guilty as well as her agreement, reported through her solicitor, to co-operate with the police should others be charged in relation to the offences under consideration. 
     
      
    17 His Honour reviewed the medical, particularly the psychiatric, evidence and noted that the applicant was under treatment at the time that she committed the offence. His Honour accepted that there were mental problems which were unresolved and that they moderated, if only to a limited extent, the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    18 His Honour noted that the applicant had no prior criminal history.  
     
      
    19 His Honour noted the submission of the applicant’s solicitor, based on the diagnosis of her treating psychiatrist, Dr Freed, that the applicant had a significant degree of impairment of her psychological functioning and control. His Honour did not accept that submission. 
     
      
    20 His Honour expressed himself dissatisfied that the mental condition from which the applicant was suffering had interfered with what she was doing when she carried the money.  
     
      
    21 His Honour declined an invitation not to impose a period of imprisonment but to make a psychiatric probation order under the provisions of s20BV Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth). 
     
      
    22 The grounds of appeal other than the sixth, which was not pressed, are as follows – 1. The sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    2. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s offending was objectively very serious and must be met with condign punishment. 
     
      
    3. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s mental condition from which she suffered did not interfere with what she was doing when she carried the cash. 
     
      
    4. The sentencing judge erred in finding that at the time of the offence and now, mental issues remain unresolved which moderated, if only to a limited extent the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    5. The learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the opinion of Dr Freed that the applicant had a “significant degree of impairment of her psychological and functioning and control”. 
     
      
       
        
         
         7. By reason of the applicant’s psychiatric/medical  
          
          condition subsequent to the imposition of sentence a miscarriage of justice has occurred (such that a different and lesser sentence should now be imposed upon the applicant). 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 Only grounds 1 and 7 were argued with any vigour. Mr Walsh, who appeared for the applicant, accepted that grounds 2, 3,4 and 5 did no more than particularise a number of errors contended for. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1. The sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. 
       
      
    24 Two substantial arguments were put forward under this ground. The first was that his Honour did not consider whether and how the applicant’s mental condition affected her appreciation of the gravity of the offence, as it was put, “whether she understood the gravity of the wrongdoing”. Mr Walsh referred the Court to a number of cases which explained the various ways in which the mental illness of an offender may sound in the sentence to be imposed. In Leach v R [2008] NSWCCA 73 Basten JA at [10] – [12] set forth with approval the principles explained by the members of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32] thus - 
     
      
    1. The condition may reduce the moral culpability of the offending conduct, as distinct from the offender’s legal responsibility. Where that is so, the condition affects the punishment that is just in all the circumstances; and denunciation is less likely to be a relevant sentencing objective.2. The condition may have a bearing on the kind of sentence that is imposed and the conditions in which it should be served.3. Whether general deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence or both.4. Whether specific deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration likewise depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms of the condition as exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of the sentence or both.5. The existence of the condition at the date of sentencing (or its foreseeable recurrence) may mean that a given sentence will weigh more heavily on the offender than it would on a person in normal health.6. Where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a significant adverse effect on the offender’s mental health, this will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    25 For these submissions Mr Walsh relied on what was said in R v Verdins at paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
     
      
    26 Reference was made to the judgment in this court in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 in which the Chief Justice, with whom Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreed, said at [21] – [25] - 
     
      
       
        
        21 The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See  
        R v Fahda 
         [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J;  
        R v Harb 
         [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also  
        R v Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ;  
        R v Tsiaras 
         [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294.  
         
         
        22 In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
         
         
        23 To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in  
        Henry 
        , supra, at [254]:  
         
         
          
          “… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.” 
          
         
         
        24 I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in  
        Lauritsen 
         at [48]:  
         
          
           
          “… mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.” 
          
         
         
        25 Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it:  
         
          
           
          “… specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.” (Tsiaras, supra, at 400) 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 Mr Walsh drew the court’s attention to parts of the report of Dr Freed, which was before the sentencing judge. The first was bipolar disorder mixed with psychotic features. She had manic-like symptoms since at least 1999 and significant depressive symptomatology following her sister’s rape and assault in September 2005. She had the complication of mixed intertwining between depressed and manic phases as well as psychotic features, namely auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation. She thought that flies settled on her because she was garbage. She thought that her family whispered about her. Dr Freed drew attention to the family history of mental illness, including bipolar disorder. 
     
      
    28 The second condition was post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from a number of incidents in the family when she was very young, including cruelty at the hands of a step-mother, molestation by a stranger at the age of six, beatings at boarding school, molestation by a neighbour at the age of 12, rape at the age of 16, mental abuse by a friend at the age of 18 and the deaths of a number of people close to her, including members of her family. It was the assault and rape of her sister by four men in 2005 which resulted in her referral to Dr Freed for treatment.  
     
      
    29 Dr Freed said that the applicant had associated with these conditions bizarre psychotic dreams which reflected abandonment and neglect in the past. There were dreams of abortion and of eating human internal organs.  
     
      
    30 Dr Freed diagnosed borderline personality disorder, characterised by an identity crisis. She consulted people who inflicted pain upon her. She abused drugs. She had symptoms of efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, impulsivity in drug and alcohol abuse and body piercing, suicidal thoughts, a marked reactivity of mood, feelings of emptiness, inappropriate anger and severe dissociative symptoms.  
     
      
    31 Dr Freed also noted the applicant’s periodic drug and alcohol abuse. He concluded as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        In this morass of multiple pathologies with significant mood changes, both in the depressed and elated phases, hallucinatory voices, and thought disorder (with an impaired capacity to test the logic of situations), she has had a significant loss of insight and judgment. Her disabilities arise out of mental illness of which the core element is Bipolar Disorder with psychosis, and the secondary elements being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from multiple traumas, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Periodic Drug and Alcohol Abuse.  
        
       
      
    32 Dr Freed gave evidence before the sentencing judge. In order to illustrate the applicant’s likely lack of judgmental ability he gave a hypothesis of a person to whom a stranger offers a Rolex watch for fifty dollars. Whereas most people would conclude either that the watch was not a genuine Rolex or that, if it was, it had been stolen, the applicant might have jumped to the conclusion that the stranger and the watch were genuine and the transaction “pleasing”. 
     
      
    33 In his report Dr Roberts noted Dr Freed’s diagnosis and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        If a presumption is made of a mood disorder being present, the use of substances would compound mood fluctuations and exacerbate the underlying condition compounding tendency of that condition to produce ill considered acts, arising as a result of poor judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the charges for which Ms Du Randt is facing Court, assuming her statements to me are true and accurate, namely that she believed that the monies handled by her were monies that were in essence legitimate and designed for the payment of legal expenses, and which she stated had been told to her, as being money emanating from Iran and because of this monies origin had to be dealt with in this manner, would be explanations that would be on grounds of probability more readily accepted by a person with a diagnosed mental illness, than a person in full possession of their critical faculties. 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Walsh drew the attention of the Court to passages in the remarks on sentence. Having referred to the Crown and defence cases on the need for adequate punishment, objective seriousness, general and subjective or personal deterrence, including the evidence of the mental health of the applicant, his Honour continued -  
     
      
       
        
        …I have carefully read all the reports and listened to the evidence of Dr Freed. I am not convinced on reading the agreed facts, including the telephone taps that the mental condition from which the offender suffered interfered with what she was doing when she carried the cash. 
        
       
       
        
        She was under treatment during the time she committed the offences and according to Dr Freed, responded positively to that treatment. However, I do accept that she had, at the time of the offence and now, mental issues unresolved which moderates, if only to a limited extent, the need for general deterrence in offences such as this. 
        
       
      
    35 It was submitted on appeal that his Honour failed to take into account the inability of the applicant truly to understand the nature of what she was doing as affecting the need for general and personal deterrence. 
     
      
    36 The case for the Crown and for the defence was put before his Honour at great length and in great detail. The Statement of Facts ran for 27 pages and the two records of interview for 19 and 47 pages respectively. Dr Freed’s monumental statement ran for 38 pages. Dr Roberts’ was more concise at nine pages. The Crown’s written submissions on sentence ran for 22 pages and the supplementary submissions for three pages. The defence written submissions on sentence ran for 27 pages. His Honour is a busy sentencing judge and I suspect that the perceived need to husband resources led him to deal more succinctly with the subject matter than did the parties. 37 I have extracted his Honour’s resume of the evidence relied on and the conclusion to which his Honour came. Having read the reports of Dr Freed and Dr Roberts and having heard the evidence of Dr Freed, his Honour could scarcely have failed to understand that it was an important part of the defence case that the mental condition from which she was suffering robbed the applicant of the ability fully to appreciate the nature of what she was doing. I would not take his Honour’s not mentioning in terms the evidence relied on or the submissions made in reliance on it as leading to the conclusion that his Honour failed to consider that submission or that evidence. In imposing sentence his Honour did make a modest allowance for the mental condition of the applicant, and I think that must have been on account of the arguments then and now put. I do not think that his Honour failed to appreciate the case that was being put or failed to consider the submissions made on this topic.38 The second substantial argument put forward under this ground was that his Honour failed to consider the effect on the service of her sentence of the applicant’s state of health. Mr Walsh relied on the fifth and sixth principles referred to in Vergins. See also the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Israil at [26]. 
     
      
    39 A substantial case for an amelioration of the sentence on this basis was put before the sentencing judge, relying, inter alia, upon a submission that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. 
     
      
    40 In the remarks on sentence his Honour made a number of references to the significance for the sentence of the applicant’s mental illness. Having reviewed the evidence about mental illness his Honour went on to consider the matters to which, by s16A Crimes Act, the Court should have regard. Subs (2)(k) introduces the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence. It was expressly in relation to that paragraph that his Honour rehearsed the submissions about the applicant’s mental illness and expressed the conclusion which I have set out above. 
     
      
    41 Para (m) of the same subsection introduces the need to have regard to the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person to be sentenced. His Honour’s remarks make no reference to that paragraph. 
     
      
    42 His Honour came back to consider the evidence of Dr Freed a second time, but only in the context of s17A(1), which provides that a court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, having considered all other available sentences, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances. It was there that his Honour considered the recommendation of Dr Freed that the applicant be not sentenced to imprisonment at all, but have the benefit of a psychiatric probation order. That was a recommendation and a submission that his Honour rejected, as I think he was entitled to do, but it does illustrate the limited context in which his Honour took into account the mental illness of the applicant. 
     
      
    43 Notwithstanding that a few sentences later his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        In imposing a sentence, I have to take into account all relevant factors under s16A. I have carefully weighed up the subjective factors in the offenders favour and including her mental health. 
        
       
       
      I think that his Honour overlooked consideration of the question whether the applicant’s sentence should be ameliorated because it would be more onerous upon her because of her mental condition. If his Honour had taken that factor into account I would have expected some reference, however brief, to have been made to the distinctly different manner in which the mental illness of the applicant might affect the sentence. 
       
      
    44 In my opinion this second attack on the sentence has been made good. In my opinion the several conditions from which the applicant was suffering at the time of sentence were such as to entitle her to consideration and amelioration of her sentence. 
     
      
    45 Under the seventh ground of appeal Mr Walsh put forward further medical evidence of the medical condition of the applicant. There was some debate as to the basis upon which the Court ought to receive the material. However, I would receive the material for the purpose of re-sentencing, as the Court ordinarily does.  
     
      
    46 Since the commencement of her sentence the applicant has been seen frequently by professionals, weekly by a psychologist and monthly by a psychiatrist. She has been treated and medicine has been prescribed and the psychologist has given her helpful advice. Notwithstanding these matters, Mrs Prinsloo, the applicant’s mother, reported that the applicant had put on weight and particularly that her lower legs were swollen and blotchy. 
     
      
    47 Dr Roberts was called to see the applicant on 2 December 2007 and wrote a report on 11 December 2007. He confirmed the matters complained of by Mrs Prinsloo and confirmed that because of the change in the applicant’s appearance consequent upon her gain of very substantial weight he failed at first to recognise her. He described the condition of the lower legs as pitting oedema. He considered that this condition to be a side effect of the drugs that the applicant was taking. Dr Roberts confirmed a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features and commented that her condition was complex and because of drug sensitivity treatment was difficult. Treatment had produced significant side effects which were severe, but not of the most severe degree. Doctor Roberts wondered whether the applicant could be adequately treated in custody, not because of any asserted lack or skill of those having the care of her but because of a lack of resources, psychiatrists within the Prison Psychiatric Service being able to see inmates less frequently than would be the case in a private psychiatric clinic. 
     
      
    48 Dr Roberts saw the applicant again on 24 March 2008 and wrote a report dated the following day. He confirmed that the applicant presented features of depression with psychosis and had a history of symptomatology suggesting bipolar disorder. She presented in a manner suggestive of significant deterioration, marked by persistent psychosis, flat, unresponsive affect and depressed mood. He thought that her physical health had deteriorated markedly. She was morbidly obese and had pitting oedema up to the knees of unknown origin. There were certain symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease. He continued -  
     
      
       
        
        It is my view on psychiatric grounds that because of Ms Du Randt’s pre-incarceration history of unwellness that the imprisonment is disproportionately severe for her to tolerate and constitutes to her a level of punishment which by virtue of the psychiatric condition present is a level of punishment which by virtue of the psychiatric condition present is a level of punishment that is far more difficult for her to tolerate than would be the case if she was not mentally ill. 
        
       
      
    49 Dr Roberts considered that urgent measures were needed to control weight gain and to clarify the causation of oedema, nocturia and breathlessness on exertion. Again he suggested that it would be less difficult for appropriate investigations and more intensive management to be undertaken outside the prison system.  
     
      
    50 The Crown responded by having the applicant see Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist, who saw her on 31 March and 28 April 2008. Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion in a report on 7 April 2008 that the applicant had bipolar affective disorder with episodes of psychosis. Her predominant mood state was depressor though she had brief periods of hypomania and mania. On occasions she had experienced auditory hallucinations, possibly persecutory delusions and disturbance of thought processes in the form of thought disorder or a flight of ideas. Dr Allnutt, too, considered that the applicant’s illness was complicated by difficulties in maintaining her medication due to side effects. He thought, however, that she had improved during the last two months with changes in medication. He thought that she appeared to be coping with the prison environment. He noted that she was continuing to receive psychiatric treatment.  
     
      
    51 Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the treatment being offered was appropriate. He thought that there had been fluctuation in her mood since her incarceration, with a depressive episode with psychotic features. However, she had responded to some degree to the medication. He thought that she remained at risk of deterioration in her mental state due to further difficulties in her treatment or to the natural fluctuations of her mental illness. For that reason she would require ongoing psychiatric monitoring with access to medical intervention when required.  
     
      
    52 Dr Allnutt had been asked to comment upon the suggestion that the applicant’s condition might not be able to be adequately managed in custody. He said that while prisons are not ideal places to treat mental illness, inmates with severe mental illness, such as the one suffered by the applicant, had access to Long Bay Hospital and, for women, to B Ward East at Long Bay Hospital. He went on to describe the staffing of those facilities and concluded that overall that he did not believe that the applicant’s case was of a nature or severity that deviated significantly from the kinds of illnesses and medical difficulties that many inmates had within the prison system. He believed that her psychiatric condition could be adequately managed in custody. If her condition became unmanageable transfer to a civil psychiatric or medical hospital could be arranged under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007.  
     
      
    53 Dr Allnutt provided a further report on 28 April 2008. He noted reports of the applicant’s recent history and complaints including depression, oedema, amenorrhoea and discussed the variations in the drugs which were being prescribed for her. Dr Allnutt noted that on 28 March 2008 there was a significant improvement in the mood, that she was less sedated since a change of drugs and that there was an improvement in her physical condition. She described hearing voices she said sounded like her mother’s but she was aware they were own thoughts. There were no command hallucinations or delusions.  
     
      
    54 Dr Allnutt saw no reason to alter the opinion expressed in his earlier report. He thought that the notes reflected a recent improvement following changes in her medication. He observed that she remained vulnerable to further fluctuations in her mental state.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion the evidence shows that the effect on the applicant of the various illnesses from which she suffers will be significant as she serves her sentence, and on that account her sentence ought to be mitigated. Accordingly, I have come to the view that a lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour is warranted: s6 (3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    56 Because of the conclusion I have reached, it is unnecessary to consider grounds 2,3,4 or 5. 
     
      
    57 I note the large amount of money – just short of $250,000 – with which the applicant was concerned and the considerable period of time over which the three incidents comprising the offence took place. I note that the role of the applicant was that of a courier and not of someone with a greater control and a more intimate knowledge of what was happening. I note that the mental illness from which the applicant was suffering at the time of the offence had some effect upon her ability fully to appreciate what she was being asked to do, though that effect was not great, especially in view of the fact that she was being treated at the time. I also note the content of the things that she said to Dunn on the telephone, which showed that she knew that she was doing wrong, though she may not have known exactly how, and throws doubt upon her later protestation of having been wrongly charged. I note the early plea of guilty and the prior good character of the applicant. I note some evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    58 I propose that the applicant be granted leave to appeal, that the sentence appealed from be quashed and that there be substituted a sentence of imprisonment of two years and six months. The sentence is to be taken to have commenced on 28 September 2007 and will expire on 27 March 2010. I would direct that the applicant be released on 27 March 2009 on a Recognisance Release Order self in the sum of $100.  
     
      
    59 BUDDIN J: I agree with Barr J.

   Mr P. Stanley for the NSW DPPMr J. Edmunds for the offender  
   
   
    
    
    
   
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
    
    
     
      
        
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. I will deal firstly with the breach of the bond. Lee Cruse has been called up before me because he has breached a good behaviour bond. The good behaviour bond was imposed on 8 March 2007 by his Honour Judge McLaughlin SC. It was imposed when Mr Cruse appealed from a magistrate who had sentenced him to imprisonment for two months. He was sentenced to imprisonment because he had pleaded guilty to one common assault and one malicious damage.  
       
       
      2. Briefly, the offences occurred on 14 October 2006, when Mr Cruse was drunk and at The Australasian Hotel in Eden. Whilst he was drunk he had been excluded from the hotel, he threw items at the hotel and used his fists to shatter the glass in doors and windows. In addition he threatened to kill the manager and threw punches at him, hitting him twice to the side of the neck.  
       
       
      3. Judge McLaughlin allowed his appeal and after giving him what is known as the “Parker 
      ” 
       direction sentenced Mr Cruse to ten months imprisonment instead of two months imprisonment. The ten months imprisonment was for each offence. However, his Honour suspended the sentence under section 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . The suspension was on condition that Mr Cruse enter into a good behaviour bond with certain conditions. One of them of course was to be of good behaviour.  
       
       
      4. Mr Cruse is before me because he has not been of good behaviour. On 1 July 2007 he committed a number of offences, including one of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence. He broke into his father-in-law’s premises and assaulted his father-in-law by biting him seriously on the leg. In addition he did damage to a car, intimidated a woman (his partner Linda) and assaulted his brother-in-law.  
       
       
      5. In those circumstances he comes before me in these proceedings for breach of the good behaviour bond. The relevant section that I need to apply is section 98 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      . Subsection (3) of that section provides that I must revoke the bond unless I am satisfied that Mr Cruse’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial or that there are good reasons for excusing his failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.  
       
       
      6. Mr Edmonds, who appears for Mr Cruse, does not make any submission that there is a basis for me not to revoke the bond. That is a realistic, appropriate and in my respectful view a correct submission. There is no way that the breach can be described as trivial and I can see no good reason for excusing his failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.  
       
       
      7. Accordingly I am obliged to revoke the bond under section 98(3) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      . The consequences of such a revocation are dealt with in section 99. By reason of section 99 (1)(c) the order made by his Honour Judge McLaughlin suspending the execution of the sentence ceases to have effect and certain other provisions of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        
      apply.  
       
       
      8. Mr Cruse was arrested on 1 July 2007, the day that he committed the offences which amounted to the breach of the bond. He has been in custody since then. Mr Edmonds submitted that the execution of the sentences revived by the revocation of the bond should date from that day and I agree. If they date from that day, the two ten month sentences will expire tomorrow 31 May 2008. I do not propose to fix a non-parole period in respect of those sentences because of their imminent expiry. 
       
       
      9. Accordingly the orders I make in this matter are as follows. Under section 98(3) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       I revoke the good behaviour bond imposed by Judge McLaughlin on 8 March 2007. Pursuant to section 99(1)(c) I sentence Mr Cruse in respect of each of the two offences to ten months imprisonment to date from 1 July 2007 and to expire on 31 May 2008. In accordance with section 45 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        
      I decline to set a non-parole period for these sentences. It is appropriate not to set a non-parole period for two reasons. One is because of the antecedent character of Mr Cruse (he has a long history of offending), this being a relatively short sentence. The other reason is because I am about to sentence him in respect of the crime he committed on 1 July 2007 and the non-parole period in respect of that sentence will subsume any parole which I would allow him for this sentence. 
       
      Are there any other formal orders I need to make in respect of the breach proceedings? 
       
       
      STANLEY: There’s not your Honour but my calculations ten months from 1 July would be to 30 April. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes.  
       
       
      STANLEY: But I’ll stand to be corrected. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. Yes, that sounds right Mr Edmonds. 
       
       
      10. The sentence will commence on 1 July 2007 and expire on 30 April 2008.  
       
       
      11. Mr Cruse I have now sentenced you for your very bad behaviour at the pub down at The Australasian in Eden. The magistrate gave you two months, Judge McLaughlin gave you ten months and suspended it. Because you have breached the bond, that ten months I have now sentenced you for. I have commenced the sentence on 1 July when you were arrested at your father-in-law’s place. The ten months expired a month ago on 30 April so you have served that sentence. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: They were two sentences, each of ten months and running at the same time. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: They have both expired.  
       
      I am now going to sentence you for the crimes you committed at your father-in-law’s place, do you understand? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: (No verbal reply) 
       
      12. I have to sentence Lee Anthony Cruse for an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence. The offence was committed on 1 July 2007. The offence is against s 112(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . Such an offence carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. In addition, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that offence. 
       
       
      13. Exhibit A contains a brief summary of what happened. Mr Cruse and his de facto wife, Linda Cunning, had at that stage a three-year old son. He is obviously now four. Linda Cunning also had an older daughter from a previous relationship. They dropped off the children at her parents’ place on the evening of 30 June 2007. They went out drinking.  
       
       
      14. Whilst they were drinking at a public place the two began to argue. Mr Cruse chased Ms Cunning outside and whilst he was pursuing her, he punched his fist through the front windscreen of a car. That action amounted to malicious damage of the car and he was charged with that. After he did that, Linda Cunning got back inside the hotel where they were drinking. Mr Cruse had been chasing her and the staff ensured that she was locked up. For his behaviour towards her, he was charged with intimidation.  
       
       
      15. Mr Cruse left the hotel and went back to his parents-in-law’s place to collect his son. The security guard alerted Mr Cunning senior who was known to him. When Mr Cruse got back to the Cunnings’ house, he broke open the closed back door. He came in calling out “ 
      I’m going to take my son 
      .” He was angry, agitated and drunk. Mr Ron Cunning, his father-in-law tried to calm him down but he went and took his son from the bedroom. Mr Cunning tried to settle him down but Mr Cruse headed towards the back door with his son in his arms. He grabbed a number of knives from a board on the wall next to the back door.  
       
       
      16. Mr Ron Cunning’s son James came to assist his father. He grabbed Mr Cruse’s wrist and made him drop the knives. The three of them fell to the floor. They were struggling on the floor and Mr Cruse bit Mr Ron Cunning on his leg above the right knee. He clamped his teeth in the flesh for what Mr Ron Cunning describes as a couple of minutes. He settled down but when he got up again, he got angry and started swinging punches several of which hit Mr James Cunning.  
       
       
      17. Those punches amounted to a third offence that he was charged with of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to James Cunning. He picked up a knife again but by this time the police arrived and subdued him and arrested him and charged him. The serious indictable offence which he committed in breaking and entering was the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr Ron Cunning. I have seen photographs of the broken back door lock and of the very ugly looking wound on Mr Ron Cunning’s leg. 
       
       
      18. It is important to appreciate that Mr Cruse has a long criminal record. He was born on 23 November 1976 so he is now thirty-one. He turned eighteen on 23 November 1994. Since then he has convictions for breaking and entering and stealing, and breaching orders such as Community Service Orders. His first time in prison was ten years ago. Other offences include assaults and entering enclosed lands and stalking and intimidating and maliciously destroying or damaging property. He has served numerous short periods of imprisonment for these offences. He has also been convicted of larceny and assaulting police. He has numerous driving offences. He has had the benefit of bonds under s 12 suspending the sentences imposed for various offences. He has, as I have said, a bad criminal record.  
       
       
      19. I should refer to some personal information about him. There was a pre-sentence report dated 21 January 2008. It noted that he had been subject to supervision before. Generally, his response has been inadequate. He left school at fourteen and has had several short-term labouring positions. He started using alcohol and illegal drugs when he was at school. He has used all sorts of drugs, the most recent one that he was using was methylamphetamine. He was drunk at the time that he committed this offence. He had also taken some methylamphetamine. 
       
       
      20. In summary, the report described him as a man who appears to have a serious problem with substance abuse and corresponding violent behaviour. He was considered unlikely to benefit from supervision by the Service and is unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for periodic detention. 
       
       
      21. He was seen by an experienced forensic psychologist, Anna Robilliard, who prepared a report dated 22 October 2007. She reports past efforts at rehabilitation. He has been to several centres. One of them he stayed at for some months and then remained sober for nine months. He reported to her that he deeply regretted his behaviour. He realised he had terrified his son and acknowledged that he had been through the same with his own father. Ms Robilliard assessed him as being at extreme risk for continuing legal problems should his current substance abuse remain unchanged. She thought his commitment to rehabilitation was conditional. She was of the opinion that he needs to commit himself to a long-term intensive substance rehabilitation programme. It should be at least twelve months. He should go directly from custody to such a programme. 
       
       
      22. I heard evidence from Mr Cruse himself and from his grandfather, well known and well respected Aboriginal elder, Oswald Cruse. Mr Cruse senior is the offender’s mother’s father. He is a pastor and lives in Eden. He gave an account of a particular traumatic event in his grandson’s life when his grandson, at a young age, witnessed the violent and horrific death of a mate who was run over by a truck. He was of the view that his grandson needed prolonged and sustained rehabilitation with special counselling. He agreed with Ms Robilliard’s views. There are several programmes that Mr Cruse senior has been involved with which would be suitable. He said how his grandson had behaved very well on one such programme which he had undertaken in the past. 
       
       
      23. When Mr Cruse himself gave evidence, he acknowledged his addiction to alcohol and drugs and the offending behaviour that occurs when he is under their influence. His de facto wife Linda has several problems. He was diagnosed with depression and treated for it by medication in custody but the side effects of the medication were uncomfortable and he came off that medication but is now on methadone. He stopped using methadone a short time ago. He had a good relationship with his father-in-law and brother-in-law until these things happened. He said he could never forgive himself. His son is now aged four and is named Matari Walkan. He is in regular contact with his son whilst in prison, that is by telephone. He wants to undertake a rehabilitation course when he is released. He acknowledges that his relationship with his in-laws is probably permanently damaged. He has remained drug-free in custody and is on protection at Parklea. He had been on protection previously at Goulburn. He acknowledged in cross-examination to Mr Stanley who appears for the prosecution, that he had promised to courts on previous occasions that he would rehabilitate himself and not re-offend, but he had not kept to his promises. He acknowledged that, as Mr Stanley put to him, he is prepared to talk the talk but not walk the walk. He could not distinguish this particular occasion from others.  
       
       
      24. I have read two references from Pastor Oswald Cruse as well about his grandson and taken those into account. He describes his grandson when sober and at home as “ 
      a kind and gentle father who has taken up painting, gardening and the first to assist in voluntary work projects on a youth camp. 
      ” 
       
       
      25. As I said, this offence carries a standard non-parole period. A preliminary question is whether that standard non-parole period applies to this case. It applies according to s 54B of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      unless I determine that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is shorter than the standard non-parole period. The standard non-parole period is intended for a middle range case. So the question I must ask myself is whether there are any reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period in this case. I do find reasons, there are two.  
       
       
      26. The first is that Mr Cruse has pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. The second is that I do not regard this offence as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That is because, as bad as it was, the offence he committed when he broke in was at the bottom of the range in seriousness of serious indictable offences that could be committed whilst he was inside. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, like larceny, carries a maximum of five years’ imprisonment. 
       
       
      27. Having said that, this offence was a shocking offence. There are a number of aggravating features of the offence. One is that the offending behaviour involved the use or threatened use of a weapon when he brandished the knives. A second is that it was committed in the presence of his own then three-year old son. A third is that it was committed at the Cunnings’ home. A fourth is that it was committed whilst he was on a good behaviour bond. In other words he had been released by the courts instead of being sent to prison, as the magistrate had done so, and back into the community on condition that he behaved himself. He breached that condition. 
       
       
      28. I have taken into account as well the victim impact statement which was prepared by Mr Ron Cunning. He describes the wound from the bite as a permanent scar which is a daily reminder of an attack that he believed would see himself or his son dead. This must have been a shocking experience. He said that he is constantly worried for the safety of his family. He no longer gets a good night’s sleep. As he said, this behaviour has robbed him and his family of peace of mind and feeling safe. His wife has had to leave work. I take into account those matters insofar as they affect Mr Ron Cunning. I do not regard that as amounting to substantial emotional harm although it is clearly significant.  
       
       
      29. In addition, he has a serious criminal record which, the parties agree, I should take into account, in the sense referred to by the High Court in the  
      Queen v Veen (No. 2) 
      . 
       There is clearly an increased need for me to take into account the deterrence that Mr Cruse needs from committing further offences. It increases the significance of personal deterrence. 
       
       
      30. I take into account the mitigating factors which Mr Edmonds has drawn my attention to, namely the evidence which his client gave, the remorse which he felt and the plea of guilty. I have taken into account the statistics which I have been referred to. 
       
       
      31. Mr Cruse’s prospects of rehabilitation are not good. I do hope that he commits himself to rehabilitation but his past record does not enable me to find that his prospects are good. He is also at a high risk of re-offending if he returns to substance abuse. I accept Mr Stanley’s submission that general and specific deterrence are important. 
       
       
      32. I would regard an appropriate overall sentence for this offence as seven years. That is because although he is not in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the reasons that I have given, the aggravating factors which accompany it require a significantly deterrent sentence. A seven-year sentence would attract a non-parole period in the region of five years. Because Mr Cruse has pleaded guilty at an early opportunity, I am going to allow him the maximum of twenty-five per cent as a discount. Accordingly, I would regard an appropriate sentence to be in the region of five years with a non-parole period of just under four years. I here take into account that the offence he actually committed whilst inside was at the lower end of the range and I take into account his expressed remorse and I propose to fix an overall sentence for this crime of four years and eight months. I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months. The sentence is to date from 1 January 2008. I do not find that there are any special circumstances which will warrant me altering the relationship between the non-parole period and the parole period. The relationship in this sentence is close enough to three to one. I have taken into account in fixing this sentence, which is a further factor for it being increased, the offences on the Form 1. Would you stand up Mr Cruse? 
       
       
      33. For the offence of aggravated break, enter and commit assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and taking into account the three offences on the Form 1, I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 1 January 2008 and to expire on 30 June 2011. The balance of the term will be one year and two months to commence on 1 July 2011 and to expire on 31 August 2012. 
       
      Have a seat Mr Cruse. Are there any other orders which I need to make? 
       
       
      STANLEY: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, because it’s not one that I fix parole in? 
       
       
      STANLEY: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now - fix the sentence. I don’t think there are any other orders are there? 
       
       
      STANLEY: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay. I’ll now adjourn.  
       
       
       oOo
