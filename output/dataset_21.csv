     REGINA v ANDREW JAMES HICKEY 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: The Crown has appealed from the sentences imposed by Woods DCJ on the prisoner on 29 August this year. 
     
      
    2 The prisoner pleaded guilty on 1 July to four counts. Count 1 was escape from lawful custody on 25 November 2002 and in that connection there was a Form 1 offence of assault on police. Count 2 was an offence of break, enter and steal on 3 December 2001. There was also a Form 1 in connection with that offence of an attempted break, enter and steal on 23 May 2002. Count 3 was a break, enter and steal on 14 December 2001, and Count 4 was a further break, enter and steal on 12 May 2002. 
     
      
    3 His Honour sentenced the prisoner to a fixed term of three months for the escape from lawful custody to commence on 25 November 2002. That was the day that the prisoner was taken into custody and he has been in custody ever since. There is no challenge to that sentence. 
     
      
    4 For Counts 2 and 3 he imposed concurrent terms of two years imprisonment to commence on 24 February 2003, at the expiration of the fixed term on Count 1, with a non-parole period of nine months to expire on 24 November 2003, which is next Monday. 
     
      
    5 For Count 4 he imposed a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 25 November 2002. 
     
      
    6 The Crown submits that the sentences are disproportionately lenient and fail to reflect the objective gravity of the criminality which forms the subject matter of the three counts of break, enter and steal, and the associated charge under a Form 1 of attempted break, enter and steal. 
     
      
    7 It will be apparent that the sentences for Counts 2, 3 and 4 have been made wholly concurrent and that the effective term of imprisonment for the three counts of break, enter and steal and the additional Form 1 charge of attempt to break, enter and steal, is nine months full time custody. 
     
      
    8 The offence on 3 December 2001 involved the loss of jewellery to a value of some $22,000 which represents on any view a substantial amount of money. The two offences in December 2001 took place during daylight when no one was at home. The third offence, the subject of Count 4, took place about 3.30 pm on Sunday morning 12 May 2002 when the victim, a female, Carly Andrews, was asleep. She woke up and disturbed the prisoner who ran away. 
     
      
    9 The subjective position of the prisoner is such as to excite the sympathy of the Court. He had a very unfavourable family background. He is a person of low intelligence, has never had paid employment in his life and has had minimal education. At the time of the offences he was unable effectively to read or write. 
     
      
    10 Unsurprisingly for a person with his family and social background he has a long criminal record, starting with an offence at the age of 11 of stealing, which took him to the Cobham Children’s Court. 
     
      
    11 At the time that he was sentenced he had four convictions for break, enter and steal and other convictions for offences against property and associated offences such as possession of implements to enter a conveyance; goods in custody; larceny; and possession of house breaking implements. 
     
      
    12 In the light of the objective criminality of the three break, enter and steal charges for which he had been sentenced and the attempted break, enter and steal on the Form 1, one is immediately struck by the leniency of the sentences, particularly the fact that the three sentences for the counts of break, enter and steal, have all been made concurrent. Effectively, as I said, the prisoner is only going to serve nine months in custody for those offences. As matters stand he was sentenced in August of this year and is due to be released next Monday. 
     
      
    13 A further matter of aggravation is that the prisoner was on two bonds at the time. This has always been treated as a serious aggravating matter in sentencing, as indeed the sentencing judge himself acknowledged. 
     
      
    14 The decisive matter in the view of the sentencing judge was that the prisoner had recently become a father as the result of the birth of a boy in January this year. He was currently in full time foster care overseen by the Department of Community Services because the mother, with whom the prisoner had had the relevant relationship, was herself in gaol. 
     
      
    15 Arrangements have been made for the child to be brought to the prisoner in gaol once a week and according to the evidence this has had a marked impact on him. This was the subject of evidence from the prisoner himself and Ms Brotherton. The prisoner has announced his intention of freeing himself from dependence on drugs and a life of crime in order that he might be a good father to his son. 
     
      
    16 Ms Brotherton, a welfare officer at Long Bay, in her report, which became exhibit 3, said that the birth of his son and the reaction of the prisoner may be a turning point for him, and the judge was disposed to accept that view. 
     
      
    17 Substantial weight must be given to this evidence and to the view the judge formed after he had heard evidence from the prisoner.  
     
      
    18 Nevertheless, the combination of the objective criminality of these four offences of break, enter and steal and attempted break, enter and steal, the aggravating circumstance that the prisoner was at liberty under two unexpired bonds and his four prior convictions for this offence leads, in my judgment, inexorably to the conclusion that the sentences imposed on these three counts are manifestly and appellably inadequate. 
     
      
    19 I would, therefore, allow the appeal and re-sentence the prisoner. The appropriate course is to not disturb the sentence on Count 4, which was a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 24 November 2002 and expire on 24 November 2003. I would also not disturb the head sentences for Counts 2 and 3 but would make them cumulative on the sentences for Counts 1 and 4. 
     
      
    20 I would, therefore, set aside the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 and re-sentence the prisoner to imprisonment for two years to commence on 25 November 2003 and expire on 24 November 2005 with a non-parole period of six months to commence on 25 November 2003 and expire on 24 May 2004. The result of these sentences will be that the prisoner will serve 18 months full time custody instead of 12 months. 
     
      
    21 It is important that the prisoner have a reasonably long period of post release supervision. He has been developing some skills in gaol which may make it possible for him to lead a life free of crime after his release but this will require a reasonable period of post custody supervision which the sentence I have proposed would allow. I would, therefore, order his release on parole on 24 May 2004. 
     
      
    22 GROVE J: I agree with Handley JA. 
     
      
    23 ADAMS J: I also agree. 
     
      
    24 HANDLEY JA: The sentences are as I have announced.

      JUSTICE HOWIE 
       
       
      MONDAY 27 OCTOBER 2003 
       
       
      70013/03 REGINA v STEVEN ANTHONY FRASER 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 His Honour: These are my reasons for directing the Crown to call evidence of a witness, Dr Skinner, in its case and not in reply. 
     
      
    2 The accused, Stephen Anthony Fraser, stands trial on three counts of murder, the victims in each of the charges being one of his three young children. When he was arraigned before the jury panel, the accused pleaded not guilty to each count of murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown refused to accept those pleas in full discharge of the indictment. The jury was then empanelled and the trial on the counts of murder proceeded. 
     
      
    3 In his opening to the jury the Crown Prosecutor stated that he anticipated that the real issue in the trial would be the accused’s claim that, at the time of the killing of each of his three children, he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. This is a defence to a charge of murder under s 23A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    4 Defence counsel, Mr Stratton SC, in his opening to the jury told them that, by his pleas of guilty to manslaughter, the accused accepted legal and moral responsibility for the deaths of the children but asked that the jury find him guilty of manslaughter on the basis of the defence of substantial impairment. 
     
      
    5 It is clear, from not only the opening addresses but also the manner in which the trial has been conducted, that the only issue before the jury is whether the accused has proved, on the balance of probabilities, the defence contained in s 23A. The evidence as to the accused's mental state at the time of the killing of the three children is not significantly in issue and there is no dispute that at the time that the accused killed each of the children he intended to do so. Therefore, but for the defence of substantial impairment being established by the accused, he would be guilty of the three counts of murder alleged against him. 
     
      
    6 The question that arose for my determination was whether the Crown should call its evidence to rebut the defence in the Crown case or in reply to the defence case. As I understood the situation, it was the intention of the defence that the accused would not give evidence himself, but would adduce evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, in support of the defence under s 23A. The Crown had indicated that it intended to call evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr Skinner, to rebut the evidence that it expected Dr Westmore to give. 
     
      
    7 Both psychiatrists have reached the opinion the accused suffered from a personality disorder at the time of the killing of his children, but there is a dispute as to the affect of that disorder upon the his mental processes at the time of the killing. There is a complicating factor in that the accused consumed both alcohol and prescribed drugs in order to be able to bring himself to kill his children. Section 23A(3) states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the deaths concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section. 
        
       
       
      Section 428A contains the following: 
       
        
         
        Intoxication means intoxication because of the influence of alcohol, a drug or any other substance. 
         
         
        Self-induced intoxication means any intoxication except intoxication that: 
         
         
         (a) is involuntary, or 
        
       
      
     (b) results from fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress or force, or 
     
      
       
        
         (c) results from the administration of a drug for which a prescription is required in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, a person authorised under the Nurses Act 1991 to practise as a nurse practitioner, or dentist, or of a drug for which no prescription is required administered for the purpose, and in accordance with the dosage limit recommended, in the manufacturer’s instructions. 
        
       
      
    8 The Crown will be submitting to the jury, that even, if it finds that the accused had a relevant mental impairment at the time of the killings, they would not find that he was substantially impaired by it. The Crown would argue that, notwithstanding that impairment, the accused had sufficient judgment, awareness, and control that he was unable to bring himself to kill the children without the assistance of alcohol and other drugs to either overcome his nature inhibition against performing such an act or to give him the “Dutch courage” he required to strengthen his resolve to carry out his wishes. It is only in that way that his ingestion of alcohol and drugs is relevant to a determination of whether the defence ins 23A is made out. 
     
      
    9 When counsel for the Crown first raised the issue of when he should call Dr Skinner, it was on the basis that either the common law or s 23A(7) gave the Court a discretion to permit the Crown to call evidence in rebuttal of the evidence in the accused’s case adduced to establish the defence. It was thought, apparently, that such a discretion had to be conferred on the trial judge because of a line of common law authority, particularly in the High Court, that prohibited the Crown from splitting its own case. I was provided with decisions of single Justices of this Court allowing the Crown to call its evidence in reply on the basis of a discretion residing in the trial judge. 
     
      
    10 However, during the course of argument and after I had indicated my initial view that the section contained no such discretion, reference was made to s 151(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 151 concerns the obligation of an accused to notify the Crown of an intention to adduce evidence tending to prove the defence under s 23A. Section 151(3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Any evidence tendered to disprove a contention of substantial mental impairment may, subject to any direction of the Court, be given before or after evidence is given to prove that contention. 
        
       
       
      Section 151(6) provides: 
       
        
         
        In this section a contention of substantial mental impairment means a contention by the accused person that the accused person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900. 
        
       
      
    11 Mr Stratton relied upon the common law cases concerned with the conduct of the Crown case, to which I briefly referred earlier. These are the High Court decisions in Shaw v The Queen (1952) 85 CLR 365; Killick v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565 and The Queen v Chin (1985) 175 CLR 671. In addition to the cases to which Mr Stratton referred can be added Lawrence v R (1981) 38 ALR 38, and Soma v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 849. Mr Stratton submits that, throughout this line of authority, the High Court has insisted that the Crown call evidence in its case, not only where the evidence supports an element of the offence, but also where the evidence rebuts a defence of which the Crown had notice.  
     
      
    12 The high water mark of this argument seems to be the following passage in the judgment of Dawson J (with whom Mason J agreed) in Chin at 685: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The prosecution will not, of course, be seeking to split its case when the evidence which it wishes to call by way of reply is to rebut evidence which forms no part of its proofs as, for example, where the defence of insanity is raised or evidence of good character is called by the accused. Even then, if the nature of the evidence which the accused intends to call should have been known to the prosecution so that it would have been possible to deal with it by calling evidence in the prosecution case, the proper course may be to refuse the prosecution permission to reopen its case in order to call rebutting evidence. Thus it was held in  
        Killick’s 
         case that the prosecution ought not to have been permitted to call evidence after the close of the defence case in order to rebut an alibi raised by the accused which ought to have been foreseen by the prosecution because it had been raised in earlier proceedings. Where evidence which the prosecution seeks to call by way of rebuttal is also confirmation of the case which it has sought to make, the trial judge must exercise his discretion to ensure the observance of the principle which finds its expressions in the rules which have been laid down: see 
         Killick’s case 
        . If the evidence was only of marginal, minimal or doubtful relevance to the prosecution case, it may properly be admitted to rebut the defence case. There is also authority for the proposition that the prosecution may be permitted to reopen its case 
          
        to repair 
          
        omissions of a formal, technical or non-contentious nature: see  
        Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 
         41st ed, 1982, para 4-414, and the cases there cited. 
        
       
      
    13 That passage however should be compared with the following from the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ and Wilson J at 676 (citations omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        The principles that govern the exercise of the discretion of a trial judge [to allow the prosecution] to call evidence after the close of the case for the defence have been discussed in this court in 
         Shaw v The Queen 
        ; 
         Killick v The Queen 
         and 
         Lawrence v R 
        . The general principle is that the prosecution must present its case completely before the accused is called upon for his defence. Although the trial judge has a discretion to allow the prosecution to call further evidence after evidence has been given for the defence, he should permit the prosecution to call evidence at that stage only if the circumstances are very special or exceptional and, generally speaking, not if the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen. The principle applies where the prosecution seeks to call evidence to rebut matters raised for the first time by the defence; if the rebutting evidence was itself relevant to prove the prosecution case (unless, perhaps, it was no more than marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant: 
         R v Levy and Tait 
         (1966) 50 Cr App R 198 at 202) and the need to give it could have been foreseen it will, generally speaking, be rejected.  
        The principle would not prevent the prosecution from giving in reply evidence directed to an issue the proof of which did not lie on the prosecution, such as insanity, or from rebutting evidence of the accused’s good character, provided that the prosecution had not anticipated the raising of an issue of this kind and led evidence with regard to it, for the prosecution must not split its case on any issue. 
         Also, it has been held that evidence may be given in reply to prove some purely formal matter the proof of which was overlooked in chief. (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    14 In Melbourne v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 1 McHugh J said at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………………………A plea of diminished responsibility, like a plea of insanity, is a plea of confession and avoidance. Any person, relying on the plea, must prove it. In this court, the accused conceded that this was so. Until an accused person tenders evidence in support of the claim of diminished responsibility, the Crown has no issue to meet. It is not like the common law “defences” of provocation or “self-defence” which the Crown must negative once they are fairly raised on the evidence. 
         
         
        
       
      
    15 The latest statement of the principle against the Crown splitting its case is in Soma. That was a case where the Crown introducing evidence of admissions made by the accused in an interview with police after the accused had given evidence and in order to rebut statements made by the accused during the course of his evidence. The majority of the High Court held that the introduction of the evidence, which should have been part of the Crown case if it were to be tendered at all, was a breach of the principle established by the decisions, to which I have already referred, and that nothing in the provisions of the Evidence Act (QLD), concerned with the admissibility of an inconsistent statement, derogated from that general principle. 
     
      
    16 In the course of its judgment, the majority referred to Niven v The Queen (1968) 118 CLR 513. Their Honours stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [ 
        34]  
        Niven 
         concerned, most immediately, the operation of s371(i) of the Criminal Code (Tas) which provided that in proceedings upon the trial of an indictment ""[e]vidence in rebuttal may be called by the Crown if the judge is of opinion that in the circumstances of the particular case it should be allowed”. The Criminal Code (Qld) contains no equivalent provision. In  
        Niven 
        , the court held that the expression “evidence in rebuttal” should be understood as applying to all evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution after the accused’s defence was complete. It therefore extended to evidence given to prove a prior inconsistent statement by the accused. It was against the background of that conclusion that the court said [at 516]: 
         
         
          
           It would therefore be advisable, in our opinion, for a trial judge as well as for the prosecutor, to bear in mind at the time the cross-examination [about a prior inconsistent statement] is being entered upon that a serious problem may later arise if the prosecutor seeks to adduce evidence to establish the prior inconsistent statement, particularly if that statement amounts to or includes an admission by the accused of guilt or of some significant fact in relation to its proof. 
          
         
         
        As the court went on to say, in exercising the discretion whether to permit the prosecution to adduce evidence of that prior inconsistent statement in rebuttal, consideration would have to be given to “the possibility of prejudice to the accused as well as of prejudice to the prosecutor which could have been avoided by appropriate action taken at an earlier point in the trial”. 
         
         
        [35] Although what was said in  
        Niven 
         was directed to s 371(i) of the Criminal Code (Tas), the principles which it states apply equally to this case. Indeed, there is no reason to think that they do not apply generally to the trial of indictable crime in Australia, unless and until this aspect of the practice and procedure in such trials is explicitly modified by statute. 
        
       
      
    17 I do not believe that there is anything in the line of authority to which I have referred or the principle that the Crown must not split its case, that would prevent the Crown from adducing evidence of a psychiatrist, as to the mental state of the accused at the time of the killing, to rebut evidence in support of the defence under s 23A and where that evidence is not otherwise relevant to prove the offence. In so far as Dawson J stated anything in Chin to the contrary, I believe it is inconsistent with other statements made in the cases to which I have referred and, in particular, with what was said in the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ and Wilson J in Chin in the passage quoted above. There is nothing in Soma that suggests that the principle is not as stated in the joint judgment. In Soma the evidence called in reply contained evidence of admissions in proof of the offence charged. 
     
      
    18 Having regard to what was said by McHugh J in Melbourne and simple logic, I cannot see any rational policy that would require the Crown to call evidence, which is admissible and relevant only to rebut a defence under s 23A, in its case. I can appreciate why the Crown cannot choose to split its case in reply so that, if it calls evidence in its case-in-chief for the purpose of rebutting the defence, it may not be permitted to call further evidence in reply. The principle enunciated in the High Court decisions, to which I have referred, is concerned with the proper application of the onus of proof on the Crown and fairness to the accused. I fail to see how generally speaking it could be unfair to the accused to permit the Crown to call evidence of a psychiatric nature in reply to evidence in proof of a defence of substantial impairment where the onus to prove that defence is on the accused. 
     
      
    19 But whatever may have been the situation at common law, it seems clear to me that the principle has been affected by s 151(3). I can see no reason why that section should be construed other than in accordance with its terms and unaffected by any common law rule that it may have displaced. 
     
      
    20 On its face s 151(3) provides the Crown generally with a discretion as to whether to call evidence to rebut the defence under section 23A either in its case-in-chief or in reply. However, in an appropriate case the trial judge may be required to intervene and give a direction as to when that evidence should be called. This will usually be necessary because it would be unfair to the accused if the evidence were to be adduced in reply. The need for that direction might arise, for example, because the evidence relied on by the Crown is part of the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and, therefore, would more appropriately be adduced in the Crown case. Another example may be where the evidence has a prejudicial effect that might operate unfairly against the accused if it were the last evidence to be heard by the jury. Yet another example may be where, although the evidence is tendered to rebut the defence, it is also relevant to either establish or disprove an element in the Crown case, such as an intention to kill. 
     
      
    21 But where the evidence is expert opinion given by a professional such as a psychiatrist or medical practitioner, and is relevant only because the defence intends to rely upon s 23A, I find it difficult to see how the intervention of the Court to interfere with the discretion vested in the Crown by s 151(3) could usually be justified let alone warranted. 
     
      
    22 There is no novelty, in this State, in the fact that a provision has displaced the common law principle against the Crown splitting its case. In relation to alibi evidence it has long been the case that, contrary to the common law rule, the prosecution has had a discretion whether to call the evidence rebutting alibi in its case or in reply. Section 405A(4) of the Crimes Act, before the repeal of that section, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Any evidence tendered to disprove an alibi may, subject to any direction by the Court, be given before or after evidence is given in support of the alibi.  
         
        
       
      A similar provision is now found in s 150(5) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . 
       
      
    23 In Blewitt v The Queen (1988) 62 ALJR 503, the High Court said (at 506):  
     
      
       
        
         
        Plainly enough [s 405A(4)] alters the old common law rule that a judge should not permit the Crown to adduce evidence after the accused has closed his case for the purpose of rebutting an alibi which the Crown should reasonably have foreseen would be raised at the trial: Killick. But it may well be that, notwithstanding s 405A(4), there are some situations in which the giving of evidence of a rebuttal of an alibi in reply would so unfairly prejudice an accused as to amount to a miscarriage of justice.  
         
         
        
       
      
    24 In respect of the same section, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Heuston (1996) A Crim R 213 stated at 244: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The present case provides a good example of the need for the flexibility given by a provision such as s 405A(4), and of the undesirability of determining these matters by reference to technical and inflexible rules of evidence, including rules about splitting of cases. It illustrates the desirability of determining the matter by reference to considerations of fairness, and by judicial discretion. 
         
         
        One relevant consideration of fairness will often be that referred to by the High Court in Killick (at 569). Evidence tendered by the Crown after the defence has closed its case may assume an inflated importance in the eyes of the jury. Other considerations relevant to fairness may include the position in which an accused will be left if evidence is called in reply, and the matter of the Crown's duty of disclosure……... 
        
       
      
    25 It seems that in respect of s 405A the question as to when in the proceedings the rebutting evidence should be called was usually raised by an application by the Crown for a direction under the section that it be permitted to call the evidence in reply rather than in the Crown case. I assume that this form of procedure arose in deference to the common law rule rather than as a result of anything in the wording of the section. It is perhaps of no real consequence how the issue is raised, and the Crown is in the best position to know whether it intends to call the evidence in its case or in reply. But the procedure adopted should not be allowed to dictate the result. In my view, it should be borne in mind that s 151(3) is permissive in that it relieves the Crown of the restriction placed upon it by the common law. The onus is upon the defence to show why the Crown should be subject to an order preventing it from calling the evidence in reply. 
     
      
    26 Why then should I make a direction requiring the Crown to call the evidence of Dr Skinner in its case? Mr Stratton has submitted that it is significant that she has changed her opinion as to whether the defence has been made out. However, I do not understand why that fact should require the Crown to call the witness in its case. The jury would clearly be made aware that she has changed her opinion and the reasons why she has done so. The fact that she has changed her view as to the effect of the accused’s mental disorder on his behaviour is hardly going to bolster her evidence or unfairly undermine that of Dr Westmore who is to be called by the accused. 
     
      
    27 Mr Stratton relies also upon statements in the High Court as to the possible disadvantage to an accused by the fact that the Crown’s evidence in reply is the last evidence that the jury hears. In Heuston the fact that the Crown’s evidence in reply convincingly disproved the accused’s alibi and that it was “left ringing in the ears of the jury” did not mean that such unfairness arose that there was a miscarriage of justice. I do not believe that the accused is treated unfairly just because the Crown’s evidence on the issue of substantial impairment may be the last evidence adduced before the jury. It should be noted, of course, that in this State the accused has the right of last address to the jury. 
     
      
    28 Finally Mr Stratton has submitted that in this case the Crown has split its case on the issue of rebutting the defence under s 23A. It was contended that, in questions asked of Dr Keller and Professor Starmer in examination-in-chief, the Crown adduced evidence as to the accused’s mental condition on or about the time of the killing in order to rebut the defence. The argument is that, having commenced to lead evidence on that issue, the Crown should be required to continue to lead evidence on it in its case. 
     
      
    29 Dr Keller was called principally to give evidence concerning the accused’s mental state after he was admitted to hospital shortly after the killing of the children. The Crown is alleging that the accused made admissions while at the hospital. The evidence of Dr Keller was relevant, to some degree, as to the making of those admissions and their reliability. But the evidence went further than that and the Crown adduced evidence from the witness of a more general nature about the accused’s mental state at the time. However, had this been the only evidence led by the Crown to rebut the defence, I would not have made any direction as to when the Crown should call the evidence of Dr Skinner. It will not be the case that a direction should be made under s 151(3) just because there has been evidence adduced in the Crown case that touches upon the issue raised by the defence. Section 151(3) is concerned with evidence that is “tendered to disprove the contention of substantial impairment” and not evidence that happens to disprove the contention but is not tendered for that purpose. 
     
      
    30 Professor Starmer was called to give pharmaceutical evidence in relation to drugs that were ingested by the accused and the children. Although the Crown submitted that his evidence was relevant to the effect of drugs on the children, that evidence was not essential in proof of the Crown case. There is no apparent dispute that the accused gave Mogadon tablets to the children in order to subdue them so that he could more easily drown them in the bath. Of more importance was the evidence that the witness gave about the drugs taken by the accused, or purportedly taken by him, and how they might have affected his behaviour. That evidence was, on the issues before the jury, relevant to whether the accused could establish the defence under s 23A. It was not simply a case of it being simply convenient for the witness to give that evidence while giving other evidence relevant to the Crown’s case. His evidence was principally concerned with an issue about the nature of the drug taken by the accused and the effect it may have had upon him. This is an issue that relates to the defence and not the Crown case, given that there is no dispute that the accused intended to kill the children. 
     
      
    31 In those circumstances it seemed to me to be appropriate to direct the Crown to call the evidence of Dr Skinner in its case.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 O’KEEFE J: I have read the draft judgment of Barr J and agree with his conclusions and the reasons for such conclusions.  
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    3 BARR J: On 12 March 1998 the applicant Wayne Scott Clark was found guilty by a jury of certain offences, namely- 
     
      
       
        
        (a) On 25 February 1996 at Smithfield stealing a certain motor vehicle;  
        
       
       
        
        (b) On the same day at Parramatta stealing a certain motor vehicle; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) On 5 March 1996 at Casula robbing Leonie Catherine Pettiford of about $510,000; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) At the same time and place maliciously wounding Edward Emerson with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension. 
        
       
      
    4 On 3 April 1998 concurrent sentences were imposed, the longest of which had a total term of 16 years with a minimum term due to expire on 2 April 2010. The applicant signed a notice appealing against the convictions and seeking leave to appeal against the sentences. The notice was dated 4 April 1998 but not filed until 5 May 1998, after the expiry of the period of 28 days then allowed for the filing of an appeal. According to the notice, the grounds of appeal were to be advised. No grounds of appeal were ever filed in spite of many mentions of the matter before the Registrar. On 25 July 2000 a notice of abandonment was filed, dated 23 July 2000. On 31 July 2000 the Court dismissed the appeal. On 30 April 2003 the applicant filed a second notice of appeal against the convictions.  
     
      
    5 It seems to me in the circumstances that the purported second appeal must be dealt with in the first place as an application for leave to withdraw the notice of abandonment and for an extension of time within which to file a notice of appeal.  
     
      
    6 On 5 March 1996 two men broke into a bank at Casula. They wore balaclavas. They were armed with loaded pistols. They threatened staff and took the bank’s money. During the robbery the alarm was raised and Mr Edward Emerson, an off-duty police officer, ran from nearby premises to the bank in an attempt to stop the robbery. One of the robbers shot and wounded him. They got away, using first one stolen car and then another. They were the two cars dealt with in the first two counts. It was the Crown case that the applicant was the robber who shot Mr Emerson.  
     
      
    7 On 8 May 1996 police from the Tactical Operations Unit arrested the applicant and took him to Picton police station. They had made no prior arrangement to take him there and had not alerted local police about their intention to arrest the applicant because they wanted their investigation to be secret. At the police station the audio-visual recording equipment was broken but there was an audio tape recorder. The arresting officers decided to use that equipment to record the interview which they hoped to have with the applicant. So it turned out.  
     
      
    8 Before the interview began, however, there was a significant conversation between the arresting police and the applicant during which he told them that he had been involved in the robbery with a man called Robert Charles Wood, that each had been armed with a revolver, that he, the applicant, had shot Mr Emerson, that Wood had received $180,000 and that the applicant had received the rest of the proceeds of the robbery. He also told the officers where they would find the sum of approximately $100,000 hidden in his house.  
     
      
    9 When the interview was recorded these matters were confirmed and the applicant went on to make a full confession of the part he played. 
     
      
    10 Police searched the applicant’s house and found about $100,000 in the place nominated by the applicant. 
     
      
    11 Police arrested Wood, who confessed, pleaded guilty and promised to give evidence for the Crown at the applicant’s trial. He fulfilled that promise. 
     
      
    12 There were three bodies of evidence against the applicant, namely the admissions recorded at the police station, the evidence of Wood and a body of circumstantial evidence. That evidence included the applicant’s having spent $125,000 in cash between 7 March and 8 May 1996 on a car, a motorcycle, a lounge suite, a large-screen television set, a billiard table, a holiday and jewellery, the finding of the $100,000, a significant part of which was in sequentially numbered notes, in the place nominated by the applicant, the finding of other substantial sums of money among the property of the applicant and his wife and at their house, evidence of telephone contact between the applicant and Wood on the morning of the robbery and afterwards and the finding of a number of firearms at the applicant’s house as well as .357 calibre ammunition. The bullet that shot Mr Emerson was of that calibre. 
     
      
    13 The applicant objected to the tender of the evidence of what he had told the police in the recorded interview. He had been tried in the previous November but the jury had been unable to agree. At that trial O’Reilly QC, DCJ had, after a lengthy voir dire, admitted the evidence following an objection on identical grounds. His Honour presided at the second trial as well, so at the commencement of that trial the voir dire evidence from the first trial was formally tendered and received and his Honour’s decision to admit the evidence formally repeated.  
     
      
    14 Six grounds of appeal were filed with the second notice of appeal, namely-  
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in allowing evidence to be given indicating that the appellant had not complained to the Magistrate at Campbelltown Local Court of misconduct by police officers who interrogated him. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in directions he gave concerning the fact that no complaint was made to the Magistrate at Campbelltown by the Appellant about improper police conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury in relation to the appellant’s right to silence. 
        
       
       
        
        4. His Honour erred in admitting over objection disputed confessional material. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The trial miscarried by reason of the absence of evidence now available as to sounds encoded on tape recordings containing alleged confessional material obtained from the appellant during his interview by police officers. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The conviction of the appellant was unsafe and involved a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
      
    15 Although written submissions were filed in support of all grounds counsel for the applicant took the view at the hearing that the first three grounds would fail and did not press them. Counsel acknowledged that the sixth ground depended on the success of the fourth and fifth grounds. Accordingly, submissions on the merits were confined to those two grounds. 16 An application for leave to withdraw a notice of abandonment or to file a notice of appeal after a delay of five and one-half years since conviction is not a formality. When the first notice of appeal was filed s.10 Criminal Appeal Act was in the following terms- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Any person convicted on indictment desiring to appeal to the court, or to obtain the leave of the court to appeal from any conviction, or sentence, shall give notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, in such manner as may be prescribed, within 28 days of the date of such conviction or sentence.

        (3) The court may, at any time, extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an application for leave to appeal, is required to be given to the court. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    17 Substantial changes were made in 2001 to the procedure for initiating appeals. Now section s.10(1) provides as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The following provisions apply to an appeal, or application for leave to appeal, under this Act against a person's conviction or sentence:  
         
         
        (a) The person is required to give the court, in accordance with the rules of court, notice of intention to appeal, or notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal, within 28 days after the conviction or sentence.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) The court may, at any time, extend the time within which the notice under paragraph (a) is required to be given to the court.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) The appeal, or application for leave to appeal, is to be made in accordance with the rules of court, which may include:  
         
         
          
          (i) provision with respect to any statement of grounds of appeal, transcripts, exhibits or other documents or things to accompany the appeal or application, and  
           
          (ii) provision with respect to the timely institution and prosecution of the appeal or application, and  
           
          (iii) provision with respect to the period during which the notice under paragraph (a) has effect.  
          
         
        
       
      
    18 The rules say nothing about the manner in which the Court should exercise its discretion whether to extend time. 
     
      
    19 I take it that the principles governing the exercise of the discretion whether to extend time or permit withdrawal of a notice of abandonment have not changed.  
     
      
    20 The law about the exercise of the discretion was reviewed by Smart AJ in R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275. The matters to be considered are whether there may have been a miscarriage of justice at trial (which depends on the substance of the grounds of appeal desired to be argued), the reasons for abandoning the appeal and for seeking to withdraw the abandonment, the length of time which has elapsed since the conviction appealed from and, at any rate where it is desired to argue new trial grounds, any particular reason why the passage of that time may have prejudiced the other side. 21 In R v Jeffrey Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 16 December 1993 unreported the applicant sought to go behind his notice of abandonment. Badgery-Parker J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said- 
     
      
       
        
        The power of the court to grant leave to withdraw a notice of abandonment is a discretionary power. The circumstances in which it should be exercised are the subject of authority. In  
        Regina v Stubbs 
         (1970) 92 WN 9NSW) 768 it was held that leave should be granted only if it appears on the face of the application that some ground exists for supposing that there may have been fraud or at least bad advice given by a legal adviser which has resulted in an unintended and ill-considered decision to abandon the appeal. 
         
         
         
        The present did not appear on the face of it to be such a case for the applicant had made a considered decision upon advice from senior counsel which advice does not appear to have been fraudulent, ill-considered, incompetent or obviously mistaken. However, the court retains an inherent jurisdiction to go behind a notice of abandonment in a case where it appeared likely that there had been a miscarriage of justice which would go uncorrected if the notice of abandonment were allowed to stand:  
        R v Bell 
         (1987) 8 NSWLR 311, 314. Consequently, in such a case as the present, a decision as to whether the notice of abandonment should be set aside and the applicant allowed to proceed with his appeal is inextricably entwined with the question whether the appeal has real merit - ibid at 314. 
         
        
       
      
    22 The applicant relied on the affidavit of his solicitor Patricia Gaye White sworn 23 May 2003 to explain the delay. There is no need to deal with the detail of the events which have taken place since conviction as recounted in that affidavit and it is sufficient for present purposes to say that the applicant and his advisers appear to have acted reasonably and with appropriate despatch at all times.  
     
      
    23 The principal remaining considerations are the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal and, if they have merit, the probable effect of delay on the Crown’s chances of a fair trial if the conviction were quashed and a new trial ordered. It is unnecessary to consider the second of those matters in view of the conclusion I have reached about the first.  
     
      
    24 The fourth and fifth grounds of appeal may be considered together. The audio-taped interview began at 9:36am and ended at 10:32am. The principal interrogating officer, Detective Sergeant Moss, gave evidence on the voir dire and before the jury about his interrogation of the applicant, his admissions before the commencement of the tape-recorded interview, his confirmation of them during the interview and the other admissions made on that occasion. A tape recording and a typed transcript of what was said were tendered through him. It was suggested to him in cross-examination that he had behaved inappropriately before and during the interview. It was suggested that the applicant had asked him immediately upon arrest for an opportunity to telephone his solicitor and that the officer had denied him such an opportunity, that he had told the applicant that his de facto wife, who had been arrested, would be refused bail and would thereby lose the care of her twelve year old girl, that he had told the applicant that if he did not co-operate he would be placed in the mainstream section of the gaol, not on protection, a dangerous place for the applicant, who had served a period of imprisonment on protection. Detective Sergeant Moss denied those assertions.  
     
      
    25 The applicant gave evidence of threats issued by Detective Sergeant Moss in much the same terms as counsel had used in cross-examining the officer. The evidence continued- 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Was there anything said to you by Mr Moss or shown to you by Mr Moss or any of the police prior to the interviews commencing? 
         
        A. Yeah the facts, what he wanted me to say. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did that happen, how did that take place physically? 
         
        A. Well he would say to me, what do you mean physically, what? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Well I mean you were at Picton police station, you’re in a room, what happened after that between you and Mr Moss and the other police when you say he showed you the facts? 
         
        A. Well the other two sat there and Moss sat next to me and he was saying this and telling me that I was going to say that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was he going to say to you? 
         
        A. That I was going to do what I was told. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you got to the Picton police station and the car was parked in the car park and you saw the tapes and then you went into an interview room, what happened in that interview room if anything before the tape was tuned on? 
         
        A. I was told what I was going to do. 
         
         
        Q. Right now what did he say you were going to do? 
         
        A. What I was told. 
         
         
        Q. Well what was it that you were told? 
         
        A. That I was going to admit to whatever he wanted me to admit to. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, now insofar as the robbery at Casula, what did he tell you if anything about that? 
         
        A. He told me all about it, he said “you’re going to be doing what you’re told”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah but what did he tell you all about it? 
         
        A. The way it happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you please tell me what he said to you,, to the best of your recollection the way it happened, tell me what he said? 
         
        A. I don’t understand how, it’s like he said this and I said that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes for a start your instructions have been that you repeated in your interview things that he had told you? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you didn’t commit the robbery, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you didn’t shoot the police officer? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well we’ve heard the recording and we’ve seen a a copy and you’ve for some time had a copy of a transcript of the record of interview in which he puts certain things to you and asked you whether you agree as to the offences at Casula? 
         
        A. Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did you come to have the knowledge about the matters that you set out in the interview on the tape-- 
         
        A. Because he had the paper work there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What would he do about the paper work in relation to you? 
         
        A. He would say to me that I’m going to admit to this and I’m going to admit to that. 
        
       
      
    26 The applicant denied having made any admission before the commencement of the tape recorded interview. All the admissions made during the interview, he said, were made at the direction of Detective Sergeant Moss and were untrue. In cross-examination the applicant said this- 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Now can you tell us how, before the first interview started, how did Moss give you the information that you were then to tell during the course of the taped interview, how did he give you the information? 
         
        A. He was telling me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So he just spoke to you and said “this is what I want you to say”-- 
         
        A. He had papers there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But did you have access to the papers? 
         
        A. Yeah he showed me the papers. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you read them? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you know, in relation to Casula how many pages were there? 
         
        A. I don’t know. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Well you read them didn’t you? 
         
        A. Well I wasn’t counting the pages. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Was it one? 
         
        A. No there was a lot of papers.  
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. And were they outline of facts or were there statements, you know what statements are don’t you? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. Were there statements? 
         
        A. No they were just facts, they were just blatant “you did this you did that”. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. They were “you did this and you did that”? 
         
        A. He was telling me you’re going to admit this and you’re going to admit to that you know. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. What was it that you read? 
         
        A. What I just said, the answers that I gave. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. And as you gave the answers was the paper in front of you? 
         
        A. When I was making the tape thing? 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. Yeah? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. Can you tell me as best you can how many pages were in the document that you had in front of you-- 
         
        A. I couldn’t tell you how many pages. 
        
       
       
        
         
        Q. Was it more than one? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Was it more than two? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. More than three? 
         
        A. There was a lot of pages but I can’t tell you how many you know. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And did you have to look for answers to the questions that were being asked of you in the pages that were in front of you? 
         
        A. No Moss told me that I would – it was yes, no, you know it was – when I listened to that yesterday I thought most of it yes, no. 
         
         
        Q. So you say you didn’t have to look for answers to the questions that Moss was asking of you? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Well did you look at the document at all when you were giving your answers? 
         
        A, Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you weren’t looking for answers to particular questions? 
         
        A. The answers were on the - they were there. 
        
       
      
    27 There was other evidence in which the applicant said that he had read answers from papers provided by Detective Sergeant Moss, but it is unnecessary to set it out in full. 
     
      
    28 His Honour was invited to reject the evidence on a number of legal bases, but they really all depended upon his Honour’s impression of the reliability of the evidence of the police officers and the applicant respectively. His Honour did not believe the applicant. The submissions have not been transcribed and it is not apparent whether counsel made any submission about whether sounds audible from a playing of the tape supported the applicant’s evidence about the use by the police officers of pieces of paper with model answers written on them. At any rate, his Honour said this in giving reasons for judgment- 
     
      
       
        
        I should have added by now that having listened carefully to the audio-tapes, they just do not seem to me to bear any of the stigmata that they would bear if Mr Clark’s story is true or any of it is true. It just does not come over that way to my ear.  
        
       
      
    29 Police suspected the applicant of having committed a number of other offences. Ten minutes after the conclusion of the interview they began to ask him formally about those matters. As before, the conversation was recorded on audio-tape. At the conclusion of the interview the applicant was charged with a number of other robberies and attempted robberies. He was called for trial on those charges on 5 March 2001. The Crown relied on the audio-tape and a transcript of the words recorded on it and the applicant objected to their tender on grounds like those raised three years previously before O’Reilly DCJ. The improper conduct attributed to the investigating police officers, particularly Detective Sergeant Moss, was the same as before.  
     
      
    30 The trial judge, Sides QC, DCJ, presided over a voir dire which occupied eight days. Evidence was received about the applicant’s admissions over the Casula robbery in addition to the admissions Sides DCJ was being asked to exclude. That, his Honour said, was because an examination of the circumstances in which they were made was relevant to matters to be decided, the Casula admissions having being made shortly before the others. No oral evidence was received from the applicant, however, and a transcript of the evidence he had given before O’Reilly DCJ was admitted into evidence. 31 Sides DCJ made findings about the audio-tapes concerning the Casula robbery and the other robberies. This passage appears in his Honour’s judgment- 
     
      
       
        
        At some stages on the audio cassette tapes non metallic tapping sounds can be heard. At some stages to my ear they sounded very like a finger tapping a hard surface. At other times they sounded like a hard non metallic object being brought into contact with a hard surface. Examples of these sounds can be heard at significant points in the interview. Also sounds like a creaking chair and sniffs can be heard. These sounds at times appear in close proximity to one another. For example: 
        
       
      
    · Page 7 of the transcript of the interview Ex C. This was soon after the interview resumed following a suspension during which a drink was obtained. During that portion of the tape I heard sniffing or a sniff on a number of occasions and a number of pauses in the Accused’s answers or before he commenced an answer. These tapping sounds are consistent with someone pointing out where the Accused was to read. Noises consistent with a sheet of paper sliding across a hard surface can also be heard on occasions a stage of the tape. The note taker or the interviewer shifting through papers he was working from may have made them. But in light of the pauses and the tapping sounds they are also capable of another explanation: a piece of paper being moved closer to the Accused so he could read from it; 
     
      
    · Question 61 Ex C asked the Accused: “Can you tell me how you were dressed?” He responds with a question: How was I dressed?” At the end of this response a non metallic sound and paper movement sounds can be heard before Q62 is asked: “Yeah, what were you wearing?” There is then a pause before the Accused answers: “Tracksuit pants and a jumper, from memory”. A sound like a creaking chair can be heard at the end of Q63. Similar sounds can be heard before Q67 is answered. Paper movement sounds can be heard during the answer to Q67 and non metallic tapping sounds at the end of that answer. Creaking of a chair on its own is of no particular significance but occurring in combination with other sounds it could be consistent with a move of a person forward in the chair as they brought something on the table to the attention of the Accused; 
     
      
    · In the questions leading up to and including Q99 Det. Moss’s voice is very soft. I detected an increase in the volume of his voice when he commenced asking Q1000. The increase was not great but it was detectable. At the end of Q99 there is a creaking sound like a movement in a chair and a trump (sic) like a cup being put on a table. These drown out the answer. The two sounds suggest a movement forward to put a cup on the table. The significance of it is that during the asking of Q102 another creak can be heard and a non metallic tapping sound can be heard just after that. There is a pause during the answer after the longest word in the answer [electrician’s]. This combination of sounds and words is consistent with someone leaning forward and pointing out where the Accused is to read from and his pausing as he reads aloud.  
     
      
    32 This Court was informed that before he made his findings Sides DCJ listened to the audio-tape with which this appeal is concerned using equipment superior to that used by O’Reilly DCJ. The evidence was not offered in order to ground any submission that the opinion of Sides DCJ had any bearing on the matter, of course, but to support a submission that if O’Reilly DCJ had had available to him equipment like that available to Sides DCJ the result might have been different.  
     
      
    33 In this way there was introduced on appeal evidence of Dr Wolfgang Nicholas Garwoli, a chartered professional engineer. Dr Garwoli swore an affidavit on 15 June 2003 which was read on the appeal. He was examined in chief and cross-examined. Dr Garwoli has extensive professional and technical qualifications and experience, including experience in recording, analysing and reporting upon sounds produced in various ways. He has conducted a number of tests for government institutions which require the application of such techniques and has written a number of papers dealing with them. It was established to my satisfaction that he had the specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience sufficient to entitle him to give evidence of his opinion.  
     
      
    34 Dr Garwoli’s opinion was requested by the applicant’s solicitor, who by letter informed him of the background to the matter and enclosed the audio-tapes used at both trials together with transcripts thereof, the judgment of Sides DCJ and a section of the transcript of evidence taken before his Honour recording the cross-examination of Detective Sergeant Moss. The letter continued- 
     
      
       
        
        We allege as instructed, that the Police scripted the interviews of Mr Clark on 8 May 1996 relevant to his current convictions. That is, the Police read the questions and Mr Clark read answers prepared by the Police. We refer you to the judgment of Justice Sides at pages 11-19 and evidence provided by Detective Sergeant Moss in cross-examination. 
        
       
       
        
        We request that you undertake an analysis of the audiotapes and prepare a report as to your opinion whether sounds appear on the audiotapes including but not limited to: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Writing; 
         
        2. Non-metallic tapping sounds; 
         
        3. Paper sliding across a hard surface; 
         
        4. Creaking chairs; 
         
        5. Thumps; 
         
        6. Coughing and sniffing; 
         
        7. Fingers sliding across paper; 
         
        8. Shuffling paper. 
        
       
      
    35 Dr Garwoli listened to the tapes and had them digitised and examined by means of a computer program. He had models produced by the same means in order to compare sounds with sounds. He listened to so many of the sounds as implied the hitting of a table, the movement of paper across the surface and writing.  
     
      
    36 Dr Garwoli observed that the poor quality of the recording significantly limited the information that could be derived from the tapes. He observed that it was essential, as in any scientific experiment, to conduct a gross error check and an authentication of the basic process before drawing conclusions from the data processed, but that it was not possible to conduct a meaningful authentication in the matter. He observed that the physics was simple but that the interpretation of the results covered new ground and was exceedingly complex.  
     
      
    37 Dr Garwoli’s conclusion was that the noise on the tape was “totally” consistent with someone tapping the table, dragging paper over a surface and writing. I understood that by that expression he meant consistent throughout. He went on to say that it had to be clearly understood that there was no authentication of his processes and that that meant that there could well be entirely different explanations for the sounds on the tape and that the tapping, dragging and writing sounds could have been due to entirely different physical effects. Dr Garwoli was asked about this and mentioned as other possible sources of the sounds something dropping, something outside the room and something in the roof.  
     
      
    38 The report continued- 
     
      
       
        
        Here we have one set of data which is limited. From this data, as far as the case is concerned, it is possible to derive two opposite conclusions: the sounds are due to the matters proposed or the sounds are due to an entirely different set of events.  
        
       
      
    39 There was no evidence to explain why evidence of the kind now available from Dr Garwoli was not available at the trial. It was not suggested that the technology used by Dr Garwoli had been developed since 1998. Counsel conceded that the evidence was not fresh but justified it by a submission that it was new and ought to be received because if it were not a serious miscarriage of justice would go uncorrected. The Crown objected to the evidence and it was received subject to that objection. However, it is convenient to deal with the evidence as though it were admissible on the basis put forward.  
     
      
    40 This Court is obliged to consider whether in the light of the proposed evidence there appears to have been a miscarriage of justice at the trial: Gallagher v The Queen (1985) 160 CLR 392 at 395. Where the evidence is not fresh there will only be a miscarriage of justice if the appellant satisfies the court that the new evidence is such that, taken with the evidence at the trial, the conclusion should be drawn that he was innocent or that his guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt, so that the verdict cannot be allowed to stand: Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 520; Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301. See also R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227.  
     
      
    41 It seems to me that the proffered evidence is equivocal. It shows no more than that the sounds Dr Garwoli was able to detect were consistent with someone tapping on the table, someone dragging paper over a surface and someone writing. As such, it is incapable of making the applicant’s contention more probable in the eyes of the tribunal of fact. It seems unsurprising to me that there should appear upon a sound recording of an interview which took place over an hour across a table in a confined space the sounds of tapping, movement of paper and writing. They are exactly the sort of sounds one would expect to hear in such circumstances. 42 In my opinion the evidence falls far short of the standard of cogency which is necessary to entitle it to be received on appeal. It does not favour the version of the applicant, whom the trial judge disbelieved. It is consistent with the truth of the version put forward by the interrogating police officers, whom the trial judge believed. I would reject the evidence.  
     
      
    43 I have considered the evidence as though this were an appeal properly so called in which the evidence otherwise qualified for admission. No question of an appeal arises, of course, because the applicant must fail to obtain the leave he needs to withdraw his notice of abandonment.  
     
      
    44 I propose that the Court make the following orders- 
     
      
       
        
        1. Refuse leave to withdraw the notice of abandonment filed on 25 July 2000; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Refuse to extend the time within which the applicant may file an appeal against conviction.

       KELLY & ORS v NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION 
       
      
     
     
      
    The Crime Commission sought leave to appeal against a hardship order made pursuant to s24 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The defendants sought leave to appeal and the Crime Commission sought leave to cross appeal against the quantum of an assets forfeiture order made against the defendants. Well out of time, the defendants sought leave to appeal against the assets forfeiture order itself. 
     
      
    HELD (Per Sheller JA, Santow and Tobias JJA agreeing): 
     
      
       
      1. Section 24 of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 does not prevent a dependant from bringing proceedings for relief from hardship after a forfeiture order has been made:  
      Hector Steamship Company v VO Sovfracht, Moscow 
       [1945] 1 KB 343 referred to. 
       
       
      2. It has been authoritatively decided that the felony-tort rule has been abandoned in this country:  
      Griffin v Sogelease Australia Ltd 
       [2002] NSWCA 421 followed. 
       
       
      3. The trial Judge was bound to make an assets forfeiture order if he found it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time more than six years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity. The trial Judge was not precluded from finding the relevant serious crime related activity even if by then the defendants had been tried and acquitted. 
       
       
      4. The trial Judge erred in calculating that the value of the proceeds derived from the illegal activies.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: 
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
       
      These three applications for leave to appeal arise out of proceedings which the New South Wales Crime Commission brought in the Common Law Division under the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 (the Act). The proceedings were directed to the property of the defendants Lawrence Raymond Kelly, his de facto wife, Glenda Jane Rangi, and her mother, Lillian Rangi.  
       
       
      The  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       
      
    2 The Act provides for the confiscation of interests in property that are interests of a person engaged in serious crime related activities and enables proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown. Section 6(1) provides that a reference in the Act to a serious crime related activity of a person is a reference to anything done by the person that was at the time a serious criminal offence, whether or not the person has been charged with the offence or, if charged, tried or tried and acquitted or convicted (even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside). Relevantly, s6(2) provides that a reference to a serious criminal offence is a reference to an offence referred to (before the commencement of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) in s45A of the Poisons Act 1966 of supplying any drug of addiction or prohibited drug within the meaning of the Poisons Act or of cultivating, supplying or possessing any prohibited plant within the meaning of that Act or a drug trafficking offence. Section 6(3) provides that, relevantly, “drug trafficking offence” means an offence under s25 (supply of prohibited drugs) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
     
      
    3 Part 2 of the Act enables the Supreme Court to make restraining orders restraining persons from disposing of or dealing with an interest in property to which the order applies. The restraining order may be in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity (s10(1) and (2) of the Act). Division 1 of Pt 3 enables the Supreme Court to make assets forfeiture orders forfeiting to and vesting in the Crown interests in property the subject of a restraining order (s22 of the Act). Sections 25 and 26 of the Act allow for application to be made excluding property or the value of innocent interests from an assets forfeiture order. Division 2 of Pt 3 enables the Supreme Court to make a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived from an illegal activity or activities of the person that took place not more than six years before the making of the application for the order (s27 of the Act). 
     
      
    4 Section 7 of the Act provides that a reference to an interest of a person in property is, inter alia, an interest the person has in real or personal property including a reference to the person’s money. In s7, “interest”, in relation to property, means a legal or equitable estate or interest in the property or a right, power or privilege in connection with the property, whether present or future and whether vested or contingent.  
     
      
    5 Section 4(1) defines “illegal activity” to mean, inter alia, a serious crime related activity.  
     
      
       
      Restraining order and assets forfeiture order 
       
      
    6 On 24 April 1998 the Crime Commission, by an amended summons filed in the Supreme Court, sought against the defendants restraining orders, various ancillary orders under s12 of the Act and assets forfeiture orders. On 28 April 1998, McInerney J made a restraining order pursuant to s10 of the Act, which restrained disposing of or dealing with all the interests in property of the first and second defendants and certain specified interests of the third defendant.  
     
      
    7 On 4 April 2001, after refusing an application by the defendants to adjourn the proceedings, Greg James J made an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s22 of the Act forfeiting to and vesting in the Crown the interests in property the disposal of which was restrained by McInerney J. Greg James J also made a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s27 of the Act requiring the first and second defendants to pay an amount to be assessed by the Court at a later date on account of the proceeds they had derived from certain criminal activity. Greg James J stayed execution of the assets forfeiture orders for six months to enable applications to be made on behalf of the defendants under ss 25 or 26 of the Act to have excluded an interest or a specified portion of the value of the interest in property from the operation of the assets forfeiture order.  
     
      
       
      Relief from hardship 
       
      
    8 Section 24 of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Relief from hardship – spouses and dependants 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If the Supreme Court is satisfied that an assets forfeiture order will operate to cause hardship to any dependant of the person who will forfeit an interest in property under the order, the Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) may order that the dependant is entitled to be paid a specified amount out of the proceeds of sale of the interest, being an amount that the Court thinks is necessary to prevent hardship to the dependant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) may make ancillary orders for the purpose of ensuring the proper application of an amount so paid to a person who is under 18 years of age. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court is not to make an order under this section in favour of the dependant of a person whose serious crime related activity formed the basis for the assets forfeiture order concerned unless the Court is satisfied that the dependant had no knowledge of any serious crime related activities of the person. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the dependant concerned is under 18 years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In this section: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          dependant,  
          in relation to a person, means: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a spouse or a de facto partner of the person, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a child of the person, or a member of the household of the person, dependent for support on the person.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 By a notice of motion filed on 21 September 2001, the defendants sought, inter alia, orders pursuant to ss25 and 26 and s24 of the Act. The Crime Commission challenged the competence of the defendants’ application under s24 of the Act on the ground that it was beyond the power of the Court to make a hardship order if the Court had already under s22 made an assets forfeiture order of the interests in property out of the proceeds of which an amount was to be paid to prevent hardship to a dependant. The Crime Commission relied upon the use of the future tense in the statement of the condition upon the satisfaction of which the Court might make a hardship order, namely “[i]f the Supreme Court is satisfied that an assets forfeiture order will operate to cause hardship to any dependant of the person who will forfeit an interest in property under the order”. Shaw J, who heard the defendants’ application for these orders, dealt with the question of competency as a preliminary point and, in a judgment given on 19 February 2003, rejected the Crime Commission’s argument.  
     
      
    10 On 17 March 2003 Shaw J heard the Crime Commission’s application to make an assessment of the amount of money or other consideration derived by the defendants from their alleged illegal activities between 13 February 1993 and 12 February 1999 and also the defendants’ applications under ss25 and 26 and s24 of the Act.  
     
      
    11 On 24 March 2003 his Honour, pursuant to s27(1) of the Act, ordered the first two defendants to pay to the Treasurer an amount of $96,000, being the amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived from the illegal activities of the first and second defendants within the six years prior to the making of the application for the order and pursuant to s24 ordered that in the event of the sale of the property known as 11 Brent Street, Boggabri by the Public Trustee, an amount of $20,000 be allocated for the three dependent children under the care of the first and second defendants pursuant to s24 of the Act. His Honour made no orders under s25 or s26 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Applications for leave to appeal 
       
      
    12 The Crime Commission sought leave to appeal from the decision of Shaw J given on 19 February 2003 (CA 40108/03). The defendants sought leave to cross-appeal against the quantum of the order made on 17 March 2003.  
     
      
    13 The defendants sought leave to appeal and the Crime Commission sought leave to cross-appeal from the decision of Shaw J of 17 March 2003, each on grounds to which I shall return (CA 40284/03).  
     
      
    14 Well out of time, the defendants sought leave to appeal from the decision of Greg James J of 4 April 2001 on grounds to which I shall return [CA 40285/03). 
     
      
       
      Leave to Appeal from Shaw J’s decision of 19 February 2003 
       
      
    15 It is convenient to deal first with the leave application by the Crime Commission from Shaw J’s judgment of 19 February 2003. Section 24 of the Act is found in Div 1 of Pt 3, which concerns assets forfeiture orders. The hardship order which the Court is empowered to make assumes that an assets forfeiture order has been made forfeiting to and vesting in the Crown interests in property, that the interests have been or will be disposed of by the Public Trustee in accordance with the directions of the Treasurer (s23(2)) and that the proceeds will ordinarily be paid to the Treasurer and credited to the proceeds account. Section 24(1)(a) describes the order as one entitling the dependant to be paid a specified amount out of the proceeds of sale of the interest which is necessarily an interest in property forfeited under the assets forfeiture order. 
     
      
    16 In rejecting the Crime Commission’s submission Shaw J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The policy and intention of the Act allows this court to deal with an application for relief from hardship, even when such application has not been made until after the date of the original application for forfeiture. Of course, practical difficulties which have obvious implications for the discretion of the court would arise if such a hardship application were made after the quantification of the amount of property to be forfeited or, more starkly, after the execution of any such order.” 
        
       
      
    17 The only factor favouring the Crime Commission’s argument is that part of the condition of power to make a hardship order under s24(1), which describes the dependant as the dependant of “the person who will forfeit an interest in property under the order”. If that phrase is intended to limit the Court’s powers to making an order in favour of a dependant of a person who in the future will forfeit an interest in property, it follows that that person has not yet forfeited an interest in property or, in other words, that an assets forfeiture order of that interest in property has not been made before the hardship order is made.  
     
      
    18 By contrast the legislature in s25 of the Act, which is also in Div 1 of Part 3, expressly conditions the application for exclusion of property, upon an assets forfeiture order having been applied for but not made or having been made, and, in s26, for the exclusion of the value of innocent interests, upon its being proved that it is more probable than not that a specified proportion of the value of an interest in property “that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order” is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity. Section 25(4) provides that after an assets forfeiture order has been made, an application for an exclusion order may not be made by a person unless made within six months after the assets forfeiture order took effect, without the leave of the Court. Section 26(4) is an identical provision. 
     
      
    19 The word “will” in the expression “will operate to cause hardship to any dependant” in the condition can be read as emphasising the degree of satisfaction to be reached by the Court before making an order. To adopt what was said by Atkinson J in Hector Steamship Company v VO Sovfracht, Moscow [1945] 1 KB 343 at 348, the use of the word “will” suggests “what is inevitable” at the time the order is made as distinct from what may happen. In that sense the expression is concerned with future hardship the result of an assets forfeiture order. 
     
      
    20 The literal approach to the interpretation of legislation proceeds from the proposition that the intention of parliament is to be found in what the language of the statute means in its ordinary and natural sense; see Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920) 28 CLR 129 at 161-2 per Higgins J. Where this rule leads down a path to absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the statute, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency but no further, the so-called golden rule; see Grey v Pearson (1857) 6 HLC 61 at 106; 10 ER 1216 at 1234. 
     
      
    21 The alternative purposive approach looks more to the purpose to be achieved or the mischief to be remedied by the legislation and is now an overriding consideration in light of s33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the interpretation of a provision of an Act …, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act … (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act) … shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.” 
        
       
      
    22 It is impossible to understand why the word “will” was used in the expression “dependant of the person who will forfeit an interest in property under the order”. An assets forfeiture order only operates to cause hardship to the dependant of a person if that person has forfeited an interest in property under the order. There is no relevant hardship unless an assets forfeiture order has been made. Furthermore, it may be unknown whether there is hardship or, if so, its extent until the court decides whether the assets forfeiture order will be to specified interests or a specified class of interests or all the interests of the person or whether exclusion orders should be made. It could scarcely be suggested that the section is directed only to the hypothetical case contemplated in s25(1)(a) of the dependant of a person whose interest in property might be subject to an assets forfeiture order if made. Yet that in substance is the Crime Commission’s argument. 
     
      
    23 I think it likely that the insertion of the word “will” before “operate” was intended but the insertion of the word “will” before the words “forfeit an interest in property” was a mistake. To avoid repugnancy and make legislative sense this phrase should be read as “dependant of the person who has forfeited an interest in property under the order”.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    24 The purpose of s24 was to relieve dependants from hardship caused by an assets forfeiture order. To my mind, it is absurd to suggest that that purpose should be defeated by a technicality, namely, that the dependant must apply for and obtain an order before the assets forfeiture order is made. Clumsy though the language is, it should not be read as denying a dependant the opportunity to bring proceedings for relief from hardship under s24 after an assets forfeiture order has been made. Such an arbitrary, unreasonable, pointless and ill-expressed limitation could achieve no sensible public purpose. In my opinion, the Crime Commission’s application for leave to appeal from Shaw J’s judgment should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The Crime Commission does not challenge the hardship order made in the later judgment on its merits. 
     
      
       
      Leave to Appeal from Greg James J’s decision of 4 April 2003 
       
      
    25 Part 51.4(1) of the Supreme Court Rules provides that an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal should be made by filing and serving on each necessary party within twenty-eight days, relevantly, from the date on which judgment was given. Sub-rule (6) provides that the Court of Appeal may extend time under sub-rule (1) at any time. In Gallow v Dawson (1990) 64 ALJR 458 on a summons in the High Court for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against an order made in the original jurisdiction of the Court, McHugh J at 459 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic. The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the Court of Justice to do justice between the parties: see  
        Hughes v National Trustees Executors & Agency Co of Australasia Ltd 
         [1978] VR 257 at 262. This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant. In order to determine whether the rules will work an injustice, it is necessary to have regard to the history of the proceedings, the conduct of the parties, the nature of the litigation, and the consequences for the parties of the grant or refusal of the application for extension of time: see  
        Avery v No 2 Public Service Appeal Board 
         [1973] 2 NZLR 86 at 92:  
        Jess v Scott 
         (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 194-195. When the application is for an extension of time in which to file an appeal, it is always necessary to consider the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the appeal: see  
        Burns v Grigg 
         [1967] VR 871 at 872;  
        Hughes, 
         at 263-264;  
        Mitchelson v Mitchelson 
         (1979) 24 ALR 522 at 524. It is also necessary to bear in mind in such an application that, upon the expiry of the time for appealing, the respondent has ‘a vested right to retain the judgment’ unless the application is granted:  
        Vilenius v Heinegar 
         (1962) 36 ALJR 200 at 201. It follows that, before the applicant can succeed in this application, there must be material upon which it can be satisfied that to refuse the application would constitute an injustice. As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council pointed out in  
        Ratnam v Cumarasamy 
         [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12; [1964] 3 All ER 933 at 935: 
        
       
       
        
         ‘The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion.’ “ 
        
       
      
    26 We heard argument on the leave application without separately considering whether there should be an extension of time and it is convenient first to consider the merits of the application. The five grounds of the proposed notice of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. No way were we to receive a fair trial that day. At the time appearing [sic] before Justice Greg James there was an outstanding Reversal of Plea in the District Court that had to be dealt with. It was unfair that the unrepresented respondents would be required to enter evidence in this court before the criminal matter had been resolved. By not allowing us an adjournment, His Honour Justice James forced us into a Kangaroo Court. 
        
       
       
        
        2. I’d also be relying on the transcripts of Justice Carruthers of the 11 September 2000 whom [sic] agrees with Mr Temby on two issues as to why our matter could not proceed that day. 
        
       
       
        
        3. We realize that there is a time issue on this appeal. At the time we were not informed adequately on the correct appeal procedure. We believe this had been done. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Justice James predetermined the outcome of the evidence that he based his decision on. The tapes that his honour heard were not to be admitted or used as evidence against us, the ruling by his Honour Woods during our criminal trial. This is why his Honour should have awaited the outcome of the criminal proceedings first, as he has now made the wrong decision based on evidence that he should have never seen or heard. 
        
       
       
        
        5. It was wrong of his Honour to try and force us into the stand to give evidence. We had to make a decision. To give our evidence before the criminal trial against the wishes of our criminal counsel or choose to say nothing to safe guard the criminal proceedings but then have all our assets forfeited. Or we could get in the stand to try and save our belongings but in the process maybe ruin our chances at District Court, or possibly both trials. Everybody is entitled to a fair trial. No one should have to compromise one trial over another.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    27 In part the appeal is directed against the judgment given by Greg James J on 4 April 2001 refusing the defendants’ application for an adjournment. In that judgment his Honour observed that the proceedings had been adjourned to 4 April 2001 from the day on which the hearing had been listed to proceed. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “2 By way of background, I note the judgment published on Monday adjourning the matter to enable the defendants a last opportunity to put on some evidence contesting the proposition that they have been engaged in serious crime related activity within the past six years. That opportunity has not been availed of. Further, in trenchant discussion of the renewal of the adjournment application by the defendants’ counsel this morning, I made it clear that the issue with which I was concerned was whether or not the defendants were intending to seek to contest the issue of whether they had been engaged in serious crime related activity. But no real matter was put forward to suggest a basis of contest other than that they opposed the making of the forfeiture order. 
        
       
       
        
        3 They contend their property was lawfully obtained, a matter not going to the making of a forfeiture order, but to the prospects of exclusion of that property from the operation of that order. They contend that their counsel has been late briefed, and only briefed on the adjournment application, rather than on the substance of the application and that the matter is, on their part, unprepared. 
        
       
       
        
        4 I should, however, note that I drew the attention of both counsel to the affidavits of the defendants and, in particular, Part 5 of each affidavit, by which each defendant asserted that they were innocent of the criminal charges led against them and upon which the plaintiff’s case relies and further asserted that the criminal case against them ‘has been prepared corruptly’. 
        
       
       
        
        5 They particularise, in that regard, that corrupt police officers had sought to utilise Mr Kelly to sell drugs for them and that he had refused to co-operate, that they had used an informant allegedly to buy drugs from him, but he had not sold drugs but prawns in lieu. 
        
       
       
        
        6 Further, that the informant, although he had provided evidence of the drug selling, had been threatened by corrupt police officers to change his statements and had now provided a new statement to an independent police officer that he had never purchased drugs from Mr Kelly, but had only purchased prawns. 
        
       
       
        
        7 I have further been informed that it is sought by the defendants to withdraw the pleas that they had entered to the indictments preferred against them in the District Court, albeit that those withdrawals appear to have been first contemplated at a time following the confirmation of the pleas, notwithstanding the retraction of the informant’s statements, or so I am informed by Senior Counsel for the New South Wales Crime Commission. 
        
       
       
        
        8 Whether the pleas are withdrawn or not, whatever be the fate of the criminal proceedings, those proceedings do not determine what happens in these proceedings although, of course, should there be a conviction it becomes rather difficult for the defendants to assert that a case of their being involved in serious crime related activities could not be established beyond the balance of probabilities, and what evidence they might give in these proceedings might well be available for use in the criminal proceedings, as I pointed out during the argument. 
        
       
       
        
        9 But these proceedings simply turn on whether the Commission on the evidence in these proceedings satisfies me on the balance of probabilities that the defendants have been engaged in serious crime related activity. Since the affidavit material filed appeared to be the only material potentially available for the defendants notwithstanding three opportunities provided by the Court for material to be filed, I inquired of counsel for the defendants as to whether it was intended that those affidavits would be read, and the deponents made available for cross-examination. I was told it was not intended that either of those events would occur. 
        
       
       
        
        10 That would leave the case for the Commission uncontradicted. In effect, that would leave the position as being that no opposition of an evidentiary nature is presented to the making of the orders as sought. I pointed out to counsel for the defendants that the lack of a basis for opposition to the making of the orders would suggest there was no rational basis for an adjournment. Nothing has been forthcoming to suggest any other rational basis for an adjournment in the light of that observation. In the circumstances, there seems no basis on which the present proceedings should not be heard.” 
        
       
      
    28 Accordingly, Greg James J refused the application for adjournment and the matter proceeded on that day and the orders already referred to were made. In his judgment of that day on the Crime Commission’s claim for an assets forfeiture order, after referring to the adjournment applications, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        3 It is to be noted that the defendants have sought to withdraw pleas of guilty entered by them in the District Court to charges of supplying an indictable quantity of amphetamines. Those pleas have not been withdrawn, and nor has the Court yet heard an application to withdraw the pleas. At present they stand as admissions of the most solemn kind, of all matters of fact and law, necessary to support convictions on the charges against them: see  
        Regina v Chiron 
         (1980) 1 NSWLR 218. 
        
       
       
        
        4 Nonetheless, because there is an application to withdraw the pleas, even though as I will show, proceedings under the  
        Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
         1990 are not conviction based, and because there is in support of that application, statements which have been tendered to me from a man who one might regard as the instrument or purchaser of drugs in what might be referred to as sting operations, recanting from his initial accounts of the defendants' drug dealing, I will accord to those pleas less significance and weight than I would otherwise, to the extent that, for the purposes of this decision, and having regard to the fact that the defendants became unrepresented when I declined the adjournment, notwithstanding the powerful submissions of Mr Temby, QC for the Crime Commission to the contrary, I will disregard the pleas. 
        
       
       
        
        5 Further, I will disregard the recantation statements of the person Parker as affecting the evidence contained in his affidavit, accepting insofar as it goes to show that both in his recantation and in chief, he is personally a person who I consider to be of no credit whatsoever, so that I would reject the evidence that he gave, unless it is confirmed or supported otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        6 In this case, however, having had regard to the other evidence on its own, and considering this as though it were a circumstantial evidence case, as opposed to a case relying on the direct evidence of Parker, the proof not only exceeds all that is necessary in law to prove the assertions of the Crime Commission as to the defendants having engaged in the process of drug supply during the month preceding 3 April 1998, but also having engaged in actual transactions involving indictable quantities on 3 April and 6 April of that year. 
        
       
       
        
        7 So it is when one examines the evidence of the police officers, whose evidence was unchallenged and who it was not sought be called for cross-examination, one finds established the purchases by Parker, whether his evidence is given any significance on that question or not. 
        
       
       
        
        8 The following evidence establishes the transactions on which the plaintiff relies. The police officers observed Parker in his journeys to and from the premises of the defendant, Kelly. On at least one occasion they watched and observed small envelopes containing white powder being passed by the defendants to Parker. Parker then produced those envelopes to the police officers. A clear chain of possession shows that what was contained in those envelopes by way of white powder was an indictable quantity of the drug. 
        
       
       
        
        9 The defendants have not given evidence before me. They have filed affidavits denying any dealing in the drugs. When they were represented on the adjournment application, I was informed that those affidavits would not be read and that the defendants would not give evidence personally. After terminating their lawyer's retainer, they have defended the proceedings brought by the Crime Commission. In address, Ms Rangi, on behalf of herself and her husband, Mr Kelly, has denied dealing in, or ever selling any drug by either of them. None of the defendants was willing to give evidence, however. 
        
       
       
        
        10 I can give no weight to that denial because it is not in evidence and so many opportunities have been given to those defendants during the progress of the adjournment applications and on two prior occasions to put on evidence of their denials, and to submit themselves to cross-examination.” 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour went on to refer to evidence given by several police officers about dealings between the defendant Kelly and the informant in April 1998 and to some conversations on tapes and concluded that he was required by s22(2) to make an assets forfeiture order, it not being necessary for a finding that a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity had taken place, to be based upon a particular offence, or as to any particular quantity. His Honour also made a proceeds assessment order under s27.  
     
      
    30 On 9 November 2001 his Honour Judge Coorey in the District Court dealt with the first and second defendants’ applications to withdraw pleas of guilty in the matters relating to the supply of methylamphetamines. His Honour heard evidence from the two defendants and concluded, on the balance of probabilities in the exercise of his discretion, that both defendants had satisfied the onus of showing that a miscarriage of justice would occur if they were denied leave to withdraw their pleas of guilty. Accordingly, his Honour gave such leave. 
     
      
    31 The trial of the first two defendants on three counts relating to the alleged supply of methylamphetamines in 1998 came before his Honour Judge Woods QC and a jury. On 25 July 2002 during the course of cross-examination by counsel for one of the defendants of an informant known as “Mr Brown”, an application was made that the witness’s evidence should be withdrawn from the jury on the basis that he was not a competent witness. The witness had been used by police as a controlled agent strapped up with a listening device and asked to enter premises occupied by the two accused for the purpose of stimulating possible evidence of the supply of drugs. His Honour observed that this was a well-known and normally uncontroversial way of proceeding in this area of law enforcement. “However, the difficulty arises because the witness, Mr Brown, has demonstrated himself to be not merely a person with a long criminal history, but to have a significant history of mental illness.” Later his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am bemused about the meaning of much of this man’s evidence, but it seems to me on the balance of probabilities that significant parts of his evidence are motivated by irrational fears produced by a chronic condition or paranoia relating to his tragically long standing poly-drug abuse and paranoid schizophrenia. His evidence, it seems to me, is dangerously irrational.” 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour reached the conclusion that the witness was incompetent within the terms of s13 of the Evidence Act 1995 and decided to instruct the jury that the evidence that he had given was withdrawn from their consideration in the trial and so ordered. 
     
      
    33 On 30 July 2002 Judge Woods said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An indictment was before me last week. That indictment, which was tried before me between 17 July and 25 July, contained as counts two and three what are now counts one and two of the present indictment. There was a verdict of not guilty on count one of the previous indictment and on one view that indictment might still be said to be before me since the jury were discharged as to that indictment, but for more abundant caution, at the instance both of the Crown and the defence, a new indictment is presented. The relevance of that is that there has been considerable argument over the last several days at the bar table as to the admissibility in the trial on what is now the present indictment of evidence generated by the use of a person having the pseudonym Brown in a controlled operation organised by police culminating in the arrest of the accused for these charges.” 
        
       
      
    34 Counsel for the defendants before Judge Woods contended that the evidence brought into existence by the controlled operation should be excluded under s138 of the Evidence Act, as improperly or illegally obtained, or under s137, as prejudicial evidence, or both. His Honour found that the police involved in the controlled operation were aware that Mr Brown, who was proposed as a controlled agent, was mentally disturbed. Yet when the application was made for a controlled operation authority to the Deputy Commissioner of Police nothing was put to the Deputy Commissioner about Mr Brown’s history of mental stability. In his Honour’s view it should have been. This gave rise to an impropriety which affected the coming into existence of the subject evidence and was an impropriety under s138(1)(b) of the Evidence Act. Taking account of a number of matters, his Honour concluded that under s138(1) the evidence flowing from the use of Mr Brown in the controlled operation should not be admitted. His Honour also concluded that s137 required that he exclude the evidence. At the end of his reasons, Judge Woods said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should make it clear that in reaching this conclusion I am not attributing to the police involved any personal moral blame. In my view the choice of Brown as a controlled agent is simply an error of judgment which has the unfortunate outcome of vitiating the use at trial of evidence generated by his involvement. This is no more a matter of moral blame than it is for the police involved in the earlier proceedings where it seems the use of a particular police undercover operative vitiated a proposed trial as a result of something which arose out of the Police Royal Commission. As I say, the evidence will be excluded.” 
        
       
      
    35 As a result of these rulings the prosecution case collapsed and the two defendants were acquitted. Perhaps understandably the defendants rely upon their acquittal and the rejection of a substantial part of the prosecution’s evidentiary case to undermine the conclusion that Greg James J reached for making assets forfeiture orders. Furthermore, implicitly they claim that this would not have happened had the civil proceedings been adjourned to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    36 It has been authoritatively decided in this Court that the felony-tort rule, which entitled a party in civil proceedings, founded upon a cause of action that involved facts constituting a felony, to obtain a stay of the proceedings until the felony was prosecuted, has been abandoned in this country; see Griffin v Sogelease Australia Ltd [2002] NSWCA 421. To quote from the decision of Wootten J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 6 ACLR 202 at 207: 
     
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules  
        merely 
         because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    37 In his reasons for judgment Greg James J said he considered the witness Parker (Mr Brown) to be of no credit whatsoever and rejected the evidence that he gave unless confirmed or supported otherwise. He said that having had regard to other evidence on its own and considering this as though it were a circumstantial evidence case, the proof not only exceeded all that was necessary in law to prove the assertions of the Crime Commission as to the defendants having engaged in the process of drug supply during the month preceding 3 April 1998 but also having engaged in actual transactions involving indictable quantities on 3 April and 6 April 1998. This followed examination of the evidence of the police officers, which, as his Honour observed, was unchallenged. The police officers were not required for cross-examination. Their evidence established the purchases by Parker. His Honour carefully reviewed that evidence. Whatever may have been the constraints the defendants felt under about giving evidence, whether those constraints were actual or perceived, it is significant that they did not attempt to cross-examine the police witnesses. His Honour did say that he could give no weight to the defendants’ denial, in the course of address, of dealing in or ever selling any drug, because it was not in evidence and so many opportunities had been given to those defendants during the progress of the adjournment applications and on two prior occasions to put on evidence of their denials and to submit themselves to cross-examination.  
     
      
    38 The second defendant, Glenda Rangi, who put submissions on her own behalf and on behalf of her husband and mother, claimed that the defendants were unaware of s128 of the Evidence Act, which applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against an Australian law (subs (2)). Subject to subs (5) if the Court finds there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the Court is not to require the witness to give that particular evidence and is to inform the witness (subs (2)): 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that he or she need not give the evidence, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that, if he or she gives the evidence, the court will give a certificate under the section, and  
        
       
       
        
        (c) of the effect of such a certificate.  
        
       
      
    39 If the witness gives the evidence, the court is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under the section in respect of the evidence (subs (3)). If the court is satisfied that the evidence concerned may tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against an Australian law and the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence, the court may require the witness to give the evidence (subs (5)). If the court so requires, it is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under the section in respect of the evidence (sub (6)). In any proceeding in a New South Wales court, evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under the section has been given cannot be used against the person other than in criminal proceedings in respect of the falsity of the evidence (subs (7)).  
     
      
    40 Ms Rangi referred us to s132 of the Evidence Act. That section provides that if it appears to the court that a witness or a party may have grounds for making an application or objection under a provision of Pt 3.10, in which is found s128, “the court must satisfy itself that the witness or party is aware of the effect of that provision.” Ms Rangi claimed from the bar table that Greg James J had an obligation under s132 to advert to the procedure available under s128 but had not done so. 
     
      
    41 The defendants did not put on any evidence to support the case that they were unaware of the provisions of s128 or that this section was not brought to their attention. On the application for adjournment on 4 April 2001 the defendants were represented by counsel. They put on affidavits in which each asserted they were innocent of the criminal charges against them upon which the Crime Commission’s case relied. Greg James J observed that during the argument he pointed out that evidence given in the proceedings might well be available for use in the criminal proceedings. He inquired of counsel for the defendants as to whether it was intended that the affidavits would be read and that the deponents made available for cross-examination and was told that it was not intended that either of those events would occur.  
     
      
    42 There would be absolutely no reason for Greg James J to suppose that, before making the decision neither to read the affidavits nor to give oral evidence, the defendants had not discussed this course at length with their counsel and been advised of the procedure available under s128. What is particularly telling in this regard is the failure to seek to cross-examine those witnesses who were called by the Crime Commission. Despite the protests of Ms Rangi, the only inference is that on the hearing before Greg James J the defendants accepted or, at least, had decided not to attempt to contradict, the Crime Commission evidence by cross-examination or by giving evidence themselves. In my opinion, although the allegations made about non-compliance with s132 of the Evidence Act cause some concern, I am satisfied they have no substance. 
     
      
    43 What is critical is that Greg James J was bound to make an assets forfeiture order if he found it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time more than six years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity; s22(2). His Honour was not precluded from finding the relevant serious crime related activity even if by then the defendants had been tried and acquitted: s6(1). What I have said deals with ground 1. 
     
      
    44 The Crime Commission in its submissions pointed out that in his judgment of 17 March 2003 Shaw J re-visited the evidence relating to serious criminal activity and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “22 On the evidence, and having regard to the prior findings of Grey James J, I am compelled to find that the statutory pre-requisites have been met and that I am required to make a proceeds assessment order against the defendants. I am particularly influenced by the provisions of s27(3) to the effect that the Court does not require, in determining whether the prerequisites have been met, the establishment of a particular offence or a finding as to any particular quantity involved. The Court does not require evidence of any conviction of a relevant offence. This is legislation which may have drastic effects, but the Court is obliged to act in accordance with it.” 
        
       
      
    45 The second ground of appeal is directed to part of the transcript before Carruthers AJ on 11 September 2000 in which he agreed with Mr Temby QC, who was appearing for the Crime Commission, on two issues as to why the matter could not proceed on that day. One was that the forfeiture application was based upon proof of serious crime related activities and the Crime Commission placed considerable reliance upon pleas of guilty, which the first and second defendants were then seeking to withdraw. It was said that it seemed convenient to await the outcome of that application to see what significance, if any, the pleas were to have. Secondly Mr Temby said that the Crime Commission did not have the affidavit material needed to enable it to proceed otherwise than on the basis of pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    46 By the time the application for an assets forfeiture order came before Greg James J in April 2001, the applications for leave to withdraw the guilty pleas still had not been heard but the evidence required for a fuller consideration of the application for assets forfeiture orders had been prepared and was put before Greg James J and not challenged by the defendants. There is, with respect, nothing in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    47 Ground 3 relates, apparently, to the failure of those advising the defendants adequately to inform them about the correct appeal procedure. This is a matter taken up in whether or not an extension of time should be granted. In any event, it was not supported by evidence. 
     
      
    48 Ground 4 relates to the tapes admitted by Greg James J and then subsequently rejected by Judge Woods. The Crime Commission pointed out correctly that Greg James J was not bound to reject the tapes on the grounds which later found favour with Judge Woods. The ground, therefore, has no merit. 
     
      
    49 As I have already pointed out, the fifth ground relates to the civil proceedings taking place before the criminal proceedings. In this case there was no legal impediment to this sequence. In particular, it did not make the civil proceedings unfair. It was a matter for the defendants whether or not they would give evidence. They chose not to give evidence. Furthermore, they chose not to cross-examine any of the witnesses relied upon by the Crime Commission. Those were decisions which, as the ground itself makes plain, were made with the advice of counsel. 
     
      
    50 In my opinion the appeal as formulated in the draft notice of appeal against the decision of Greg James J would be bound to fail. In the circumstances, I would extend time for the making of the application for leave to appeal up to and including the day on which the application was filed in Court but I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      The defendants’ application for leave to appeal against the decision of Shaw J of 17 March 2003 and the Crime Commission’s application for leave to cross-appeal. 
       
      
    51 It is convenient to deal first with the Crime Commission’s cross-appeal. In his judgment, Shaw J rejected each of three methods advanced by the Crime Commission, based on evidence from a financial analyst, Mr Robert Davis, for assessing the amount of money or other consideration the defendants derived from their illegal activities in the period from 13 February 1993 to 12 February 1999.  
     
      
    52 Section 27(1) of the Act required the Court to assess the value of the proceeds derived from the illegal activity or illegal activities of the person that took place not more than six years before the making of the application of the order. It is important to observe that the value to be assessed was the value of the proceeds and not some “net” figure in the nature of the profit from such activities. The Court must recognise that it is not likely that the Crime Commission would be able meticulously to prove a particular quantum representing those proceeds. There are unlikely to be any accurate books or records of drug sales. In their absence it is appropriate to adopt a rough and ready approach; see R v Fagher (1989) 16 NSWLR 67 at 80, a case to which Shaw J referred, concerned with analogous legislation: the Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act 1985.  
     
      
    53 The Crime Commission accepted that it was open on the evidence for his Honour to reject the evidence supporting the three methods put forward but submitted that his language indicated that he had simply rejected the methodology without giving reasons for doing so. Shaw J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “52 The methods of assessment adopted by the plaintiff were as follows. First, the court could determine from four known sales of illegal drugs (two in 1995 to Mr Clarke and two in 1998 to Mr Parker) a series of daily transactions to multiple numbers of purchasers each at $200 per supply. At two sales per day over the period from 1993 to 1998 the plaintiff submits the proceeds would amount to $1,095,000 for Ms Rangi and $1,018,958.33 for Mr Kelly. 
        
       
       
        
        53 This method of assessment must be rejected. There is no simple evidence upon which the Court can be persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the defendants were engaged in the regular sale of illegal drugs in the order of those amounts. The observations of former police officers that members of the public would visit the defendants do not amount to proof of drug sales.  
        
       
       
        
        54 The second method of assessment urged by the NSWCC was to receive evidence of a diminution of the use of the needle exchange program at Boggabri District Hospital following a search of the defendants’ premises as indicative of the supply of illegal drugs by the defendants. Extrapolation of these figures generates figures of $1,125,000 for Ms Rangi and $1,031,250 for Mr Kelly.  
        
       
       
        
        55 This method of assessment must be rejected. There is plainly no evidence upon which the Court can proceed according to this methodology. 
        
       
       
        
        56 The third method offered by the NSWCC was to take the profits asserted by Mr Kelly on the seafood business as actually derived from the sale of illegal drugs. According to this method the NSWCC offers an assessment of $1,560,000 for Ms Rangi and $1,451,666,67 for Mr Kelly.  
        
       
       
        
        57 This method must similarly be rejected. Though the plaintiff drew some comfort for the fact that each method generated a similar figure the Court cannot rely on either method of assessment offered as reliable and based on actual evidence. Accordingly I am required to undertake my own assessment of the profits generated by the defendants, taking into account money acquired from Mr and Mrs Rangi and profits derived from the seafood business.” 
        
       
      
    54 With due respect this passage reveals that his Honour was not persuaded that the proceeds thrown up by such calculations from the limited bases suggested were supported by evidence. His Honour said quite simply he was not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the defendants were engaged in the regular sale of illegal drugs in the order of those amounts. Observations by police officers that members of the public would visit the defendants did not amount to proof of drug sales nor did a diminution of the use of the needle exchange programme at the local hospital or profits asserted to have been made from the seafood business. Whatever may have been the merits of each of the methods in other circumstances, the evidence was, in the opinion of Shaw J, insufficient to demonstrate the result on the balance of probabilities. No ground is shown for this Court to interfere with those findings of fact. 
     
      
    55 Accordingly, the trial Judge was required to undertake his own assessment. He referred to what he described as the final method of assessment asserted by the Crime Commission, namely to compare the income generated by the defendants against their expenditure. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “58 … Mr Davis concludes that Mr Kelly and Ms Rangi spent $161,782 more than they earned from 1993 to 1998. The plaintiff asserts that this figure represents the minimum figure for net profits since it assumes that there was no other expenditure and that drug sales account only for this deficit and were not responsible for generating a greater income. 
        
       
       
        
        59 Mr Davis gave this evidence about the amounts of expenditure for the seafood business according to receipts and documents provided to him. He concludes that the business had an approximate expenditure of $12,000 based on those documents. Mr Davis conceded that if further invoices existed, his figures would need to be adjusted. 
        
       
       
        
        60 In my opinion the most rigorous and methodologically correct evidence as to the comparison between the legitimate income of the defendants and known expenditure is to be obtained from the affidavit of Mr Robert Davis. Although the applicant suggests that that constitutes an ' 
        underestimate 
        ', nevertheless, it seems to me that is the appropriate basis upon which the judgment and orders should be made and the conclusion of Mr Davis is that there was a deficit (that is a contrast between legitimate and illegitimate earnings) of $161,782.  
         
        
       
       
        
        61 The plaintiff contends that this figure is the ' 
        absolute minimum 
        ' of net profits from drug sales. The plaintiff submits this figure makes a number of assumptions favourable to the defendants. Nonetheless I feel more confident in basing an assessment on expert analysis of the financial position of the defendants rather than some broad and perhaps excessive figure which might do injustice to the dependants. The applicant suggests that that figure should be doubled, as I understand it, because two people were involved. I do not regard that as compelling or even persuasive. Mr Davis does not suggest that the estimated deficit should be doubled in relation to an assessment of gross drug proceeds and therefore I would accord weight to his 'bottom line' figure.  
         
        
       
       
        
        62 The question then arises as to whether the figure calculated by Mr Davis should be discounted or ameliorated on any basis in accordance with to the statutory regime [sic]. 
        
       
       
        
        63 Mr Temby, QC, fairly conceded for the NSWCC, that it is distinctly possible that monies came in from New Zealand as a result of Ms Rangi's parents' contribution to the family in New South Wales.  
        
       
       
        
        64 Mr Davis has given evidence as to the amount of money that could have been brought into the country during the trips made by Mr and Mrs Rangi (and received by Mr Kelly and Ms Rangi on trips taken to New Zealand) according to the evidence of Mr Rangi before the Registrar. Mr Davis deposed that such figure amounts to a maximum of $58,090. In a comprehensive analysis of the possible amounts of money imported into Australia by Mr and Mrs Rangi from New Zealand Mr Davis' evidence reveals that at times Mr Kelly and Ms Rangi were up to $23,220 out of pocket though making cash transactions of up to $10,000 at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        65 I accept Mrs Rangi's evidence (the mother of the second defendant) that some monies were brought in, although I acknowledge the difficulties arising from the incapacity of her husband (on medical grounds, accepted by all parties) to give evidence before this Court. Doing the best I can, I think the calculations in relation to money which came in from New Zealand relatives result in a figure of $50,000 and therefore this should be deducted from the figure of confiscation I have otherwise indicated.  
        
       
       
        
        66 In addition, I think that it is undoubted that some profits were raised from the fish mongering business although it is my view that the defendants' evidence as to the quantum of those profits is grossly exaggerated. In the inflation of figures from $1,000 per week profit to $10,000 it is difficult to assess a proper figure. The Court is willing to give weight to the evidence of Mr Evans that he would could generate approximately 25 per cent profit on expenditure. Taking an expenditure of approximately $12,000 the Court will consider a profit from the seafood business in the amount of $4,000 
        .  
        Accordingly, I would deduct $4,000 from the figure as being a rough and ready estimate of the amount that might have been earned form the sale of fish and prawns. 
        
       
       
        
        67 Thus, the Court can make an assessment that the amount of income generated by the defendants from criminal related activity in the amount of $96,000.” 
        
       
      
    56 The Crime Commission attacks this conclusion in two ways. First it claims that the figure produced is a net figure or, as it were, profit from the sale of drugs and takes no account of what the “proceeds” of those sales were. In a sense this is true but Mr Singleton, who appeared for the Crime Commission, conceded that no evidence was given to indicate the sale price of the drugs allegedly traded or the percentage that the net profit could be expected to be of the total sales receipts. Such evidence would have been available to the Crime Commission but was not called. His Honour had no choice but to assess the value of the proceeds derived from illegal activity on the material presented by the Crime Commission. His Honour acknowledged that this represented the minimum figure for net profits. In my opinion, this ground of appeal would have no prospect of success.  
     
      
    57 Finally the Crime Commission pointed out that there was a mathematical error in the result his Honour reached namely, the amount of $96,000. According to his Honour’s reasons the figure should have been $161,782 less $54,000 (the sum of $50,000 which came from New Zealand and $4,000 the estimate of the amount that might have been earned from the sale of fish and prawns). This produces, and in this the Crime Commission seems to be right, a total of $107,782. 
     
      
    58 In regard to this judgment the defendants’ application for leave to appeal was directed to Mr Davies’ calculation of receipts from the seafood run at $12,000 outlay. Further, it was said that the evidence of a witness, Barry Norris, should have been before the trial Judge. During an examination before a Deputy Registrar he is said to have given evidence that he had brought in some $25,000 from New Zealand which should have been added to the allowance of $50,000 for imported money. The defendants did not press matters set out in par 4 of their document headed “Summary of grounds for Justice Shaw”.  
     
      
    59 In support of the defendants’ argument we were referred to the transcript of Mr Norris’s evidence before the Deputy Registrar and to material placed before Shaw J which indicated that all the records of the seafood business had been seized by the Crime Commission and were not available to the defendants in support of their case. They also referred to material in Council records and taxation records pointing to the longevity of the seafood business. 
     
      
    60 The Crime Commission submitted that Shaw J reached the $4,000 figure in the following way: 
     
      
    · He accepted that the defendants had produced to Mr Davis approximately $12,000 worth of receipts for their expenditure on seafood (ie their business inputs). 
     
      
    · He accepted evidence from another seafood seller in the relevant district, Leonard (Bert) Evans, that he could make a 25 to 30 per cent profit on selling seafood. 
     
      
    · He applied a profit rate of 25 per cent to the known $12,000 outlay producing a profit of $4,000. 
     
      
    61 His Honour was satisfied the defendants had grossed $16,000 from selling seafood and found not an $8,000 loss but a $4,000 profit. He allowed the defendants the benefit of that amount in calculating what they must have derived from illegal activities in order to fund their known expenditure. This demonstrates that the particular error relied upon has no substance. The defendants argued before us that the business of Mr Evans at the time he gave evidence was not comparable and was less profitable than the defendants’ business. But on the evidence before Shaw J, where no doubt these arguments were advanced, there is nothing to suggest that the method adopted by the trial Judge was erroneous in the way suggested. 
     
      
    62 In the hearing before Shaw J the defendants were represented by counsel. Mr Temby QC, who appeared for the Crime Commission, tendered the examination transcripts of each of the defendants and George Rangi, Glenda’s father. He said on 11 February 2003 (page 24 of the transcript): 
     
      
       
        
        “There was one other examinee, a man named Norris. There has been nothing brought forward concerning him by way of affidavit material from the other side. They are not relying upon him and, accordingly, I do not need to. I am not tendering that small part of the examination transcript which relates to Norris which, for my learned friend’s benefit, is from pages 85 to 97 inclusive of the examination on 7 May 2001.” 
        
       
      
    63 On 27 March 2003 Mr Temby said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My present purpose is to say that there is no non-family evidence as to the importation of money and there is little with respect to seafood evidence and nothing which goes beyond what the Commission suggests that the court will accept, that there was a little seafood selling for a confined period in 1996. 
        
       
       
        
        So far as the lack of supporting evidence is concerned, it is a notable fact that a Barry Norris, who is a cousin of Mr George Rangi, is said to have brought money into the country from New Zealand on behalf of Mr George Rangi, has not been called to give evidence. He is referred to quite extensively in the examination transcripts of George Rangi and to an extent Lillian Rangi and also Glenda Rangi, but he has not been brought to court to support the evidence which has been given in that respect. He lives here in Sydney and the evidence discloses that. He is an available witness who has not been called and a comment is available and of course made, that there has to be reasons for that. You are left only with the evidence that is given by the Rangis.” 
        
       
      
    64 Later on 27 February 2003 (transcript 281) Mr Healey, who appeared for the defendants, in the course of submissions said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Might I digress for a moment. There was no evidence brought by Mr Norris in relation to the bringing of monies into Australia. The transcript of the hearing before the Registrar on 7 May 1999 commences at page 85.” 
        
       
      
    65 Mr Temby said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not in evidence. It didn’t include the transcript of Mr Norris’ evidence. It is not before you.” 
        
       
      
    66 Mr Healey then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I beg your pardon, I thought the whole of the transcript was before you. That is my mistake if that is the case. I have not checked that. If that be the case that would be a gross unfairness because there is an explanation provided and that should be before you.” 
        
       
      
    67 The Judge said he would entertain an application to re-open. Mr Healey asked if he could leave that to the end. No such application was made and the trial Judge reserved his decision on 27 February 2003. 
     
      
    68 I am not persuaded that on the evidence before the trial Judge there was any error in the findings he made nor am I persuaded that the defendants were denied any opportunity to put before the Court any evidence they wished to rely upon. 
     
      
    69 I am not persuaded that the projected appeal by the defendants against the judgment of Shaw J of 17 March 2003 had any real prospects of success and would accordingly reject the application for leave to appeal.  
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    70 The overall result is that the Crime Commission has succeeded in demonstrating a relatively small error in the calculation made by Shaw J in assessing the value of the proceeds derived from the illegal activities pursuant to s27 of the Act. We were informed that the Crime Commission applied to the Judge to correct this error but he decided not to do so. While ordinarily demonstration of such an error might not attract leave, in the circumstance that it was brought to the attention of the trial Judge and in the circumstance of the ventilation of all issues between the parties in this Court on the basis that there be a concurrent hearing of the leave applications and any appeal if leave was granted, I think it appropriate that the Crime Commission be granted leave to cross-appeal on that limited ground and that the appeal be upheld and the value of the proceeds adjusted accordingly. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    71 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      CA 40108/03

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 FOSTER AJA: I will ask Mr Justice Grove to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Sides DCJ at Campbelltown District Court. The applicant had pleaded guilty before a magistrate to two charges of robbery in company and had been committed for sentence. The maximum prescribed penalty for such offence is imprisonment for twenty years. The sentencing judge was also asked to take into account on sentence three offences on a Form 1 being offences of larceny, entering enclosed lands, and self administering a prohibited drug respectively.  
     
      
    3 The learned sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years and fixed a non-parole period of eighteen months, ordering the release of the applicant to parole upon the expiry of the non-parole period. It might be presumed that this term was intended to be imposed in respect of each charge with the sentences to be served concurrently. The Form 1 offences were taken into account but his Honour expressly indicated that the sentence imposed was not extended by reason of those offences having regard to his conclusion that none of them would have merited a custodial sentence.  
     
      
    4 A co-offender Konrad Bordakiawicz appeared for sentence with the applicant on the counts of robbery in company. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years accompanied by a direction that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. Again, it might be taken sentence was imposed in respect of each charge and that the sentences be served concurrently. The sole ground of appeal asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity of the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon his co-offender.  
     
      
    5 On Saturday 15 June 2002 the offenders entered Glen Street Park at Eastwood where they encountered three fourteen year old boys. Bordakiawicz said to one of them “What’s in your pocket?” And he then “patted down” the trousers of the boy and removed his wallet and mobile phone. He took $5 from the wallet and the sim card from the phone, returning the wallet to this victim. The applicant then said to another of the boys “Empty out your pockets, come on, I am asking you nicely”. The applicant then started pushing this boy with both hands, as a result of which he removed a mobile phone from his pocket and gave this to the applicant. The offenders then left the park. 
     
      
    6 At about 6.15 pm that evening police observed the applicant speaking to a person called Holmes outside Eastwood Railway Station. There was an extant condition of bail requiring the applicant not to associate with the man Holmes. The applicant was told to empty his pockets and he produced the telephone stolen earlier in the afternoon. At interview later in a police station the applicant admitted participating in the robberies. The applicant gave to police information concerning the co-offender whom he knew as “Chad” and this information enabled Bordakiawicz to be identified and arrested in due course.  
     
      
    7 In his remarks on sentence the learned judge made express reference to his consciousness of the issue of parity between the co-offenders. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no basis, in my view, to distinguish between the criminality of the two offenders, nor is there a basis to distinguish between them on the question of leniency to be given for their pleas of guilty. However, their subjective circumstances are different.” 
        
       
      
    8 He noted that whilst both offenders were young, the applicant was about twelve months older. Bordakiawicz had no prior convictions. The applicant had been convicted at Ryde Local Court on 30 November 2001 of driving with a low range of the prescribed concentration of alcohol; custody of a knife in a school; larceny to the value of less than $2,000 and taking and driving a conveyance without consent of the owner. He was ordered to pay fines, serve 150 hours community service and placed upon recognizance for two years under the supervision of the Probation Service. On 10 January 2002 at Fairfield Local Court he was fined on each of three charges respectively for possessing a prohibited drug, larceny to a value of less than $2,000 and goods in custody reasonably suspected of having been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. On 16 April 2002 at Burwood Local Court he was fined for driving whilst disqualified. It follows that at the time of these offences the applicant was subject to current recognizance and also, as I have mentioned, to bail conditions.  
     
      
    9 Finally, as a matter of discrimination between the offenders, his Honour expressly found that the prospects of rehabilitation of Bordakiawicz were excellent and much better than those of the applicant. He expressly found that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation could not be “viewed as good”. His reasons for this conclusion were stated to include:  
     
      
       
      (a) the content of a psychologist’s report;  
       
      (b) the prior convictions; 
       
      (c) the failure to complete the community service order; 
       
      (d) his poor response to supervision whilst on the bond; 
      
     and 
     
      
      (e) the fact that he breached bail in the commission of the current offences. 
       
      
    10 His Honour’s findings were amply supported by the evidence. A Probation and Parole Service report was unfavourable. It noted that as regards the community service order the applicant was dismissed from a community service agency for general misconduct and attending the work site apparently under the influence of marijuana and alcohol. The report also noted that he failed to appear for work assigned and that an application for revocation had been made, following which there was a failure to appear before court and the order for community service revoked and a warrant issued. His Honour’s assessment of poor rehabilitation prospects was further confirmed by the inclusion in the report of the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given Mr Jin’s reoffending, his evasive and minimal response to supervision on his current bond and his failure to appear as requested during the assessment process, he is considered unsuitable for further supervision with this Service.” 
        
       
      
    11 Submissions on behalf of the applicant asserted that there were significant matters in his favour which were not present in the case of the co-offender. The applicant intended to return the mobile telephone which he had taken and this was expressly found in his favour by the sentencing judge. Nor did his Honour overlook the assistance rendered to authority in enabling the identification of the co-offender. The applicant has also spent four days in custody in respect of these charges before being released to bail, which was not the situation in the case of Bordakiawicz. 
     
      
    12 The principles to be applied when a ground such as the present is advanced have been stated authoritatively in Lowe v The Queen 1984 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen 1997 189 CLR 295 and do not require restatement. As has been noted, whilst both offenders received identical head sentences, the non parole period specified for Bordakiawicz was in fact longer than that specified for the applicant, although the former was to serve the non-parole period by way of periodic detention. None of his Honour’s findings have been shown to be erroneous. Nor has his Honour, as can be deduced from his remarks on sentence, overlooked any matter of significance in assessing the applicant’s sentence and in determining the appropriateness of contrast between the sentence to be imposed upon him and upon his co-offender. The reasons given for discrimination between them were valid and amply supported by the evidence of the circumstances. The ground is not made out. It has not been suggested that the sentence, viewed in isolation, was outside the bounds of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    13 I propose that application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    14 FOSTER AJA: I agree. 
     
      
    15 DOWD J: I also agree. 
     
      
    16 FOSTER AJA: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal against the sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     Regina v David Ray 
      
    On 23 April 2001, the appellant was indicted for the manslaughter of his mother, Elvira Louise Ray, and was found guilty by a jury on 9 May 2001. He now appeals against that conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence that was imposed, namely, a term of imprisonment for seven years and six months, with a non parole period of four years.FactsThe deceased died during the night of 10/11 November 1997, at her home, and upon autopsy was found to have had lethal levels of both alcohol and morphine in her system. It was the Crown case that the deceased and the appellant had been drinking vodka, and that at some stage he had injected her intramuscularly with an excessive amount of morphine. It was this that was relied upon as an unlawful and dangerous act, which substantially contributed to her death, with the unlawfulness being pursued either as an assault, requiring proof that the injection was given without consent, or as an offence under sections 5 and 13 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which required proof that the morphine used had not been left at the home by a medical practitioner.It was the appellant’s case at trial that the deceased most probably killed herself, either deliberately or accidentally, by the self administration of either some or all of the morphine found in her body, at a time when she was depressed. At the trial it was contended that there was no conclusive evidence as to where the morphine in her body had come from, how or when it was given or taken or in what quantities and even if some morphine had been injected by the appellant, whether that injection had been a significant contributing cause of her death.As to whether any act by the appellant in injecting his mother with morphine constituted an unlawful act, it was submitted that there could be no case based on assault as there was no evidence that such an act was done without consent, and no case based on a breach of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as the Crown could not exclude the reasonable possibility that any morphine that had been injected by him, had been prescribed or supplied by one of the doctors who had seen her, or that he honestly believed that to be the case.Grounds of AppealLiesThis ground of appeal was argued to the effect that the trial judge’s directions on lies had been erroneous in law and entitled the appellant to a new trial. The answers which were given by the appellant in his record of interview, were not relied upon by the Crown as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, but as constituting lies going to the credibility of the version which he had given to police. Despite this, and without inviting counsel to address him on the question of whether an Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 direction should be given, his Honour elected to give such a direction. However, his Honour did not identify with any precision, those matters that the jury were free to consider as lies evidencing a consciousness of guilt, as distinct from those matters going only to his credibility and held that Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 2000 CLR 234 was distinguishable. The way in which the directions were put, left a risk of a miscarriage of justice and could only have significantly bolstered the prosecution case, even though the Crown had not sought to use the evidence in that way.Where the prosecution does not contend that a lie is evidence of guilt then it is unnecessary and inappropriate to give an Edwards direction, unless the judge apprehends there is a real danger the jury may apply such a process of reasoning - Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40. If such a direction is to be given for the protection of the accused, it should be done in terms that make it clear that it is given for such reason, and ensures that the evidence is not used in a way which risks bolstering the prosecution case, by elevating it to an admission of guilt.Further problems of the summing up included: a direction which, contrary to the decision in Robinson v The Queen (1991) 180 CLR 531, was capable of inviting the jury to consider whether the appellant’s account to police had been affected by the circumstance that he had an interest to serve in lying to them; an inappropriate observation to the jury regarding the intoxication of the appellant; a direction which came close to offending the line of reasoning discussed in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1; and a reference that his Honour in his time on the bench, had not experienced white lies, but only lies told for a serious criminal purpose, all of which tended to compound the problems caused by the directions on lies and bolstered the position that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.Verdict unreasonable or not supported on the evidenceThe test for this ground is whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant – M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. It is to be decided by the court after making its own independent assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence including its reliability and credibility – Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454, as well as giving proper regard to the greater opportunity that the jury had in seeing the witnesses give their evidence.When the factors identified in support of the prosecution case are considered, there are no possibilities which have the strength or cogency of a kind that would require the conclusion that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. In particular the admissions have very great probative value, particularly when viewed in conjunction with the items found in the appellant’s bag. Furthermore it appears unlikely in the extreme that the deceased could have, or would have injected herself with morphine, or ingested sufficient orally to reach the toxic levels found.Orders:1.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: On 23 April 2001, the appellant was indicted for the manslaughter of his mother, Elvira Louise Ray. To that charge he pleaded that he was not guilty. On 9 May 2001, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and he was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment for seven years and six months, to commence on 23 April 2001, with a non parole period of four years. He now appeals against that conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 The deceased died during the night of 10/11 November 1997, at her home. When police arrived at the home on the morning of 11 November they found her lying on the floor, in the study/hallway area, near a desk on which there was a telephone, and an empty vodka bottle.3 Upon autopsy she was found to have had lethal levels of alcohol and morphine in her system. Her blood alcohol level was 0.404 grams per 100 ml, and her blood morphine level was 0.6 mg per litre. Each was in the fatal range of toxicity. Apart from several other drugs in lesser concentrations, she also had a blood codeine level of 0.4 mg per litre.  
     
      
    4 She was a person who had a long-standing history of depression, and of problems with alcohol. She was taking a number of medications for a variety of health problems and nervous or mental disorders, including manic depression. She had a major problem with migraine headaches which had been treated with pethidine, usually injected by her general practitioner or by out of hours Doctors, although occasionally it was injected by members of her family. She also used Codral Forte to treat this problem. 
     
      
    5 The appellant who was 37 years of age, similarly had a long-standing alcohol problem and was on methadone, having overcome an earlier addiction to heroin. He had not, however, discontinued drinking, and it was common ground that he had been affected by alcohol on the night of 10 November and on the following day.6 It was the Crown case that, during the hours preceding her death, the deceased and the appellant had been drinking vodka, and that at some stage he had injected her intramuscularly with an excessive amount of morphine. This was relied upon as an unlawful and dangerous act, which substantially contributed to her death. The allegation of its unlawfulness was pursued on 2 alternative bases: first, that it involved an assault, which required proof that the injection was given without the consent of the deceased; and secondly, that it involved an offence under sections 5 and 13 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which require proof that the morphine, which was used, had not been left at the home by a medical practitioner. A third basis which had been opened, to the effect that the unlawful act involved the provision of knowing assistance to the deceased to suicide, was not pursued. 7 The sister of the appellant, Julia Ray, gave evidence to the effect that, on the morning of 11 November, she had received a message from the appellant, on her answering machine, to the effect that their mother had died. She went to the house of the deceased at about 5:30 PM, after having alerted her father and a friend Peter Harrison. She noticed that there was a blanket and pillow near the telephone, and that the appellant appeared to be very upset and still affected by alcohol.8 In a clothes basket in the hallway she found an unused phial of pethidine, which she placed into Mr Harrison's bag. In a sports bag sitting on the bed, which the appellant was accustomed to using, she found some boxes of tablets which appeared to be Rohypnol or Valium, and which contained chemists labels. She also found a pink plastic ""Bras N Things"" bag which she said contained a number of small syringes and three to five glass phials. Some of the phials, she said, appeared to have been used, because their tops had been broken off. Some of the syringes were in packets and two were loose, but she could not say whether they had been used. She also placed these various items into Mr Harrison's bag, but later returned them to the sports bag.9 Initially, she said, she had collected these items and placed them into Mr Harrison's bag, because she was concerned for her brother's well-being and wished to ensure that he did not use the drugs himself. She acknowledged in cross-examination that the deceased shopped at Bras N Things.10 She said that she had, additionally, found many other boxes of drugs around the house, including those in her mother's bedside table and in a cupboard. They included Codral Forte but she could not remember the names of the other drugs that she had seen. She thought that she had left them with Mr Harrison who had said that he would return them to Dr Holliday.11 On the following day Ms Ray said that she returned to the house. During the afternoon she spoke to the appellant separately in a bedroom. On this occasion she said he ""seemed a lot more coherent and, he didn't seem like he had been drinking alcohol"". The account she gave of this conversation was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Well, David actually called me into the bedroom to talk to him because he said he was really worried because he said he had given mum an injection of morphine for her headache and he said ""that's okay because you have given her one before"", something like that, and I sort of thought to myself, I said to him, ""oh what time was that?"" and he said, ""that happened, I think it was about 11 o'clock that night before she died"". I said to him, I think I said to him if he had any other things in the house he should be getting rid of that because I didn't think that anyone would understand that sometimes she had these sorts of headaches and that someone might think that something else had happened, you know, and I think that's all I said to him and by that stage I had already said other things to him about the vials and other things I had to put back. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. When did you do that? 
         
        A. I did that the night before when Jane I were going to do to the motel with the girls and Dad and Peter were going to stay with David and I thought, if they are staying with him tonight it's better if I put them back, to have him not get angry or upset about it or worry about it because they were actually there, they were there to look after him and I wasn't so concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. You gave evidence that he said to you that he had given his mother injections of morphine, not to worry as you had done that. Have you ever given your mother an injection of morphine? 
         
        A. No, no, not of morphine. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I think you had of pethidine? 
         
        A. Pethidine, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But not of morphine? 
         
        A. No I haven’t. I am trying to think back and I think he said morphine. “I gave a shot”, I think he said morphine. It might have been “a shot” or “an injection”. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Having regard to what you thought, don’t say what you thought as to what he told you he had injected. 
         
        A. I am pretty sure he said morphine but he said “you have given her a shot before” but I hadn’t. It was pethidine.” 
         
        
       
      
    12 She agreed in cross-examination that the words which the appellant had in fact used when saying that he was worried were that ""there might be traces of morphine"" in the deceased; and also suggested that he had said that “he had injected her at about 11 o’clock”.13 Additionally she replied, in cross-examination, when asked to confirm that she had told him to ""get rid of the evidence"": 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I said to him that  
        I knew that he had some morphine in the house because mum had told me that he had it there, 
         and that he should not keep it, or words to that effect, because I didn't think that it would be understood that he had given it to her for a headache, I would have thought it didn't sound right, but then I was concerned about him at the time and I thought at the time that if he had given to her, it would have been for a headache, perhaps."" 
        
       
      
    14 Although the italicised part of this answer was allowed to stand at the time, Mr Boulten successfully objected to any re-examination in relation to it, by reason of its status as second hand hearsay. No application was made to have the original answer struck out as nonresponsive, no doubt in order to avoid attracting attention to it.15 Ms Ray gave evidence of some other conversations that afternoon involving the appellant. In the course of a conversation with their father, Ford Ray, she heard him say that he had come down to visit his mother because she was unstable, and ""he had come to sort of bring her down from being agitated or not so depressed"". He indicated that he had done the same thing a month or two before.16 Another conversation, which she also overheard, was between the appellant and their uncle, Daniel Ferns. Her evidence in this respect was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. He said to David, ""what had she taken David?"" or something like that or, ""what had she had?"" and David said, ""vodka and morphine."" Uncle Dan said to David, ""where did she get the morphine David?"" and David said, “Oh, from her Doctor,"" and Dan said, ""from Doctor Burchett?"" who was one of her doctors and David said, ""yes,"" or something like that. And then Dan said, ""but Dr Burchett said he hadn't given her any”, because Dan had spoken to Dr Burchett and David just went like this (indicating). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. You are moving your hands upwards? 
         
        A. Just did this and walked away."" 
        
       
      
    17 Additionally she gave evidence of him saying that he had gone with his mother by taxi to a hotel in Earlwood where they had purchased a bottle of vodka. According to her, his account of the night's events continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""They came back and David said that mum had given him a nip of vodka and they were in the lounge room watching telly, or something, and she took the bottle into the bedroom and he said about 4 o'clock in the morning he heard a thump in the hallway where the phone was and she had fallen off the chair and still had the phone in her hand and she couldn't talk but she was making strange noises and he said he couldn't get her into her room so he just covered her and put her arm under her head and went to bed and when he got up at nine she was dead on the floor."" 
        
       
      
    18 Ms Ray described finding on her mother's dressing table a note, dated 30 October 1997, in the handwriting of the deceased and addressed to her brother Daniel Ferns, in which she stated that  
     
      
       
        
        ""I have had enough -- however I am castigated it is of no consequence to me. I have held on for as long as I can to see my children through to a adulthood and now I’m of no use to them or anyone else for that matter"".  
        
       
       
      She also made reference to her will and to the way in which the estate was to be divided between the appellant and the witness, and in which she identified the location of various sums of money that she had on deposit. 
      
    19 Ms Ray agreed that the deceased had a long-standing history of multi substance abuse, although she had an aversion to injecting herself. She said that she had injected the deceased twice with pethidine, for headaches, once about a year earlier, and the second time, about two weeks before her death. The deceased, she said, had informed her that she had obtained the pethidine from her Doctor, in case she needed treatment for a migraine attack at night or on a day when she could not get to the surgery.20 She also agreed that her mother had, on four or five occasions engaged in acts of self harm, involving the overdose of tablets, the most recent of which had occurred in late October/early November 1997. She identified an additional letter, which was undated but which had been written by the deceased and addressed to her, in which she observed that she was ""leading a useless life"", and that her heart was ""broken"". The letter went on to refer to money that she was leaving to Ms Ray with the hope that it would make her life ""easier."" Although not certain about it, she thought that she had found this letter at the house after her mother's death.21 Mr Harrison gave evidence of going to the house of the deceased on Tuesday 11 November, after receiving a call from Ms Ray. He arrived at about 1 PM. He was informed by the appellant, who appeared to be ""possibly mildly drunk"", that, when he had gone to bed the preceding night, his mother had been lying on the floor, so he had covered her with a blanket and placed a pillow under her head. He had left his bedroom door ajar to listen for her, but when he had woken in the morning he had found her dead.22 Mr Harrison described seeing a 750 ml bottle of vodka, a small shot glass, a Rohypnol box and a script on the telephone table. Being concerned that the appellant may take an overdose, he made a search for, and found, several packets of Rohypnol, Valium and other prescription drugs, which were in the name of Mrs Ray. He said that he placed these packages, which appeared to have been unopened, in his own bag.23 He also said that later he and Julia Ray made a further search of the apartment looking for drugs, in the course of which other packages of prescription pills in the name of the deceased were found. Additionally, he said, Ms Ray made a search of the appellant's bag, in which she found some more packets of pills, which he thought were Valium. He recalled her giving him one box of Valium, and one box of Rohypnol, which he put into his backpack. He did not recall seeing a pink bag, or any syringes, or glass phials, while he was in the room with Julia Ray. The pills taken from the appellant's bag, he said, were returned to it about half an hour later. The remaining tablets that had been found he said he gave to Dr Holliday, who returned one packet for the appellant to use in case he had nausea. He thought that all of the containers of drugs that were taken away were unopened. 24 He said that on the Thursday following his first visit, and after a conversation with Ms Ray, he spoke again to the appellant in the following terms (permission having been given to lead the evidence): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. I will read it as it appeared in your statement. Listen and I will take it bit by bit. I think you said to David, ""Julia told me about the morphine. Did you inject her intravenously or intramuscularly""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And he said, ""intravenously""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Then David said, ""oh, oh, no, I mean intramuscularly""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And you said, ""Where is the evidence? The syringes and stuff""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And he said, ""I put it in the wheelie been""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And you said, ""David, I think you should leave now and go back to the Blue Mountains. David if this comes out you are going to be in a lot of trouble""? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And I think he said, amongst other things, ""Maybe they won't find it""? 
         
        A. Yes."" 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Harrison recalled the occasion described by Julia Ray on Wednesday, when she had been called by the appellant into his bedroom. It was his impression that he seemed, at this time, to be well affected by alcohol and drugs, and to be angry towards his sister and father. He also indicated that the appellant was drinking beer when he had the conversation with him on the Thursday morning, although he did not seem to be affected by alcohol at that stage.26 On the following day, that is Friday, Mr Harrison said he moved the unemptied Otto bin into the garage, which he then locked. 
     
      
    27 He additionally gave evidence to the effect that the deceased had informed him that she often went to two doctors for pethidine injections for headaches and had been given pethidine to take home. He also confirmed that she had suffered from periods of depression, some of which had been quite debilitating.  
     
      
    28 The uniformed police, Senior Constable Garrihy and Constable Bruce, who had arrived at the scene on the morning of 11 November 1997, received a similar account from the appellant as to the fact that he had been drinking vodka with the deceased on the preceding night, that she had taken a vodka bottle into the study area where she was making telephone calls, that he had fallen asleep watching TV in the lounge, that after waking he had found her asleep on the floor, and that he had placed a pillow under her head and a blanket over here, after unsuccessfully trying to rouse her, even though she had made a response. He added that he had discovered her dead in the morning, after which he had contacted the Ambulance Service at about 9 AM.  
     
      
    29 Senior Constable Garrihy confirmed seeing an empty standard 750 ml vodka bottle on the telephone table. He did not recall seeing any drugs or scripts on the desk but did remember Constable Bruce finding an unused packet of medication during a search of the premises. He could not recall what was on the label.  
     
      
    30 Detective Sergeant May gave evidence of the items which he retrieved form the Otto bin on 17 November 1997 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I opened the bin, I located a green plastic bag and that bag was physically tied in a knot. Inside was another plastic container, and inside that container I located three hypodermic needles in packets and two unused swabs. One film holder containing one unused swab. One paper Soul and Pattinson chemist bag which was twisted. Inside that bag was a hypodermic needle which appeared to be used. There was also a pink bag labelled “Bras n Things”. On opening that bag I located a broken hypodermic needle, five empty morphine vials, five glass tips for those vials, an empty packet which appeared to have those vials and the packaging.” 
        
       
      
    31 He also described finding in the bin the letter which had been written by the deceased to Julia Ray previously mentioned, as well as some prescription tablets. In this regard he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I continued my search in the plastic bag with other rubbish I located a handwritten letter, 2 empty boxes of Codral Forte tablets, and one empty box of Codox on the front of the two Codral Forte packets was a prescription in the name of David Ray. I took possession of those items and they were entered up as Exhibit C 354379."" 
         
        
       
      
    32 He explained that the items recovered were found at the top of the Otto bin, and that under some of the plastic bags, although towards the top, he found an empty bottle of vodka. Whether it was a 375 ml or 750 ml bottle remained unresolved, although it would appear more likely to have been the latter.33 There was evidence to the effect that these items were subjected to fingerprint tests, but that no identifiable prints were recovered. By the time of the trial only three of the five phials were still contained with the exhibit, the other two apparently having been lost or mislaid. However it was common ground that they had been originally marked as containing 30 mg of morphine sulphate in one millilitre.34 Testing was not carried out on the syringes found in the bin, which appear to have included both 1 ml and 3 ml syringes, to determine whether they had ever contained morphine. Detective Sergeant May said that the reason for the absence of such tests was due to the refusal of the government analysts to handle needles for occupational health and safety reasons. Nor was any testing carried out on the vodka bottle or shot glass to determine whether it had contained any traces of that drug.35 It also appears that no inquiries were made to determine whether any telephone calls were made from the house during the evening of 10/11 November, and if so, as to the time or times that they were made.36 Detective Sergeant May conducted an electronically recorded interview (ERISP) on 25 November 1997, in which the appellant participated voluntarily.37 By reason of the manner in which this ERISP was treated by his Honour when summing up to the jury, and the significance that was given to the topic of lies, it is necessary to extract the more relevant passages. For convenience, I have assembled those passages under topic headings, noting however that they did not necessarily occur in the precise sequential manner which my reconstruction might otherwise suggest.

    38 Constable Bruce, who had spoken to the appellant on 11 November, gave evidence of recording him say that, at about 8 PM on the preceding night, the deceased and he had shared a 375 ml bottle of vodka, consuming equal amounts each; and that, at about 11 PM, they had purchased a 750 ml bottle of vodka and taken it back to the premises. He had consumed only one nip from this bottle, which had been taken by the deceased to the study, where she made telephone calls. Otherwise her account was to similar effect of that given by senior Constable Garrihy.39 Evidence was called from Dr Burchett and Dr Holliday in the Crown case, and also from Amanda Geraghty of the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) concerning the services which had been provided to the deceased between late December 1994 and 11 November 1997, and paid for by the HIC, and also concerning the prescriptions for which benefits had been paid by the HIC through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).40 Ms Geraghty said that these records did not contain any entry indicating that morphine had been prescribed to the deceased, although they did show that on 2 October 1997 pethidine had been prescribed for her by Dr Burchett. However she explained that private prescriptions for morphine and other drugs, including those which exceeded the permitted quantity for which payment would be made under the Scheme, would not show up in the records. She also said that pharmacists filling a prescription for pethidine or morphine for a general patient, in 1997, would not claim a PBS benefit unless that patient was a pension or concession card holder.41 She added that a treating doctor is able to receive samples of medication, including morphine, using an ""emergency drug doctors bag order form"", from a pharmacy, usually in a quantity of five phials. They can then be used in an emergency without any prescription being issued in the patient's name, and without any record being made in the Health Insurance Commission system.42 She also acknowledged that services provided in a public hospital to a public patient, would not appear in the records; neither would services provided without charge, or services for which a Medicare claim was not made.43 She said that it was up to a treating doctor to decide whether to leave medication with the patient; although she would not expect this to occur with pethidine or morphine, due to the fact that doctors have to keep a record of the drugs which they receive from pharmacies.44 Dr Burchett, who had been the deceased's treating doctor on and off for about 10 years, said that she had been dependent on alcohol and benzodiazepines. She had been trying to control her alcohol problem from about 1995, and during 1997 she seemed to be having some success with it. He noted that she had been hospitalised in March 1997 because of her struggle with benzodiazepines, and that leading up to this admission, she had been visiting a number of doctors to obtain prescriptions.45 He indicated that she had also suffered from severe migraine headaches, for which he had prescribed various medications, and for which he had injected her with pethidine, on a number of occasions, including 2 October 1997 and 16 October 1997.46 He said that he had, on occasions, written prescriptions for pethidine for her, and had kept the spare ampoules (the package normally contains five phials), after having left her with 1 ampoule (100 mg in 2 ml) when he thought that there was a strong likelihood of her having a recurrence while he was not available to see her. This ampoule he had left for an on call doctor to use, since she would not inject herself. These phials, he agreed, would have come from the doctors bag scheme, and would not have appeared as a prescription in the Health Insurance Commission records.47 If he had left a syringe, he said, it would have been a 2 - 2.5 ml syringe, and not a 1 ml insulin syringe, of the kind which was found in a package in the Otto bin.48 He denied having ever prescribed morphine for the deceased, indicating that he did not consider it a good drug for a migraine attack. Its use for such a condition, he said, would be contrary to his normal practice, while acknowledging that in an emergency, if there was no pethidine available, then 10 milligrams of morphine could be used. That however was not a drug he said which he normally carried in his bag.49 He also said that, on 10 November 1997, there had been a weather disturbance of the kind that can trigger a migraine attack, and that the deceased had in fact phoned his surgery, after which he had made a home visit to her at about 7 PM. By then the storm had passed, and the deceased had said that she did not need anything, and would ""just take another Codral tablet"". He left her a prescription for Codral Forte and Rohypnol, adding that, as events turned out, they were never made up. She did not appear to have been suffering at the time of this visit from depression, or to be in a manic phase.50 He acknowledged that the Health Insurance Commission records showed that a number of doctors had treated the deceased over the years leading up to her death. However he suggested that other doctors would not be inclined to administer an opiate such as pethidine or morphine without a letter from the treating general practitioner.51 He identified the phials which had been recovered from the Otto bin as having been intended for 30 mg of morphine sulphate in one ml. A 30 mg dose, he said would be excessive, and would only be used for patients with a high tolerance to opiates such as occurred with cancer patients, or for a patient with very severe pain, such as that associated with a kidney stone.52 He agreed that a patient who was tolerant to pethidine would show some cross-tolerance to morphine, since they were both active opiates. 
     
      
    53 Dr Colin Holliday, a general practitioner who had also treated the deceased since 1982, and who had admitted her to hospital in March 1997, when she was exhibiting signs of paranoia, agreed that she had been “doctor shopping” and obtaining codeine-based prescriptions in the weeks before the admission.  
     
      
    54 He said that she had attempted suicide in 1985 by drinking half a bottle of whisky along with sedatives, and again in 1986 by cutting her wrists. She had resisted his attempts to transfer her to a detoxification unit at Wandene Hospital on the occasion of the 1997 hospital admission. 
     
      
    55 He said that he had never prescribed morphine for the deceased, or for the appellant, although he had prescribed pethidine and promethazine for the deceased’s migraine attacks. The pethidine with which she had been injected by him, he said, had come from the doctor’s bag scheme.  
     
      
    56 He had given instructions to the after-hours service not to give narcotics to the deceased, but had been informed by some of those doctors that they had injected her with pethidine. 
     
      
    57 He had, on three occasions, left her with pethidine, but in order to restrict her use of the drug, he had confined it to one ampoule for a month. He had entertained concerns as to her drug abuse, and had referred her to various psychiatrists over the years for anxiety depression and substance abuse.  
     
      
    58 He remembered attending at the home of the deceased after her death, although he had no record of it in his cards. He did not recall any person there giving him a quantity of drugs and asking that they be removed from the premises. Had he received morphine or pethidine, he said, he would have broken the phials and emptied their contents in the presence of a witness, and documented that fact. Other drugs he would have returned to a pharmacy, pursuant to the system for getting rid of unwanted tablets.  
     
      
    59 The Health Insurance Commission records reveal that, apart from Drs Burchett and Holliday, medical services for which benefits had been claimed had been provided by 60 or so doctors over the period to which the records applied. Although the major source for prescriptions had been Drs Burchett and Holliday, the records showed that many prescriptions had been written by Drs Rajendram and Khatri. Other prescribing doctors included Drs Scruby, Girgis, Nour, Hegoe, Kosten, Lance, Spicer, Tsung, Allen, Chakty, Campbell, Lee, Smyth and Walker. The only doctors recorded as having prescribed pethidine were Drs Khatri, Burchett, Scruby, Ma and Holliday. 
     
      
    60 A critical issue in the case was whether or not the appellant’s conduct had been a significant contributing factor in his mother’s death. 
     
      
    61 Dr Allan Cala, who conducted the post mortem examination, attributed the death to multiple drug toxicity.  
     
      
    62 He gave evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
      (a) The blood alcohol level in the deceased was in the “theoretically fatal range”, and could have led to her death. 
       
       
      (b) The blood level of morphine was in the “toxic and fatal range” which “theoretically [is] anything over 0.08 mgs per litre”. The level found, he said, was about twice the level of morphine which he had seen in fatal overdoses by long term drug users. 
       
       
      (c) Pethidine does not metabolise within the body to morphine; but codeine based drugs such as Codral Forte can do so. 
       
       
      (d) The effects of a large dose of morphine are that a person will become more and more unconscious, with their volume and rate of respiration reducing. 
       
       
      (e) While pethidine is an appropriate treatment for a migraine attack, morphine can also be used for that purpose. 
       
       
      (f) Morphine sulphate of the kind that one would expect to find in the exhibited phials was not meant for oral ingestion; it could be taken that way, although its bio-availability would be reduced to about one-third, because substances consumed orally are rapidly degraded by the liver.  
       
       
      (g) If morphine had been orally ingested, it would be expected that some would be found in the stomach on post mortem examination; however on this occasion, testing of the deceased’s stomach contents had not been conducted. 
       
       
      (h) While the codeine found in her blood was not at a fatal or toxic level, some of that codeine, approximately 10%, would have metabolised into morphine – in that regard, if its source was Codral Forte, which contains 30 mgs of codeine that would have been equivalent to 3 mgs of morphine theoretically, although it would have had a lesser toxicity if taken in the usual way by oral ingestion than if injected. 
       
       
      (i) One intravenous injection of a 30 mg ampoule of morphine in 1 ml of fluid, of the kind recovered as an exhibit in this case, would be about three times the recommended dose to give an adult for the treatment of pain, and would be sufficient to produce a blood morphine level of 0.6 mg per litre, which in turn would lead to breathing stopping within about 20 seconds. 
       
       
      (j) An intramuscular injection of a 30 mg ampoule would result in a lower rate of absorption, and hence in a morphine level much lower than that found in this case; as would its oral ingestion, although in that case, to an even lesser extent. 
       
       
      (k) Combining one 30 mg intramuscular injection, with the oral ingestion of four 30 mg phials, some three to five hours later, would “probably not” result in the blood morphine level found in deceased; although he said that “it remains nevertheless…a possibility”. 
       
       
      (l) A blood alcohol level between 0.3 and 0.404 gms per 100 ml would have a considerable effect on the manual dexterity of a person attempting to open morphine phials, since in his experience they were quite difficult to open, and sometimes shattered in one’s fingers. 
       
       
      (m) He did not find any convincing injection puncture mark or marks on the deceased during his post mortem examination of her body, although that he did find some bruises on her arms. 
       
       
      (n) The failure to find any puncture marks, he said, did not surprise him since injection marks can be extremely difficult to detect, and often are not found, whether they were given intravenously or intramuscularly; although, he added that, had the exhibit ampoules of morphine been injected with a 3 ml syringe, requiring at least two shots, then he would have expected to see evidence of some puncture marks, as he would also have expected if there had been four to five shots using 1 ml syringes, because the chances of seeing injection marks are increased when they are repeated and occur over a short period of time. 
       
       
      (o) The longer that morphine is in the body, the lower are the levels of morphine, and the higher are the 2 chemicals, morphine 6 glucuronide, and morphine 3 glucuronide, into which it metabolises – test results were not however available to show the level of these metabolites, or to provide an indication of the time that morphine had been present in the deceased before her death.  
       
       
      (p) The bile morphine level of the deceased was 40 mg per litre (which showed that the morphine had been moving around) although that did not come as a surprise to him, and did not necessarily provide any guide as to the time between the morphine entering the deceased’s body and her death, although it could mean that the blood had been, at some time, higher than 0.6 mgs per litre. 
       
       
      (q) He was unable to say how much time would have elapsed between the administration or ingestion of morphine and death; nor was he able to say how much morphine would need to have been injected intramuscularly to reach a 0.6 mg per litre level, although he did say that it would be greater than 30 mgs. 
       
       
      (r) The regular use of codeine and pethidine, particularly the daily use of codeine, would produce some cross tolerance to morphine, in which event the time until death, if given an excessive dose of morphine, would be lengthened.  
       
       
      (s) To achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.4 mgs per 100 ml, would require the ingestion of 14 to 15 or more standard drinks of spirits, depending on the rate of consumption and metabolism. 
       
       
      (t) Had the deceased consumed half a 375 ml bottle of spirits, starting at about 7.30 PM, then her blood alcohol level would have been about 0.1 gms per 100 ml of blood by 10.30 pm, a level which would not have affected her motor skills to the point where she would have been unable to knock the tops off the phials and to empty them. 
       
       
      (u) Had the deceased been alive at 10.30 PM, and still talking at about midnight, then he would exclude the reasonable possibility of her having been injected intravenously with a fatal dose of morphine between those hours.  
       
       
      (v) Had she collapsed at about 2.30 AM, and been found mumbling incoherently at about 4 AM or 5 AM, then that would be consistent with an injection after 2.30 AM, or a slow release of morphine ingested prior to that time. 
       
      
    63 An application for a Prasad direction at the close of the Crown case was declined. The appellant did not give evidence, although he called one witness, Kenneth Suydan, who lived in an apartment immediately below that of the deceased. It was his evidence that at about 10.30 PM on 10 November 1997, the deceased had phoned him and asked him to go to the bottle shop to buy a bottle of vodka. Her speech, he said, was slurred, although she did not sound depressed. He replied that the shop would probably not be open, after which she thanked him and ended the call. 
     
      
    64 His bedroom, he said, was directly under the hallway/study area where her telephone was located. At about 11 to 11.30 PM he heard her talking apparently on the phone for 5 to 10 minutes. He went to sleep but was awoken at 2:30 AM by quite a loud thud directly above his bedroom. The time of this thud he had fixed by referring to an illuminated digital clock beside his bed. 
     
      
    65 He did not hear any other noises after that thud. During his cross- examination, he indicated that from his flat, he was able to hear footsteps of anyone walking around in the area above his bed. He was unaware whether this area was carpeted, although he knew that there were timber floors in the lounge and dining room, by which answer it would seem that he meant that they were uncarpeted.  
     
      
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    66 It was the appellant’s case at trial that the deceased most probably killed herself, either deliberately or accidentally, by the self administration of either some or all of the morphine found in her body, at a time when she was depressed.  
     
      
    67 In this regard he relied upon the following matters: 
     
      
       
      (a) About two weeks before her death she had overdosed on medication; 
       
      (b) She had written what appeared to be recent suicide notes; 
       
      (c) She had a long history of overdosing and of emotional problems for which she had received psychiatric treatment, and which had prevented her from working over the preceding 20 years;  
       
      (d) She had been drinking heavily on the night of 10 November. 
       
      (e) Julia Ray’s evidence that when she had visited her mother in late October or early November 1997, she had looked depressed, and that her separation from her third husband, at the end of 1996, had also caused her considerable distress. 
       
      (f) Mr Harrison’s similar confirmation that the deceased had gone through periods of debilitating depression. 
       
      (g) Kenneth Suyadan’s confirmation that he had seen her looking depressed or sad, and had been told by her, about 2 months before her death, “I’ve had enough”.  
       
      
    68 As to the cause of death it was contended by the appellant at trial that there was no conclusive evidence as to where the morphine in her body had come from, or how or when it was given or taken, or in what quantities. 
     
      
    69 Further, it was submitted, even assuming that some morphine had been injected by the appellant, that the Crown could not prove that such injection had been a significant contributing cause of her death, in that it could not exclude, as a reasonable possibility, that the deceased had subsequently injected herself, or had orally ingested, some of the morphine from the exhibit phials.  
     
      
    70 In relation to whether or not any act by the appellant in injecting his mother with morphine (if he had done so) constituted an unlawful act, it was submitted: 
     
      
       
      (a) In relation to the Crown case based on assault, that there was no evidence that any act of injecting the deceased was done without her consent. 
       
      (b) In relation to the Crown case based on a breach of the 
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 
       that the Crown could not exclude, as a reasonable possibility: 
       
        
        (i) that any morphine injected by him had been lawfully prescribed or supplied to the deceased by one or other of the doctors who had seen her, with the consequence that its subsequent use by the appellant, would not have amounted to an offence under the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        ; and additionally that, 
         
        (ii) the Crown could not exclude, as a reasonable possibility, that the appellant had honestly believed that the morphine had been lawfully prescribed or supplied to her.  
        
       
      
    71 Two grounds of appeal were argued: first, an acquittal ground, that the verdict was unreasonable and/or could not be supported on the evidence; and secondly, a new trial ground, to the effect that the trial judge’s directions on lies had been erroneous in law. It is convenient to deal with that latter ground first. 
     
      
       
      Lies 
       
      
    72 The case was not one where, either at trial or on appeal, the Crown sought to rely upon the answers in the appellant’s record of interview as constituting lies of the kind that would evidence a consciousness of guilt. At the highest, its case was that the jury would regard his account in the ERISP as unreliable, that is, as a matter going to the credibility of the version which he had given to police. 
     
      
    73 Notwithstanding that circumstance, and without inviting counsel to address him on the question of whether an Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 direction should be given or not, his Honour elected to give such a direction. The direction, which was thereafter given, made appropriate reference to the elements of which the jury needed to be satisfied, in order to treat the appellant’s answers in the ERISP as revealing a consciousness of guilt. As initially framed they did not include any reference to the additional explanation which Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ had suggested in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234, might properly be given in a case such as the present: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[23] A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.’  
           
          
         
        A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence.“ 
        
       
      
    74 A direction was later given by his Honour at the request of counsel, in accordance with the final sentence of the suggested direction, although with the addition of the word “material” after the words “lie about something”.  
     
      
    75 It was also the case that his Honour left to the jury what he referred as “areas of [the appellant’s] conduct” which amounted to admissions. In this regard his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, you may also use conduct of an accused in the same way as you may use admissions. Again, subject to the same three conditions, which I will not repeat. But the crown points to areas of conduct which fall within that category. First, there is the concealing of drugs and drug administration material in the wheelie bin. The crown submits that this was to avoid being detected. That is based on finding evidence by the police, and partly on Julia Ray’s evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        Putting the materials in the bin certainly helped to ensure that the accused had a period of some days in which to think about what he would say if questioned about the events of 11 November.” (Summing Up p 54). 
        
       
      
    76 He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “These factors, the Crown says, point to a consciousness of guilt of a similar kind to that which arises in relation to the lies about which I have given you some directions, or assistance. Again, I say to you, before you take into account such matters as showing consciousness of guilt, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular conduct of the accused did in fact occur as the Crown alleges. 
        
       
       
        
        That was, at first, disputed by the accused in his record of interview. I gave you the example of that earlier. Later, it was admitted, when he was, as Mr Boulten said, pressed. What really happened there was that they came back to it at another time in the questioning and in a slightly different context, and then the concession was made.” (Summing Up p 55). 
        
       
      
    77 Although his Honour had broached this topic by reference to “areas of conduct”, it was ultimately confined to the one aspect of the placement of the drugs and the Bras ‘n Things bag in the Otto bin. That was then taken up in the context of the manner in which the appellant’s answers in the ERISP developed.  
     
      
    78 In the initial stages of the summing up, the direction in relation to lies had focused upon the appellant's answers concerning the alleged admissions to his sister. The matter was however eventually not so confined.  
     
      
    79 It was largely the responses of the appellant that “he did not remember” certain matters when they had been put to him by police that became the crux of the directions. However a response of that kind was different in degree from a denial of having had the conversation in question, or of having carried out the other acts that were put to him, although it was also the case that the appellant did deny giving morphine to the deceased or taking such substance to the house.  
     
      
    80 Otherwise, the focus was upon whether any changes in responses, as the questions continued, were such as to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    81 At the close of the day on which the directions concerning lies had first been given, Mr Boulten of counsel asked that they be withdrawn, upon the basis that the Crown had not relied upon lies in the ERISP, or the conduct of the appellant in relation to the Otto bin, as admissions of guilt. 
     
      
    82 His Honour declined to withdraw either direction, although he indicated that Mr Boulten could renew his application at the end of the summing up.  
     
      
    83 Without departing from his objection, Mr Boulten then requested his Honour to inform the jury of the possible reasons why the appellant may have given the answers in question, or placed items in the bin. 
     
      
    84 On the following morning his Honour repeated the Edwards direction, and then indicated that, at the request of counsel for the appellant, he would add two matters for consideration, which were not directions of law, but “comments on the evidence”. They were to the effect that, when considering whether the appellant had told a lie solely because he believed that the truth would implicate him in the offences charged, they should also consider, as a possible reason for him having done so, that he was conscious of some other offence, such as assisting his mother to commit suicide; or that he wished to cover up the fact that his mother had committed suicide; or that he was trying to avoid revealing a failure to take steps to avoid his mother acting in a self-destructive way; or that he was trying to avoid telling police the true source of the morphine.  
     
      
    85 When his Honour returned to deal with the ERISP in the course of his summary of the evidence, having declined to withdraw the directions on lies, he began by encouraging the jury to group together the questions that dealt with the same or related subject matters, observing: 
     
      
       
        
        “That way you can test a number of things. One is internal consistencies. Another thing that you can test is whether or not you have a sliding story that gets a bit better as it goes on. Sometimes that is because people remember things; other times it is for different reasons; whether what is said in the record of interview can really stand with what has been said at other times by the same person, and, finally, how what is said in the record of interview compares with other evidence. Is it inconsistent with other evidence and how do you work out that inconsistency?” 
        
       
      
    86 That was an appropriate and helpful way to consider the answers, particularly so far as they went to an assessment of the credibility of the account which had been given to the police.  
     
      
    87 What followed however was a recitation of the answers which had been given by the appellant to questions concerning, for example, the circumstances in which the second bottle of vodka was acquired, as to whether he heard a “thump”, as to the time that he woke and covered his mother with a blanket, as to the throwing of items in the Otto bin, as to whether he had seen the Bras ‘n Things bag, as to whether he had seen morphine in the house, as to whether his mother had told him that Dr Burchett had injected her with morphine, as to whether he had informed his sister that he had injected his mother with morphine, or that doctors had left morphine with her, and so on. They were accompanied by his Honour’s comments in relation to the truthfulness of those responses, and as to any apparent contradictions between them, which were largely unfavourable to the defence case, and which invited their possible consideration as indications of hedging, or as lies on the part of the appellant.  
     
      
    88 At the end of this exercise his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, the record of interview is the last occasion that the accused had of putting before you – putting before the police rather, the investigation people – his version of what occurred. You have read it. You have seen it. You will analyse it because it is part of your function and, in doing so, you may feel that it will assist you in coming (a) to a view as to what did occur, (b) as to the truthfulness of the accused, and (c) subject to the conditions that I have indicated to you, if you find it has been proved by the crown beyond reasonable doubt in the second way I put to you that you may use lies, if you find them to have been told by the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        The record of interview is a very important piece of evidence in this case, both for and against the accused.” 
        
       
      
    89 What his Honour did not do, when dealing with the ERISP was to identify, with any precision those matters that the jury were free to consider as lies evidencing a consciousness of guilt, as distinct from those matters going only to his credibility.  
     
      
    90 At the conclusion of the summing up, Mr Boulten asked his Honour not just to withdraw the directions about lies but also the way in which the jury had been taken through the ERISP, upon the basis that the summing up had caused the trial to miscarry. In particular, his Honour’s attention was drawn to the decision in Zoneff v The Queen and to the absence of the precision that was needed in identifying the matters relevantly relied upon as admissions of guilt. 
     
      
    91 In the event of his Honour declining to withdraw those parts of the summing up, or alternatively declining to discharge the jury, counsel asked for specific directions to the effect that, before the ERISP answers were to be treated as admissions or as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the jury would need to be satisfied that the accused really did have a memory of the events of 10/11 November when he was interviewed by police; and additionally that his memory had not been impaired by the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs on the night of 10/11 November, or over the intervening period. A direction was also sought in terms of the directions which had been suggested by Zoneff v The Queen,  previously noted.92 On the following morning his Honour delivered judgment in which he declined to withdraw the directions previously given, and held Zoneff to be distinguishable, on three bases; first, that the lies said to have been told were not themselves the subject of the charge; second, the appellant had not given evidence, with the consequence that the Crown had not been afforded the opportunity of putting to him that his ""lies"" were told because the truth would have implicated him in the death of the deceased; and third, because the interviewing detectives had suggested, at least inferentially, that the appellant’s asserted absence of recollection was not genuine.93 It is true that, in certain cases, an Edwards direction should be given for the protection of an accused, that is, where there is a danger of the jury using the evidence inappropriately as admissions of guilt. In the present case, suggestion by inference in the ERISP, or in the Crown Prosecutor's address, may well have led to that danger, and justified an Edwards direction which made it clear that the ERISP was not relied upon for that purpose, and that the answers and any hedging revealed by them were matters relied upon by the Crown as going to credibility alone.94 Had his Honour framed the directions in this fashion, there could have been no objection to the explanation which was given, which did comply with the elements of the approved direction. However, in the way the summing up developed, the directions were given in a way which could only have significantly bolstered the prosecution case, even though the Crown had not sought to use the evidence in that way.95 After this judgment was delivered, Mr Boulten sought to present an additional submission, but his Honour refused to hear him. The jury was then brought back after which his Honour gave the additional specific directions which Mr Boulten had sought, as a backup to his primary submission, in support of the application that the summing up be substantially withdrawn or the jury discharged.96 In an affidavit provided to the court by Mr Boulten, he stated that, at the first adjournment after the jury retired at the conclusion of the summing up, he had dictated a file note recording the additional submissions which he had been prevented from making. The note was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I intend to put on record the following: 
         
        1. That His Honour’s directions given yesterday morning in response to my fax were couched in terms that denied them any judicial impramata and which thereby diminished them in the eyes of the jury. (Domican). 
        
       
       
        
        2. That I made my reference yesterday to the trial miscarrying because of a combination of His Honour's directions about consciousness of guilt and His honours analysis of the ERISP. I intended to expand in this way. His Honours analysis of the ERISP led to the summing up lacking balance thereby causing unfairness to the accused. Not only was the disproportionate amount of time in the summing up spent on the question of the veracity of the accused answers in the ERISP but there was no real attempt at balancing His Honour's arguments that suggested to the jury that the accused had lied in his ERISP with any of the reasons advanced by the accused (in argument to the jury and in the redirections sought) that suggested that the answers in the ERISP were not deliberate untruths/or were not evidence of a ""consciousness of guilt"". 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour's directions failed to identify particular lies the jury were to consider as evidence of consciousness of guilt, rather it was an invitation for the jury to identify for themselves which lies might constitute consciousness of guilt contrary to  
        Edwards 
         and  
        Zonnef  
        (sic).” 
        
       
      
    97 In my view the submissions which Mr Boulten wished to make were properly based and, in the way that the matter was left, there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice. The decision of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, and Callinan JJ, in Zoneff, provides helpful guidance in relation to the circumstances in which lies should be dealt with, particularly in the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “16. There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an  
        Edwards 
        -type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. As a general rule, however, an  
        Edwards 
        -type direction should only be given if the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt, in the sense that it was told because, in the language of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in  
        Edwards 
        , ""the accused knew that the truth ... would implicate him in [ 
        the commission of 
        ] 
          
        the offence"" and if, in fact, the lie in question is capable of bearing that character. (The words in italics are ours and, for the sake of clarity, should be included in the statement of principle.) 
         
         
        17. Moreover, if there is a risk of confusion or doubt as to the way in which the prosecution puts its case, the trial judge should inquire of the prosecution whether it contends that lies may constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt and, if so, he or she should require identification of the lie or lies in issue and the basis on which they are said to be capable of implicating the accused in the commission of the offence charged. 
         
         
        18. This was an unusual case. The prosecutor did not, during cross-examination, in terms, or in our view, by implication, suggest that any answer given was a lie, told out of consciousness of guilt (a phrase we use for convenience). Moreover, as the prosecutor did not address the jury, no such suggestion was made at any later stage of the trial.  
        
       
       
        
        19. In this Court the respondent prosecutor reiterates that no reliance was, in the courts below, or is here, placed upon the answers given to found a submission that the appellant lied, out of a consciousness of guilt. 
         
         
        20. It follows in our opinion that it was unnecessary, indeed undesirable, that a direction of the kind with which  
        Edwards 
         was concerned be given in the circumstances of this case. In order to give it in this case the trial judge would have had to decide which of the appellant's answers were or were not capable of being regarded as lies indicative of a consciousness of guilt. Such a direction here could have had the effect of raising an issue or issues upon which the parties were not joined, and of highlighting issues of credibility so as to give them an undeserved prominence in the jury's mind to the prejudice of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        21. Because the Crown did not put, either in cross-examination or in any submission at the trial that there was any material capable of being regarded as a lie stemming from a consciousness of guilt, the direction that the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal quoted and which is set out above, should not have been given.  
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        25. For the trial judge here to refer to, indeed raise, on his own initiative in the way in which his Honour did, the possibility of a consciousness of guilt without any identification of relevant answers, and without any further explanation, was to invite the jury to infer that the alleged lies might be indicative of a consciousness of guilt, a proposition for which the prosecution has not contended, and does not now contend.” (References Omitted). 
         
        
       
      
    98 It is clear from a long line of authority, for example R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697, R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234, Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193, and Zoneff v The Queen that the topic of lies is one that must be approached with considerable care. As Zoneff and Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 have shown, before lies are left as evidence of consciousness of guilt, it is preferable for the trial judge to ascertain precisely what use the prosecution contends should be made of the evidence. Additionally, having regard to the potential prejudice which can attach to lies, it is always desirable that those which are to be relied upon as evidencing a consciousness of guilt be identified with precision, and not left at large for the jury to select.99 Moreover as Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40 at para 34: 
     
      
       
        
        ""where the prosecution does not contend that a lie is evidence of guilt, then, unless the judge apprehends that there is a real danger that the jury may apply such a process of reasoning, as a general rule, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to give an  
        Edwards 
         direction"". 
        
       
      
    100 I would add that where such a direction is given to protect an accused, then it should be done in terms that make it clear that it is given for such reason, and that ensures that the evidence is not used in a way which risks bolstering the prosecution case, by being elevated to an admission of guilt.101 Having regard to the course which this trial took, I am persuaded that error has been shown. The Crown conceded that to be so, when the matter came to be argued before us. This ground has accordingly been made good.  
     
      
    102 The case is not, however, one suitable for an application of the proviso since the question of the appellant’s truthfulness and/or hedging in the ERISP were very much to the forefront of the summing up, and the terms thereof were well capable of influencing the jury verdict in a way that risked a miscarriage of justice.103 I am fortified in my conclusion that a miscarriage of justice occurred, by reference to some other aspects of the summing up which, although they may not of themselves have required a new trial, tended to compound the problems caused by those directions.104 They included, for example, the following passage which, contrary to the decision in Robinson v The Queen (1991) 180 CLR 531 was capable of inviting the jury to consider whether the appellant's account to police had been affected by the circumstance that he had ""an axe to grind"", that is, an interest to serve in lying to them: 
     
      
       
        
        ""You need to look at whether or not there is a reason, or an absence of reason, for a particular witness to be truthful, or untruthful. That is relevant to your assessment as well. If a witness, any person, has a particular axe to grind, you may think that that could colour their evidence. In the  
        case of an accused 
        , of course,  
        there is always the factor that he is anxious to ensure that what the police hear is as good as he can give them 
        . That is human nature.""  
        
       
      
    105 Next, in the context of the admissions, which were said to have been made by the appellant to his sister, his Honour made an observation to the jury which, in my respectful opinion, was inappropriate insofar as he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""..you have to ask yourself, ‘ 
        is it likely that somebody would say that unless it were true? 
        ’, because it is a most serious matter. And if it is the truth, you may think - and it is a matter for you - it is heightened by the fact or may be heightened by the fact that they withdraw from the rest of the people and the door is closed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Boulten says, ‘Well, this fellow had been drinking, you should take that into account’ and you should. However, may I just pose for your consideration two matters:  
        one is this is an old Latin maxim, in veno (sic) veritas; in wine truth. It means that when you are in your cups you often say things that are true 
         that you wouldn't say but for the uninhibiting effect of alcohol. The other way that is put it is you often hear the truth from drunks. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now you have got to balance the argument that Mr Boulten puts about, ‘well, he had been affected by drink, he had been drinking during the day, he went to sleep on the toilet holding a bottle of beer’ - he must have only been half asleep not to drop it, one would think, but still, it is against the nature of what was said that  
        often remorse or desire to share a burden may be, or may come to the fore more when somebody has had a few drinks. 
        "" 
        
       
      
    106 The adage “in vino veritas” is of dubious validity, particularly as a general proposition, a matter reflected by the circumstance that intoxication commonly needs to be taken into account, pursuant to section 85 of the Evidence Act, when considering whether evidence of an admission, which had been made in the course of official questioning, in circumstances affecting its reliability, should be excluded. Moreover, in this instance, Ms Ray had given evidence to the effect that at the time of this conversation the appellant had seemed ""a bit more coherent"" and not ""like he had been drinking alcohol at the time"". It is true that Mr Harrison had a contrary impression, but to the extent that there was a conflict in the evidence, the comment was unfortunate, given the critical nature of the alleged admission.107 Additionally, when dealing with Ms Ray's evidence, his Honour, at one point, said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The comparison of witnesses in relation to this area of alleged admissions is a matter of assessment solely for you, but, in making that assessment 
        , you may want to ask yourself: was any reason suggested to Julia Ray why she may be untruthful in relation to what she says was said? 
         I do not think in the cross-examination will find that suggestion put to her. That is a material matter."" (S.U. 53). 
        
       
      
    108 This direction came close to, if not directly falling within, the offending line of reasoning which has attracted the attention of the courts, in relation to similar questions asked of complainants in sexual assault cases: see Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1.109 Next, when dealing with the truthfulness and reliability of the ERISP, his Honour drew attention to the appellant’s observation that he ""wanted a solicitor"" as a matter which possibly reflected adversely upon him. For the jury to have regarded such a request, which merely reflected his entitlement to seek legal assistance, as a matter adverse to his case would have clearly been inappropriate.110 Finally, when prefacing his original remarks on lies his Honour had made what can only be regarded as an unfortunate observation, to the effect that he had not, in his time on the bench, experienced “white lies” but ""only lies told for a serious criminal purpose"". Such a comment may well not have gone unnoticed by the jury when they were invited to consider whether lies in this case evidenced an appreciation by the appellant of his guilt and attempts by him when interviewed by police to deflect suspicion.  
     
      
    111 For these reasons, this ground has been made good, and subject to the next ground, the appellant is entitled to a new trial.  
     
      
       
      2. VERDICT UNREASONABLE OR NOT SUPPORTED ON THE EVIDENCE 
       
      
    112 The test for this ground is that stated in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, namely whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. That question is one for the Court to decide after making its own independent assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence, including its reliability and credibility: Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454. It is also appropriate to give proper regard to the greater opportunity that the jury had in seeing the witnesses give their evidence.  
     
      
    113 The prosecution case, although by no means compelling, was one which was, in my view, capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. That is not of itself enough to save a verdict, since the Court may still, after its own review, reach the conclusion that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    114 The Crown case, in summary, encompassed the following strands of evidence: 
     
      
       
      (a) The presence in the deceased of a toxic level of morphine; 
       
       
      (b) The appellant’s unchallenged admissions, first to his sister, that he had injected the deceased with morphine at about 11.00 PM, and later to Mr Harrison, that the injection had been intramuscular; 
       
       
      (c) The observation of Ms Ray concerning the contents of the appellant’s sports bag, including most particularly the photos and syringes in the Bras ‘n Things bag; 
       
       
      (d) The appellant’s reaction when, following his observation that the deceased had obtained morphine from Dr Burchett, he was informed that Dr Burchett claimed not to have done so. 
       
       
      (e) The fact that broken morphine phials were found at the top of the Otto bin, into which the appellant had admittedly deposited drugs and drug injection paraphernalia. 
       
       
      (f) The absence of any labelling on the packet which was found in the Otto bin (which had been consistent with a morphine packet), of the kind that might be expected had it come from a pharmacist.  
       
       
      (g) The absence of any morphine phials among the drugs which were prescribed in her name found in the bedroom of the deceased, or other places where drugs were found after her death. 
       
       
      (h) The improbability that any medical practitioner would have prescribed or injected morphine for her migraine headaches, which had been consistently treated with pethidine or Codral Forte, each of which were preferred medications. 
       
       
      (i) The evidence of Drs Burchett and Holliday, who, apart from Dr Rayendran, were the most common treating doctors, to the effect that they had never injected the deceased with morphine, or left it with her or prescribed it for her. 
       
       
      (j) The absence of any mention in the Health Insurance Medical Service, and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, records of morphine having been injected or prescribed for the appellant. 
       
       
      (k) The absence of any used or broken phials of pethidine or morphine, or needles, in the area of the telephone desk, being also the area where the 750 ml vodka bottle and body of the deceased had been found. 
       
       
      (l) The difficulty which the deceased might be expected to have had in opening the morphine phials in view of the exceedingly high blood alcohol level that was found post mortem.  
       
       
      (m) The blood alcohol level of the deceased which was such that it was unlikely that she would have been able to inject herself, or to give consent, at least an informed consent, to being injected with morphine. 
       
       
      (n) The fact that the deceased was averse to injecting herself. 
       
       
      (o) The improbability that the deceased’s blood morphine level could have achieved the level found other than by intravenous or intramuscular injection, even allowing for the possibility that some of the Codeine present had metabolised into morphine. 
       
       
      (p) The absence of any prior request by the deceased to Ms Ray that she give her an injection of morphine, as distinct from pethidine. 
       
       
      (q) The fact that instructions had been left with the after hours service not to give narcotics to the deceased. 
       
       
      (r) The improbability of other doctors having left with the deceased either an entire unlabelled packet of 5 phials of morphine, or five individual phials on five separate occasions. 
       
       
      (s) The fact that the deceased’s history of substance abuse had not been known to have extended to morphine. 
       
       
      (t) The fact that the appellant had a history of heroin addiction and as a consequence might have been expected to have had a knowledge of the way in which an injection of an opiate might be performed. 
       
       
      (u) The fact that the 30 mg phials which were found were of a strength that would only be used in acute cases of kidney stone or terminal cancer pain, and were not of the strength that would be likely to have been left with a patient whose problem was one of migraine pain, being in fact three times the normal dose of such drug.  
       
       
      (v) The appellant’s answers in the ERISP which were of the kind that were capable of throwing doubt on the credibility of his account to police. 
       
      
    115 On the other hand there areas where the police and forensic examinations had been incomplete in so far as: 
     
      
       
      (a) There had been no test of the deceased’s stomach contents,  
       
       
      (b) No test had been conducted to determine whether any of the syringes found in the appellant's bag had contained morphine;  
       
       
      (c) No tests had been made of the vodka bottle and shot glass to see whether they contained traces of morphine; 
       
       
      (d) The remaining doctors who had treated the deceased had not been interviewed as to whether they had ever given morphine to her or prescribed it for her.  
       
       
      (e) No reverse call searches were made or at least results of searches available, to confirm whether, and if so when, any telephone calls had been made to the deceased's telephone service during the night of 10/11 November;  
       
      
    116 Additionally there were the circumstances that:  
     
      
      (a) At about the time of her death, the deceased had been suffering from migraine attacks; 
       
      (b) Also at times proximate to her death she had been doctor shopping, and appeared to have been contemplating suicide; 
       
      (c) For the reasons explained by Ms Geraghty, the Health Insurance Commission records were not necessarily conclusive as to whether a medical practitioner had, or had not, left morphine with the deceased or prescribed it for her; 
       
      (d) Dr Cala's evidence could not exclude the possibility of the deceased having injected herself with morphine, or having orally ingested it; 
       
      (e) Injection marks were not found by Dr Cala, even though more than one injection would have been needed using the syringes that were found to deliver sufficient morphine to reach the level found, or to use all of the phials found in the Otto bin. 
       
      (f) While Dr Cala thought it unlikely that the blood morphine level could have reached the level found other than by injection, that remained a possibility; 
       
      (g) The significance of the unlabelled package which, it was contended by the Crown had contained morphine and had been given to the appellant, was reduced by the circumstance that an unlabelled phial of pethidine was also found in the apartment; 
       
      (h) The appellant had made an observation to his sister which was consistent with a belief that she had previously injected their mother with morphine for a headache, and also consistent with the drug having been available on the premises, and believed to be appropriate for such use; 
       
      (i) The appellant said in the ERISP that his mother had informed him that Dr Burchett had given her morphine, a matter which was also consistent with a belief that any morphine in the house had been lawfully provided; 
       
      (j) The ""admission"" if made to Ms Ray, was silent as to the quantity of morphine injected, and in her recollection included reference to a shot or injection in the singular; 
       
      (k) The reference by the appellant to morphine in the alleged ""admissions"" was to ""traces"" of that substance, a matter inconsistent with his injection of any significant quantity of the drug; 
       
      (l) The time of death and of the fatal injection or ingestion of morphine could not be ascertained; 
       
       (m) That there was no obvious reason why the appellant would have wished to inject his mother, whom he liked and who he had visited in an attempt to cheer her up, with morphine, without her consent, that is, in a way constituting an assault; 
       
      (n) It was unlikely that the appellant would have stored drug paraphernalia, if it was his, in a Bras 'n Things bag, particularly if it was the case that the deceased was accustomed to shopping at a place with that name; 
       
      (o) On Dr Cala's evidence it was improbable that a single intramuscular injection of 30 mg of morphine would have led to the toxic blood morphine level found in the deceased, and which, it was accepted, contributed to her death. 
       
      (p) It was not possible to determine which of any of the 1 ml or 3 ml Exhibit syringes was used; nor was possible to know precisely how much morphine was injected into, or ingested by, the deceased. 
      
    117 In these circumstances it was suggested that reasonable possibilities consistent with the appellant's innocence were available insofar as the Crown had been unable to remove the following possibilities: 
     
      
       
      (a) that any injection of morphine by the appellant was of a phial that had been left at the home, or prescribed, by one or other of the medical practitioners who had seen her, and/or that the appellant had an honest belief on reasonable grounds to that effect; 
       
      (b) that any injection by the appellant of morphine had occurred at the request of the deceased in order to treat a migraine attack of the kind that had possibly begun to develop earlier that night; 
       
      (c) that the reliability of any admissions made by the appellant to his sister and to Mr Harrison and/or his memory, at the time of the ERISP, had been affected by alcohol and/or drugs, and/or by distress in relation to his mother's death, on the night of 10/11 November, and over the subsequent days. 
       
      (d) that the deceased had not subsequently injected herself or ingested morphine in a way that meant that the appellant's act was not a substantial contributing cause of her death. 
      
    118 Clearly these were arguments that were properly to be placed before the jury although none of them had been ventilated by the appellant in his ERISP, it having been his case from beginning to end that he had not injected his mother with morphine. When the factors identified in support of the prosecution case are considered in combination I am not persuaded that any of the possibilities identified by the defence had the strength or cogency of the kind that would require the conclusion that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt. 
     
      
    119 In particular, the admissions have very great probative value, particularly when viewed in conjunction with the items found in the appellant’s bag. Furthermore, it appears unlikely in the extreme that the deceased could have, or would have, injected herself with morphine, or ingested sufficient orally to reach the toxic level found. 120 In those circumstances I do not consider that this ground has been made out. The proper order, accordingly is as follows: 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
      2. Conviction quashed; 
       
      3. New trial ordered. 
      
    121 It remains properly a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether, in the light of the deficiencies in the investigation, the analysis of the evidence contained in these reasons and the time served, whether the appellant should be placed on trial again. 
     
      
    122 SIMPSON J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    123 ADAMS J: I also agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    124 WOOD CJ at CL: The orders of the Court are:

      2. Conviction quashed;

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 26 June 2003 we allowed the appeal against conviction, quashed the conviction, ordered a new trial and announced that we would publish our reasons later on. These are our reasons. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was convicted of murder following a trial by jury and appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the resulting sentence. Before the trial began he offered a plea of guilty of manslaughter but the Crown declined to accept it in discharge of the indictment. Consistently with the appellant’s offer defence counsel conducted the trial upon the contention that the appellant was guilty of provocation manslaughter. Although self-defence was left to the jury, that was not a conclusion contended for by counsel for the defence and there was no realistic chance that the appellant would be acquitted. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was charged with stabbing Rebecca Diab to death on or about 18 February 2000 in an hotel at Bass Hill. The appellant and the deceased were having an affair and had gone to that place by arrangement. The appellant stabbed the deceased repeatedly, principally in the upper chest, the throat and the neck. After the stabbing the appellant showered and telephoned his son to tell him that he had killed somebody. Ultimately the son got in touch with the police, who attended the hotel, found the deceased dead, arrested the appellant and took him to the police station. Later on they interviewed him and he admitted stabbing the deceased. He said that during the night the deceased emerged from the bathroom and started waving a knife about in front of him and that he tried to take the knife from her and in the course of doing so received a cut to his hand. He managed to get the knife away from her and began stabbing her. 
     
      
    4 In his evidence the appellant told the jury that the deceased complained to him that every time they went to the hotel his son telephoned. She became increasingly aggressive and used words that were inflammatory to him, a man of Lebanese background. Accordingly, he became angry. The deceased performed an obscene sexual act in front of him while making derogatory comments about him. The incident with the knife followed. 
     
      
    5 It is convenient to deal with the sixth ground of appeal since the Crown made an important concession on appeal. The ground complains that the trial judge erred in his redirections on provocation and manslaughter. 
     
      
    6 His Honour summed up the case on provocation and manslaughter in these words - 
     
      
       
        
        Provocation has been raised as an issue in the trial. Let me stress there is no onus on the accused in relation to this. 
        
       
       
        
         There is no onus on the accused to prove provocation. The onus of proof to this matter is, as in all things in this trial, on the Crown. The Crown must negate provocation and do so beyond reasonable doubt. What in the law is provocation and what is its effect? 
        
       
       
        
         The legislature has relevantly provided: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that an act causing death was an act done under provocation and but for the provocation the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury must acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         So provocation is about acquitting the accused of murder and finding the accused guilty of manslaughter. It is not a walk-free matter. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “For the purpose of this part of the law an act causing death is an act done under provocation where: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased including grossly insulting words or gesture towards or affecting the accused; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm, upon the deceased; whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act causing death or at any previous time.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        So from this you can see that an act causing death is done under provocation where the following elements, three in number, are present: 
        
       
       
        
        A) The act is the result of a loss of self control on the part of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        B) The loss of self control was induced by conduct of the deceased towards of affecting the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        C) The conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mrs Diab. 
        
       
       
        
        The loss of self control may be due to fear, anger, resentment but it must be present at the time of the killing. Conduct which gives rise to a sense of grievance or revenge will not suffice. 
        
       
       
        
         An ordinary person is a person of the accused’s age and sex with ordinary powers of self-control for a person of that age and sex. Whether grossly insulting words were actually used by Mrs Diab is a question of fact for you to determine remembering that the onus is not on the accused, the onus is on the Crown to negate that they were said. Whether the accused lost his self-control is also a question of fact for you, again the onus is not on the accused, it is on the Crown. Whether the grossly insulting words or actions, if said or done, induced the loss of self-control, is also a question of fact for you to determine. Again there is no onus on the accused to prove this. The onus is on the Crown to negate it. 
        
       
       
        
         The Crown may establish that the accused’s act was not done under provocation by satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that any one of (A), (B) and (C) that I have referred to already, was not so. That is by excluding any one of the necessary elements of provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         If the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder, except that the accused was not acting under provocation, then in that event the accused is not guilty of murder but must be convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
         So you look at the elements of murder, you work through those, you ask yourselves, has the Crown proved each of those elements? You then come to provocation. If the Crown has not negated provocation then the accused is entitled to an acquittal on the charge of murder, but must be convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
         Now, I have prepared a sheet that I spoke to you about. We found some typographical errors in them, one of them was the omission of the word “not” which was pretty important, so that has been rectified. 
        
       
       
        
         If I can just digress from provocation for a moment you will see what the sheet contains. It contains the elements that have to be established or negated beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown if murder is to be found. It then deals with what grievous bodily harm means. It deals with the matters I have directed you on in relation to self-defence and we are now on p 2 and I have summarised there the directions on provocation that I am giving to you. 
        
       
       
        
         Could I say to you ladies and gentlemen, the law of provocation is not easy as you will see as it unfolds and the refinements in it are a source of argument in superior courts. 
        
       
       
        
         I have said to you that the Crown may establish that the accused’s act was not done under provocation by satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that any one of (A), (B) and (D), which you will see on p 2 of the sheet that you have been given, was not so, that is by excluding any one of the necessary elements of provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         If the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder, except that the accused was not acting under provocation, then in that event the accused is not guilty of murder but must be convicted of manslaughter unless it has also negated the provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         That indeed was the final plea to you on behalf of the accused by his counsel. I will return later to the crime of manslaughter. Let me continue with the matter of provocation however. It follows that for the accused to be guilty of murder the Crown must establish all the elements of murder including the intentional act of the accused which resulted in the death of the deceased and that the act causing death was not done under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         Provocation has the three necessary elements (A), (B) and (C) that I have referred to, and it follows that if any one of those elements is excluded by the Crown, that is proved beyond reasonable doubt not to be, provocation is excluded as a partial defence and if the other elements of murder have been established then the crime of murder will have been established because provocation has been negated or negatived. 
        
       
       
        
         The first element in provocation is that the act of the accused was the result of a loss of self-control on his part. Let me say something about loss of self-control. The loss of self-control is not the same as an emotion, an emotion such as anger, resentment, hatred, revenge, possessiveness or something of that sort. None of those emotions amount in themselves to a loss of self-control, although they may lead to a loss of self-control. 
        
       
       
        
         Loss of self-control must involve the temporary suspension of reason. The temporary suspension of reason, that is a state where the power to reason rationally and sensibly has been lost. The relevant time is the time at which the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm was formed. There must have been a loss of self-control in the sense I have indicated at the time of forming that intention. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, whether the accused in this case stabbed the deceased as a result of a loss of self control is a question of fact. It is therefore a question entirely for you, it is your province, not mine or anybody else’s. If the Crown is to exclude provocation on this ground it is for the Crown to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not stab the deceased as a result of a loss of self-control. If, in your opinion, there is a reasonable possibility that he did stab the deceased as a result of a loss of self-control, reasonable possibility, the Crown will have failed to exclude that element in the legal concept of provocation. That is the first element. 
        
       
       
        
         I now go to the second element of provocation. If the Crown has failed to exclude loss of self-control under the first element, it may still exclude provocation by excluding one of the next two elements in the legal concept of provocation, that is elements (B) and (C). 
        
       
       
        
         For the Crown to exclude provocation in this way you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s loss of self-control was not induced by conduct of the deceased. The question for you in relation to this point is whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, if there was a loss of self-control by the accused, it was not induced by conduct on the part of the deceased. That conduct may be either actions or words or it may be both. The principle can be re-stated in a slightly different way, looking at it in a different way. If there is a reasonable possibility that the accused lost self-control as a result of the conduct, be it words or actions or both, on the part of the deceased, the Crown has failed to exclude that element of provocation, and accordingly has failed to that element of provocation, and subject to element (C) has failed to exclude provocation at all. 
        
       
       
        
         Now, just to recapitulate. It is a necessary element in the crime of murder that the act was not done under provocation. The Crown must exclude provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         The Crown must exclude provocation. It may do this by showing one of the necessary components of provocation was not present. It may show that the act was not done as a result of loss of self control or it may show that loss of self control was not induced by relevant conduct of the deceased towards or effecting the accused. If it is to do either of those two things, it must do so beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
         I now come to the third necessary element which I referred to earlier on page two of the sheet you have been given. That is the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused so to have so far lost self control as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
         What is meant by an ordinary person in the position of the accused? You will note that there are two ideas built into that phrase; one is the idea of ordinary person; the other is the element, “in the position of the accused”. How can these two components of the phrase be reconciled? The answer to that has been settled by the courts. What I now tell you is the law in that connection which like every legal principle I instruct you on you are bound to accept. 
        
       
       
        
         There are two distinct steps. First you determine the emotional effect on the accused of the deceased’s behaviour. That is a question of fact. It is subjective. For that purpose you take the accused himself, not some hypothetical person, not yourselves. 
        
       
       
        
         You take the accused with all his personality characteristics insofar as they may be relevant. Conduct which may not be insulting or hurtful to one person might be extremely so to another because of some unusual or abnormal sensitivity which that other person may have. Confronting behaviour may be extremely provocative for such a person because of his personal characteristics which may include age, sex, race, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, life history, personality as it came to be because of life’s experiences on him and other personal qualities and characteristics. 
        
       
       
        
         You ask what was the emotional effect of the accused’s behaviour on the accused. If the deceased’s behaviour had a particular sting in it for the accused because of his personal characteristics, that is part and parcel of the emotional effects of the deceased’s behaviour on the accused. It does not matter for that part that most people would not have experienced or might not have experienced whatever emotional response the accused in fact experienced. The gravity of the documents conduct on this line of provocation is not assessed objectively. It is the gravity of that conduct as experienced by the accused. It is entirely subjective. 
        
       
       
        
         Having made that assessment of the gravity of the deceased’s conduct as experienced by the accused, you move to the second step. You move now from this man, the accused, to the generality of human kind. You ask whether an ordinary person experiencing the emotions felt by the accused could so far have lost self control as to form an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm on her. 
        
       
       
        
         For this purpose an ordinary person is a person of the same age and sex as the accused with the ordinary powers of self control for a person of that age and sex. Ethnicity, life history, personality and the like, that is the individual characteristics, play no part in the decision in relation to this aspect of the law of provocation. The test is an objective test for a person of the age and sex of the accused. So there is a little bit of subjectivity in the hypothetical reasonable person. That is you imbue that person with the characteristics of age and sex of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
         The concept or notion of self control necessarily involves a range of capacities for self control. Whether the capacity is at this lower end of the range is a matter for your judgment drawing on your experience of people and of life. You bring your knowledge of the world in which ordinary people may react to bear in deciding this matter. 
        
       
       
        
         The question is this. Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased’s conduct was such as could not have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm? If the answer to that question is yes then the Crown has excluded that necessary element of provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         Again the matter can be put in another way as I did in relation to the first element. It can be put this way. The Crown will have failed to exclude the third element of provocation if there is a reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to form an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
         If the Crown has also failed to exclude the other elements of provocation which I have dealt with, it will have failed to exclude provocation as an element of murder. 
        
       
       
        
         The final element in the crime of murder, namely that the act was not done under provocation would then not have been satisfied and there would have to be a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
         These are the principles of law applicable to the element of the crime of murder, that the act was not done under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         I referred to manslaughter and I should give some directions in relation to that. Where an accused is charged with murder but where the Crown has failed to establish that his act was done with the intention required for it to amount to the crime of murder, there is an alternate verdict available and that is one of guilty of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
         This aspect of manslaughter or this way of arriving at manslaughter must be considered quite separately from the verdict of guilty of manslaughter which is the crime or result where the issue of provocation which I have just discussed with you has not been eliminated by the Crown. 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour dealt with manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and with self-defence and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        Now, you will see on the sheet that I have given to you that in relation to manslaughter one can arrive at a manslaughter verdict in one of two ways in this case. The first way is, if the Crown has failed to prove the specific intent necessary for the crime, and the second way is, if the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder except that the accused was not acting under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         I have summarised in this sheet the way in which you may approach this question of manslaughter. The first, if the Crown has failed to prove the specific intent for the crime of murder. This is an approach or a way of approaching the matter which arises for consideration if the Crown has failed to establish that the accused intended to kill the deceased, or that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on her. 
        
       
       
        
         There, under that approach, the accused is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter if, and only if, the Crown has established that: (a) it was a deliberate act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased, and (b) it was an unlawful and dangerous act. I have worked through on that sheet the things that I have said to you in relation to the various elements of manslaughter under that approach. 
        
       
       
        
         The second approach is, if the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder except that the accused was not acting under provocation, that is that the Crown proved all the elements one to five that I dealt with at the opening of the summing-up in relation to murder, but that it has not negated provocation and in that event the accused is not guilty of murder but must be convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
         May I return to the question of provocation and because the evidence touches on some of the matters in relation to murder that I have directed you on, I have kept it until I had given you those directions. 
        
       
       
        
         The provocation in this matter is said to be twofold: one, the obscene acts said by the accused to have been done or carried out in his presence by the deceased with the cucumber, using it as some form of instrument of auto eroticism both vaginally and anally. 
        
       
       
        
         Well there is an issue of fact to start with that you have got to come to a conclusion on. The question that is posed is, did it happen? And the second thing is, words that were said by the accused to have been said by Mrs Diab. Those words, and I will come to them, were said by Mr Moses, the interpreter who was called to give expert evidence, were words that would be the most insulting words that one could use to a person of Lebanese extraction, particularly the combination of the three words relating to the accused’s mother. 
        
       
       
        
         As I have said Mrs Diab is not available to give evidence of what happened in the room, and as counsel for the accused pointed out there was no room video and nobody was running a tape recorder. The closest we come is words and noises heard by Ms Mughelli, which she was unable to understand because they were in a language other than English. 
        
       
       
        
         We do, however, have two lots of evidence from the accused. In his oral testimony (p 516): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. When you got into the hotel room what happened after you got in there?” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This is a question asked by his counsel. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “A. We sat and we ate I think a mango and what I think was the red grapes and I was talking to her about how I was going to return home and I was wishing her a happy life with her family. Then we got on the bed and we made love. At all times I was talking to her in a way that would not make her upset so I would stay friends with her. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Did she appear to be doing the same with you, saying nothing that would upset you and staying friends? 
           
          A. Approximately yes, at first yes that’s what happened.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Note the sequence of events. He was then asked by his counsel: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. At some stage did you receive a telephone call on your mobile phone? 
           
          A. Correct, from my son. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Was that before or after you had made love to Ms Diab? 
           
          A. After making love. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. How long did the conversation go for with your son? 
           
          A. Seconds, not long. Seconds, not long.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        We know that call took place somewhere around very close to 11 o’clock in the evening, so we have got a situation on that evening that everything was calm, nice, each talking to the other to ensure that no one was upset. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. What happened after that? 
           
          A. When I hung up Rebecca said ‘Everytime I am with you your son calls, your children call.’ 
           
          Q. How did her demeanour appear, how did her behaviour change or was it the same as before? What was happening, what did you see?” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         That might be five questions, yes, five questions in one but it certainly gave him the opportunity to answer. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “A. She was very upset, very upset. 
           
          Q. You have told us that she said to you in effect, ‘Your son always rings, your family always rings.’ What happened next, what was said after that? 
           
          A. She said to me, ‘Every time we are on the bed - I am on the bed with you your children’ – she said, ‘your children ring’ and she started swearing at me saying abusing words. 
           
          Q. What did she say? 
           
          A. ‘Son of a slut, your mother is a slut, your mother is a head of a league of sluts, your children are sluts. Tomorrow you going to go to your birthday. Your daughter is a slut and I am going to fuck your daughter because her husband is paralysed.’ 
           
          “I didn’t hear” says the Prosecutor. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: Q. ‘I am going to fuck your daughter because her husband is paralysed.’ 
           
          A. ‘And your daughter needs this.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          KING: Q. How long did that conversation take? 
           
          A. Five minutes, ten minutes, something like that. I was trying to calm her down to pacify her and as long as I was trying to do that she was getting more upset.” 
           
          Q. Who went to the bathroom? 
           
          A. Rebecca went to the bathroom and came back. 
           
          Q. Where did she came back to? 
           
          A. To the room where I was on the bed…and I was trying to talk to her gently and calmly. She came she wanted to get on the bed so I would make love to her again. I said to her, ‘Please sit down so we can talk together. I am tired now and I can’t make love. Let us have mutual understanding, calmly.’ She got up quickly from the bed and there was a cucumber on the table. She was using the cucumber on herself. 
           
          Q. When you say ‘using the cucumber on herself’ what did you see her doing? 
           
          A. She was inserting it on herself from the front and the back. 
           
          Q. During that time did she say anything to you? 
           
          A. She was saying, swearing saying the same word that she used before. I asked her, ‘Please remove the cucumber’. I was begging her, ‘Why are you doing this to me?’ She told me, ‘I’m going to put it in your mum and dad….I’m going to put it in your mother and father, and Dad and the whole family. Your whole family. And if you are thinking of going back to your wife, you’re not going to go back to your wife unless, I’m going to kill you and kill myself first. I would kill you and kill myself.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         Curious, you may think, how she was going to kill herself first and somehow she would effect the second killing. I am not sure, but that is the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Did she say anything, or did she say anything describing the cucumber in relation to you? 
           
          A. The first thing she said, ‘This cucumber is better than you. You’re not a man.’ So the cucumber fell on the floor. So I got up in order to pick it up and put it away from her. She hit me on the shoulder.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        And then we have the evidence about the sole of the foot. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “A. I was trying up to that moment to be very calm, very calm with her. 
           
          Q. What happened next? 
           
          A. When I got up from the floor and I was going back to the bed, she pulled out a knife and charged at me. She hit me the first time and the second time and then other times in my hands and she jumped on me on the bed.” Et cetera. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         That is the first account in evidence by the accused of the events and the matters of, I am sorry, the action and words of the deceased said to constitute the provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. When you say she hit you, what do you mean? 
           
          A. She hit me with the knife on my hand. She hit me with the knife. I thought that my hand had blown away”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         And then a little later he was asked by his counsel about the mark on the wrist. I don’t propose to go into that. Perhaps you take one of the photographs of the knife into the jury room and have a look at that photograph. You can form your own view about that, whether it is a crease in the wrist as the Crown suggests or a cut as counsel for the accused suggests. And he is asked about the knife. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. What happened after that? 
           
          A. I remember after she charged at me while I was on the bed I remember taking the knife and hitting her and after that I don’t remember anything. 
           
          Q. Then she attacked you with the knife, is that right? 
           
          A. Yes.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         Question were asked and answered in English through the interpreter. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. What was her demeanour like, her behaviour when that was happening? 
           
          A. Her – the look on her face wasn’t normal at all.” 
           
          Q. Did she say anything to you while she was doing that, doing those things? 
           
          A. Yes, she told me, ‘I’m not going to let you go back to your wife or to your house at all.’ I told her, ‘I’m not going back to my wife, I’m going back to my family.’ 
           
          Q. Was there any more swearing or abuse or anything like that? 
           
          A. She was yelling and shouting and swearing and she charged at me and she pushed me on to the bed. I fell with her on the bed. While she was hitting me with the knife I fell with her on the bed. 
           
          Q. What sort of swearing words did she say to you? 
           
          A. ‘Son of a slut I’m going to f-u-c-k your mother and daughter, your family.’ 
           
          Q. Did those words at that time have any effect on you? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: At which time are you referring to? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          KING: During this attack and the words being said at the same time. 
           
          Q. When were those words said in relation to when she was attacking you? 
           
          A. They were said from the start, when she started until she charged at me and she was swearing and she hit me. 
           
          Q. When you say ‘hit me’? 
           
          A. She hit me with the knife. 
           
          Q. Is there another word for hit that you might use? 
           
          A. She hit me with the knife, she cut me. 
           
          Q. Is ‘cut me’ another word for ‘hit’ or are you talking about two different things? 
           
          A. She was coming on to me in order to hurt me. She came to me to kill me with the knife and she said to me, ‘I’m going to kill you.’” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I have read you that in another context. Well, there is one other passage I think. He has asked: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. How were you at the time she was attacking you with the knife? How were you feeling, what was in your mind? 
           
          A. All I was, all I had in my head was to get the knife away from her hand but I couldn’t do that. 
           
          Q. Why did you want to get the knife away from her hand? 
           
          A. In order to put it aside. 
           
          Q. To put it aside? 
           
          A. So in order for me to get it away from her and from me. 
           
          Q. Why did you want to get it away from you? 
           
          A. So I wouldn’t strike her or strike myself or do something wrong.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Up to then you may think it is a picture, expressed by the accused as one of calmness. He is trying to hose down a situation of tension, a situation of anger and loud response by the deceased, “Let’s sit on the bed, let’s talk things through calmly.” 
        
       
       
        
        There is an additional piece of evidence, however: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I thought I was dead and death was in front of me. I was dead from the fright. 
           
          Q. At the time Ms Diab was coming towards you with the knife what effect, if any, did the swearing have on your mind? 
           
          A. The swear words had an effect on me before she charged on me with the knife and then she came with the knife. My knees started to go to jelly. 
           
          Q. I think you described it before you felt on fire inside? 
           
          A. My legs were shaking and my inside was on fire and my whole body was shaking. I didn’t know what was happening to me.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 The written directions referred to by his Honour included the following passages - 
     
      
       
        
        MURDER 
        
       
       
        
        Murder is established if the Crown proves: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The deceased died on or about 18 February 2000 
        
       
       
        
        2. it was an act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased; 
        
       
       
        
        3. it was a deliberate act by him; 
        
       
       
        
        4. The act was done - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) with an intention to kill the deceased;  
          or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        5. the act was not done in self defence,  
        and 
        
       
      
    6. the act was not done under provocation. 
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        MANSLAUGHTER 
        
       
       
        
        The accused may be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. That may occur in one of two ways. 
        
       
       
        
        FIRST WAY: If the Crown has failed to prove the specific intent necessary for the crime of murder. 
        
       
       
        
        1. This arises for consideration if the Crown has failed to establish that the accused intended to kill the deceased or that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on her and, on that account, is not guilty of murder. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Under this approach, the accused is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter  
        if 
         and  
        only if 
         the Crown has established that - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it was a deliberate act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased,  
          and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the act was unlawful and dangerous. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Second Way: If the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder except that the accused was not acting under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        In that event, the accused is not guilty of murder but  
        must 
         be convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
      
    9 The jury retired on 9 August 2001. At 1:40 pm on the following day they asked a question in the following terms - 
     
      
       
        
        “Would you please clarify point ‘C’ of provocation with particular reference to: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) What is an ordinary person. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Can point ‘C’ be broken into two parts, those being: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (A) Making an assessment of the gravity of the conduct of Rebecca on Ali, taking into account sex, race, history, ethnicity and personality, e.g. Muslim Lebanese background, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (B1) Them asking ‘would this have the same effect on an ordinary person of the same age and sex only.’? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (B2) Is the ordinary person we are to consider someone like Ali who is bankrupt, has nowhere to live, no family (kicked out) breaking up with girlfriend, or is the ‘ordinary person’ just anyone of the same sex and age? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If part ‘C’ can be broken into these two parts and one is proven, the other not, how can we answer part ‘C’? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Also 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) With part ‘B’ do we have to believe that the loss of self-control was ‘wholly’ induced by the deceased on the night to find the point proven. If there are contributing factors do we find this not proved?” 
        
       
      
    10 According to the transcript, during the debate which followed his Honour received a further note from the jury in these terms - 
     
      
       
        
        “Should the jury fail to be able to agree unanimously on provocation, is it a hung jury or do we go the (sic) second way of manslaughter?” 
        
       
       
      and there was this debate about the second note - 
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What do you say about the hung jury question? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Would your Honour recite it again for us? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. “Should the jury fail to be able to agree unanimously on provocation is it a hung jury or do we go to  
        (sic) 
         second way of manslaughter?” I do not think they can possibly go to the second way of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, they can’t but have we a hung jury? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I do not know. I know as much as you know. I am not in the jury room, I do not skulk around the corridors. I know what is in the question. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The question indicates to me they have not reached the -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What is the answer to the question that you propose? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: They cannot take that course and then move on to manslaughter simpliciter. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It seems to me you only get to provocation if you have found specific intent and having found specific intent, but you cannot agree on provocation, then they are hung. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. Can I say this that the wording of the letter indicates they have not reached that position as yet but if they have your Honour would have to give them a Black direction. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The second way for manslaughter if the Crown has established all the elements of the crime of murder except that the accused was not acting under provocation, what happens? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: They cannot move on to that. If they cannot decide provocation they are hung and they cannot, then cannot dismiss it and move on to manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        KING: I agree. If they did ignore  
        (sic – disagree?) 
         provocation there is no alternative of manslaughter, it has got to be murder, so they are hung. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The text of the letter does not indicate that they have reached that position. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Absolutely and we will see. Once we have answered the questions we will give them some time and see what they do. 
        
       
       
        
         I am not sure that is right for the second way. I think they might be able to. 
        
       
      
    11 In due course his Honour gave further directions about the ordinary person in the position of the accused and this followed - 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You have asked me another question which sent dismay into my heart about a hung jury. Why not go away and see whether those directions help you and say I resume at 3.30, will that give you enough time to discuss that? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: I think it will. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: If need be I will then give you some further directions in relation to hung or not hung. You are under no pressure remember, calm, mature deliberation but I hope those directions will be of assistance to you in resolving this question of provocation. 
        
       
      
    12 The jury retired again and his Honour sent in further written directions, which appear to have been in the following terms - 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown will exclude provocation either by: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Establishing that the stabbing which caused the death of Rebecca Diab did not result in fact from the loss of self-control on the part of the accused, or 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Establishing that such loss of self-control was not induced or caused by some conduct on the part of the deceased, or, 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Establishing that the conduct of the deceased was not such that it could have induced or caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost his self-control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury upon the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    13 The jury returned to the Court at 3:30 pm and the transcript records that this was said - 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, were those directions of any assistance to you? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes, they assisted us but we are still where we were at before we came in. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You have asked a second lot of questions: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Should the jury fail to agree unanimously on provocation, is it a hung jury or do we go to  
          (sic) 
           second way of manslaughter?” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Well now have you got before you the sheets that I handed out to you? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now, you only get to the second way of looking at manslaughter if you find that the deceased died on or about 18 February 2000, that it was an act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased, that it was a deliberate act by him, that the act was done either with intention to kill the deceased or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased, and that the act was not done in self-defence. Those five elements. 
        
       
       
        
         Remember that the crown has to prove a negative under 6, that is that the act was not done under provocation. The act was not done under provocation has to be proved by the Crown and proved beyond reasonable doubt and unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was not done under provocation, the accused then is entitled to a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Now that is the second way you are asking about? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I am concerned that the question that you have asked about the hung jury may indicate when taken in conjunction with the other questions that you may be transposing the onus of provocation on to the accused. The onus is on the Crown to prove it was not provocation and unless the Crown proves that beyond reasonable doubt then you go into manslaughter by the second way. 
        
       
       
        
        So, if you have a doubt as to whether or not the elements of provocation have been proved beyond reasonable doubt – have been proved – if you have a doubt about that then you go into way two. Does that help you? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Then I will adjourn until 4.30 -- 
        
       
       
        
        KING: Your Honour, some of the jurors were indicating no, it does not help. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What they indicate is totally irrelevant, that is the direction that I am giving and I am sending the jury out to consider it. If they are not helped by it Mr King then no doubt they will send us another question. 
        
       
      
    14 Again the jury retired but returned with a further question at 4:05 pm - 
     
      
       
        
        “We can’t agree unanimously on all aspects of provocation. We have unanimously agreed murder has been established under points 1 to 5 inclusive. Can you confirm your direction is that we must bring a verdict of manslaughter?” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour gave further directions as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Ladies and gentlemen I take you to the sheet again. As I said to you earlier the Crown must prove that the act was not done under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
         Now, if you are left in any doubt about that then the Crown has failed to prove that element and then you go to the second way of manslaughter. Now that is one situation and that is one interpretation of your note. 
        
       
       
        
         Another interpretation of your note is that some of you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was done  
        (sic) 
         under provocation and others of you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was not done under provocation, then you are a hung jury. 
        
       
       
        
         Now, does that assist you? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes it does your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Because your unanimity is part of our system. Unanimity is different from reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt is what each of you hold in your own mind but if some have no reasonable doubt, do not have a doubt at all, and others do, then you are not unanimous and that is the second situation that your note contemplates. 
        
       
      
    16 The jury retired again at 4:10 pm and returned with a verdict of guilty of murder at 4:20 pm. 
     
      
    17 There was some uncertainty (at least in the transcript) at trial and not a little difficulty on appeal about the terms and intent of the request by the jury for directions about whether they should go the “second way” to manslaughter if they were unable to agree about provocation. The Crown submitted on appeal that there must have been two notes in almost identical terms as transcribed in paras 10 and 13 above. However, an inspection of the file shows that there was only one note. It was in the following terms and variations from them in the transcript would appear to be erroneous - 
     
      
       
        
        Your Honour 
        
       
       
        
        Should the jury fail to be able to agree on  
        point 6 
         provocation is it a hung jury or do we go to “Second Way” of Manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        Would you please clarify. 
        
       
       
        
        Thank you 
        
       
      
    18 Accordingly, we think that the references at 1:40 pm and 3:30 pm were to the one question in the one note. 
     
      
    19 Any uncertainty about the meaning of the note arose in the first place because manslaughter had been left to the jury on two different bases. That uncertainty would have been avoided in our opinion if the only basis left had been by provocation. Subject to the necessary but almost theoretical defence of self-defence, the only jury issues left should have been those raised by the parties. The appellant’s case was only ever that he killed the deceased but that he was guilty only of manslaughter because he was provoked. Counsel never argued for an acquittal. The accused thereby impliedly acknowledged that he had acted with the specific intent necessary for murder. In our opinion there was no occasion to leave for the jury’s consideration manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    20 The basis of the Crown concession on appeal was the manner in which his Honour redirected the jury in response to their requests. The first submission was that the reference by the jury to the “Second Way” of manslaughter was to provocation manslaughter. This submission may be accepted. Although the meaning of the note was not immediately apparent, and although the Crown Prosecutor appeared at first to consider that the “Second Way” meant manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act (if that is what the Crown Prosecutor meant by “manslaughter simpliciter”) we think that the jury were referring to provocation manslaughter. So much seems clear from the answer to that effect that the Foreperson gave his Honour and from the correspondence between the expression “Second Way” in the note and in the written directions, where that expression refers to provocation manslaughter. 
     
      
    21 It thus appears that the jury were asking, notwithstanding the clear directions his Honour had given, whether if they disagreed whether the Crown had rebutted provocation, they could return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by provocation. 
     
      
    22 His Honour’s first response was to defer answering the question and to answer the substantial questions about the ordinary person in the position of the accused. His Honour’s only reference to the note was to indicate that he was dismayed and that he might give further directions about the effect of the jury’s inability to agree. 
     
      
    23 The jury returned to court after an hour by arrangement. They had raised no further question but the Foreperson indicated that the jury still needed help. His Honour responded by reciting the elements necessary for murder and provocation manslaughter and repeating his directions about the burden and standard of proof. However, his Honour made no reference to what was troubling the jury, namely whether if they were not unanimous that the Crown had rebutted provocation they should find the accused guilty of manslaughter. It cannot have come as a surprise that, according to defence counsel, some members of the jury were indicating that the further direction had not helped. 
     
      
    24 His Honour’s response, to the effect that the jury could send another question, brought forward the final note. The note repeated the previous request and asked his Honour to confirm that his direction was that they must bring in a verdict of manslaughter. It seems that by using the word must the writer of the note was referring to the written directions under the heading “Second Way …”. 
     
      
    25 His Honour’s first response was to say that if the jury were left in any doubt whether the Crown had proved that the act causing death was not done under provocation they should go to the second way of manslaughter, namely manslaughter by provocation. That direction said nothing about the matter which was troubling the jury, namely the proper course to be taken following their inability to agree. Insofar as the doubt referred to was not a unanimous doubt the direction was incorrect. 
     
      
    26 His Honour then dealt with what he called another interpretation of the note, namely that some jurors were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and some were not. We have already remarked about the difficulty in relying literally upon the transcript of what was said. We have extracted accurately at para 15 above what his Honour is reported to have said and it seems appropriate to proceed, notwithstanding the possibility of inaccuracy, upon the understanding that what is written was said. His Honour’s remark that some might be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was done under provocation and others not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was not done under provocation was likely further to confuse a confused jury. Even if the jury were not misled by the error, and even if the transcript is wrong and there was no error, the concluding remark, namely, “then you are a hung jury” was our opinion unlikely to assist the jury. 
     
      
    27 In the question they last asked the jury plainly demanded to know whether if they disagreed whether the Crown had disproved provocation they must find the accused guilty of manslaughter. The question was never plainly answered. 
     
      
    28 The Crown submitted that his Honour’s last direction was capable of leading the jury to an erroneous conclusion about whether they were “hung” or not. They were never told in plain terms what they must or might do if they disagreed about provocation. We accepted those submissions and considered that the Crown’s concession was appropriately made. We considered that confusion in the mind of at least one juror about the consequences of disagreement might have led to the abandonment of a genuinely held dissenting view. 
     
      
    29 Counsel submitted that if the appeal succeeded on this ground the Court had no need to deal with any other ground of appeal. We have therefore not considered the other grounds.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Shaw J:  This is an application by the applicant to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Sides on 18 February 2003 in the District Court sitting at Campbelltown following a plea of guilty to one charge and one further offence, committed in close proximity to the offence alleged in the substantive charge specified in the Form 1. The offences occurred on 9 and 10 June 2002 at Ulladulla and concerned sexual intercourse with the applicant’s five-year-old step-sister and her friend, sleeping in the same bedroom where the applicant resided. The applicant was seventeen-and-a-half years of age at the relevant time. He has no prior criminal history. 
     
      
    2 The trial judge imposed a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of nine months, to be served in a juvenile detention centre pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 
     
      
    3 These were grave offences involving very young girls, with potentially serious consequences for the victims. In my opinion, it was obvious that a custodial sentence had to be imposed and, despite the youth of the offender, one which was not illusory but of substance. My initial reaction to the sentence was that the applicant was treated leniently by the trial judge. 
     
      
    4 I note that the applicant accepts that Sides DCJ dealt with the matter according to law and ‘in respect of which it is not contended his Honour fell in to error ...’ 
     
      
    5 Admittedly the episodes on the Sunday evening in question were brief. It is also apparently the case that when the first complainant indicated that the activity should stop, the applicant complied. 
     
      
    6 The first sentencing error which the applicant relies upon is the way his Honour dealt with the offence specified on the Form 1. His Honour took the view that the Court was required to consider the offence on the Form 1, and this could hardly be in dispute. He said that the Court should not merely pay ‘lip service to it’. His Honour accepted that it was an offence committed at about the same time as the offence on the indictment, but in relation to a different individual. Accordingly, his Honour reasoned that the prima facie head sentence determined (i.e. fifteen months) should be extended by another nine months to reflect the offence on the Form 1. His Honour said this is an extension which was significantly less than would have been imposed had the matter been the subject of a separate charge. 
     
      
    7 The applicant draws attention to what was said by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 to this effect: 
     
      
       
        
        ... the sentencing court is sentencing only for the principal offence and it is no part of the task for the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all offences and then apply a ‘discount’ for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence.” 
        
       
      
    8 However, this observation has to be seen in a more general context of what was said by the Chief Justice in that case. His Honour dealt with a number of considerations in relation to taking matters into account on a Form 1, which I would summarise as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) to take account of the Form 1 matters will usually result in the imposition of a longer sentence (or may alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence stood alone.  
         
        (b) it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. 
         
        (c) the sentence that is appropriate for the charge on indictment, when one has regard to the Form 1 matters, would ordinarily result in increasing that sentence because the sentencing judge will place a great emphasis on the objective seriousness of the offence charged. 
        
       
      
     9 The focus must be on the ‘principal offence’ alone, as Simpson J said in R v Lemene (2001) 118 A Crim R 131 and repeated in R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        ... an offender who adopts the procedure is entitled to expect an additional penalty significantly less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted. 
        
       
       
      
    10 It has been said by the applicant in this case - and it has been a well-argued case - that the sentencing judge may have taken into account wrongly, or at least given excessive weight to, the question of general deterrence. It is true that in the Attorney General’s Application case the Chief Justice said in [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 
        
       
      
    11 What the Chief Justice made clear in [43] is that this was not a universal or exhaustive statement of the matters that can be taken into account when the sentencing court is having regard to Form 1 offences. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. 
        
       
       
      
    12 However, no additional elements for which that could have been so have been identified in submissions in this Court. 
     
      
    13 In short, it seems to me the focus is on the principal offences but the Court has regard to the additional matters specified in Form 1 and they may well result in a longer sentence than would otherwise have been the case.  
     
      
    14 This seems to me to have been, in substance, the approach taken by the sentencing judge in the present case. He extended the sentence by a period to reflect the matter on the Form 1, but took the view that this was an extension which was significantly less than that which would otherwise have been imposed if the matter had been the subject of a substantive plea of guilty. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion, the approach of the sentencing judge was not contrary to authority. 
     
      
    16 The second ground of appeal which has been propounded is the more general proposition that a lesser penalty is warranted in law. The focus of the argument is on the applicant’s subjective circumstances. However, it seems to me that the sentencing judge has taken note of and given weight to all of the extenuating circumstances in a quite explicit manner. In particular, he had taken note of the early plea of guilty and awarded a twenty-five per cent discount as a result. He has noted the contrition of the applicant; his admissions to the police; his genuine efforts of rehabilitation and undertaking further study; other subjective factors, such as social isolation and poor self-image; the support of his relatives; and the absence of a prior criminal history. His Honour also noted the absence of a prior sexual experience. However, it has been concluded that the applicant understood that what he did was wrong and that this was no mere sexual experimentation. 
     
      
    17 A fair reading of the Remarks on Sentence would indicate his Honour gave conscientious thought to a sentence that might be appropriate in the circumstances of what was a serious case, albeit one with the extenuating factors mentioned. This is not a case of mental or intellectual disability, and in fact the applicant was of above average intelligence. It is true that the applicant was to be regarded as a juvenile, as the sentencing judge prescribed, but he was approaching adulthood. I think it is appropriate that he serve the sentence in a juvenile institution.  
     
      
    18 As I have said, I think the non-parole period, whatever view one might take of the head sentence, was relatively lenient and there is force in the submission of the Crown that the non-parole period was at the lower end of the range for offences of this type. 
     
      
    19 In the result, it is my view that the Crown submission is correct that no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing process in this case and I would conclude that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    20 GROVE J: I would only wish to recapitulate, as has been mentioned by Shaw J, that the victims in this case were two little girls aged five years. 
     
      
    21 For myself, I find it impossible to come to a conclusion that the penalty imposed is one which was excessive to the extent that a lesser penalty would be warranted in law. 
     
      
    22 I agree with the orders proposed and those will be the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      O’KEEFE J:  
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of five years. 
     
      
    2 On 15 October 2001, Toufic Zreika (the Applicant) who is 26 years of age, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a letter with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced by Chief Judge Blanch (the Judge) to a fixed term of imprisonment to commence on 5 December 2006 and expire on 4 December 2011. The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  
     
      
    3 The circumstance which caused the sentence to be fixed to commence so far in advance of the date of its imposition was that at the time the Applicant was serving sentences of imprisonment for 10 years, 12 years and a fixed term of five years. Taken as a whole, these sentences commenced on 5 June 1999 and were to expire on 3 November 2013, with non parole periods of 7 years and 6 months (to expire on 4 December 2006) and 6 years and 11 months (to expire on 4 November 2013) respectively. The fixed term of imprisonment for five years was ordered to be served concurrently with these sentences. The sentence the subject of the present appeal was thus due to commence on the expiration of the Applicant’s non parole period in respect of the offence for which he received a sentence of 10 years. 
     
      
    4 The Statement of Facts before the Judge revealed that on 30 July 1996 the Applicant had been involved in an incident arising out of a drug deal with a man named Bessounian. Bessounian gave the Applicant a large sum of money for the purchase of a quantity of drugs on the understanding that the Applicant would return with the drugs a short time after the money had been handed over. The Applicant did return, but instead of handing over the drugs, he shot Bessounian six times. Bessounian survived and identified the Applicant.  
     
      
    5 The Applicant, who had decamped to Melbourne, was extradited on 16 December 1996 and charged with the attempted murder of Bessounian. Some six days before his trial was due to commence, the Applicant approached Bessounian in the street and threatened him. The next day, namely 25 March 1998, the Applicant ambushed Bessounian and shot him a further five times. Bessounian survived this shooting as well, but was unable to identify the Applicant because his assailant wore a balaclava. The Applicant was charged with threatening Bessounian, and at a later date was charged with shooting with intent to murder Bessounian on 25 March 1998. 
     
      
    6 The charge in respect of the second shooting was laid because the Applicant had confided to his then girlfriend, Ms Melanie Cetinich, that he was the person who had shot Bessounian twice. The Applicant and Ms Cetinich had a falling out, and she threatened to go to the police. On 5 June 1999, Ms Cetinich had a number of shots fired at her at close range as she sat in her car on the driveway of her home. One of the shots caused a head injury, however she survived and gave a statement to the police inculpating the Applicant. He was arrested, charged and refused bail.  
     
      
    7 On 20 February 2000, whilst in custody at the Cessnock Correctional Centre awaiting trial for the charges referred to in paragraph 5 above, the Applicant handed a number of handwritten pages to a prison officer to give to his family. He explained to the officer that the papers were of a legal nature and related to his current court case. He said that it was important that his father and brother (who were then visiting the prison) should be given the papers.  
     
      
    8 The officer’s suspicions were aroused, and the pages were forwarded to the police involved in the prosecution of the Applicant. They were found to include a request to the Applicant’s brother to contact a female associate of the Applicant so that she would ensure that certain wording, as detailed by the Applicant, was included in her statement of evidence for his forthcoming trial. The object of the wording he proposed for her statement was to discredit the evidence of Ms Cetinich and exculpate the Applicant. One of the pages contained an instruction: 
     
      
       
        
        “Destroy this page after you have memorised all its contents, don’t forget every detail.” 
        
       
      
    9 It was the actions referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 above that constituted the attempt to pervert the course of justice to which the Applicant pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    10 The Applicant was convicted of wounding with intent to murder, shoot with intent to murder and threaten witness on 7 July 2000 and was sentenced in the manner set out in paragraph 3 above. However, on 28 October 2002 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed his convictions and ordered new trials. These are scheduled for May 2003. The Applicant then applied to the Judge to adjust the sentence, relying on s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However on 6 December 2002, his Honour refused to do so on the basis that the power conferred by that section did not extend to the instant case and he was functus officio. On 20 December 2002 the Applicant was successful in having the Court of Criminal Appeal vary the sentence imposed in respect of the offence the subject of the present appeal by ordering that it commence on 5 June 1999 and expire on 4 June 2004, pursuant to the powers conferred by s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    11 The power conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal by s 59 of that Act is limited. Whilst the Court may vary the date of commencement of any consecutive sentence that had been imposed (s 59(1)), it has no power under the section to vary the term of a sentence, or the non parole period of a sentence (s 59(5)). 
     
      
    12 Shortly after the Court of Criminal Appeal had quashed Applicant’s convictions and ordered new trials, he gave notice of intention to appeal in respect of the sentence now under consideration. 
     
      
    13 The Applicant relies on two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (i) the Court should intervene and pass a sentence which includes a non parole period; 
       
       
      (ii) in the alternative, some other sentence less severe than that imposed is warranted in law and should be imposed. 
       
      
    14 The Crown does not oppose the application, provided that the non-parole period remains at five years. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    15 After the Court had reserved its decision, the parties were asked to file additional written submissions addressing the jurisdiction of the Court to intervene in relation to the sentence imposed on the Applicant as it now stands. The sentence in the present appeal was imposed on 15 October 2001; its commencement date varied on 20 December 2002. The Notice of Appeal was filed on 1 November 2001. It is thus within time. 
     
      
    16 The appeal is brought pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the Court: 
        
       
       
        
        (c) with the leave of the Court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction.” 
        
       
       
      The power of the Court to deal with such appeal is set out in s 6 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912. Relevantly it provides: 
       
       
        
        “(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence the Court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case may dismiss the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    17 The exercise of the power conferred by s 6 does not involve the Court in merely substituting its own view for the view taken by a Trial Judge. The sentencing process involves an exercise of judicial discretion, and the Court will intervene only if error is demonstrated. Where it has, the Court may “pass some other sentence … warranted in law … in substitution” for the sentence imposed the Trial Judge. (s 6(3)) Such an approach to the exercise of the relevant power is consonant with the general approach taken by appellate courts to the interference with discretionary decisions of lower courts. The principles in this regard are set out in the much quoted case of House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, in which it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the Judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary Judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable and plainly unjust the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” (supra at 505 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ) 
        
       
      
    18 The manifest excessiveness of a sentence involves a question of law, even though specific error cannot be pointed to. It is within the third category of error referred to in House v The King (supra) (Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). 
     
      
    19 The sentence imposed on 15 October 2001 was not attended by relevant error at the time of its imposition. What has happened is that the circumstances have changed since it was imposed. Had those changed circumstances been in force at the time of sentence, they may not have justified the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of five years – ie, with no parole period being set. However a change of circumstances may not make that which was not erroneous at the time it was done erroneous retrospectively. It was because of concerns of such a kind that the Court sought further submissions from the parties.  
     
      
    20 In the further submissions filed on behalf of the Crown, no objection was taken to the Court admitting evidence of the changed circumstances and acting on such evidence if the interests of justice so indicated. It was conceded on behalf of the Crown that the evidence of changed circumstances “would lay sufficient foundation for (the) Court to intervene.”  
     
      
    21 The Court has intervened in other cases that have aspects similar to the present case. In Corbett ([2002] NSWCCA 137, 19 April 2002, unreported) this court exercised jurisdiction to determine an application for leave to appeal against a sentence that was unexceptional when it was imposed, but carried a different connotation after convictions for other matters for which sentences had been imposed at the time had been quashed. The Applicant had been convicted on one count of indecent assault, and two counts of carnal knowledge. He was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months in respect of the first conviction, and to concurrent terms of four years in respect of the other convictions. Parole periods were set in respect of the two lastmentioned convictions, however because the sentence on the first conviction was for fixed term, no parole period was fixed. On appeal, the conviction in respect of the charge of indecent assault was quashed and the sentence set aside. The Court then considered the sentences which had been imposed in respect of the other two offences. Smart AJ (which whom Sully J agreed; Handley JA dissenting) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In general, my mind baulks at a result whereby an offender receives the same effective sentence for two offences as he did for three where it is held that the conviction on the third offence was not reasonably supported by the evidence. This is despite the fact that the sentence for each offence must be looked at individually. I accept that there may be cases where there ought to be no adjustment of the sentences where a conviction on one offence is set aside but the convictions on other offences remain and all sentences are concurrent.” (at para 66) 
        
       
       
      In the result, the appeal against sentence was allowed in that case, and shorter sentences were substituted. There is no suggestion in the decision that the sentences imposed were excessive at the time they were imposed; rather they became excessive by virtue of matters arising subsequent to their imposition – ie, the quashing of one of the convictions had the effect of warranting in law a less severe sentence than that imposed (s 6(3)). 
       
      
    22 In Regina v Grant (2002) 55 NSWLR 80, this Court considered a case in which the Appellant had been convicted on a count of murder and a count of shooting with intent to murder, and had been sentenced to 18 years imprisonment in respect of the first charge (with a non-parole period fixed) and a fixed term of 5 years in respect of the second charge. On appeal, the conviction in respect of the first charge was allowed and the conviction and sentence were quashed. The appeal on the second charge was dismissed, however in those circumstances the Court found it necessary to consider the fixed term sentence that had been imposed. Wood CJ and CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and David Kirby J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since I am of the view that the appeal should be upheld in relation to Count 1, but dismissed in relation to Count 2, it is necessary to consider the sentence imposed for that count. That arises by reason of the circumstance that the Appellant was sentenced … to a fixed term, no doubt in recognition of the fact that it would be wholly absorbed in the sentence imposed for Count 1, which was partially cumulative on it. His Honour, it may be assumed … fixed a sentence which he otherwise considered appropriate for Count 2. … If the Court were now to set a non-parole period in respect of this Count, it would result in a sentence that was manifestly lenient for a serious offence of shooting with intent to murder. In these circumstances, and taking into consideration s 44(1) and s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I would accordingly decline now to vary the sentence imposed by fixing a non-parole period.” (supra at 108) 
        
       
      
    23 The above passage accepts that the Court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence, although it was not manifestly excessive or subject to other error of law at the time it was imposed, where such sentence did not have a non-parole period set because the sentence was subsumed in another sentence that was later quashed on appeal. Whilst the Court in that case did not vary the sentence, it did not do so for discretionary reasons, not for jurisdictional reasons. 
     
      
    24 Section 52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 empowers the Court in an appeal against sentence to set a non-parole period, even though a non-parole period has not been set by the sentencing Court. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion, the Court has jurisdiction to review the sentence in circumstances such as those involved in the present case, and should do so if it would be in the interests of justice. In my opinion, it is in the interests of justice for the Court to exercise such jurisdiction in relation to the present appeal. 
     
      
       
       
      As to (i) 
       
      
    26 It was contended on behalf of the Applicant that the Judge imposed a fixed sentence because of the provisions of s 45(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence … a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the offence if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so:  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender.” 
        
       
      
    27 This contention is supported by the words in the Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “I convict the prisoner. I sentence him to a sentence of five years imprisonment  
        by way of a fixed term  
        commencing on 5 December 2006 and to be concurrent with the sentence imposed from that day. It is to be a  
        fixed term  
        because it is to be served totally concurrently with that sentence 
        . 
        ” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    28 Not only did the Judge describe the sentence as a fixed term, but he also stated his reason for imposing it, as required by s 45(2). The effect of the words of sentence referred to above, in my opinion, clearly involved an exercise of the power conferred by s 45(1)(b) of the Act.  
     
      
    29 This conclusion does not of itself, however, establish the second proposition that was advanced; namely that the Court should proceed on the basis that five years imprisonment was the maximum sentence that his Honour would have imposed had the sentence in question been the only sentence under consideration.  
     
      
    30 The Crown argues that his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence, including the actual words used when imposing the sentence, support the conclusion that the term of five years was not intended to be the total sentence, but was intended to be the minimum term. It should be noted, however, that his Honour has not expressly stated that the fixed term is intended to be the equivalent of a minimum term.  
     
      
    31 In Thomas (1993) 65 A Crim R 269, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Grove and James JJ agreed), said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a sentencing Judge is dealing with concurrent sentences of unequal length, or cumulative sentences, so that any additional terms upon the shorter or earlier sentences would be of no utility (because the prisoner will still be in custody) it is appropriate … for the Judge to set a fixed term for the length of what would otherwise have been the appropriate minimum term. … The Judge should, however, when giving the reasons … for setting the fixed term, state expressly that the fixed term is intended to be the equivalent of such a minimum term. It would not be appropriate in such circumstances to impose a fixed term for what would otherwise have been the total sentence of the Court.” (at 275-276) 
        
       
       
      This decision militates against the submission by the Crown that his Honour intended the five year fixed term to be the minimum term, and that this Court should treat it as such. 
       
      
    32 The Applicant submits that an examination of the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission tends to support the conclusion that the intent of the Judge was that the fixed term of five years was to be the maximum sentence.  
     
      
    33 Caution should be exercised in relation to the use that is made of such statistics. It should be remembered that the factual circumstances in the individual cases included in the statistics are not known. Furthermore, in some instances the number of cases involved is small, in which event absence of knowledge of the factual circumstances, particularly where outliers are concerned, may render the statistics of limited, if any, value. Notwithstanding this caveat, it is appropriate to examine the statistics in relation to the subject offence and cognate offences.  
     
      
    34 In the period from July 1995 to June 2002, the number of cases included in the statistics relating to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice was only four. Two of these (50%) resulted in terms of imprisonment being imposed. Those terms were: in one case, 6 months; in the other, 2 ½ years. The non-parole, or fixed or minimum terms, were 6 months in one case, and 18 months in the other. This indicates that in the first-mentioned case, the sentence imposed was a fixed term. 
     
      
    35 In the period from July 1995 to June 2000, the number of cases included in the statistics relating to attempts to pervert the course of justice was 97. In 28 cases (29%), terms of imprisonment were imposed. No head sentence exceeded 5 years. A term of imprisonment of 5 years was imposed in only one case. Whilst it was argued that the case in which such term was imposed was the present case, there is no actual evidence that identifies the case referred to in the statistics as the present case. However, the argument does appear to receive some support from the accompanying statistics relating to Non-Parole Periods, Minimum Terms and Fixed Terms, since there is only one such case, and it constitutes 4% of the total of 27 cases dealt with in that part of the statistics.  
     
      
    36 When regard is had to the statistics, imprisonment for five years is seen to be the heaviest penalty imposed in the 28 cases covered by that part of the statistics that deals with Head Sentences / Full Terms. This period coincides with the longest Non-Parole Period / Minimum Term / Fixed Term in the 27 cases dealt with in the part of the statistics that deals with such matters. Since there is no head sentence in the statistics that would support a non-parole period of 5 years, the conclusion flows that the 5 year period referred to in the second part of the statistics is or is at least likely to be in the category of Fixed Term rather than in the categories of Non-Parole Period or Minimum Term.  
     
      
    37 The Crown argues that since his Honour stated that the five year fixed term was imposed because it was to be served concurrently, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I must confess that had it not been for the late charging of this matter, I would have been inclined to fix a sentence which did extend the non-parole period by a short term such as three months or six months.  
        
       
       
        
        However, because of the late charging in my view that should not happen at this stage.” 
        
       
       
      the inference should be drawn that the term of 5 years was intended to be the non-parole period. I do not think that this inference is justified, particularly when regard is had to the statistics of which his Honour was no doubt aware. 
       
      
    38 In my opinion, the fixed sentence of five years imprisonment should be treated as the maximum sentence intended by the Judge.  
     
      
    39 It is reasonably clear that the Judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment as the appropriate sentence because of the other sentences with which it was to be concurrent. The quashing of the convictions and sentences in respect of those other offences creates an entirely new factual matrix or changed circumstances in which the sentence to be imposed on the Applicant is to be seen. No question of concurrence arises. In the changed circumstances, the provisions of ss 44(1) apply and a non-parole period should be set, unless there is a reason for not doing so which falls within the provisions of s 45 of the Act. The only provision of s 45(1) which could have possible application in the present case would be that in s 45(1)(c), namely that it appears to the Court that it is appropriate to decline to set a non-parole period for any reason other than those specified in s 45(1)(a) and (b). In my opinion this is not such a case. If the Applicant had not been the subject of other sentences on 15 October 2001, he would have been sentenced in the ordinary way under the regime then in force, namely to have the term of his sentence set and then have a non-parole period determined. In the changed circumstances there is not, in my opinion, any reason to depart from the provisions of s 44 of the Act, that is, and decline to set a non-parole period. 
     
      
    40 For the foregoing reasons I propose that a non-parole period should be set and, there being no special circumstances, such non-parole period should be 3 years nine months. It should commence on the date on which the sentence of 5 years has now been fixed to commence, namely 5 June 1999, and expire on 4 March 200, on which date the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
     
      
    41 BELL J: I agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court at Bathurst on 15 November 2001 on the applicant Adam James Reilly. The applicant came before the District Court on that occasion in respect of four offences. The first, breaking entering and stealing committed on 1 January 2000. The second, possessing goods reasonably suspected of having been stolen committed on 29 February 2000. The third, driving a motor vehicle whilst disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence committed on 18 March 2000. The fourth, breaking and entering and stealing committed 14 March 2001. 
     
      
    2 In his remarks on sentence, the learned District Court Judge set out the details relating to those offences. In relation to the first offence of break and enter, that matter was before the court in that the applicant had been dealt with by a magistrate in the Local Court and sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non parole period of six months and had appealed that sentence to the District Court. 
     
      
    3 On that appeal a District Court judge had dismissed the appeal, confirmed the conviction and sentence but suspended the sentence for two years conditionally upon the applicant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for those two years. The applicant had breached that bond and that was what caused the matter to come before the District Court on 15 November 2001. The offence in that case involved stealing property from a house.  
     
      
    4 In relation to the offence of possessing goods reasonably suspected of having been stolen the applicant had been sentenced by a magistrate in the Local Court at Orange to imprisonment for a fixed period of six months. He had again appealed to the District Court. His appeal was dismissed, a conviction was confirmed but the sentence was set aside and in lieu thereof the court deferred passing sentence conditionally upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. He had breached the bond. The position is similar in this regard to that which prevailed in respect of the previous conviction to which I have referred. 
     
      
    5 The offence of driving a motor vehicle whilst disqualified came before a magistrate in the Local Court at Orange and the applicant had received a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period of six months and a disqualification. Again he appealed and again sentence was deferred although the appeal dismissed and the conviction confirmed and again a two year bond was imposed. Again there was a breach and the position is similar to that on the offences I have earlier referred to. 
     
      
    6 There was in addition an offence of having custody of a knife in respect of which he had been sentenced by a magistrate in the Local Court on 14 September 2001 and was fined $200 and ordered to pay court costs. He had not appealed against that sentence. That offence constituted a breach of the bonds entered into by him on 4 December in respect of those offences to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    7 When in prison in relation to an offence of demanding $200 cash with menaces intending to steal the money, said to be committed on 14 April 2001, the applicant was charged with an offence of breaking into and entering the home of a Mr. Babicci at Orange on 14 March 2001 and stealing his property. When charged with that offence the applicant was serving a sentence for a period of two years with a non parole period of six months imposed upon him in the Local Court at Orange for that offence of demanding money with menaces. He had not appealed the sentence imposed by that magistrate. That offence constituted a breach of the bonds entered into on 4 December 2000 also. 
     
      
    8 In the Local Court, the offender had initially pleaded guilty to the offence of breaking into and entering the home of Mr. Babicci. That offence is punishable by a maximum of 14 years when dealt with, as here, in the District Court. That offence also constituted a breach of the bonds.  
     
      
    9 In consequence of all that complex of matters it was necessary for the trial judge to examine the appropriate sentence to be imposed for that break and enter offence, albeit it was necessary for him also to have regard to the sentence imposed for the first break and enter offence and vary the apportionment of that sentence having regard to the necessity to impose a proper non parole and parole period. 
     
      
    10 His Honour said little concerning the facts of the offence. Shortly what the applicant had done had been to enter a home by forcing open the window lock of the bedroom and removing a lap top computer, luggage and sporting equipment, leaving however his fingerprints on the aluminium surface of a fly screen. When arrested he declined to be interviewed and in due course came forward to be dealt with on his plea before the magistrate for the matter. 
     
      
    11 The learned trial judge had regard when determining the appropriate sentence to the specific criteria set out in his judgment, and in particular the criteria set forth in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Relevantly to the grounds of appeal he said in relation to rehabilitation:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is difficult to see that the offender is motivated towards rehabilitation. He was given, what his Honour Judge Gibson described as, a last chance to turn over a new page in his book of life and yet he rejected that chance. I doubt that he [is] motivated toward rehabilitation. I suspect that as history has the habit of repeating itself, his criminal history will repeat itself on his being released from prison.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour referred to the applicant’s early plea and an entitlement to the applicant receiving a maximum discount of 25% on the basis of it having “the greatest utilitarian value”. Further his Honour said in relation to the offender’s contrition:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that, as a principle, a guilty plea carries with it an indication of an offender’s contrition. I really doubt, however, that the offender is contrite for the breaking, entering and stealing offence committed by him on 14 March 2001 because he, being a drug addict, and lacking the wherewithal with which to obtain his drug of choice, would be unlikely to give a moment’s thought to whoever it was or from wherever it was that he obtained property to get money in order to obtain his drug of choice.” 
        
       
      
    13 The sentences imposed by his Honour resulted in the applicant having to serve an effective sentence for this batch of crimes of some five years with a non parole period of two and a half years. The instant sentence on which he appeals was a sentence which was divided into a non parole period and a parole period as follows. A non parole period of one year and six months imprisonment to commence on 14 April 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2003. A parole period of two years and six months to commence on 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 April 2006, that is to say a sentence of four years with a non parole period of 18 months if considered discretely. 
     
      
    14 The submissions made in respect of the sentence imposed require one to have regard to the complex of sentences to which I have referred and in particular to have that regard when considering the submission that the sentence, when considered in totality with the other sentences, was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    15 His Honour had said, when passing sentence, that, as the offender was liable to the sentences that had been suspended arising from his breach of the bond and the sentence that his Honour proposed to pass, and that his Honour proposed to accumulate the sentences, the fact of accumulation was a special circumstance which permitted his varying the otherwise statutory apportionment of the non parole and parole period. It was this matter that gave rise to the proportions of non parole to non parole period to which I have referred. 
     
      
    16 It is submitted that his Honour erred in failing to find or consider properly the applicant’s contrition as a mitigating factor. It is submitted further that insofar as his Honour did find contrition that insufficient weight was given to it. It is contended that the sentencing judge erred in “taking into account that there was no contrition at the time of the offence and not taking into account the contrition displayed at the time of sentencing”. 
     
      
    17 The contrition displayed at the time of sentencing which is presumably also the matter to which reference is made in the other submissions contending that there was an absence of contrition or that such contrition was not properly considered is said to be evidenced in the hand written letter from the prisoner’s mother and the evidence of the applicant given at the sentencing hearing.  
     
      
    18 On a fair reading of the applicant’s evidence, he said he had been involved substantially in taking prohibited drugs when a youth, had received the benefit of the bonds and the suspended sentence to which I had referred and he said, when asked, “Well why didn’t you remain on good behaviour?"", ""I just wasn’t myself when I was using the drugs and I was doing stupid things, things I regret doing now"". He had said that it did not make him feel good to be in custody for so long and that he intended attending drug and alcohol counselling to do whatever he could not to go back on the drugs, that he had a motivation for committing the offences to get money for drugs and that these were isolated offences committed by him for that purpose. He expressed the view that he thought he was able to stop using drugs. 
     
      
    19 Before us it has been submitted on his behalf that it can be assumed that whilst he was in custody he was drug free and that we should assume that due to the passage of time he has been drug free longer now than he had been before the trial judge. For myself I am not content to make any such assumption as critically important to the outcome of this appeal, particularly not in the absence of other evidence. 
     
      
    20 The finding of the presence or absence and the degree of contrition is a matter of fact for a trial judge. I am unable to conclude that his Honour erred in his treatment of the presence, absence or weight to be afforded to contrition when having regard to what his Honour said in his remarks on sentence and the material that was before him on that issue. 
     
      
    21 In particular the assumption that there is a principle that requires the court from such as was said by the applicant to conclude that there was contrition available at that time is one that I am not prepared to make. 
     
      
    22 The further submission is made that the sentencing judge failed to properly consider the issue of rehabilitation by failing to place appropriate weight on the subjective factors. The sentencing judge in that regard made the remark to which I have referred earlier concluding that it was difficult to see that the offender was motivated toward rehabilitation.  
     
      
    23 Given that it is particularly important in sentencing young persons to have regard to their prospects for rehabilitation and that the applicant has apparently, whilst in custody, done many courses, nonetheless it was entirely open to the trial judge to reach the conclusion that he did, particularly in the context of the numerous instances of criminality which had brought the offender before the trial judge on the instant occasion and particularly having regard to the applicant’s extensive record. 
     
      
    24 The remaining submission concerned the sentence being manifestly excessive in the circumstances taking into account all factors relevant at the time of sentencing. A particular point was made in support of that contention that the effect of the applicant’s breach of the bonds which resulted in the suspended sentences being reactivated was that the applicant was punished not only for the original crimes by having to serve the sentences which were suspended but also for the crimes which constituted the breaches of the recognisances in each case and that those penalties were effectively made cumulative or at least to some considerable extent. 
     
      
    25 For my part I see no problem there. That is what happens when the leniency that was extended by the original sentencing district court judge, Gibson, J., is abused. The mechanism of reactivation of the suspended sentence does not require that a lesser sentence be passed upon a person who, by committing a crime, breaches an entitlement to conditional liberty as would be the case if the point were upheld. True it is that the totality principle still prevails to ensure that the sentence overall does not attain an artificial substantial gravity. But that is a different thing to suggesting that the consequences of the breach should not be visited upon the applicant in circumstances such as these. 
     
      
    26 When I have regard to the totality of criminality and further to the applicant’s record, when I have regard to the matters that set the context before the learned trial judge, I cannot conclude that the sentence is excessive. 
     
      
    27 In the circumstances I would propose, since the matter has been fully argued, that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    28 JAMES J: I agree and the orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HEYDON JA: On 19 September 2001 the appellant was convicted on 23 counts of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 after a trial presided over by Judge J B Phelan DCJ lasting eleven days. He appeals against conviction on the ground that the jury verdict “was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence”.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 Each of the 23 charges took the same form, namely that on a particular date in a series of dates between 7 September 1993 and 27 August 1997, he dishonestly obtained a financial advantage to the extent of a particular sum of money by “pretending to Arthur Kostandinu that there was a real threat to his person which could be prevented by the payment of money” to the accused.  
     
      
    3 The essential facts as the trial judge saw them are recorded thus in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts are somewhat complex. The charges relate to a series of dates running from 7 September 1993 through to 27 August 1997. The victim is the uncle of the prisoner and they had had a close association throughout their lives. 
        
       
       
        
        The first count involved a demand for $20,000, it being represented by the prisoner that some third parties, mostly referred to as the Rebel Motorcycle Club and sometimes the Mafia, were demanding payment of money for protection. That is to say that if the money was not paid the victim would be shot in the kneecaps or possibly some worse action than that. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim said that he was in fear and he accepted right up until towards the end that his person was under threat. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence suggests that on the various dates involved that sums of money, which I will read onto the record, were paid on these dates; 7 September 1993, $20,000; 25 July 1994, $160,000; $1,800 on 30 December 1994; $90,000 on 13 March 1995; $3,600 on 5 April 1995; $1,500 on each of the dates 2 May and 29 June 1995; $30,000 on 4 September 1995; $1,200 on each of the dates 29 February, 30 April, 25 May, 29 June 1996; payments of $1,500 on 23 August, 28 September, 14 October, 20 November, 25 December 1996 and $1,500 on 16 January 1997. 
        
       
       
        
        There were payments of $3,000 each on 3 March and 9 May 1997. $1,500 payments were paid on 28 June, 8 August and 27 August 1997. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown’s case depended upon the evidence of the victim as well as a conversation that took place between the victim, the mother and father of the prisoner and Father Cockayne, the prisoner being in contact with the group by way of a phone which could be heard in the room. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence was to the effect that Arthur Kostandinu had said something about not being able to continue making payments and that the prisoner had said that he would try and do something to help him. 
        
       
       
        
        That evidence was of itself not of conclusive interpretation, but the Crown primarily, apart from relying on the victim whose evidence, to say the least, was at some times shown to be poorly based or the subject of memory problems, was linked up with various payments that I have referred to and the lifestyle and financial records disclosed by the evidence relevant to the prisoner. 
        
       
       
        
        The starting point is that throughout the period, the prisoner and his wife received Newstart benefits from Centrelink starting in September 1993 and continuing until December 1997. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner’s wife received Parenting Allowance from 1994 until the end of 1997. During that period the most a couple with a child could earn before benefits ceased was a gross amount of $966.28 per fortnight. 
        
       
       
        
        Having received the proceeds of an AVCO cheque for $20,000 on or about 7 September 1993 the accused purchased a Harley Davidson motorcycle for $22,000. That could not be accounted for in any account held by the prisoner at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the payment of the $160,000 on 25 July 1994 the prisoner paid airfares and insurance [totalling] $4,088 on 26 October 1994. On 3 November he paid $13,800 into the National Bank Mastercard. On 23 December 1994 he exchanged and settled a purchase of a property at Batemans Bay. A letter from Smith Vandenberg Reid, solicitors, stated that it was anticipated that the prisoner would pay $81,455 on settlement. Settlement took place on 23 December and the vendor received $74,978.50. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner entered a mortgage with the vendor for $100,000. If paid on or before 12 May 1995 no interest was to be charged. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of purchase the prisoner still owned his Queanbeyan property which was mortgaged to the extent of $37,000. During the period 1 July 1994 to 1 January 1995 the highest amount held in the accused’s St George account was $2,308.92 and in his Westpac account $1,019.20. 
        
       
       
        
        The amount spent on the airfares, crediting MasterCard accounts and house purchase totalled $99,333 which could not be sourced from financial records, although the prisoner himself did say that his father had assisted him in relation to the airfare expenses. 
        
       
       
        
        On or about 13 March 1995 the amount of $90,000 was paid to Mrs J L Young for the discharge of the mortgage held by her over the prisoner’s property at Batemans bay. The victim had signed an authority on 10 March to pay $90,000 to the prisoner or at his direction. 
        
       
       
        
        On 28 March 1995 two cheques to J Young were forwarded which she banked on 30 March, one for $90,000 and the other for $9,100. The $9,100 could not be accounted for in the business financial records. Further, the financial records established that $90,000 was not repaid to the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the sale on 7 April of the prisoner’s Queanbeyan property after paying out the mortgage two cheques totalling $94,000 were paid into the prisoner’s Westpac account. 
        
       
       
        
        On 19 April 1995 the prisoner went to Coffs Harbour and purchased a boat and trailer for $30,000 by bank cheque. $20,000 appears to have come from the prisoner’s Westpac account. The other $10,000 could not be accounted for from his financial records, though a witness claimed to have supplied the difference. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not propose to examine in detail the smaller amounts that were paid on a regular mostly monthly basis. In relation to the prisoner being paid the $30,000 on or about 4 September the prisoner deposited $9,000 into a Westpac cash management account on 6 November. On 15 December $1,000 was paid into a Westpac account. On 28 December $9,200 was paid into a Westpac cash management account and on 29 January $5,500 into a similar account. 
        
       
       
        
        The total amount of the $24,700 could not be accounted for in the prisoner’s financial records. 
        
       
       
        
        Income tax returns from the prisoner for the period 30 June 1996 declared a taxable income of $8,505. For the financial year ending 30 June 1997 $6,752 was stated as income for him and $4,843 for his wife. 
        
       
       
        
        On 2 September 1997 the prisoner opened a Commonwealth Securities account which operated to 25 May 1998. In that period of time $112,596.20 was paid into the account. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner’s Westpac cash management account operated from 14 June 1995 until 14 January 1998. During that period over $166,000 was debited to the account. The account opened with $60,000 and at 14 January 1998 the balance was $62,171.08. 
        
       
       
        
        There was also evidence that the prisoner sought investment advice in relation to a large sum of money. So that in the absence of any other explanation as to where the money came from it seems to me to have been a very strong case against the prisoner despite some of the problems with the victim’s credibility. 
        
       
       
        
        Perhaps the background to the matter lay in the fact that the victim had apparently inherited a substantial sum of money or assets from his stepfather. He had invested money in properties, mainly flats and shops in the Queanbeyan area of which there were a large number. He himself followed the occupation of a real estate agent and it seems that in early years he was probably successful in that role. 
        
       
       
        
        But he had developed problems in his life, particularly with alcohol and with relationships. He literally threw his money about and he seems to have had a gambling problem as well.  
        
       
       
        
        At the beginning of the period relevant here he had loans totalling some $300,000 and by the time the period finished those loans had augmented to $843,000 and he afterwards became and is a bankrupt. 
        
       
       
        
        So that the prisoner who does not seem to have had such a start in life may well have had feelings of envy of his uncle and probably despised his lifestyle. The uncle appeared to be wealthy, enjoyed overseas holidays, womanising, drinking and also appears to have been somewhat paranoid. The prisoner appears to have assisted the victim in some ways and clearly enough appears to have had an influence over him and it was that knowledge of his paranoia and resentment which I suspect was at the nub of this crime. 
        
       
       
        
        It was never suggested that the threats that the victim said were addressed to him indeed came from the Rebels or from the Mafia and it was only towards the end of it that he began to realise that he was being duped by his nephew.” 
        
       
       
      The structure of the appeal 
       
      
    4 In order to understand the structure of the appeal, it is necessary to set out in detail how the Crown puts its case.  
     
      
       
      Count : $20,000 on 7 September 1993 
       
      
    5 Mr Kostandinu gave evidence to the effect that in June 1993 he received a threat from the father (Mr Gruber) of a former girlfriend (Ms Brown) from whom he had acrimoniously parted the previous month because she failed to become pregnant. The threat was that Mr Gruber would get his son Steven to bash Mr Kostandinu. (When Mr Gruber gave evidence he denied that threat.) On the next day Mr Kostandinu told the appellant of this, and the appellant asked him for $5,000 to prevent any harm coming to him. A week later, the appellant told Mr Kostandinu that there was a contract on Mr Kostandinu to blow his kneecaps off. The next day the appellant telephoned Mr Kostandinu, told him the hit men were named Mario and Angelo, and said he could buy the contract out for $35,000. On 7 September 1993 Mr Kostandinu obtained a cheque for $20,000 by way of loan from Avco Financial Services Ltd (a transaction of which there was documentary evidence), cashed it and gave it to the appellant; he said he would give it to the Rebels in Canberra. He said he gave the remaining $15,000 but was uncertain where it came from or when he gave it to the appellant. Mr Kostandinu said that the appellant told him that if he told anyone else about what was happening, he would be killed and the person he told would be killed as well.  
     
      
       
      Count 2: $160,000 on or about 25 July 1994.  
       
      
    6 From a time beginning a fortnight after 7 September 1993, Mr Kostandinu said the appellant kept talking about how good Mario and Angelo were at their work. The appellant and Mr Kostandinu agreed that the appellant would provide protection for three years at $40,000 per annum. Mr Kostandinu said he would need to arrange another loan. A loan from Outram Finance, Queanbeyan, was arranged but not provided for some time. On 27 September 1993 the appellant bought a motorcycle for $22,000. There was no evidence of the source of the money. In late 1993 and 1994 Mr Kostandinu had a fight with a man called John Leoniuk or “Jinx”. The appellant told Mr Kostandinu that the Rebels had fined him $10,000. The appellant also told Mr Kostandinu that he had to pay a fine of $27,000 for being late in commencing payment for the three year protection.  
     
      
    7 On 22 July 1994 Mr Kostandinu, after mortgaging some property, received a bank cheque for $286,240.45. A solicitor’s letter establishing that was in evidence. On 25 July 1994 Mr Kostandinu cashed a personal cheque and, according to his evidence, gave the appellant $160,000 in cash: $120,000 for three years’ protection, $10,000 for the Leoniuk fine, and $27,000 for the overdue payment fine. A figure of $3,000 “would have went to the rounding of the money up or towards the protection payments”. The cheque was in evidence, as was a Westpac statement showing the payment. Mr Kostandinu said they then went to the appellant’s house, and counted the money in the presence of the appellant’s wife. The appellant then said he would go to Canberra to deliver the money to the Rebels. He returned 2½ hours later and said he had.  
     
      
    8 On 26 October 1994 the appellant paid $4088 to a travel agent to pay for air fares to Athens for himself, his wife and a child. On 13 November 1994 the appellant paid $13,800 into a National Australia Bank Mastercard account. There was no evidence of the source of either sum of money. Most of the $13,800 was used up while the appellant was overseas in November–December 1994.  
     
      
       
      Count 3: $1,800 on or about 30 December 1994 
       
      
    9 Mr Kostandinu said he kept talking to the appellant about the Rebels. He asked the appellant how much life protection would cost, and the appellant said $250,000, payable over ten years at $1,800 per month. On 30 December 1994 he took $2,850 from a Westpac account, and wrote “A Brooks, caretaking” on the butt (an “alias name” – ie a non-existent person). These propositions were supported by documentary evidence. He said he paid $1,800 to the appellant.  
     
      
       
      Count 4: Payment of a $90,000 debt to Joy Young on 13 March 1995 
       
      
    10 On 23 December 1994 the appellant paid $81,500 ($76,000 deposit plus $825, $4650 stamp duty and $25 fees) in relation to the purchase by himself and his wife of a house at Bateman’s Bay pursuant to a contract made that day with Joy Young as vendor. The purchase price was $176,000. The appellant’s financial records do not reveal the source of the $81,500. The other $100,000 was financed, interest free, by a vendor’s mortgage, and was to be paid by 12 May 1995. In the event that the money was not paid by then interest was payable at 16% per annum. A transfer was executed on 23 December 1994.  
     
      
    11 In early March 1995, according to Mr Kostandinu, the appellant said “they” required a $40,000 advance on the life protection payments. The appellant said he would pay the money on Mr Kostandinu’s behalf, but that Mr Kostandinu would have to repay him with $10,000 interest before the settlement day on “a house down the coast”, ie the Bateman’s Bay purchase, in order to avoid penalty interest of $3,000 per month. (The actual penalty interest was 16% per annum, ie $16,000, about $1300 per month.) There are documents indicating that on 13 March 1995 Perpetual Trustees Australia Ltd advanced $150,000 to Mr Kostandinu by way of a loan on the security of a property he owned at 213 Crawford Street, Queanbeyan. After a fee and an advance interest payment were deducted, the sum of $148,300.03 was available. Of that sum, $90,000 was paid to Joy Young by Vandenberg Reid pursuant to a direction to Vandenberg Reid signed by Mr Kostandinu in the following terms: “You are hereby authorised and directed to pay from the advance the sum of $90,000.00 to Mr A Chacos or as he directs.” Mr Kostandinu said he agreed with Mark Phillips, a solicitor in Vandenberg Reid acting for the appellant, that $90,000 to be advanced to the appellant should be paid to someone in the firm. (Mr Phillips denied this.)  
     
      
    12 There is a document showing that on 14 March 1995 Vandenberg Reid received from the appellant and his wife $9100. The appellant’s records do not show where the money came from, nor whether Joy Young received the $10,000 still owing in relation to the $100,000 debt after Mr Kostandinu’s $90,000 was paid to her. Mr Kostandinu said that the $90,000 he paid was made up of $40,000 (advance on life protection), $10,000 (interest on the money requested by the appellant for having already paid that $40,000 on Mr Kostandinu’s behalf), $10,000 (to be given to the Rebels in order to silence the mother of a woman called Nina with whom Mr Kostandinu had a relationship: the mother had threatened to have him charged with rape) and $3,000 (at one stage Mr Kostandinu said this was a penalty which the appellant had to pay for being late in finalising the purchase of the Bateman’s Bay house, and at another stage he said it was payment for two months protection). He said he did not know what the balance of $27,000 was for. Mr Kostandinu admitted giving a different version earlier.  
     
      
       
       
      Count 5: $3,600 on 5 April 1995  
       
      
    13 Mr Kostandinu had an Advance Bank Visa card. An Advance Bank document shows that on 5 April 1995 he withdrew $3,800. He paid $3,600 to the appellant that day. He said that was two months’ protection at $1,800 per month (having just before said it was $3,000 at $1,500 per month). He kept the balance of $200. 
     
      
    14 On 7 April 1995 the appellant sold a Queanbeyan property for $137,000. On 7 April 1995 $84,528.22 from that source was deposited into his Westpac account 604049. On 11 April 1995 $9,982, from another source, was deposited in that account. On 19 April 1995 the appellant, who was still unemployed, bought a boat and trailer for $30,000 and withdrew $20,000 from the Westpac account. There was no evidence of the source of the other $10,000. 
     
      
       
      Count 6: $1,500 on 2 May 1995 
       
      
    15 Mr Kostandinu said that at some time the appellant told him the Rebels knew he was gambling heavily. The appellant and his wife made Mr Kostandinu write receipts for all cheques and “put [him] on a wage of $250 a week”. Mr Kostandinu protested about them “going through” his books. The appellant said he would arrange for Angelo to take over the protection for $1,500 per month while paying $300 to the Rebels. Thenceforth Mr Kostandinu only had to pay $1,500 per month. There are documents showing that on 2 May 1995 Mr Kostandinu cashed a cheque for $1,500; the butt showed a payment to D Olivarti for painting Flat 14 – another “alias name”. Mr Kostandinu said he paid the $1,500 to the appellant on 2 May 1995.  
     
      
    16 On 14 June 1995 the appellant transferred $60,000 from Westpac account 604049 to another Westpac account 10-8741, a cash management account, in which, prior to the transfer, there was a nil balance. 
     
      
       
      Count : $1,500 on 29 June 1995 
       
      
    17 There are bank documents revealing that on 29 June 1995 Mr Kostandinu cashed a cheque for $1,500. The butt showed a payment to D Olivarti for painting Flat 7. Mr Kostandinu said he paid the $1,500 to the appellant as payment for one month’s protection. 
     
      
    18 On 11 July 1995 the appellant made a purchase for $12,000 on his National Australia Bank Mastercard. Before the purchase there was a credit balance of $4,279.32. On 24 July 1995 the appellant paid $7,800 into the account, generating a credit balance of $29.40.  
     
      
    19 On 8 August 1995 the appellant bought a truck for $18,750, paying the price out of the Westpac cash management account.  
     
      
    20 On 22 August 1995 the appellant bought a car for $29,200, again paying the price out of the cash management account.  
     
      
       
      Count 8 
       
      
    21 This alleged a payment of $30,000 on 4 September 1995.  
     
      
    22 Mr Kostandinu sold 213 Crawford Street, Queanbeyan for $320,000. After Mr Kostandinu paid out the $150,000 mortgage, together with fees, he received $163,497.14. He told the appellant of this, and the appellant said Angelo wanted $30,000 paid towards Mr Kostandinu’s life protection. 
     
      
    23 There are bank documents showing that on 31 August 1995 the sum of $163,497.14 was paid into Mr Kostandinu’s ANZ account; that on 4 September 1995 he withdrew $30,000 in cash; and that on the cheque butt he wrote “paid off loans”. Mr Kostandinu said that in fact it did not pay off loans, but was paid to the appellant because Angelo wanted $30,000 of the protection money to be paid off. 
     
      
    24 Over the next four months the appellant made a series of payments as follows.

    25 After the payment of $30,000 on 4 September 1995, according to Mr Kostandinu, the appellant informed Mr Kostandinu that Angelo wanted only $1,200 per month. From that time on Mr Kostandinu said he marked the amount and date of seventeen payments he made on a manila folder. Most of these were the subject of counts 9 to 23. There are Advance Bank records revealing that on 29 February 1996 Mr Kostandinu withdrew $1,400 from an account. Mr Kostandinu said he gave the appellant $1,200 on the same day. 
     
      
       
      Count 10: $1,200 on or about 30 April 1996 
       
      
    26 Bank records reveal that a cash cheque for $1,200 was drawn on a Westpac account of Landeck Pty Ltd (which Mr Kostandinu said was a family company of his); Mr Kostandinu wrote on the cheque butt that the payee was “Pitchou” (another “alias name”) and he was paid for painting Flat 12. In fact the $1,200 was paid to the appellant.  
     
      
    27 Mr Kostandinu said that on 21 May 1996 he executed, at the appellant’s request, a document drafted by solicitors, namely Baker Deane & Nutt. He gave it to the appellant at Bateman’s Bay. On that occasion the appellant claimed to have found a “bug” under the driving seat. Mr Kostandinu had it independently examined and was told it was “a computer for a phone to voice alternation”. He refused to return it to the appellant and eventually gave it to the police. There was in evidence an unexecuted document said to be a copy of that executed on 21 May 1996. It purported to be an acknowledgement that Mr Kostandinu owed $300,000 to the appellant, to be reduced as repayments were made from time to time. Apart from the “protection contract”, Mr Kostandinu said he owed no money to the appellant.

      Count 16: $1,500 on or about 20 November 1996  
       
      
    37 On 20 November 1996, State Bank records reveal, $3,100 in cash was withdrawn from a Landeck Pty Ltd account, and on the same day, Westpac bank records reveal, the same sum was withdrawn from another Landeck Pty Ltd account. Mr Kostandinu said he paid the appellant $1,500 from one of these two sources but could not say which. $3,000 of the money was paid to the appellant in addition to find out who was bugging Mr Kostandinu’s telephone.

They also reveal that on 9 May 1997 Mr Kostandinu withdrew $1,500 in cash from a Landeck Pty Ltd account. Each cheque butt referred to payments to painters, but Mr Kostandinu said that in fact the money was used to pay protection money to the appellant for April and May.

    47 Westpac records reveal that on 27 August 1997 Mr Kostandinu withdrew $1,500 in cash from a Landeck Pty Ltd account. The cheque butt said it was to pay a painter, but Mr Kostandinu said that in fact the money went to the appellant. 
     
      
    48 On 27 August 1997 the appellant deposited $800 into his Westpac account 604049, Queanbeyan branch.  
     
      
       
      Events 29 August 1997-12 October 1998 
       
      
    49 On 29 August 1997 J B Were & Son prepared an investment plan for the appellant and his wife for the investment of $100,909. 
     
      
    50 Between 2 September 1997 and 25 May 1998, the appellant paid $112,596.20 into an account with Commonwealth Securities Ltd. A total of $75,002.87 was debited. Nearly $50,000 of that was paid into the appellant’s cash management account.  
     
      
    51 On 16 October 1997 the appellant transferred $28,570 from his Westpac cash management account to his Westpac account 604049.  
     
      
    52 On 5 November 1997 the appellant deposited $15,424.44 into his Commonwealth Securities share account. This money had been withdrawn from Westpac account 604049.  
     
      
    53 On 20 November 1997, the appellant deposited $13,000 into his Westpac cash management account, Queanbeyan branch.  
     
      
    54 Mr Kostandinu said that in late 1997 he became suspicious because he became aware that the $10,000 he had given to the appellant for transmission to the Rebels in order to be relieved of the problem of Nina and her mother was not in fact used for that purpose. Mr Kostandinu said he came to suspect that the appellant had been pocketing all the money which he had given him for protection and had not passed it on to any third party in order to obtain protection.  
     
      
    55 Mr Kostandinu said he discussed these matters with members of his family. The following day they met at the house of Father Cockayne. On the speaker telephone, Mr Kostandinu told the appellant that he could no longer pay the protection money. Mr Kostandinu said the appellant indicated that he would speak with Angelo. Father Cockayne gave evidence that he heard Mr Kostandinu tell the appellant that he could no longer continue to make payments, and heard the appellant say that he would see what he could do to help. (Father Cockayne gave two other pieces of evidence. One was that Mr Kostandinu told him that certain members of the Chacos family, including the appellant, owed him money. The other was that Mr Kostandinu told Father Cockayne that he was running out of money and that at least some of his money was going on paying for protection.) 
     
      
    56 On 11 December 1997 Mr Kostandinu prepared a handwritten document narrating the events of the previous four years. He made two copies of it. He also copied the manila file folder on which he had been recording the dates and amounts of payments. He made copies of the 21 May 1996 acknowledgement of debt document, prepared envelopes marked “to be opened only after the death of Arthur Kostandinu” and delivered one to Father Cockayne (as Father Cockayne confirmed) and the other to Mr Herrald, a local Queanbeyan solicitor. 
     
      
    57 On 30 January 1998 Mr Kostandinu went to Queanbeyan Police Station with a third envelope containing the materials just described, the “bug” recovered from his car, and the original manila folder. Detective Sergeant Nixon commenced taking a statement which took over three months to complete. 
     
      
    58 On 26 May 1998 the police executed a search warrant on the appellant’s premises in Bateman’s Bay. In an office in the garage they located a handwritten note with a number of figures on it (in particular the figure of $300,000 together with an interest rate which might correlate with the $300,000 on the 21 May 1996 document); a copy of the J B Were & Son $100,909 investment plan; Westpac Bank statements for account number 604049 and the cash management account (10-8741) – these statement sheets had handwritten annotations indicating what some of the larger amounts were used for, namely funding various purchases; and a tax assessment notice for the year ending 30 June 1997.  
     
      
    59 On 12 October 1998 the appellant and his solicitor went to Queanbeyan Police Station. He declined to be interviewed and was charged.  
     
      
    60 In short, then, there were two essential bases of the Crown case:  
     
      
       
      (a) Mr Kostandinu’s evidence of the fear implanted in him by the appellant which caused him to pay over $330,000 to the appellant between September 1993 and August 1997; 
       
       
      (b) the fact that although the appellant was unemployed and on social security from 1993 to 1997, he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on acquiring assets without any significant means of funding them save payments from Mr Kostandinu. 
       
       
      The appellant’s case at trial 
       
      
    61 Mr Kostandinu gave evidence in chief for about a day. He was forcefully cross-examined for about three days. The cross-examination attacked him by suggesting he was dishonest to the Australian Tax Office, was a heavy drinker, a big gambler and a womaniser; was in financial trouble well before he began dealing with the appellant, and it was this that led eventually to his bankruptcy; had given versions of events in his pre-trial statements different from those given in evidence; was motivated by hatred for the appellant and dislike of his family, whom he blamed for his mother’s death; and had given evidence containing internal inconsistencies.  
     
      
    62 The appellant did not give evidence in his own case, but did call some witnesses. The point of calling some of them was to seek to explain how a man like the appellant, living on social security, had possession of large amounts of money, which, if not explained, would tend to confirm Mr Kostandinu’s story. Mr Lipovski said he gave the appellant $13,340 to buy shares using his Commonwealth Securities Ltd account. Mrs King said that in October 1991 she paid the appellant $13,600 in cash for some furniture. Mr Volk said he paid the appellant $10,000 for a boat they purchased together; bought a van from him for $5,500 cash; and bought fishing equipment from him for $2,800. The appellant’s father said he gave financial help to the appellant (eg $23,650 for an overseas trip in 1994; a gift of a truck which the appellant sold for $14,000; and a gift of $10,000 to buy a truck). Another theme in the evidence of the appellant’s witnesses related to Mr Kostandinu’s tendency to gamble, drink and tip very heavily. 
     
      
    63 In short, the appellant attacked basis (a) of the Crown case by characterising Mr Kostandinu as a witness wholly lacking in credit and basis (b) by trying to establish a source of funds sufficient to explain how the appellant’s assets were acquired independently of any payments from Mr Kostandinu.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s essential approach on appeal 
       
      
    64 On appeal the appellant was represented by different counsel but each employed similar tactics. The appellant submitted that apart from a few items of evidence, the whole Crown case depended on accepting Mr Kostandinu’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It did not matter that the appellant had not contradicted Mr Kostandinu’s evidence; it collapsed of its own inanition. Mr Kostandinu was evasive, inconsistent and farcically unbelievable. He was motivated by hatred for the appellant and dislike for the appellant’s family. A man who had been a self-employed real estate agent for ten years and had inherited great wealth would not have been likely to have made the payments to the appellant which he alleged for the reasons supposedly urged on him by the appellant. His credibility was damaged by participation in tax frauds, by evasions and delays in providing evidence and by the differences in the various versions of events he gave to the police and to the court. He was contradicted on key issues by witnesses such as Mr Gruber and Mr Phillips. His claimed loss of money by paying the appellant could be explained by his drinking and gambling. The large sums which the appellant spent were sourced not from Mr Kostandinu but from property sales, assistance from others, and social security payments. Finally, Father Cockayne’s evidence did not point distinctly against the appellant. 
     
      
       
       
      The relevant test 
       
      
    65 The appellant is relying on s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which relevantly provides that this Court must allow the appeal if of opinion that the verdict was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”.  
     
      
    66 In M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493 Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ, after saying that “The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence”, continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      R v Dellapatrona 
       (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 141 Hunt CJ at CL, Abadee and James JJ said that a verdict would not be set aside as unreasonable simply because there is an attack on the credit of a vital Crown witness apparent from the transcript: “Very few trials are free from attacks upon the credit of a vital Crown witness. Everything depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the attack, its vitality and its proximity to the particular issue to which the evidence was relevant … .” 
       
       
      The sum of $90,000 paid to Joy Young 
       
      
    67 It was a central feature of the appellant’s arguments to this Court that while independent bank records show a pattern of Mr Kostandinu obtaining cash which was not inconsistent with him making cash payments to the appellant, there was no independent evidence that any of the payments said to have benefited the appellant actually did so, apart from the $90,000 used on 30 March 1995 to pay off part of the $100,000 debt which the appellant owed Joy Young as the unpaid purchase price of the property he bought from her at Bateman’s Bay. Counsel for the appellant said: “There was no dispute that $90,000 from the complainant went towards the property purchased by the appellant”. That concession is understandable given the Vandenberg Reid documents supporting it. It is further understandable in that there was no doubt that the appellant did buy land from Joy Young, and did owe $100,000; nor is there any doubt that if that money had not been paid by May, high interest would become chargeable. Counsel for the appellant also said: “The money was in fact returned, albeit after the conviction.”  
     
      
    68 It is difficult to see why the subsequent return of money allegedly obtained by deception should create a defence to the charge – particularly when the return is effected after the conviction, and the trial judge made an order that it be returned. It is also difficult to see why counsel asserted as a fact something which ex hypothesi was not a matter on which there could have been any evidence before the jury. This submission highlights the fact that this $90,000 advantage to the appellant is a powerful support for the Crown case. It is true that counsel for the appellant was able to point to numerous curious aspects of Mr Kostandinu’s evidence as to why he conferred that $90,000 advantage on the appellant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant alleged that $90,000 would be paid by him to the vendor but that the appellant did not want his name on any documents. The complainant then made the highly implausible claim that the solicitor then suggested that rather than using the appellant’s name, they could ‘ 
        put it in somebody else’s name that’s in the firm 
        ’ (T13.51. Firstly, the appellant’s name was used in the documents. Secondly, the solicitor [Mr Phillips] gave evidence and denied the allegation of the complainant. Thirdly, the money was not put in anyone else’s name, whether a member of the firm or otherwise. The money went directly to the vendor. The vendor had never worked for the firm. The evidence of the complainant was dishonest, self-serving and nonsensical. The jury ought to have rejected it. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant was asked in chief what the $90,000 payment comprised of. He claimed that the appellant told him that there was included $40,000 for life protection, $10,000 interest and another $10,000 for the Rebels to stop a lady making trouble for him. There was no explanation as to why the protection from this lady would not have been included in either the earlier $40,000 protection over three years or the $250,000 life protection or both. Of the $90,000 the complainant stated that he did not know where the unexplained $27,000 went (T 15.45).” 
        
       
       
      These are points of some potential effectiveness in relation to Mr Kostandinu’s reliability. There are possible answers to them developed by the Crown or otherwise available (Mr Phillips did only “part of the matter” and Mr Kostandinu may have made a mistake in the identity of the solicitor to whom he spoke; Mr Kostandinu’s story was confused, but substantial parts of it cohered with his other evidence). Let these potential answers be put aside for the moment. However contradictory or implausible Mr Kostandinu’s account of why he advanced the $90,000 was, the fact remains that he did advance it. What justification did the appellant have for receiving that advantage? Why would Mr Kostandinu have made that advance, particularly since it was part of the appellant’s case that he hated the appellant?  
       
      
    69 In oral argument counsel for the appellant said that the $90,000 was part of the “undisputed legitimate money” that came to the appellant in the period 1993-1997. But he did not say why it could be called “legitimate”. Counsel for the appellant was directly asked by a member of the court whether there was any explanation for why Mr Kostandinu provided $90,000 for the appellant. The answer was: “No. The decision was made not to call the accused.”  
     
      
    70 In supplementary written submissions filed at the direction of the court after the close of oral argument, counsel for the appellant repeated that there was no dispute about the $90,000 going towards the purchase of property for the appellant, and that the “money was in fact returned, albeit after the conviction.” This contention caused the Crown to file an affidavit dated 13 December 2002 sworn by Maria-Rosa Etnasios. In the circumstances I would grant leave for that affidavit to be relied on, and in a subsequent written submission counsel for the appellant said nothing to indicate that he opposed that course. The deponent of the affidavit was a solicitor with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions having carriage of the appeal. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That appeal was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 21 October 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to the hearing date, the Appellant filed and served a document entitled ‘Submissions for the Appellant’. 
        
       
       
        
        A submission appears therein at page 2.6 concerning the sum of $90,000. 
        
       
       
        
        That submission asserts that the sum of $90,000 was ‘returned’ to the victim, Arthur Kostandinu, after the conviction of the Appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        On 17 October 2002, I contacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Service by telephone on (02) 6270 3601, and spoke to Ben Bryce. Mr Bryce informed me, and I verily believe the same to be true, that no such monies had been paid to the Trustee in Bankruptcy in relation to Arthur Kostandinu. 
        
       
       
        
        At the hearing of the appeal on 21 October 2002, the Court directed the parties to file supplementary written submissions. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23 October 2002, I received a document entitled ‘Further Submissions for the Appellant’ in consequence of the directions given by the Court at the hearing of the appeal.  
        
       
       
        
        A submission appears therein at page 2.8 concerning the sum of $90,000. 
        
       
       
        
        That submission asserts that the sum of $90,000 was ‘returned’ to the victim, Arthur Kostandinu, after the conviction of the Appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        On 5 November 2002, I again contacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Service by telephone. I spoke to Peter Olsen who informed me, and I verily believe the same to be true, that no such monies had been received by the Trustee in Bankruptcy in relation to Arthur Kostandinu. 
        
       
       
        
        Annexed hereto and marked with the letter ‘A’ is a document from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Service dated 5 December 2002. That document confirms that no such monies have been received by the Trustee in Bankruptcy in relation to this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        On 13 December 2002 I again contacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Service by telephone. I spoke to Dianne Sebo who informed me, and I verily believe the same to be true, that no such monies had been received by the Trustee in Bankruptcy in relation to Arthur Kostandinu.” 
        
       
       
      The deponent’s summary of annexure A is correct.  
       
      
    71 On 17 December 2002 submissions prepared by counsel for the appellant were filed. They contain the following: “My understanding of the return of the $90,000 is clearly incorrect. It however has no effect on the conviction appeals. I apologise for the error.” If the fact of non-return of the $90,000 has no effect on the conviction appeals, it is hard to see how the allegation that the money had been returned had any effect either.  
     
      
    72 In my opinion the circumstances surrounding the $90,000 benefit are very powerfully confirmatory of the Crown case not only on count 4, to which it specifically relates, but generally. This episode is one in which objective documentary evidence established that on 23 December 1994 the appellant contracted to buy the Bateman’s Bay house and paid a $81,500 deposit on it. On that day he also agreed to pay the remaining $100,000 by 12 May 1995 on pain of high interest rates thereafter if he did not pay by that day. There was no possible reason why Mr Kostandinu should accommodate the appellant to the extent of $90,000 except for the reasons which Mr Kostandinu himself gave. The transaction by which the $90,000 benefit was conferred is entirely inconsistent with the appellant’s theory of the case as one brought by a vengeful liar against a man he hated; it is entirely consistent with the Crown theory of the case as one in which Mr Kostandinu trusted the appellant, believed his tales of the dangers facing Mr Kostandinu if protection was not obtained, believed that the appellant was procuring protection, and believed that large sums were needed to secure it at short notice. It would be astonishing if the jury had not concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the $90,000 advantage was provided because of some inducement along the general lines Mr Kostandinu gave evidence of, for there was no other explanation for such a step. That in turn reveals Mr Kostandinu’s state of mind to be one which makes more acceptable his evidence of his behaviour, and of the appellant’s behaviour, in relation to other counts. The understandable inability of counsel for the appellant to explain the $90,000 benefit receives heightened significance by attempts to contend that it was a “legitimate” advance which was repaid. If it was legitimate there was no need to repay it. If it was repaid that would have suggested that it should have been repaid, and that would have in turn suggested that there must have been something wrong about it.  
     
      
       
      Father Cockayne 
       
      
    73 It is desirable to examine Father Cockayne’s evidence in some detail. He said he was an Anglican priest who had known the Chacos and Kostandinu families for at least fifteen years, and had been involved in the appellant’s marriage ceremonies. He said that on one occasion in the later part of 1997 he was in his house in the company of Mr Kostandinu and Anne and Les Chacos (the appellant’s parents). Mr Kostandinu was on the telephone, but he could hear the appellant’s voice at the other end of the line. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. That telephone call could you hear the voice on the other end of that call? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. I could not hear it well but I could hear it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whose voice was that, did you recognise it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I believe it to be Arthur Chacos’ voice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And as far as that phone call’s concerned was that a phone call made from your phone or was it a phone call received from your phone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It would have been made from my phone. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was talking on the phone in your house? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Arthur Kostandinu. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall what was said? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I can’t recall a great deal, I’m not very good at recalling, it’s a priests fault but I believe they were speaking about money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well did you hear Arthur Kostandinu say something? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I think Arthur Kostandinu said something about not being able to continue making some payments. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. During that conversation did he say what the payments were for? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not to my recollection. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you recall hearing if Arthur Chacos said anything? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I believe he told him that he would try and do something to help him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now Ann and Les Chacos were they in the room at the time that that call was made? 
        
       
       
        
        A. They were. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is there anything else you recall being said on the course of that conversation? 
        
       
       
        
        A. On the telephone? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        A. I can’t recall, I know it wasn’t very easy to hear it was one of those phones that where it speaks out to the room but it wasn’t very clear, that was I think the gist of the conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So this particular phone had some sort of speaker on it that was audible? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Apart from the handset? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      That is evidence confirmatory of Mr Kostandinu’s testimony.  
       
      
    74 Father Cockayne gave further evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Around November/December 1997 did Arthur Kostandinu hand to you an envelope marked ‘Not to be opened until his death’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you subsequently handed that to the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Perhaps if this could be shown to the witness. Does that appear to be the envelope? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I believe so. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you look at the contents at all of that envelope? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No it was sealed.” 
        
       
      
    75 That too is evidence confirmatory of Mr Kostandinu’s testimony. 
     
      
    76 Counsel for the appellant cross-examined Father Cockayne, but not about that conversation or the handing over of the envelope.  
     
      
    77 In re-examination Father Cockayne gave a third relevant piece of evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You recall my friend asked and read part of your statement as to the latter part of 1997 you were aware that Arthur Kostandinu had financial problems, was that something that Arthur said to you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did he tell you what were his financial problems? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, you’re straying into the area of confessional -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I mean this is something you told the police in a statement? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s okay, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall what were his problems? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What he said, was his financial problems? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That he, well that he was running out of money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well did he tell you where his money was going? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well he told me that at least some of his money was going in on paying protection.” 
        
       
      
    78 Father Cockayne’s evidence about receiving the envelope has some importance in corroborating Mr Kostandinu’s evidence to that effect. His evidence about the telephone conversation and his evidence that Mr Kostandinu told him he was paying for protection gives very powerful support to Mr Kostandinu’s testimony. The appellant’s theory of the case is that Mr Kostandinu is delusional or maliciously motivated by hatred to lie; that Mr Kostandinu lost his money by his own folly, not by paying for protection; that Mr Kostandinu never gave any money to the appellant (apart from the $90,000); and that all Mr Kostandinu’s accounts of conversations which would have impelled him to make those payments are incorrect and perjured. Yet in the telephone conversation Mr Kostandinu said in effect that he had been making payments, and the appellant, by not denying this, admitted that Mr Kostandinu had been making payments to the appellant. The question of why, on the appellant’s case, Mr Kostandinu would do such a thing to a man he hated arises just as sharply here as it did in relation to the $90,000. The only explanation on the evidence is that the reason was to obtain protection via the appellant, and that explanation is confirmed by what Mr Kostandinu said to Father Cockayne as narrated in re-examination. 
     
      
    79 Mrs Chacos was not called, and hence she offered no contradiction of Father Cockayne’s account of the telephone conversation.  
     
      
    80 Mr Les Chacos was called. In chief he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you remember an occasion, and if you can tell us when it was please do, do you remember an occasion where Mr Arthur Kostandinu came to see you and [your] wife and made a complaint which involved money? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Can you repeat the question please. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember an occasion when Mr Kostandinu came to see you and your wife and made a complaint about money involving Arthur? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what it was he complained to you about? 
        
       
       
        
        A. About money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now can you be more specific as to what it was he said about money? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He said was, was lot of money he said, he’s lost a lot of money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that, he said what? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He’s lost a lot of money he said. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you thereafter go somewhere and in fact were you on that occasion present when Father Michael Cockayne was also present? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you have any recollection of a phone call which was made using a loudspeaker? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now were you able to hear what was aid on that occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No I can’t because it was on speakers and was very noisy. Father Michael tried to adjust the speakers and I couldn’t, couldn’t understand a thing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember any part of that conversation involving any of the speakers, any of the persons who were talking? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Like I said, it was not clearly at all the telephone conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you recognise the voice of Arthur Kostandinu at all? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It wasn’t Arthur Kostandinu, Arthur Kostandinu was in the room. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was speaking then on the phone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was Arthur, my son. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was he speaking to on the other end, do you know? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Was speaking on the, on the phone with just Father Michael.” 
        
       
      
    81 In cross-examination he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You were asked about Arthur complaining about money involving your son, is that right, towards the end of 1997 Arthur complaining, Arthur Kostandinu complaining about money and your son, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. What way? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were asked a question about Arthur Kostandinu coming and making a complaint regarding money involving Arthur -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – about money? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that as in 1997, towards the end of 1997, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’m not sure when it was? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That he was complaining that he was paying money to your son? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you – during the course of that complaining did you hear any word like contract being said? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Or harm, physical harm being said? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Or protection? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t hear anything like that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then there’s this occasion that you’re at Father Cockayne’s house, that’s right isn’t it and there’s a telephone call? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah, we did go there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you’re there with your wife? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Father Cockayne’s there? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And Arthur Kostandinu? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And this was all because, you were all there together because Arthur was complaining about he had been paying money to your son?

        Q. Well you’re in there in the room though aren’t you when this call came through?

        Q. Right okay, well Arthur Kostandinu’s voice isn’t coming over the speaker is it, he’s talking on the end of the phone because he’s there in the room with you, it’s your son’s voice coming over the speaker?

        A. Correct.

        Q. Well what you told us about the speakers being set up hearing your son’s voice and although not being able to make out the words, is this the same telephone call that Father Michael initiated, that is he rang your son? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He rang first because he wanted all of us to listen to hear what he was going to say so he put the phone down and told Arthur to ring us back.

        A. Like said, Father Michael, he was confused himself because like I said, none of us understood anything that was said on the telephone through the speakers. Father Michael said I wish we could understand what was going on.

        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    82 The jury were entitled to reject this evidence as entirely unconvincing both because of its terms and because Mr Les Chacos had had a brain tumour, had suffered memory loss and was on medication. No point arising out of Mr Les Chacos’s testimony was put to Father Cockayne in cross-examination. But even if Mr Les Chacos was correct in saying he could not hear what was said, he did not contradict Father Cockayne’s evidence.  
     
      
    83 Counsel for the appellant contended that that Father Cockayne’s evidence lacked weight because it used words like “think” and “believe”, and because he said the phone “wasn’t very clear”. However, the jury were entitled to accept Father Cockayne’s evidence, particularly in view of the fact that there was no cross-examination on it or contradiction of it. It in turn confirmed Mr Kostandinu’s evidence that he told the appellant in a telephone call in the presence of Father Cockayne and the appellant’s parents in chief that he could pay no more money.  
     
      
       
      The resources of the appellant 
       
      
    84 Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant received approximately $420,000 from sources other than Mr Kostandinu, and that this body of assets offered a sufficient explanation for the appellant’s dealings without having to search for an explanation in sums of money received from Mr Kostandinu. Counsel elected to leave out of account $20,000 advanced by the appellant’s parents for a family holiday only part of which went to the appellant and also small sums earned from the appellant’s removal business. In that respect counsel was realistic, and this Court may leave those matters out of account as well. The $420,000 figure was made up thus:

    85 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the $420,000 greatly exceeded the amounts said to have been received by the appellant from Mr Kostandinu.  
     
      
    86 The first flaw in this analysis is that it includes the $90,000 which on the Crown case was one of the dishonestly obtained payments, and which is wholly unexplained. The payment is totally supportive of the Crown case. That figure should not be taken into account. Eliminating it reduces the total figure in question to $330,000.  
     
      
    87 A second difficulty is that while persons who receive nothing but social security payments have to live on them, it is not easy to do so, and tempting not to do so if one has any liquid assets. It is safe to assume that at least $100,000 was spent in meeting day-to-day living expenses over four years. That reduces the relevant figure to $230,000.  
     
      
    88 A third difficulty is that with all respect to Mr Les Chacos, whose health had been poor, and whose bad health may have affected the quality of his evidence, there is no documentary confirmation of his evidence about the $14,000 received on the sale of the truck which he said he gave the appellant, or the $10,000 he said he gave the appellant to buy a truck. Similarly, there is no documentary confirmation of Ms King’s evidence about the $13,000 received on selling furniture.  
     
      
    89 A fourth difficulty is that the crucial period in the case is 7 September 1993 to 27 August 1997. About $75,000 was paid before this period and about $60,000 was paid after it. In different ways each of these sums has limited materiality.  
     
      
    90 Fifthly, a realistic endeavour by the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt by this analysis of non-Kostandinu sources of funds would have to rest on an integration of the flows in and the flows out as assets were purchased. This enterprise faces problems. For example, the evidence at the trial did not disclose the source of the funds with which the appellant purchased a Harley-Davidson motor cycle on 27 September 1993. The $20,000 which Mr Kostandinu said he paid on 7 September 1993 suggests the likely source.  
     
      
    91 Next, there are indications in the payments into his accounts by the appellant that the source was monies paid by Mr Kostandinu. Thus in November and December 1995 the appellant deposited $24,700 into two accounts in four payments. Counsel for the appellant submitted that one payment of $5,500 was for the van sold to Mr Volk. Even if that is so, deposits of that order of magnitude do not appear to have any ready source other than the periodical payments which Mr Kostandinu said he made to the appellant. There were no corresponding withdrawals from other funds. A car was said to have been sold on 3 November 1995, but no other funds were available except Centrelink payments. Similarly, on 28 August 1996 the appellant deposited $1,500 in the cash management account and on 10 September 1996 he deposited $2,495 in his ANZ Visa account. There were no corresponding withdrawals from other accounts. The evidence called by the appellant did not point to any possible source for those deposits. That left the monthly payments which Mr Kostandinu said he made as the only possible sources. Those payments were of a comparable size to the monies put into the appellant’s accounts.  
     
      
    92 Similarly, on 14 October 1996 Mr Kostandinu said he paid the appellant $1,500. On 15 October 1996 the appellant deposited $500 in his Westpac cash management account and on 16 October 1996 he deposited $280 in it. There were no corresponding withdrawals from other accounts, and it is highly likely that the source of these deposits was the $1,500 Mr Kostandinu said he handed over the day before.  
     
      
    93 The same thing happened in November 1996. On 20 November 1996 Mr Kostandinu said he paid the appellant $1,500. On 25 November 1996 the appellant deposited $500 in the Westpac cash management account and $100 in his Westpac account 604049. There are no corresponding transfers or withdrawals from his other accounts. As Crown counsel submitted, these amounts reflect deposits of not insignificant sums the source of which cannot otherwise be accounted for and which correspond in magnitude to the sums said to have been paid to the appellant by Mr Kostandinu. On the other hand, the financial position of the appellant was such as to preclude those amounts being deposited without recourse to other accounts or recourse to Mr Kostandinu. Thus they tended to corroborate Mr Kostandinu’s testimony. 
     
      
    94 The same reasoning applies in December 1996 and January 1997. On 25 December 1996, according to Mr Kostandinu, he paid the appellant $1,500 and he said the same in relation to 16 January 1997. On 12 February 1997 the appellant deposited $3,037.25 in his Westpac cash management account and on 7 February he deposited $100 in his Westpac account 604049. There were no corresponding transfers or withdrawals from his other accounts. Even if Mr Volk’s contention that he paid the appellant $2,800 for fishing equipment in early 1997 is right both as a matter of substance and as a matter of precise dating, $2,800 is less than $3,137. It is not possible to account for the making of the deposits without either sourcing them from other accounts, which did not happen, or sourcing them from Mr Kostandinu. 
     
      
    95 In relation to counts 19-23 there is a somewhat more complex but similar pattern. On 3 March 1997, according to Mr Kostandinu the appellant received $3,000. On 6 March 1997 the appellant deposited $500 in his Westpac cash management account. There were no corresponding transfers or withdrawals from other accounts. On 10 March 1997 the account of the appellant’s parents had a cheque for $500 deposited into it. On 20 March 1997 the appellant received a cash gift of $400 from his parents. On 9 May 1997 Mr Kostandinu, on his account, paid the appellant $3,000. On the same day the account of the appellant’s parents had $600 deposited into it and $500 immediately withdrawn. On 16 May 1997 the appellant received a cash gift of $1,000 from his parents. On 29 May 1997 the parents’ account had $400 deposited into it. On 6 June 1997 the appellant received a cash gift of $630 from his parents. Mr Kostandinu said that on 28 June 1997 he paid the appellant $1,500. On 10 July 1997 the account of the appellant’s parents had a cheque for $500 deposited into it. On 8 August 1997 the appellant, according to Mr Kostandinu, was paid $1,500 by Mr Kostandinu. On 13 August 1997 the appellant deposited $1,100 in his Westpac account 604049. There were no corresponding transfers or withdrawals from his other accounts. On 27 August 1997 the appellant received $1,500, according to Mr Kostandinu. On the same day he deposited $800 in his Westpac account 604049 at Queanbeyan. There were no corresponding transfers or withdrawals from his other accounts. On 15 September 1997 the appellant received a cash gift of $900 from his parents.  
     
      
    96 In short, from March 1997 to September 1997 (after the sale of fishing equipment to Mr Volk) and before the Lipovski advance for share purchases, apart from the three “gifts” from the parents, there were no payments from third parties to the appellant to which counsel for the appellant has pointed which could account for the payments by the appellant into his own or his parents’ accounts. The sums involved were too large to be funded by people on social security unless they received other amounts or accessed other assets, which they did not. The sums were small enough to be funded out of the monthly payments which Mr Kostandinu said he made.  
     
      
    97 Finally, some of the payments by outsiders to the appellant are suspicious in the sense that they were immediately preceded by sums of about the same amount being paid into the outsiders’ accounts. Thus on 25 September 1997, $10,011 was deposited in Jiri Lipovski’s account; on the same day $9,150 was withdrawn from the appellant’s Westpac cash management account 10-8741; and on 29 September 1997 Jiri Lipovski paid $10,000 out of his account to the appellant. The movement of funds is largely circular. Similarly on 3 November 1995, $10,000 was withdrawn from the account of the appellant’s parents and given to the appellant – on the appellant’s case, as payment for a car he sold them. But the figure of $10,000 was about equal to the total of various sums paid into the parents’ account from 1993 onwards.  
     
      
    98 It is convenient to summarise the reasoning to this point. The giving of the $90,000 benefit shows that Mr Kostandinu made one substantial payment. The only available explanation for that payment was the one to which Mr Kostandinu testified – in large measure to buy protection. That in turn supports the view that other payments he said he made were made. Father Cockayne’s evidence establishes an admission by the appellant to that effect, and also constitutes evidence that the payments were for protection. Persons on social security operating a losing business might have been able to fund their asset purchases and lifestyle from third parties, but even taken at its highest, the evidence of third party payments is inadequate to explain the pattern of payments at crucial times. The appellant does seem to have had large liquid sums, but it also seems clear he made deposits and other payments without having to have recourse to them, because he could have recourse to a continuing stream of monthly protection payments from Mr Kostandinu.  
     
      
    99 Not only was there evidence before the jury on which they could convict, but, in my opinion, making one’s own independent assessment of the evidence, it was reasonable for the jury to convict and not dangerous to let the verdict stand, even in the light of the appellant’s arguments about the credibility of Mr Kostandinu as revealed in the witness box. These must now be examined.  
     
      
       
      The credibility of Mr Kostandinu 
       
      
    100 A reading of Mr Kostandinu’s evidence makes it understandable why counsel for the appellant used the strong language he did about Mr Kostandinu. He did appear to be on numerous occasions evasive, non-responsive, ready to offer self-serving answers, and inconsistent. It was also open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kostandinu pursued a very expensive and extravagant lifestyle, and that he did not satisfactorily explain numerous details about his financial affairs. He was contradicted on particular points by Mr Gruber and Mr Phillips. Even on his own evidence, he was extraordinarily gullible and trusting. His story was a quite remarkable one. He admitted changes in that story and he admitted discreditable acts. It would be unduly wearisome to set out the detail of the main complaints which counsel for the appellant made along the above lines: the arguments have been analysed and the evidence has been checked in detail. But these complaints show only that the jury could easily have rejected the totality of Mr Kostandinu’s evidence. It does not establish that it was unreasonable for them not to.  
     
      
    101 Extraordinary though Mr Kostandinu’s story is if it were substantially true, it would be even more extraordinary if it were false. His story explains why he benefited the appellant to the extent of $90,000 in relation to the Bateman’s Bay purchase; the appellant’s case did not. Mr Kostandinu was corroborated by Father Cockayne in several respects, and Father Cockayne was neither cross-examined nor contradicted. The appellant’s arguments based on the use of third party funds does not square with certain aspects of the payments. A jury is particularly well equipped to form a judgment about whether a witness’s unsatisfactory demeanour and manner of testifying – particularly a witness not fluent in English – is a sign of dishonesty or merely a sign of incompetence. A jury is also well equipped to distinguish between the hard core of a witness’s account and inessential details, and to accept the former but not the latter. The jury heard Mr Kostandinu over four days; this Court did not hear him at all. In particular, there was objective and independent evidence that supported key points of Mr Kostandinu’s testimony; the objective evidence which the appellant relied on was much less precise. The jury did not have to accept every detail of Mr Kostandinu’s jumbled and tangled testimony. It was sufficient if they accepted that the appellant repeatedly told Mr Kostandinu that he was at risk of injury unless he got protection, and that, if the appellant were paid as stipulated, the appellant could provide that protection. The jury was entitled to reason that while a confused, unreliable, tax-dodging witness like Mr Kostandinu might not be acceptable in many respects, he could be believed on the criminal standard of proof in key respects. 
     
      
       
      Proof on all charges? 
       
      
    102 Counsel for the appellant said that even if the main arguments on the appeal fail, in relation to certain withdrawals of money from Mr Kostandinu’s bank accounts in sums not equal to the monthly protection payments required, being sums not supported by clear cheque butts, there were some counts in relation to which Mr Kostandinu was not able convincingly to establish that he had paid the appellant. Mr Kostandinu’s confidence that he had paid the appellant appeared to rest on a faith in a roughly standard practice, and on the notes on the manila folder. In my judgment if the jury accepted Mr Kostandinu on the inducements which the appellant communicated to Mr Kostandinu and on the fact that many payments were made, it was not unreasonable for them to rely on Mr Kostandinu’s evidence of practice and to accept his evidence that the notes on the manila folder were made roughly contemporaneously with the events recorded. Three of the relevant counts preceded the purported commencement of the folder, but Mr Kostandinu’s evidence of his practice could reasonably be accepted even without the folder. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    103 The appeal should be dismissed.

      70212/01 – REGINA v Wesley Patric WATERMAN 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Wesley Patric Waterman, was tried upon an indictment charging him with the murder of Anthony Alexander Costello at Woolloomooloo on 11 November, 2000. The jury found him guilty of manslaughter. He committed the offence in the company of a co-offender, Jerome William Leyman. Mr Leyman was also charged with murder, but his plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown prosecutor in discharge of that indictment. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 At the relevant time the offender was living with his parents in Charles Street, Woolloomooloo. Mr Leyman lived nearby in Forbes Street. During the evening of Friday, 10 November, 2000 a number of homeless men, including the deceased, who was forty one years old, took up positions to sleep for the night on the steps of a building roughly opposite Mr Leyman’s house.  
     
      
    3 Mr Leyman was at home, drinking with friends. In the small hours of the following morning, Saturday, 11 November, 2000, people in the house were talking loudly and disturbing the sleep of the homeless men outside. Some of those men protested, demanding that the noise cease or they would call the police. Mr Leyman came out of his home, carrying a broomstick. He prodded a number of the men with the stick, including the deceased, and ordered them to leave the area. The deceased said that he was not leaving. Mr Leyman attempted to strike him with the stick, but the deceased seized it from him and struck him on the nose, causing it to bleed. 
     
      
    4 Mr Leyman ran back to his home. A number of the homeless men stood outside his house, swearing at him and demanding that he come outside, but after a while they settled down. He rang the offender and told him what had happened.  
     
      
    5 The offender left his home in Charles Street, armed with a knife, and ran to where the men were. He demanded to know who had assaulted his friend. He then went to Mr Leyman’s home, and the two of them emerged and walked towards the men. Mr Leyman pointed out the deceased as the man who had struck him. 
     
      
    6 There is a conflict in the evidence about what then occurred. What is clear is that the deceased sustained one stab wound to the chest, which was fatal. What is not clear is exactly how that happened. Manslaughter was left to the jury on two bases: either that the offender deliberately stabbed the deceased but without the intent requisite for murder, or that he menaced the deceased with the knife and the deceased lunged towards him, impaling himself upon it. For the purpose of sentence, the Crown prosecutor contended that I should find that the stabbing was a deliberate act by the offender, a proposition supported by the evidence of some of the homeless men. Mr Hamill, for the offender, argued that I should sentence on the basis that the deceased had impaled himself upon the knife, a view consistent with the evidence of a witness, Ms Tracy Conklin, whom both counsel accepted as reliable. 
     
      
    7 It is unnecessary to go to the detail of the evidence. It is sufficient to say that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the wound was the result of a deliberate stabbing and I propose to sentence upon the basis propounded by Mr Hamill. Nevertheless, it is common ground that, when the deceased suffered the wound and fell to the ground, both the offender and Mr Leyman kicked him. They then ran back to Mr Leyman’s house. The deceased died later that day at St Vincents Hospital. 
     
      
    8 The offender was charged several days later, when he attended Kings Cross Police Station with a solicitor. He declined to be interviewed and he did not give evidence at his trial. It is clear from the evidence in the Crown case that he was intoxicated at the relevant time. The knife which he had was one which his mother had left near the front door of their home for protection, because there had been a violent incident involving a number of youths at the back of the house some months before and her husband was frequently away. Not surprisingly, in view of what happened, she said in evidence, “I rue the day I ever put it there.” 
     
      
    9 The incident must be understood against a background of tension created by the presence of a large number of homeless people in the area. Mrs Waterman, who was sympathetic to the problems of those people, explained that residents were regularly harassed, stood over for money or even assaulted by some of them. The situation became worse when the demand for police during the Sydney Olympics significantly reduced police presence in the area. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    10 The offender was thirty years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-two. He has a lengthy criminal record, including some offences of violence, but most of it comprises offences committed when he was a juvenile. To Ms Anna Robilliard, a psychologist who examined him for forensic purposes, he frankly acknowledged that he had been “a juvenile delinquent.” He spent several periods in detention in juvenile institutions. His response to schooling was poor and his formal education came to an end when he was about fourteen years old. All this was so despite what appears to have been a satisfactory family background.  
     
      
    11 He used heroin for a period in his teens and smoked marijuana until his late twenties. However, of greater significance is his abuse of alcohol, a problem which endured right up to the time of his arrest for the present offence.  
     
      
    12 His lifestyle improved markedly in his early adulthood, probably due to his involvement in relationships with two young women, both of whom bore his children. He has one child from the first relationship and two from the second and, although both relationships are now at an end, he maintained contact with those children and is devoted to them. He has a few convictions as an adult, but they demonstrate nothing like his consistent pattern of offending as a juvenile. He gained steady employment. It appears that his drinking escalated when the second relationship broke down about a year before the present offence. He has had contact with that lady and the two children since he has been in custody, and he has some hope of a reconciliation with her upon his release. 
     
      
    13 I have received an impressive body of character evidence, both written and oral, from friends and from members of his family. The effect of that evidence is that, notwithstanding his criminal history, the present offence is very much out of character. He is described as a caring person, who is generous and helpful to others in need. I was particularly impressed by the evidence of his mother and his sister, and it is clear that he can rely upon the continuing support of his family. His sister can offer him accommodation, and expects to be able to arrange employment for him upon his release. 
     
      
    14 Since being in custody he has taken the opportunity to further his education and has sought psychological counselling. His health has improved as a result of his abstention from alcohol. Nevertheless, Ms Robilliard reports that he needs to address the related problems of alcohol abuse and anger management and, while there is a course of treatment available within the prison system, it is likely that he will need support and professional assistance to that end upon his release. I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good, but they should be fostered by a longer than usual period of parole eligibility. Accordingly, I find special circumstances.  
     
      
    15 He gave an account of the offence to Ms Robilliard which, in my view, is somewhat sanitised. Nevertheless, I accept that he is remorseful about the death of the unfortunate victim. He offered to plead guilty to manslaughter prior to the trial, a fact which entitles him to leniency in accordance with the principles propounded by Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed, in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310. Neither counsel suggested that I should express that leniency as a quantified reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate, and I do not propose to do so. 
     
      
      Sentence 
      
    16 In assessing the objective gravity of this crime, I have regard to the background of tension from the presence of homeless people in the area, to the offender’s intoxicated state, to the speed with which events unfolded and to my finding about the cause of the fatal wound. On the other hand, I must also bear in mind that the offender left his home armed with a knife, obviously anticipating a violent encounter. He also kicked the victim, although he may not have then been aware that he had sustained a life-threatening wound. In all the circumstances, the offence falls short of the more serious category of this class of manslaughter but it is, nonetheless, a serious one. 
     
      
    17 I have received a victim impact statement from the sister of the deceased, providing a brief account of his sad life and expressing her grief, and that of other members of the family, at their loss. The approach of this Court to that material is well settled and need not be repeated. The Court expresses its sympathy to the loved ones of the deceased. 
     
      
    18 Sentencing in cases such as this is never an easy task. To achieve an appropriate balance between the objective gravity of the crime and the favourable subjective circumstances of the offender is a notoriously difficult exercise. The sentence which I propose is the best I can do to meet the community’s sense of justice. It will date from the day that the offender was taken into custody, 16 November, 2000.  
     
      
    19 Wesley Patric Waterman, you are sentenced to imprisonment for six years, to date from 16 November, 2000, with a non-parole period of three and a half years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 15 May, 2004.

     1 Sperling J:  
      
       
        
       Thien Tho Nguyen 
        
       
     2 In Simpson (2001) 52 NSWLR 704, Spigelman CJ said, at 720-1: 
      
       
        
         
         Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process”. That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor” is not satisfied. 
         
        
       
     3 I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted in this case and should have been passed. 
      
       
     4 I find myself so much in agreement with the written submissions provided by the Crown, which are in that vein, that I can best convey my view of the case by substantially adopting what is said there. This judgment accordingly reproduces much of what appears in the Crown’s written submissions. 
      
       
     5 The applicant and his co-offender Dai Phuc Nguyen were sentenced by Morgan DCJ in the District Court at Campbelltown on 26 April 2002. The applicant had entered a plea of guilty to a charge, pursuant to s112(2) of the Crimes Act, of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely, larceny in circumstances of aggravation. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. He also pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated robbery pursuant to s95(1) of the Act. That offence also carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The applicant had been committed for sentence from the Campbelltown Local Court on 17 December 2001. 
      
       
     6 Her Honour sentenced the applicant in relation to the s112(2) offence to a term of imprisonment for seven years with a non parole period of four years to date from 9 May 2001, the day he went into custody. The non parole period was set to expire on 8 May 2005. On count 2, aggravated robbery, her Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for two years to date from the 9 May 2001 which was to be served concurrently with the sentence on the first charge. Her Honour declined to set a non parole period because of the sentence she imposed in relation to the first count. 
      
       
     7 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the alleged severity of this sentence upon the following grounds: 
      
       
        
       Ground 1: The sentence imposed of seven years with a non parole period of four years was unduly harsh and severe. 
        
        
       Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence of two years for the offence of aggravated robbery. 
        
        
       Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in failing to give weight or sufficient weight to the lack of planning. 
        
        
       Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in failing to give weight or sufficient weight to the subjective matters.  
        
       
     8 Perusal of her Honour's remarks on sentence discloses a very carefully reasoned judgment. Her Honour recounted the facts concerning the offences to which the applicant pleaded (ROS 1-5). Set out hereunder is that portion of her Honour's remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         The date of the commission of these offences was 9 May 2001. At the time of the offences Thien Tho Nguyen was 18 years of age being born on 1 April 1983. The offender Dai Nguyen was 16 and a half at the time of the offence, being born on 10 November 1984. Neither offender has any previous criminal history. 
         
        
        
         
         The circumstances of the commission of these offences are that at about 7:30 or thereabouts on the evening of Wednesday 9 May 2001 Mr Wladis Plaza the victim of these offences was seated in his downstairs lounge room in his home in Fairfield Road Cabramatta. He was watching television when he became aware of two people entering through the door from his dining room, both were wearing balaclavas and carrying machetes. They screamed at Mr Plaza to lay down on the floor. Mr Plaza stood up from his seat and picked up a pot plant and threw it at the two men, this did not deter them and they continued to yell at Mr Plaza to lay down on the floor. These two men were the offenders. At the time they appeared in the lounge room the only other person in the house apart from Mr Plaza was his 19 -year-old daughter  
         [this would appear to be an error because in her statement dated 9 May 2001 Nicole describes herself as being 25 years old] 
          Nicole who was in her bedroom upstairs. The shouting alerted Miss Plaza and she crept down the stairs past the doorway to the lounge room, as she did she could see her father standing with his back against a wall with his hands raised into the air just a little above his head, he was facing towards her. She also saw two men in balaclavas facing towards her father and one of those men was holding a machete type knife above his head like a sword. Miss Plaza escaped from the house through the front door and ran to the neighbours across the road where she dialled 000. Meanwhile in the house Mr Plaza was being threatened by the two masked men, the offenders, who were demanding money from him. Mr Plaza's hands were taped with black masking tape which was produced from a bag taken into the premises by one of the offenders. Mr Plaza took them to the kitchen where his wallet was and two $50 notes were removed from it by one of the offenders. A Westpac and ANZ bank card was also removed. At the time the offenders noticed a shooter’s license in Mr Plaza's wallet and demanded to know where the guns were. Mr Plaza took the two men out to the garage where a number of rifles were in rifle cases on top of a cupboard. The offenders took possession of those rifle cases and also wanted the bolts, however Mr Plaza was able to distract them from further search of the garage and the three of them went back into the house. Mr Plaza was then taken upstairs by the two men and into the master bedroom where the offenders continued to demanded money and jewellery. Throughout all this time the two men had possession of the machetes and at times Mr Plaza would be threatened that if he did not cooperate they would ""Chop him"". The two men ransacked the bedrooms upstairs and took possession of a lighter found in Mr Plaza's room. One of the offenders kept demanding the pin number from Mr Plaza and eventually he told them what it was. The man then said he would go to Cabramatta and withdraw money from the account and leave the other man with him. He also threatened to chop Mr Plaza if he had lied about the pin number. Before that man left the house the black tape was again produced from the bag and Mr Plaza's mouth was taped as well as his legs and his already taped hands were taped to the bed frame. The men left the room. The tape over Mr Plaza's mouth did not stick because of his moustache and he was then able to bite the tape off his hands. Whilst he was doing this one of the men returned to the bedroom still holding a machete and he used the machete to cut the tape around Mr Plaza's legs. He then told Mr Plaza to accompany him downstairs and at the time he was holding the machete up to Mr Plaza's throat. Mr Plaza refused to go anywhere until he put the machete down and the man then held it by his side. The two of them walked down the stairs and at the time Mr Plaza could see that there were police officers outside. 
         
        
        
         
         As a result of the call made by Miss Plaza to 000, police had attended the house and indeed had surrounded it. About 8:30 pm they saw a man walk out the front door of those premises carrying a machete, a dark-coloured balaclava, a backpack and the rifle bag. Police drew their pistols and moved towards him and he was told to lay down on the grass nature strip. That man was the offender Thien Tho Nguyen. When he was later searched, police found a gold coloured Zippo style lighter and an ANZ bank access card in the name of Wladis Plaza. At the time of the arrest police also noticed that the offender was wearing disposable rubber gloves on each hand. Following Thien Tho Nguyen’s apprehension police called out that the house was surrounded and to ""Come out with your hands in the air"". At that time one of the police officers was standing near the front door of the house and he could see reflected in a hall mirror two people walking down the stairwell, one was wearing a balaclava and carrying a machete and the other was Mr Plaza. The man in the balaclava stopped at the front door and the police called on him to drop his machete, he asked where his friend was and when told he had been arrested after some hesitation placed the machete on the floor. The police then moved in and arrested him. That person was the offender Dai Nguyen."" 
         
        
       
     9 Her Honour then addressed the material that had been presented to her on behalf of the applicant (ROS 5-12). Her Honour referred to the lengthy ERISP which the applicant took part in with police. Her Honour noted that the applicant made full admissions as to his involvement in the matter. She referred to the applicant's version of how the place was selected for the crime, and how the co-offenders returned to the applicant's house where the applicant picked up a black bag containing tape which was to be used to tie people up and both of them armed themselves with machetes to scare people in the house. She also set out in that interview how the applicant took with him a pair of gloves and that each wore balaclavas so they would not be recognised. Her Honour then referred at length to the pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole officer of the Liverpool District Office. Her Honour also referred to the applicant's claim that he was addicted to gambling and allegedly had a substantial debt of several thousand dollars to an associate at one of the clubs he said he frequented. Apparently, the claim of that debt was not substantiated. Her Honour referred to the report of Mr Terry Smith, clinical psychologist. Her Honour also referred to a letter written by the applicant and tendered on his behalf. Her Honour noted that whilst in custody the applicant had undertaken a number of courses of education. 
      
       
     10 Her Honour then considered the very serious nature of the offences and noted the premeditated invasion of a person's home at night whilst wearing balaclavas and armed, knowing that someone was in the house. Her Honour noted that the victims must have been truly terrified during the three-quarters of an hour that the offenders were in the house. Mr Plaza was subjected to continued threats of violence. His house was ransacked and he was bound hand and foot and ultimately bound to his bed. Her Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         Although the offenders may now protest their stupidity at their actions and express remorse and contrition for the offence it remains that the psychological damage to Mr Plaza and his family will be likely to remain with them for the rest of their lives. It is my view that sentences must be imposed not only to punish the offenders but to also send a message to those who might be tempted to become involved in home invasion offences. That message will be that they will receive severe and condign punishment from the Court for such type of offences.  
         
        
       
     11 Her Honour referred to what was said by Abadee J in Li (Unreported, NSWCCA 9 July 1997). 
      
       
        
         
         The public must be protected and the community standards reflected in the penalty imposed by Parliament in this type of offence, and in the circumstances with which the court is presently concerned and this must be reflected in the appropriate sentence. 
         
        
       
     12 It was Parliament's concern at the rise in the incidence of home invasion type offences which bought about the amendments to the Crimes Act in 1994 and 1999. 
      
       
     13 Her Honour accepted that the applicant played the lead role in the offence, although her Honour was of the opinion that there was not very much difference between the two offenders in the criminality exhibited on that occasion. 
      
       
     14 Her Honour said (ROS 20): 
      
       
        
         
         Dealing with Thien Nguyen, in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender Thien Tho Nguyen I take into account his early plea of guilty which evidences a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I have regard to the guideline judgment of Thompson and Houlton and I consider that a discount in the order of 25% would be appropriate in this case. I also have regard to his expressions of remorse and contrition, and the steps he has taken in his own rehabilitation as evidenced, by the reports from Mr Smith and his conduct whilst he has been in custody. Having regard to the recommendations in Mr Smith's report I consider that the offender would be well served by receiving extensive counselling, and it would be appropriate that he receive extended supervision upon his release from custody. I also have regard to his age and that this is his first custodial sentence. I accordingly find special circumstances in his case. Having regard to the principles enunciated in  
         Pearce’s 
          case I consider that the appropriate sentence to impose upon a charge under section 112 (2) would be one of seven years, and the sentence to be imposed on the second charge of robbery would be one of two years. I consider in all of the circumstances of this case that it would be appropriate for those sentences to be served concurrently. 
         
        
       
     15 Her Honour then imposed the sentences the subject of this application. Although her Honour referred specifically to authorities concerned with the interrelationship of general deterrence and the youth of an offender in her judgment relating to the sentence she was imposing on the applicant's co-offender, it is apparent that these principles were well to the fore in her Honour's mind at the time of imposing sentence upon the applicant. Her Honour considered the following authorities. AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58, where it was said  
      
       
        
         
         It is well accepted that in the case of youth general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment and rehabilitation.  
         
        
        
       Her Honour also referred to the decision of this Court in  
       DAR  
       (Unreported, NSWCCA 1 October 1997) and  
       Mazzilli 
        [2001] NSWCCA 117, and then concluded: 
        
        
         
         However important that principle is it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.  
         
        
        
       Her Honour then referred to what was said by Lee AJ in  
       Nichols  
       (1991) 57 A Crim R 391. Her Honour said,  
        
        
         
         Lee A.J. commented on this in  
         Nichols  
         at page 395 and said 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           True it is however that the courts consistently point out the need to give young offenders a chance and to refrain from sending them to gaol or dealing heavily with them if that course can be avoided. ... However, there is point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of 19, even though a young man, is of such a nature, is so great, that that principle must be in the public interest, give way.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In the case of  
         Pham 
          (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, which was a case involving a home invasion by number of young men, Lee C.J. at C. L. said at 135 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           It is true the Courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind, otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal courts’ function will cease to operate. In short deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the person committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own home. 
           
          
         
        
       
     16 Her Honour was referred to the decision of this Court in Blackman v Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 and at page 24 distinguished that case from the present. I agree with her Honour's basis for distinguishing that decision. 
      
       
     17 Her Honour had regard to the offender's age which was 18 at the time of the commission of these offences. Her Honour noted that he was a person without prior criminal convictions.  
      
       
     18 Her Honour referred to the principles of sentencing which related to this particular matter.  
      
       
     19 Both offences were aggravated offences. The circumstances constituting aggravation in relation to the s112(2) offence were that the applicant was armed with an offensive weapon and was in company. The circumstance constituting aggravation in relation to the second offence was depriving Mr Plaza of his liberty by holding him against his will. So each of the offences included an element different from and additional to the elements in the other. Accordingly, the applicant was properly charged with the two offences. However, they were part of the same episode and did not warrant the same punishment as would have been appropriate had they been committed on separate occasions. 
      
       
     20 There was error in the way the sentences imposed were structured. Her Honour took into account the criminal conduct involved in the whole episode when fixing a sentence for the s112(2) offence. That is apparent from the sentence for aggravated robbery being made wholly concurrent. This approach was contrary to Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45-48], as explained by Simpson J in Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7-10]. A sentence should have been determined for each offence separately, being an appropriate sentence for each offence in isolation. The principle of totality should then have been implemented by the degree of cumulation or concurrence introduced as between the sentences. In this case, the sentence for the s112(2) offence would have been less than that imposed and the two sentences would, I expect, have overlapped. I do not doubt, however, that if this had been done the overall effective sentence would have been no different from the overall effective sentence which was imposed. Accordingly, notwithstanding the error, no prejudice has been suffered by the applicant in consequence. 
      
       
     21 I return then to what was said in Simpson (see earlier). An appeal against sentence is not automatically allowed for error. If the appellate court is not of the opinion that a less severe effective sentence was warranted and should have been passed, the appeal must be dismissed. 
      
       
     22 This was a very bad crime. It was planned. It was in company. There was the threat of violence with machetes. The victim was held against his will. He was bound, gagged and terrorised. His victim’s impact statement shows that the effect of the experience has been serious and lasting. Mr Plaza’s daughter was also, no doubt, put in fear, although she managed to escape undetected.  
      
       
     23 Having regard to the objective seriousness of the applicant’s conduct, I would not re-sentence the applicant to an effective sentence for both offences that was any less severe than the effective sentence imposed below. 
      
       
     24 I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       Dai Phuc Nguyen 
        
       
     25 The applicant, Dai Phuc Nguyen, was sentenced on 26 April 2002, on the same occasion as his co-offender Thien Tho Nguyen. Morgan DCJ’s remarks on sentence of that date relate to both offenders. The objective circumstances of the case were summarised by her Honour in a way that related to both offenders (see above).  
      
       
     26 The present applicant was charged with a single count, pursuant to s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely, larceny in circumstances of aggravation (maximum penalty, 20 years imprisonment). As in the case of his co-offender, the present applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest possible time.  
      
       
     27 Her Honour sentenced the present applicant to a term of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three years, the sentence to be served in a juvenile justice centre. 
      
       
     28 This appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence. The grounds of appeal are specified as failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s youth and giving too much emphasis to general deterrence; and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     29 The present applicant was born on 10 November 1984. He was 16 and a half years old at the time of the offence. His co-offender had turned 18 at the time of the offence. The age difference between them was one year and seven months. 
      
       
     30 Concerning the roles of the two offenders, her Honour said (ROS 19): 
      
       
        
         
         I do not think that there is very much difference between the two offenders in the criminality exhibited that night, however Mr Plaza stated that the offender wearing the surgical gloves and who demanded jewellery, money and his pin number appeared to be in charge. The offender to whom he was referring was Thien Tho Nguyen. That evidence would appear to support what Dai Nguyen told Mr Champion which was he had played a secondary role in the offence. 
         
        
       
     31 In my view, this passage does not sufficiently acknowledge the difference between the roles of the two offenders in the episode. The applicant’s co-offender drove the car to the area where the crime was committed and where the victim’s house was cased. He then drove the car to his own home where tape, machetes and balaclavas were placed in a bag. He drove the car back to the victim’s house. The following is an extract from Mr Plaza’s record of interview. (It was the applicant’s co-offender who was wearing gloves.) 
      
       
        
         
         The bloke without the surgical gloves appeared to be younger than the fellow with the surgical gloves on. The one with the surgical gloves was the one that seems to be in charge, the one that kept asking me the pin number, where the jewellery is, where the money is, where, where anything is, where everything is, he’s the one that kept saying where’s this, where’s that, where’s your pistols, where’s your guns he was the one that kept saying it the young one, the other fellow I didn’t know he was the younger one at this stage, the other fellow just sort of stood there and he kept telling, get him lay down lay down he didn’t say too much. 
         
        
        
       It was the co-offender who took money and bank cards from Mr Plaza’s wallet and who was later found in possession of one of the bank cards and a lighter taken from Mr Plaza’s bedroom cupboard. It was the co-offender who threatened to “chop” Mr Plaza if he did not co-operate with him. It was also the co-offender who persistently demanded Mr Plaza’s pin number and again threatened to “chop” him if he lied about it. The present applicant was in another room when those particular demands and threats were made. 
        
       
     32 It further appears that the present applicant demonstrated some compassion towards the victim. The following is an extract from what Mr Plaza told the police: 
      
       
        
         
         The other fellow when I told him I had a heart problem, the one with the surgical gloves didn’t bother too much, the other bloke said ‘what’s the matter?’ so I showed him me heart thing. I said look I am going to bloody have a heart attack here this is bullshit. I said I need a drink I need a drink. ‘What do you want to drink?’ he said ‘what do you want to drink?’ So he went to the fridge and got me the drink and that. 
         
        
       
     33 On the other hand, it is to be acknowledged that both offenders were active in taping Mr Plaza’s hands and taping him to the bed frame. It is also to be acknowledged that, when challenged by the police to give himself up, the present applicant led Mr Plaza outside with a machete held to Mr Plaza’s throat, dropping the machete only when twice ordered to do so by the police. 
      
       
     34 Her Honour was aware of the importance of taking account of the applicant’s youth. She said (at ROS 24-25): 
      
       
        
         
         In deciding the appropriate sentence I do of course have regard to the offender’s age, being only 16 and a half at the time of the commission of this very serious offence. 
         
        
        
       She carefully reviewed the law on that topic. 
        
       
     35 The authorities include Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 where the following was said, at [25]: 
      
       
        
         
         However it is, we think, appropriate to look beyond the simple difference in facts and to address the principle which is involved. It lies in at least part of the rationale for making any allowance for youth, i.e. the immaturity which is usually involved. Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years. 
         
        
       
     36 There was evidence before her Honour that the applicant’s immaturity had contributed to his involvement in the offence. The psychologist, Dr Champion, emphasised that the applicant was immature and lacked sophistication. The applicant told Mr Champion that he trailed the co-offender about in the house, following his directions. That is confirmed by Mr Plaza, as I have mentioned. It was only when the applicant’s co-offender had left the applicant alone in the house with Mr Plaza and after the applicant had been challenged by the police to give himself up that the applicant engaged in threatening behaviour, holding a machete to Mr Plaza’s throat. That was an unplanned act of desperation, serious though it was. 
      
       
     37 The evidence strongly indicates that the applicant’s co-offender had the dominant role in the episode and that the applicant was very much under his influence. 
      
       
     38 The remarks on sentence in this case are a model of care and clarity. However, I am of the opinion that the significance of the applicant’s youth and of his lesser role in the episode were not sufficiently taken into account by her Honour.  
      
       
     39 I would set aside the sentence imposed. I would find special circumstances by reason of the applicant’s youth and this being his first time in custody. I would re-sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of four years commencing on 22 March 2002 with a non-parole period of two years expiring on 21 March 2004, on which date the applicant is to be released, the sentence to be served in a juvenile justice centre. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     40 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       Thien Tho Nguyen 
        
        
       (1) Grant application for leave to appeal against sentence.

      OLYMPIC CO-ORDINATION AUTHORITY v ZHU 
       
      
      
       
     The appeal was from a decision of Bergin J given on 6 November 2001. The plaintiff had instituted proceedings against SOCOG (the defendant) and claimed that SOCOG had wrongfully induced TOC Management Services Pty Limited (TOC) to terminate an agreement whereby TOC had appointed the plaintiff an agent to market in Mainland China International Memberships in the Olympic Club which was established in preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. SOCOG was the body established to organise and stage the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. 
      
       
     The Olympic Charter contemplated exploitation for advertising, commercial or profit making purposes of the Olympic symbol and the Olympic emblems outside of Australia but only with the consent of the relevant National Olympic Committee (in this case, the Chinese National Olympic Committee) and only if a certain proportion of profits were distributed to that Committee. These requirements were not adhered to in this case. Clause 48 of the Host City Contract with the City of Sydney and the Australian Olympic Committee entitled the International Olympic Committee to terminate the contract and to withdraw the Games from Sydney if there was a violation of the Host City Contract, the Olympic Charter or any applicable law. The relevant legislation was the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 (the Act). 
      
       
     TOC was the trustee of the Olympic Club Trust. SOCOG and TOC, as trustee, entered into the Olympic Club Licence Agreement which recited that SOCOG was the exclusive entity for the purpose of organising and staging the Olympic Games and had the authority to grant to TOC as trustee certain rights and opportunities relating to the Games. Rights were granted to use intellectual property in connection with the Club, however the rights and opportunities granted were to be exercised in and only in Australia. 
      
       
     TOC entered into an Agency Agreement and a Marketing Restriction Deed Poll (the Deed Poll) (executed in favour of SOCOG) with the plaintiff. The Deed Poll provided that the plaintiff could not use any words, phrases, symbols or images which suggested any connection between the plaintiff and the Olympic Movement without the prior written consent of SOCOG. In consideration of TOC appointing the plaintiff its agent for the term, the plaintiff paid TOC an Agency Fee of $30,000. The Agency Agreement was subsequently extended on the payment of a further $230,000 by the plaintiff to the Olympic Club.  
      
       
     TOC covenanted with the plaintiff that his appointment as agent was exclusive within Mainland China and, upon the execution of the Agency Agreement, TOC provided to the plaintiff a letter introducing him as the exclusive authorised agent of the Olympic Club to sell International Memberships in China. The letter authorised the plaintiff to sell the Memberships as a component of travel and accommodation packages. 
      
       
     The plaintiff had frequent contact with employees of TOC, reporting back to them about what he had done in developing the project, including meeting with Chinese Government officials. The plaintiff obtained permission to appoint a number of sub-agents. The plaintiff was also informed that TOC would do whatever it could to get SOCOG to assist in the arrangement of visas for Chinese residents who purchased Memberships. The ""guarantee"" to help Members obtain visas drew the attention of the Criminal Intelligence Unit of the Olympic Intelligence Centre.  
      
       
     On 30 July 1999, due to financial difficulties, the ownership of the Olympic Club concept and all know-how in relation to the operation of the Club was transferred to SOCOG. In October 1999 the plaintiff was informed that SOCOG no longer wanted the International Memberships to continue.  
      
       
     Subsequently, SOCOG's representatives communicated with the Olympic Intelligence Centre their suspicions that the plaintiff and his sub-agents were operating without any authority and fraudulently – particularly with regard to the issue of Membership certificates which were ""not genuine"". On the plaintiff's return to Australia from China in early December he was arrested at Sydney airport. The plaintiff was charged but those charges were subsequently withdrawn. The trial Judge was satisfied that SOCOG's conduct caused the plaintiff's arrest. 
      
       
     During the hearing most attention was directed to whether or not TOC had wrongly repudiated the Agency Agreement which in turn depended upon whether or not the plaintiff was in breach of the terms and conditions of the Agency Agreement and Deed Poll. The trial Judge held that TOC had wrongfully repudiated the Agency Agreement and that SOCOG was not justified in procuring the termination of the Agreement. Further, it was found that the conduct of the plaintiff which SOCOG complained of – such as, the representations made by the plaintiff that SOCOG would assist in obtaining visas for Members – did not warrant summary dismissal and rejected the claim that the conduct entitled TOC to terminate the Agency Agreement. 
      
       
     The plaintiff recovered approximately $4,230,000 plus costs. On appeal SOCOG did not challenge the right to such damages or their assessment if the tort alleged against it was made out. 
      
       
     The principal ground of appeal was based on the defence of justification. SOCOG claimed justification as a complete defence to the plaintiff's claim for inducing a breach of contract on three bases: 
      
       
     - the breach by the plaintiff of the terms of the Deed Poll, being independent contractual obligations owed to SOCOG;- the equal or superior right of SOCOG derived from its responsibility to protect the reputation and goodwill of the Olympic Movement and from statutory regulation of the use of Olympic indicia and images. The plaintiff breached terms of the Act; and- the serious breaches of the contractual and fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff to TOC. 
      
       
     SOCOG acknowledged that it knowingly induced TOC to break its contract with the plaintiff. The question on appeal was whether or not the inducement was without lawful justification. 
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Giles JA and Hodgson JA agreeing): 
      
       
     1. To sell or market Olympic Club International Memberships to residents in the Peoples' Republic of China in China was a breach of paragraphs 11 and 12 of the bye-law to rule 17 of the Olympic Charter and s12 of the Act unless the plaintiff was, within the meaning of that Act, a licensed user and some part of the proceeds of exploitation in Mainland China were to go to the Chinese National Olympic Committee. Such a breach was a ground for termination of the Host City Contract under cl 48(iii).  
      
       
     2. Pursuant to the Act relevantly no person other than SOCOG or a licensed user was permitted to use Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images. No evidence was produced which proved whether or not the plaintiff was a licensed user. On the evidence the only conclusion open was that he was not a licensed user within the meaning of the Act. 
      
       
     3. Justification as an element in the tort of wrongful interference with a contract has not been, and probably cannot be, defined. Whether justification in a particular case exists or not should be left to the good sense of the tribunal having regard to established considerations: see Building Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104; Read v Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England [1902] 2 KB 88 at 96-7; James v The Commonwealth (1939) 62 CLR 339. 
      
       
     4. The trial Judge seemed to equate justification in the sense of whether TOC was justified in terminating the Agency Agreement with the different question of whether SOCOG was justified in interfering even if TOC had no grounds for termination. SOCOG's justification case based solely on statutory rights and responsibilities was not dealt with by the trial Judge. 
      
       
     5. The terms of the Agency Agreement contemplated execution by the plaintiff of the Deed Poll. It was plain enough that the Deed Poll must be read as an integral part of the contract between the plaintiff and TOC. It would be absurd to read it as intended to contradict and defeat the Agency Agreement. In giving meaning to the words of an agreement between commercial parties, courts will endeavour to avoid a construction which makes commercial nonsense: see Hyde & Skin Trading Pty Ltd v Oceanic Meat Traders Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 310 at 313-4. If the plaintiff operated within the limits imposed by the Agency Agreement including the letter handed to him in compliance with the Agency Agreement, there could be no breach of the Deed Poll. 
      
       
     6. The language of s12 of the Act was unequivocal. Subsection (1) prohibited a person, not a licensed user, using Sydney 2000 Games indicia and images for commercial purposes. SOCOG was justified in procuring the termination of the Agency Agreement. That agreement if allowed to stay in place required continued illegal conduct not only by the plaintiff but by others. The Agreement erroneously permitted the plaintiff commercially to exploit intellectual property owned by the IOC on behalf of the Olympic Movement in a country outside Australia without the consents of any of the Olympic bodies who were required to consent and in particular by the relevant Chinese bodies. 
      
       
     7. The plaintiff's contractual rights to exploit Olympic intellectual property in Mainland China under the terms of the Agency Agreement derived from TOC. The Licence Agreement made it clear that TOC had no authority to grant such rights. The superior right SOCOG called in aid was an absolute one based on its constitution and the Act. While SOCOG knowingly induced the breach of contract, the inducement was justified. 
      
       
     8. The costs orders made by the trial Judge were confirmed. The way in which the case was run by SOCOG at trial wasted a considerable amount of judicial time and resulted in considerable expense being unnecessarily incurred by the plaintiff. No order for the costs of the appeal were made as the appeal succeeded on the basis of submissions filed late. Also, the point in issue could have been dealt with quite shortly at the trial if proper emphasis had been placed on it by SOCOG. 
      
       
     Per Hodgson JA (Giles JA agreeing): 
      
       
     9. The non-production by SOCOG of the register of licences did not advance the plaintiff's case because registration did no more than provide evidence of the grant of a licence: it was not itself a source of rights. The case was conducted on the basis that TOC's rights and the plaintiff's rights were those granted by the stipulated agreements and there was no suggestion that there were rights granted otherwise. 
      
       
     10. The plaintiff argued on appeal that SOCOG knew that TOC had purported to grant the plaintiff authority to use Sydney 2000 indicia and images but did not tell the plaintiff that this was without authority, whereupon the plaintiff acted to his detriment, giving rise to an estoppel. However, no such estoppel was pleaded. In any event, such an estoppel would not operate against the requirements of a statute. 
      
       
     11. The award of damages referable to the plaintiff's arrest cannot be upheld. The arrest was alleged in the Statement of Claim only as one of the means of bringing about the wrongful interference with the plaintiff's contract.

     1 SHELLER JA:  
      
       
        
       Introduction 
        
       
     2 This is an appeal from a decision of Bergin J given on 6 November 2001. The proceedings were begun by summons filed on behalf of the plaintiff and respondent, Peter Tao Zhu (Zhu), on 22 December 1999. The plaintiff sought declaratory relief and orders against three parties, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), TOC Management Services Pty Limited (TOC) and Keith Wyness (Wyness). The proceedings against Wyness were settled and the proceedings against TOC stayed by operation of law when a liquidator to TOC was appointed in August 2000. The parties in the proceedings before Bergin J were Zhu and SOCOG. In the context of the preparation for the XXVII Olympiad to be held in Sydney in 2000 (the Sydney 2000 Games) Zhu claimed that SOCOG had wrongfully induced TOC to terminate an agreement whereby TOC had appointed Zhu an agent to market in Mainland China International Memberships of the Olympic Club which was established in the preparation for the Sydney 2000 Games. SOCOG admitted that it induced the breach of contract but claimed that it was justified by the plaintiff’s breaches of the Agency Agreement and covenants in favour of SOCOG in a separate contemporaneous Deed Poll and by an equal or superior right derived from its responsibility to protect the reputation and goodwill of the Olympic Movement and from statutory regulation of the use of Olympic indicia and images. 
      
       
         
       
     3 Since then SOCOG has been dissolved by operation of s54 of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games Act 1993 (NSW) (the SOCOG Act). Section 55 of the SOCOG Act provided for SOCOG’s assets to vest in and its rights and liabilities to become the rights and liabilities of the Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA). On 1 July 2002 the Olympic Co-ordination Authority Dissolution Act 2002 (NSW) (the Dissolution Act) commenced. Section 4 of that Act provided that OCA was dissolved. Section 6 of the Dissolution Act provided, relevantly, that the assets, rights and liabilities of OCA comprising obligations and entitlements of SOCOG existing immediately before 31 October 2001 and not finally disposed of or recoverable before 1 July 2002 be transferred to the Treasurer. No party’s Counsel has suggested that these provisions affect the resolution and outcome of this appeal beyond requiring amendment to substitute as a party The Treasurer of the State of New South Wales for SOCOG. To avoid confusion I shall continue to refer to the remaining defendant in the proceedings as SOCOG. 
      
       
        
       The Olympic Club 
        
       
     4 On 26 September 1997 the Olympic Club Trust was established by a trust deed. The unit holders of the trust were the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), SOCOG and a company called Synthesis Consulting Pty Limited (Synthesis). TOC was the trustee of the trust and provided management and other services to the Olympic Club (the Club).  
      
       
     5 TOC was set up in July 1997. The company had previously been known by other names. On 17 September 1997 Wyness was appointed managing director of TOC in which position he remained until late 1999. In December 1997 Angus Roderick Noble (Noble) began employment with TOC and became known as the commercial director. Noble had responsibilities to establish and manage the Club and report to Wyness. 
      
       
     6 The Club was established pursuant to The Olympic Club Establishment Agreement (the Establishment Agreement) made on 5 December 1997 between TOC as trustee, SOCOG, AOC, Synthesis and TOC in its personal capacity (TOCMS). In the Establishment Agreement TOC was referred to as the Trustee and the International Olympic Committee as IOC. In cl 2 of the Establishment Agreement the parties acknowledged that they intended that the Club would be established as an affinity programme by contract between the Trustee and each member. The parties also acknowledged that the purpose for which the trust had been established was the encouragement or promotion of sport through the programmes offered by the Club and that members of the Club would benefit from the Club through, amongst other things, the provision of the Olympic Benefits and other privileges (cl 2(a)-(c)). Olympic Benefits included tickets to Olympic Games, test events, Paralympic Games and Olympic Arts Festival events, access to the Official Dress Rehearsal of the Opening Ceremony, Club Member recognition on a special memorial, privilege rights to become a volunteer and involvement rights in the torch relay (cl 1(a); sch 1).  
      
       
     7 Clause 5 constituted a Club Committee which comprised two representatives of each of SOCOG, AOC and Synthesis. At relevant times the members of the committee included Paul Reading (Reading) and John Moore (Moore) of SOCOG, Craig McLatchey (McLatchey) and Alan Grover (Grover) of the AOC, William David Sherbon (Sherbon) and Stefan Wisniowski (Wisniowski) of Synthesis and Wyness. The members of the Club Committee were to have a role and duties, in respect of the Club and the trust, similar to those of a board of directors, and the members of a board of directors in respect of a company (cl 5(e)). Clause 5(d) of the Establishment Agreement described the functions of the Club Committee and relevantly cl 5 (g) provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “If all the AOC and SOCOG representatives are reasonably of the opinion that an activity of the Trustee is likely to affect the goodwill or reputation of the Olympic movement adversely, they may direct the Trustee to cease that activity. The Trustee must comply with such a direction.” 
         
        
       
     8 Clause 25 of the Establishment Agreement, headed “No endorsements, publicity or use of Olympic Insignia” was relevantly as follow: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) Except as permitted in this agreement or in a Transaction Document, the Trustee and Synthesis will not, without the prior written permission of SOCOG, which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion, represent, hold out, market, promote or advertise in any way that it has any connection or association with SOCOG, the IOC, the Games, or the 1988 or 2000 Australian Olympic teams (Teams).  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           [“Transaction Documents” were defined in the Establishment Agreement and other relevant documents as the agreement itself ‘the Loan Agreement, the Management Agreement, the Trust Deed, the Licence Agreement and any other agreement to which all the parties were party expressed to be a Transaction Document’. Nothing turns on this.] 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (b) Except as expressly permitted in this agreement or in a Transaction Document, the Trustee and Synthesis acknowledge that they have no right to use any intellectual property belonging to SOCOG, the IOC and the AOC, including but not limited to any Olympic logo, mark or design. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Except as permitted in this agreement or in a Transaction Document, the Trustee and Synthesis agree that, without the prior written consent of SOCOG, which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion, it (sic) has no right to use and it will not use for any purpose, including but not limited to for any marketing, promotional or advertising purpose, any words, phrases, symbols or images which, in SOCOG’s opinion, suggest any connection or association between the Trustee or Synthesis and SOCOG, the IOC and the AOC, the Games or any of the Teams. The Trustee and Synthesis further agree that, without the prior written consent of SOCOG, which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion, in any marketing, promotion or advertisement it will not: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (1) refer to SOCOG, the IOC and the AOC, the Games or any of the Teams; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (2) use the words ‘Olympic’, ‘Games’, ‘Sydney 2000’; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (3) use any other words, phrases, symbols or images which refer to, directly or indirectly, SOCOG, the IOC and the AOC, the Games or any of the Teams; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (4) use any ‘Sydney 2000 Games images’ or ‘Sydney 2000 Games indicia’ (as those terms are defined in the  
           Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 
             
           1996 (Cth). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (d) The Trustee and Synthesis must ensure that its directors, contractors, employees and agents or any person involved in or associated with the operations of the Club do not give interviews, appear in any promotion or advertisement or render any assistance to the media in relation to any story concerning the affairs of SOCOG, the IOC, the AOC or the Games, without the prior consent of SOCOG and must not make any statements which are, in SOCOG’s reasonable opinion, contrary or prejudicial to the aims and objectives of SOCOG, the AOC, the IOC or the Olympic Movement. The Trustee and Synthesis must not make or permit the making of any statement or announcement of its involvement or association with the Club without the prior written consent of SOCOG. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Each of the Trustee and Synthesis will procure to the satisfaction of SOCOG that each person with whom it deals in relation to the Club observes the provisions of this clause 25, by entering into a deed of confidentiality in the form required by SOCOG.” 
         
        
       
     9 Clause 27 of the Establishment Agreement was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) The Trustee will procure that each person with whom it deals in the course of carrying out its functions in relation to the Club (other than Members and such other persons or persons in such classes as are notified by SOCOG to the Trustee for the purpose of this clause from time to time) executes a deed in the form of the document comprised in Annexure F (Marketing Restriction Deed) in favour of SOCOG under which the person agrees, amongst other things, not to represent, hold out, promote or advertise its connection with SOCOG, the AOC or the Games without SOCOG’s prior written permission. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) SOCOG and the Trustee agree to negotiate in good faith the persons and classes of persons with whom the Trustee may deal to whom this obligation does not apply.” 
         
        
        
        
       The Olympic Club Licence Agreement 
        
       
     10 On 14 May 1998 SOCOG and TOC, as trustee of the Olympic Club Trust, entered into the Olympic Club Licence Agreement (the Licence Agreement) which recited  
      
       
     · that the AOC had appointed SOCOG as the exclusive entity for the purposes of organising and staging the Olympic Games in Sydney, that SOCOG, in its own right and/or on behalf of the AOC, had the authority to grant to TOC as trustee certain rights and opportunities relating to the Games, to SOCOG, to the 1998 and 2000 Australian Olympic Teams and to the AOC,  
      
       
     · that pursuant to the Establishment Agreement, SOCOG and the AOC had granted certain rights to use intellectual property in connection with the Club subject to the terms of a long form licence agreement entered into in respect of that property,  
      
       
     · that it was important that the rights and opportunities granted to TOC as trustee pursuant to the Licence Agreement be used in a manner which maintained and enhanced the nature of the Olympic movement and furthered the achievement of its aims, and  
      
       
     · that the parties had agreed to enter into the Licence Agreement to govern the terms of the grant of the rights under the Establishment Agreement and such further rights and licences as were set out in the Licence Agreement.  
      
       
     11 The Licence Agreement defined “Club Logo” as having the meaning given it in the Establishment Agreement and included the logo in Appendix D. The Club Logo in Appendix D incorporated the Games Logo with the five Olympic rings and the phrase “Sydney 2000”. The expressions “Olympic marks”, “SOCOG designations”, “SOCOG emblems” and “SOCOG marks” were also defined. TOC was referred to as “the Trustee”. Clause 2 of the Licence Agreement provided as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         2 
           
         Olympic Charter 
         
        
        
         
         2.1 All provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the Olympic Charter and, if any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Olympic Charter arises, the provisions of the Olympic Charter shall prevail, unless contrary to Australian law. The Trustee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Olympic Charter and agrees to abide by all requirements applicable to the Trustee. Subject to clause 2.2, the terms of this Agreement shall not be affected by any amendment to the Olympic Charter which occur after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Games, unless by mutual agreement of SOCOG and the Trustee. 
         
        
        
         
         2.2 Notwithstanding clause 2.1, during the Games, the Trustee shall abide by all requirements in the Charter which is current at the time of the Games and which are: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) applicable to the Trustee or the operations of the Olympic Club; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) notified to the Trustee under clause 3.8. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           SOCOG will provide to the Trustee a copy of that Charter when it becomes available.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     12 Clause 3 was headed “Grant of Rights”. The following sub-clause is particularly important: 
      
       
        
         
         “3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SOCOG: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) confirms that the following rights and approvals have been granted to the Trustee under, and subject to, the Establishment Agreement: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) the exclusive right to establish and operate the Olympic Club in accordance with the provisions of the Establishment Agreement; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     (ii) approval for the exclusive use of the Business Name; 
      
       
     (iii) approval for the exclusive use of any Club Logo; 
      
       
     (iv) the exclusive right to use SOCOG Designations; 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (v) the non-exclusive right to use the Olympic Marks; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) grants to the Trustee during the Term solely with respect to the Olympic Club, the rights and opportunities set out in Appendices A1 and A2, to be exercised in and only in Australia from the date of execution of this Agreement to 31 December 2000.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     13 It is important to note that the rights and opportunities granted were to be exercised in and only in Australia. The SOCOG and AOC rights were described in the Appendices A1 and A2, in so far as they were connected with the promotion and advertising of the Club to indicate a relationship or association with the Games or SOCOG or the AOC, as the “right in Australia”. 
      
       
     14 By cl 3.2 in relation to the business name, TOC as trustee agreed: 
      
       
        
         
         “(e) The Trustee must at all times carry on the Olympic Club only under the Business Name and not use the Business Name except in carrying on the Olympic Club;” 
         
        
       
     15 Clause 3.3 enabled the trustee to develop a Club logo in relation to the Club in consultation with SOCOG.  
      
       
        
         
         “Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and any Transaction Document, the Trustee agrees that: 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) the Trustee must not use the Club Logo except in carrying on the Olympic Club; 
         
        
        
         
         (g) the Trustee must not allow any other person to use the Club Logo or otherwise deal with it without first obtaining SOCOG’s written consent, and the Trustee agrees that it will not assist, permit or condone the use of the Club Logo by any other person except as permitted by the Management Agreement or any other Transaction Document or as may otherwise be approved by SOCOG and the AOC; 
         
        
        
         
         (h) the Trustee may, notwithstanding paragraph (g), authorise its employees, agents and contractors to use the Club Logo in relation to the Olympic Club and in a manner consistent with this Agreement; ….” 
         
        
       
     16 Clause 3.4 provided that SOCOG, on behalf of the AOC and pursuant to the Olympic Charter, “approves the use by the Trustee of the Olympic Marks in Australia with respect to the Olympic Club on the terms set out in this Agreement.” 
      
       
     17 Clause 3.5 provided, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “3.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not, except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement or a Transaction Document: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) use or authorise the use of any or all of the Olympic Marks on or in relation to any goods or services of the Trustee or any third person, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; ….” 
           
          
         
        
       
     18 Clause 3.7 provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Trustee shall exercise the right and opportunities granted under this Agreement: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) in a manner consistent with the good name, goodwill, reputation and image of the IOC, SOCOG, the AOC, the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Marks and in compliance with the Olympic Charter and all applicable laws and regulations; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) strictly in accordance with any direction given by SOCOG or the Club Committee under this Agreement or any Transaction Document.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     19 Clauses 3.10 and 3.11 provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “3.10 The Trustee shall not: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) enter into any agreement or arrangements with third parties or take any other action which is or may be inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) do any act which would, or is likely to cause SOCOG to breach any agreement between SOCOG and a Games Sponsor. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         3.11 All rights not expressly granted to the Trustee in this Agreement or pursuant to the Establishment Agreement or any other Transaction Document are reserved by SOCOG and may be exploited by SOCOG in its absolute discretion subject to the terms of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document. All rights granted to the Trustee may be exercised only by the Trustee and not by any other person including, without limitation, any related body corporate as defined in Section 50 of the Corporations Law.” 
         
        
       
     20 Clause 9 was headed “Material Obligations and Termination”. Clause 9.1 provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “9.1 The Trustee agrees that the occurrence of any of the following events will constitute the breach of a material obligation under this Agreement entitling the Club Committee to remove the Trustee from its position as trustee of the Trust pursuant to clause 5(i) of the Establishment Agreement: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the Trustee commits a material breach of this Agreement which, in the opinion of SOCOG, is incapable of remedy; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the Trustee commits a material breach of this Agreement which, if capable of remedy, is not remedied within 30 days (or such further period as SOCOG allows) of receipt of a notice from SOCOG to rectify the default; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the Trustee uses the Olympic Marks otherwise than in accordance with this Agreement, uses a ‘protected design’ (as that phrase is defined in the  
           Olympic Insignia Protection Act 
            1987), otherwise than in accordance with this Agreement or that Act, or claims interests adverse to the rights of SOCOG, the AOC or the IOC, and such use not being remedied or adverse claim withdrawn as soon as possible but in any event no later than 30 days after receipt of written notice of such misuse or adverse claim; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the Trustee engages in conduct which in the reasonable opinion of SOCOG reflects unfavourably on the good name, goodwill, reputation or image of the IOC, SOCOG, the AOC, the Games or the Olympic Movement, or which is in any manner inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and such conduct is not remedied as soon as possible but in any event no later than 30 days after receipt of written notice from SOCOG of such conduct.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     21 In cl 13 “Miscellaneous” was sub-cl 13.1 which provided as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Assignment 
         
        
        
         
         Neither this Agreement nor any of the Trustee’s rights or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned, sub-licensed, transferred, mortgaged, charged, sub-contracted or otherwise dealt with by the Trustee without the prior written consent of SOCOG. Any attempted dealing by the Trustee with its rights or obligations without SOCOG’s consent shall be void and considered a material breach of this Agreement. The provisions of this clause do not limit the Trustee’s rights to permit employees, agents, contractors and consultants of the Trustee to use the Club Logo for the purposes described in clause 3.3(h).” 
         
        
       
     22 Clause 13.4 provided that any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of the Agreement should be in writing and should not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or any other provision of the Agreement.  
      
       
        
         
         “Failure by either party to insist upon strict adherence to any provision of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive such party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that provision or any other provision of this Agreement.” 
         
        
        
        
       The Agency Agreement 
        
       
     23 On 11 March 1999 the plaintiff and TOC signed an Agency Agreement to commence on 1 April 1999 (the commencement date) with an initial termination date defined as 30 June 1999. The further term was defined as the period 1 July 1999 to 30 September 2000. Zhu’s evidence was that on 11 March 1999 he attended by prior arrangement at the office of the solicitors for the Club, Kaufmann Peters, at Loftus Street, Sydney to sign the Agency Agreement and a document headed partly in print and partly in hand-print “Marketing Restriction Deed Poll” (the Deed Poll). His own solicitor was present and witnessed his signature. Noble was also present. In the Agency Agreement TOC was referred to as “the Company”.  
      
       
     24 In the Agency Agreement the word “Services” was defined in cl 1.1 as “the activities to be conducted or supervised by the Agent set out in Schedule 1 or any part thereof”. Schedule 1 provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Services (Clause 1.1) 
         
        
        
         
         During the Initial Term the Agent shall sell 2,000 International Memberships in the Territory to Mainland Chinese visiting Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and during the Further Term 8,000 International Memberships.” 
         
        
        
       “Standards” was defined to mean the standards of performance of the Services set out in Schedule 3 which provided: 
        
        
         
         “1. All activities are to be undertaken in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Company from time to time. 
         
        
        
         
         2. To the extent it is within the Agent’s control, all activities are to be undertaken within the time frame set by the Company for the completion of any given task. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Reporting timetables nominated by the Company are to be adhered to, subject to this not being precluded by factors beyond the control of the Agent. 
         
        
        
         
         4. All statutory requirements, to the extent they are within the Agent’s control, are to be complied with.” 
         
        
        
       
     25 The “Territory” was defined as the Mainland of The Peoples Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong), in which “the Agent will perform the Services”. “International Memberships” were defined as “International Membership of The Olympic Club of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games as endorsed by the Sydney and Australia Olympic Committees”.  
      
       
     26 Relevantly the Agency Agreement provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “2.  
         Agency 
         
        
        
         
         2.1 The Company hereby appoints the Agent exclusively and the Agent agrees to accept the exclusive appointment to provide the services to the company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement for the initial term and (if applicable) the further term.”  
         
        
        
       Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Agency Agreement were as follows: 
        
        
         
         “3.  
         Term of Agency 
         
        
        
         
         3.1 The Agency shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall terminate on the Initial Termination Date (the ‘Initial Term’) unless earlier terminated by the Company in accordance with clause 15.2, or extended by the exercise of the Option. 
         
        
        
         
         4.  
         The Option 
         
        
        
         
         4.1 Subject to the Conditions Precedent set out in Clause 5, the Company grants to the Agent an Option for the Further Term on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
         
        
        
         
         5.  
         Conditions Precedent to The Exercise of The Option 
         
        
        
         
         5.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that the following duties and responsibilities are Conditions Precedent to the exercise of the Option granted in Clause 4: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) The Agent shall sell, by no later than 30 June 1999, a minimum of 2000 International Memberships in the Territory. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) The Agent shall pay to the Company all and any Membership Fees due and owing including the minimum sum of AUD$700,000 in respect of this clause 5.1(a). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) The Agent shall not be in any breach of this Agreement.” 
           
          
         
        
       In consideration of TOC appointing Zhu its agents for the term, Zhu was to pay TOC an Agency Fee of $30,000 (cl 6.1). Zhu arranged for the payment of this fee to the Club on 8 March 1999. TOC acknowledged receipt in Schedule 4 of the Agency Agreement.  
        
       
     27 By cl 7.1 TOC covenanted and agreed with the Agent that the appointment of the Agent was exclusive within the Territory and that upon execution of the Agency Agreement TOC would provide to the Agent a letter introducing the Agent as the exclusive authorised Agent of the company and the Club to sell International Memberships to the people of the Mainland of The Peoples Republic of China. A copy of the letter of introduction was said to be annexed to the Agency Agreement and marked “A”. Annexure A includes no more than a heading “Letter of Introduction (cl 7.1(b))”. Bergin J thought this indicative of the sense of urgency with which the Agency Agreement was entered into (para 136). The plaintiff’s evidence was that on 11 March 1999, shortly after the Agency Agreement had been signed, Noble handed him a document dated 8 March 1999 which was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

     28 Clause 9.1 of the Agency Agreement was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Agent covenants and agrees with the Company that he shall: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Do all things and sign all documents reasonably necessary to obtain the appropriate and required approvals and authorisations from the Government of the Peoples Republic of China and the Chinese Olympic Committee. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Refrain from, in any way, utilising the Sydney 2000 Olympic Club Logo or this Agency generally for the purpose of promoting, marketing or selling any services other than the International Memberships and the Agent agrees to execute the Marketing Restriction Deed Poll presented to him at the time of executing this Agreement. For the sake of clarity, the Marketing Restriction is to extend to, but not be limited to, the sale of travel schemes, arrangements or tickets to Australia, accommodation in Australia, other activities in Australia, and all and any merchandising by the Agent or all and any of his associated or related entities, individuals or bodies corporate. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) To obtain the written approval of the Company prior to utilising the Sydney 2000 Olympic Club Logo or any variation thereon in any print or electronic media or marketing or sales material.” 
         
        
       
     29 Clauses 10 and 11 of the Agency Agreement were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “10

         11.1 If, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, the Services or any of them are at any time not being satisfactorily performed, the Company will so notify the Agent and the Company and the Agent will consult together in good faith as to the best method of rectifying the problem. 
         
        
        
         
         11.2 The Agent will use its best endeavours to remedy unsatisfactory performance of the services as soon as possible including, without limitation, by performing the unsatisfactory Services again, and by taking appropriate measures to ensure that the problem does not recur. 
         
        
        
         
         11.3 If, in the opinion of the Company, the Agent fails to use its best endeavours to remedy any unsatisfactory performance or other breach of this Agreement, the Company may, in its absolute discretion, terminate this Agency on fourteen (14) days within notice of its intention so to do.”  
         
        
       
     30 Clause 12 of the Agency Agreement was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “12

           (c) Represent to any person that he has the authority of the Company to pledge the Company’s credit or receive or pay moneys on behalf of the Company otherwise than in accordance with this clause 12(b).” 
           
          
         
        
       
     31 Clause 15 of the Agency Agreement dealt with termination of the Agency. The following sub-clauses are relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “15.2 The Company may terminate the Agency at any time by giving fourteen (14) days written notice to the Agent (the ‘Termination Notice’) if the Agent is in breach of his duties as specified in clause 8 provided that a Rectification Notice has earlier been given by the Company to the Agent and the Breach(es) specified therein have not been rectified;

         15.4 Nothing in this clause 15 shall be taken to or is intended to affect or restrict the Company’s right to terminate the Agency if the Agent is guilty of conduct justifying summary dismissal.” 
         
        
        
       Marketing Restriction Deed Poll 
        
       
     32 In accordance with cl 27(a) of the Establishment Agreement and pursuant to the Agency Agreement, the plaintiff as Covenantor signed a Marketing Restriction Deed Poll (the Deed Poll) directed to SOCOG. The relevant terms were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “In order to protect the rights of SOCOG, the Australian Olympic Committee Incorporated, the International Olympic Committee, the Olympic movement and the official sponsors, suppliers and others who are from time to time authorised to use those rights (Olympic Bodies), the Covenantor is required to execute this deed in favour of SOCOG. 
         
        
        
         
         1. The Covenantor will not, without the prior written permission of SOCOG, which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion, represent, hold out, market, promote or advertise in any way that it has any connection or association with the Olympic Bodies, the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (the Olympic Games) or the 1998 or 2000 Australian Olympic teams (the Teams). 
         
        
        
         
         2. The Covenantor acknowledges that it has no right to use any intellectual property belonging to any Olympic Body, including but not limited to, any Olympic logo, mark or design. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The Covenantor agrees that, without the prior written consent of SOCOG, which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion, it has no right to use and it will not use for any purpose, including, but limited [sic – not limited] to, for any marketing, promotional or advertising purpose, any words, phrases, symbols or images which, in SOCOG’s opinion, suggest any connection or association between the Covenantor and any Olympic Body, the Olympic Games or any of the Teams. The Covenantor further agrees that, without the prior written consent of SOCOG (which SOCOG may withhold in its absolute discretion), in any marketing, promotion or advertisement it will not: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) refer to any Olympic Body, the Olympic Games or any of the Teams; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) use the words ‘Olympic’, ‘Games’, ‘Sydney 2000’; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) use any other words, phrases, symbols or images which refer to, directly or indirectly, any Olympic Body, the Olympic Games or any of the Teams; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) use any ‘Sydney 2000 Games images’ or ‘Sydney 2000 Games indicia’ (as those terms are defined in the  
           Sydney 2000 (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 
            1996 (Cth). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         4. The obligations of the Covenantor imposed by this deed shall survive notwithstanding the expiry or termination of any agreement to which it is a party. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The obligations of the Covenantor imposed by this deed are subject to any rights granted to the Covenantor by any Olympic Body, any rights granted to the Covenantor by operation of law (including without limitation under the Corporations Law and the rules of the Australian Stock Exchange Limited). 
         
        
        
         
         6. This deed is irrevocable and the obligations of the Covenantor under this deed terminate on 31 December 2000 but termination will not prejudice any antecedent rights of SOCOG against the Covenantor.”

     33 As the Deed Poll mentioned, valuable intellectual property was owned on behalf of the Olympic Movement, a loose collective description of International Federations, National Olympic Committees (NOC’s), Organising Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOG’s), National Associations, Clubs, and persons belonging to them, particularly athletes, judges/referees, coaches and other sports technicians together with other organisations and institutions recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). To understand how this property was protected and exploited by its owner, the following documents and statutes need to be examined:  
      
       
     · the Olympic Charter, 
      
       
     · the Host City Contract for the Sydney 2000 Games entered into by the City of Sydney and the AOC,  
      
       
     · the statutory constitution of SOCOG, and  
      
       
     · the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 (Cth) (Indicia and Images Protection Act).  
      
       
        
       I set out the relevant parts of these. 
        
        
       The Olympic Charter 
        
       
     34 The Olympic Charter which was expressed to be in force from 3 September 1997, began with paragraphs headed “Fundamental Principles”. These referred to “the supreme Authority” of the IOC. The goal of the Olympic Movement was to contribute to building a peaceful and better world “in the Olympic spirit, which [required] mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play”. Chapter 1 of the Charter was headed “The Olympic Movement”. Clause 1 stated that any person or organisation belonging in any capacity whatsoever to the Olympic Movement was bound by the provisions of the Olympic Charter and should abide by the decisions of the IOC.  
      
       
     35 Rule 11 of Chapter 1 was headed “Rights over the Olympic Games” and provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Olympic Games are the exclusive property of the IOC which owns all rights relating thereto, in particular, and without limitation, the rights relating to their organisation, exploitation, broadcasting and reproduction by any means whatsoever. 
         
        
        
         
         All profits derived from the celebration of the Olympic Games shall be applied to the development of the Olympic Movement and of sport.” 
         
        
       
     36 Chapter 1, rules 12-16 described and defined the Olympic Symbol, the Olympic Flag, the Olympic Motto, the Olympic Emblem and the Olympic Anthem. Rule 17, which was headed “Rights to the Olympic Symbol, Flag, Motto and Anthem” provided as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “All rights to the Olympic symbol, the Olympic flag, the Olympic motto and the Olympic anthem belong exclusively to the IOC.” 
         
        
        
       A bye-law to rules 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, parts of which are set out below, followed rule 17. Paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the bye-law are important to this appeal. 
        
        
         
         “1. 1.1 The IOC may take all appropriate steps to obtain the legal protection, both on a national and international basis, of the Olympic symbol, flag, motto and anthem. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           1.2 Even if the national law or a trademark registration grants to an NOC the protection of the Olympic symbol, such NOC may only use the ensuing rights in accordance with instructions received from the IOC Executive Board. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         2. Each NOC is responsible to the IOC for the observance, in its country, of Rules 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 and of their Bye-law. It shall take steps to prohibit any use of the Olympic symbol, flag, motto or anthem which would be contrary to these Rules or their Bye-law. It shall also endeavour to obtain protection of the designations ‘Olympic’ and ‘Olympiad’ for the benefit of the IOC. 
         
        
        
         
         3. An NOC may at any time call upon the IOC for its assistance in obtaining protection, as envisaged above, for the Olympic symbol, flag, motto or anthem and for the settlement of any differences which may arise with third parties in such matters. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The NOCs may only use the Olympic symbol, flag, motto and anthem within the framework of their non-profit-making activities, provided such use contributes to the development of the Olympic Movement and does not detract from its dignity and provided the NOCs concerned have obtained the prior approval of the IOC Executive Board. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The IOC encourages, in collaboration with the NOCs of the countries concerned, the use of the Olympic symbol on postage stamps issued in liaison with the IOC by the competent national authorities; to that effect, it may authorize the use of the Olympic symbol subject to the conditions set forth by the IOC Executive Board. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         7. 
          
         … 
          
           
           7.7 Whenever and wherever possible, the Olympic emblem of an NOC must be susceptible of registration (ie of legal protection) by the NOC in its country. The NOC must carry out such registration within six months of such emblem’s approval by the IOC Executive Board and provide the IOC with proof of registration. IOC Executive Board approval of Olympic emblems may be withdrawn unless the NOCs concerned take all possible steps to protect their Olympic emblems and inform the IOC of such protection. Similarly, the OCOGs must protect their Olympic emblems, in the manner described above, in their countries as well as in other countries as decided in consultation with the IOC Executive Board. Any protection obtained by the NOCs and the OCOGs cannot be put forward against the IOC. 
           
          
         … 
         
        
        
         
         8. The use of the Olympic symbol, flag, motto and anthem for any advertising, commercial or profit-making purposes whatsoever is strictly reserved for the IOC. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The use of an Olympic emblem for any advertising, commercial or profit-making purposes whatsoever must be in accordance with the conditions laid down in paragraphs 10 and 11 below. 
         
        
        
         
         10. Any NOC or OCOG wishing to use its Olympic emblem for any advertising, commercial or profit-making purposes whatsoever, either directly or through third parties, must comply with this Bye-law and ensure its observance by such third parties. 
         
        
        
         
         11. All contracts or arrangements, including those concluded by an OCOG, shall be signed or approved by the NOC concerned and shall be governed by the following principles: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           11.1 The use of an NOC Olympic emblem shall only be valid within the country of the said NOC; such emblem, as well as any other Olympic-related symbols, emblems, marks or designations of an NOC, may not be used for any advertising, commercial or profit-making purposes whatsoever in the country of another NOC without the latter’s prior written approval; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           11.2 similarly, the Olympic emblem of an OCOG as well as any other Olympic-related symbols, emblems, marks or designations of an OCOG, may not be used for any advertising, commercial or profit-making purposes whatsoever in the country of an NOC without the prior written approval of such NOC; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           11.3 in all cases, the period of validity of any contract concluded by an OCOG must not extend beyond December 31st of the year of the Olympic Games concerned; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           11.4 the use of an Olympic emblem must contribute to the development of the Olympic Movement and must not detract from its dignity; any association whatsoever between an Olympic emblem and products or services is prohibited if such association is incompatible with the fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter or the role of the IOC as set out therein. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           11.5 upon request by the IOC, any NOC or OCOG shall provide a copy of any contract to which it is a party. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         12. The Olympic symbol and the Olympic emblems of the IOC may be exploited by it or by a person authorized by it, in the country of an NOC, provided that the following conditions are respectively fulfilled: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           12.1 For all sponsorship and suppliership agreements and for all marketing initiatives other than those referred to in paragraph 12.2 below, the condition shall be that such exploitation does not cause serious damage to the interests of the NOC concerned and that the decision be taken by the IOC Executive Board in consultation with such NOC, which shall receive part of the net proceeds deriving from such exploitation. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           12.2 For all licensing agreements, the condition shall be that the NOC shall receive half of all net income from such exploitation, after the deduction of all taxes and out-of-pocket costs relating thereto. The NOC will be informed in advance of any such exploitation.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       Paragraph 12 of the bye-law contemplated exploitation for advertising, commercial or profit making purposes of the Olympic Symbol and the Olympic Emblems outside Australia (the country of AOC and SOCOG) by an authorised person in the country of a National Olympic Organisation provided this did not cause serious damage to the interests of the NOC concerned and the NOC received part of the net proceeds derived from such exploitation. 
        
        
       Host City Contract 
        
       
     37 On 23 September 1993 the IOC entered into the Host City Contract with the City of Sydney and the AOC. Clause 48 of that contract entitled the IOC Executive Board to terminate the contract and to withdraw the Games from Sydney if, inter alia, 
      
       
        
         
         “(iii) there is a violation by the City, the NOC or the OCOG of any material obligation set forth in this Contract, the Olympic Charter or the applicable law.” 
         
        
        
       SOCOG’s Constitution 
        
       
     38 In 1993 SOCOG was constituted by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games Act. It had the same legal capacity and powers as a company under the Corporations Law. The primary objective of SOCOG was to organise and stage the Sydney Games in the year 2000 in accordance with the rights and obligations conferred and imposed under the Host City Contract (s9(1)). A specific function was to become a party to the Host City Contract and perform its obligations under that Contract (s10(1)). In relation to the Games, the functions of SOCOG included establishing a marketing programme in consultation with the IOC and the AOC (s10(2)(d)). In exercising its functions SOCOG was required to take into account “to the fullest extent practicable” the Olympic Charter, the host city contract, any instructions given to it by the Executive Board of the IOC as contemplated by the host city contract and commitments made by the AOC, the Council of the City of Sydney or Sydney Olympics 2000 Bid Limited to the IOC unless agreed otherwise in writing by the Executive Board of the IOC (s11). 
      
       
        
       The Indicia and Images Protection Act 
        
       
     39 The Indicia and Images Protection Act had amongst its objects “to protect, and to further, the position of Australia as a participant in, and a supporter of, the world Olympic and Paralympic movements” and “to the extent that it is within the power of the Parliament, to assist in protecting the relations, and in ensuring the performance of the obligations, of the Sydney 2000 Games bodies with and to the world Olympic and Paralympic movements” in relation to the holding of the Sydney 2000 Games (s3(1)). The expression “Sydney 2000 Games bodies” included SOCOG (s3(3)). Section 8 defined the meaning of “common Sydney 2000 Games indicia” to include the phrases “Sydney 2000” and “Sydney 2000 Olympic Games indicia” and to include the word “Olympic”. Section 9 defined “common Sydney 2000 Games images” and “Sydney 2000 Olympic Games images”. Section 11 described what was meant by “use for commercial purposes”. A person was said to use Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images for commercial purposes, relevantly, if (a) the person applied the indicia or images to goods or services of the person and (b) the application was for advertising or promotional purposes, or was likely to enhance the demand for the goods or services and (c) the application, to a reasonable person, would suggest that the first mentioned person was or was a sponsor of, or was the provider of other support for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.  
      
       
     40 In Part 3, “Protection”, Division 1, “Regulation of Use”, was found s12 which, so far as presently relevant, provided as follows:

         (4) A licensed user may only use for commercial purposes the Sydney 2000 Games indicia and images that the person is licensed to use, and may only use those indicia and images in accordance with the licence.” 
         
        
        
       Section 13A provided for the purposes of the Act that a person was taken to have contravened s12 if that person had attempted to contravene the section, had aided, abetted, counselled or procured a contravention, had induced, or attempted to induce a person to contravene it, had been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention of the section or had conspired with others to contravene it. 
        
       
     41 Section 7 of the Indicia and Images Protection Act defined a licensed user to mean a person in relation to whom a licence under s14 was in force. Section 14 provided that for the purposes of the Act SOCOG might license a person to use all, or any one or more, of the common Sydney 2000 Games indicia, Sydney 2000 Olympic Games indicia, common Sydney 2000 Games images and Sydney 2000 Olympic Games images in all circumstances or in specified circumstances, for a specified time or until the Act ceased to have effect. Section 15 provided that where SOCOG licensed a person to use Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images it must make an entry in the register of licensed users. Licensing took effect when the entry was made in the register. Section 16 required SOCOG to establish and maintain a register of licensed users. Section 17 provided that an entry in the register must contain in relation to the licence user, inter alia, the Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images the person might use for commercial purposes, and the circumstances in which the person might use those indicia or images. Section 19(1) provided subject to matters therein material that a person whose name appeared in an entry in the register was to be taken to be a licensed user, for the purposes of the Act, of the Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images specified in the entry. 
      
       
     42 Section 43 in Division 3 “Remedies” provided:

       Background material 
        
       
     44 The following account is based upon Bergin J’s findings which were not challenged. Before January 1999 TOC engaged a company known as Salesforce Australia Pty Limited (Salesforce) to provide services for direct sales of Club memberships to the general public. Salesforce arranged for a team of sales representatives to sell memberships of the Club by way of a door knock approach. Noble was responsible for the supervision of the Salesforce personnel, one of whom was Tim Go (Go). In January 1999 Go informed Noble that he knew the plaintiff and that the plaintiff thought that there was a market for selling Club memberships to residents of mainland China as part of an accommodation and travel package for the Games. Noble asked Go to arrange for the plaintiff to visit him. 
      
       
     45 Early in February 1999 a meeting took place in the TOC offices at Chatswood between the plaintiff, Noble and Go. The plaintiff told Noble that he saw a big market in China for people to come to the Games. Noble told the plaintiff that the Club did have some ideas for taking the Club internationally beyond the Games and that his idea could work in well with the Club’s “long term plan”. Noble informed the plaintiff that he would speak to his directors and then they would speak to SOCOG because “everything had to be approved by SOCOG”. The plaintiff also told Noble that he would need to provide tickets to the Games in his accommodation package. The Chinese interest in such sports as badminton, table tennis and soccer was discussed and the plaintiff asked whether it would be possible to buy tickets for such events and include them in the package. Noble told the plaintiff that he could not guarantee it and said “but with our connections with SOCOG, I would be able to provide you with assistance with your negotiations with SOCOG” and “it is likely that there will be tickets available for the less popular sports”. 
      
       
     46 The plaintiff and Noble continued to meet on other occasions in February 1999. During one of their meetings Noble told the plaintiff that he had the “go ahead” for the plaintiff’s idea. Noble requested a copy of the plaintiff’s resume and two reference letters as “we will need to check you out”. By late February the plaintiff had worked out the elements of the basic travel and accommodation package incorporating Club memberships which he intended to sell. At a meeting with Noble in late February the following conversation took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “Noble: You can probably sell as many memberships in China as you like. There will be no real limit. However, we can only provide you a maximum 10,000 at the Opening Ceremony Dress Rehearsal. Accordingly, our contract in the first place will have to be limited to that number because of the restriction on those tickets. It won’t be a problem however if you want to sell more than that if demand for memberships is great, then you could sell more, but we’ll have to discuss that and you must understand that any extra memberships over the 10,000 would be sold without tickets to the Opening Ceremony Dress Rehearsal being guaranteed. For the time being therefore, we will leave it at 10,000 and see how your sales go. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff: I would be prepared to pay a $350 fee for each Club membership, if that includes one ticket to the Opening Ceremony Dress Rehearsal. Can you and SOCOG guarantee that I can get 10,000 tickets to the Opening Ceremony Dress Rehearsal? 
         
        
        
         
         Noble: Oh, sure. We can guarantee 10,000 to the Dress Rehearsal guaranteed.” 
         
        
       
     47 The plaintiff told Noble he would need a letter of introduction that he could use as authority to act on behalf of the Club and a letter of introduction to the Chinese Olympic Committee. Noble told the plaintiff there would be no problem in providing such letters and advised him that “we will need a simple form of Agency Agreement”. He also told the plaintiff that “you have our full support, we really like the idea and are planning to establish agencies in other countries”. The following conversation took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff: Do I need to notify the names of members as they are sold? How will it work? 
         
        
        
         
         Noble: You can buy memberships in bulk and on-sell them as part of your travel packages. Then you provide us with the member’s name and mailing address we can then send out the welcome kit and enter the details in the database.” 
         
        
       
     48 On 3 March 1999 Noble faxed to the plaintiff a draft Letter of Understanding and Introduction Letter for discussion. After the plaintiff replied to that letter on 4 March 1999 Noble signed the terms of a letter dated 8 March 1999 which was also signed by the plaintiff as Chairman of Australian Chinese Sports Connections Pty Ltd (ACSC). In discussions in February the plaintiff told Noble that he had purchased this company for use in the sale of the packages. Noble told the plaintiff that he could use a company but that the Agency Agreement needed to be in the plaintiff’s name because the Club wanted him to be personally responsible for the Agency. 
      
       
     49 On 10 March Noble supplied the plaintiff with a letter of that date signed by him as Commercial Director introducing the plaintiff to the Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Chairman 
          
         Chinese Olympic Committee 
         
        
        
         
         Dear Sir 
         
        
        
         
         The Olympic Club of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games is pleased to advise that Mr Peter Tao Zhu has been chosen as the Exclusive Authorised Agent of the Club to market International Memberships to residents of the Peoples’ Republic of China in China. 
         
        
        
         
         The Olympic Club has chosen Mr Zhu as its first Exclusive Authorised Agent for Overseas Memberships after lengthy consultations, discussions and investigation. We are therefore pleased to introduce Mr Zhu to your Committee. 
         
        
        
         
         We respectfully request you provide such assistance as your Committee deems appropriate to Mr Zhu in his work of enlisting Peoples’ Republic of China residents to join the Club via these International Memberships.” 
         
        
       
     50 I interpolate here that this may have been intended to achieve some compliance with the bye-law to rule 17 para 12 of the Olympic Charter by informing the Mainland Chinese NOC about the sale in that country of Olympic Club International Memberships. In fact, to sell or market Olympic Club International memberships to “Chinese residents” or “residents of the Peoples’ Republic of China in China” was in breach of paras 11 and 12 of the bye-law in the Olympic Charter and s12 of the Indicia and Images Protection Act unless Zhu was, within the meaning of that Act, a licensed user and some part of the proceeds of exploitation in Mainland China were to go to the Chinese NOC. Such a breach was a ground for termination of the Host City Contract under cl48(iii). 
      
       
     51 On 10 March 1999 the plaintiff met with Mr Keming Wu, the Consul General of the Peoples Republic of China in Sydney, at the Consulate General’s Office in Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills. The Consul General informed the plaintiff that he would do everything he could to assist him and arrange for him to meet with the “top sports administrators in China”. He informed the plaintiff he would arrange for him to meet with Mr Tu Mingde (Tu), the Director of the Liaison Department of the State Sports General Administration and Chief Secretary of the Chinese Olympic Committee and also Mr Shaozu Wu (Wu), the Minister for Sport in China. For this purpose the Consul General provided a letter to the plaintiff directed to the State Sports General Administration of China for assistance in the activities he would be undertaking. 
      
       
     52 On 11 March 1999 the plaintiff and TOC signed the Agency Agreement in the circumstances already described and the plaintiff received from Noble the letter dated 8 March 1999 signed by Wyness. 
      
       
     53 On 23 March 1999 the plaintiff met with Tu in China. They spoke of his plans for arranging travel to Sydney for the supporters of the Chinese Olympic Team during the Games. Tu said that the Chinese Olympic Committee did not have any right to grant approvals and it was not interested in participating in that type of commercial activity. The plaintiff raised with Tu the possibility of receiving a letter of support. Tu said: “I cannot issue a letter of support because your activity has not yet commenced. When you have concrete plans, let me know and our Olympic Committee will consider them and provide its assistance”. The plaintiff told Tu that he would donate “nearly half of the profit” generated from the project, which he advised was US$1 million, to support “Chinese Sports”. 
      
       
     54 After the meeting with Tu, the plaintiff wrote to the Consul General in Sydney on 29 March 1999 telling him about his activities in China in the previous three weeks, including his meeting with Tu. He also told the Consul General about his meeting with the Vice President of the Tianjin Municipal Sports Committee and Government departments and companies in Shanghai.  
      
       
     55 From March until June 1999 the plaintiff made trips to and from China and was away from Australia for most of that time setting up the marketing of his project. He appointed several sub-agents, one of whom was Zhang Zhao Ming (Zhang). While he was away Go acted on the plaintiff’s behalf in communicating with Noble and the Club.  
      
       
     56 On 29 March 1999 Wyness wrote to McLatchley, the Secretary-General of the AOC advising “we have been approached by individuals wishing to develop travel and accommodation packages to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games with International Australian Olympic Club Memberships attached for the Territories China, Turkey, Macedonia, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka.” He asked McLatchley to advise those National Olympic committees that the Australian Olympic Club was an initiative of SOCOG and the AOC and was fully supported by the AOC. His letter made no mention of the Agency Agreement of 11 March with the plaintiff or the letter of 8 March whereby Wyness under seal had authorised the plaintiff to act as TOC’s exclusive agent in the Peoples’ Republic of China. 
      
       
     57 On 15 April 1999 the Club Committee met. Reading, McLatchley and Wyness with Noble were in attendance. The minutes showed that Noble provided the Committee with a document outlining the Club’s then current financial position, some key budget assumptions and contingency plans. Also produced was a document Wyness prepared with the assistance of his staff entitled “Incremental Revenue Opportunities” which included a section entitled “International Olympic Club Membership”.  
      
       
     58 The section dealing with International Memberships recorded that memberships were to be sold “via agents” and that the membership “consists of Welcome kit containing: Satchel, Magazine, Video, CD, Membership Certificate, Member Pin, Australian Souvenir”. The status was recorded as “commitments from China; agents ready to be appointed; costing for kit components being finalised”. Dealing with membership fees the document recorded that after door to door direct sales revenue and revenue from corporate purchases “the only other acquisition channel included in the budget is 3,300 international sales with a net contribution of $265 per member, accounting for $875,000 profit sales commencing in October 1999.” The minutes recorded that McLatchey inquired as to how the membership acquisition actual numbers compare with budget, and whether the forecast revenue was on budget. The minutes also recorded that in respect of “International Olympic Club Membership (travel and accommodation packages for non-Australian residents)” TOC had discussed the matter with AOC, McLatchley, who was to write to the relevant NOCs. It was recorded that “no international activity is to be undertaken unless approved by SOCOG, AOC, NOC and IOC.” The minutes recorded that Noble had held “full, in depth discussion” with McLatchley and that local agents would sell the International Olympic Club. It was noted that it was a “potentially very good revenue generating mechanism.” 
      
       
     59 On 27 April 1999 one of the plaintiff’s sub-agents, Zhang, arrived at Sydney International Airport from Hong Kong and was selected by Australian Customs Officers for a baggage examination. Documents found in his possession included documents “authorising him to enrol international memberships” of the Club. Zhang advised the Customs Officers he was a sub-contractor to the plaintiff who was an agent of TOC to sell international memberships in China. The documents included a copy of a letter from the Consulate General and the March letter from Wyness to the plaintiff appointing the plaintiff as exclusive agent in China for the period 1 April to 30 June 1999. The Australian Customs Service advised the Olympic Intelligence Centre (OI Centre) of the search and the documents found and a translation of the Consul General’s letter. The OI Centre provided details of the documents to TOC and SOCOG. The OI Centre spoke to Noble and was told by him that the plaintiff “does indeed have an authority to sell Olympic Club memberships in China and authority to appoint other agents who may obtain Olympic Club memberships from Chinese residents” on the plaintiff’s behalf. Noble was told that the Consulate General’s letter contained a claim by the plaintiff that “once Chinese residents obtain the Olympic Club membership, they will then be provided with a visa from the Department of Immigration”. Noble advised the OI Centre that he had informed the plaintiff that TOC could not guarantee visas for club members but that TOC would “assist if required”. 
      
       
     60 In May 1999 the plaintiff was in Sydney and attended a meeting with Noble in the presence of Go. The plaintiff reported on what he had done so far in meeting with Chinese Government officials both in China and in the Consulate in Sydney for the purpose of getting the necessary government approval for establishing the business in China. It was important that correct channels be followed and the right government approvals obtained. It was even more important to ensure that everything was seen to be proper, correct and legal. The plaintiff told Noble of his meeting with travel authorities and the concern expressed in relation to the obtaining of visas. He asked Noble whether SOCOG could give assistance in obtaining visas. Noble said that the SOCOG people “tell us” anybody that does not have a criminal history and therefore would be classed as an undesirable person should be able to get a visa provided they can prove they have tickets and some sort of accommodation/travel package to come to Sydney for the Games. “Obviously we can’t guarantee anything, but we will do whatever we can to get SOCOG to assist you with these people getting visas.”  
      
       
     61 The plaintiff said that he was having “a bit of a problem in selling 2,000 memberships before 30 June” that is to say the 2000 International Memberships to be sold in Mainland China. He explained the problems and said that he did not think he would be able to sell all 2,000 memberships by 30 June. He wanted to know whether he could get the condition to sell 2,000 memberships before 30 June waived. Noble thought this was reasonable but said that he would have to discuss the issue with the board and if agreed the Club would require payment of some additional money in return for waiving that condition. Asked how much, Noble said it would need to be a reasonably substantial sum on top of the $30,000 already paid “probably at least another $150,000”. He would get back to him. 
      
       
     62 On 18 May 1999 Noble wrote to the plaintiff as Chairman of ACSC confirming that it was the responsibility of the individual travelling to Australia to obtain visas to Australia but saying  
      
       
        
         
         “we are happy to assist to ensure that the individuals that purchase International Olympic Club memberships are made fully aware of the Australian Government immigration requirements and guarantee that members will be provided with a full refund for any membership fees if they are unsuccessful in obtaining a Visa subject to the return in original condition of any Olympic Club merchandise such as the Welcome kit.” 
         
        
       
     63 About two days later the plaintiff telephoned Wyness and asked about his request for an extension of the contract. Wyness said he had not made up his mind yet but he thought it was a reasonable request. Some days later during a conversation between the plaintiff and Noble on the telephone, Noble said: 
      
       
        
         
         “..we’ve agreed that we will give you an extension and waive the requirement that you sell 2,000 by 30 June, but in return you’ll have to pay us at least $200,000 by 30 June. If you can pay $200,000 to the Club by 30 June, we will give you exclusive rights up to the end of December 2000 and waive any conditions for minimum sales of membership.” 
         
        
       
     64 Told that the $200,000 would be credited towards the cost of future memberships the plaintiff said he could arrange to have $200,000 paid by 30 June. An extension was agreed. In addition to the Agency Fee of $30,000 paid on 8 March 1999, Zhu paid the Club a total of $230,006. 
      
       
     65 On 19 May 1999 Zhang attended the Club’s offices at Chatswood with the plaintiff and met Noble. Noble told them that the International Members from China must have tickets to the Games, return tickets and hotel accommodation before they would be able to obtain a visa. He also advised that the Club was making contact with the relevant government bodies.  
      
       
     66 On 24 May 1999 the Director of the Criminal Intelligence Unit of the OI Centre, Neil Fergus (Fergus) wrote to Reading at SOCOG with a copy of an intelligence report about “persons of interest involved in the sale of Olympic Club International memberships as part of a travel and accommodation package to Chinese residents travelling to Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.” The intelligence summary referred to the translation of documents in Zhang’s possession which indicated that as part of the contractual arrangements between the plaintiff and TOC, the latter had agreed to “guarantee to help members to obtain visas” to Australia. The summary recorded that although the plaintiff was not “currently involved in either activity” he “had appeared on a range of Australian criminal indices in relation to unlawful immigration activity and false documentation violations”. It also stated that he had been “recorded as being associated with persons who are currently the subject of investigations involving Asian organised crime”. The summary recommended that the Club consider revoking the plaintiff’s contract and passing the information on to the Olympic Investigation Strike Force. Fergus advised Reading that there were a number of “vulnerabilities” that had been identified in the Olympic commercial framework which could be exploited by criminal enterprise” and that “the investigations into the persons of interest will continue with” the Strike Force. 
      
       
     67 On 31 May and 1 June 1999 the plaintiff paid a total of $230,006 required pursuant to his discussions with Noble and Wyness and on 4 June 1999 was issued with a letter signed by Wyness in identical terms to that issued in March save that the period 1 April 1999 to 30 June 1999 was replaced by the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 2000.  
      
       
     68 In late May or early June 1999 the plaintiff told a friend of his, Frank Yang Hu (Hu), that he needed assistance to meet with some people in China to help him perform his obligations under the Agency Agreement. Hu was a personal friend of the Minister and Vice Minister of Sport in the Government, Yuan Wei Min (Yuan) and Yu Zai Qing (Yu). On 5 July 1999 the plaintiff and Hu met with Yu and a representative of Yuan’s office at the Government Offices in Beijing. He told them of his appointment as the exclusive agent by the Olympic Club in Sydney to sell International Memberships in China and that he would be selling those memberships as part of a tour package for Chinese citizens to travel to Sydney to support the Chinese athletes at the Sydney Games. He asked what the Government requirements were for him to carry out his tasks in China. 
      
       
     69 Yu told him the project was a good one both for China and the Chinese people giving them the opportunity to attend the Games and to share the experience and support their athletes. “We will, therefore, give you whatever support you need. How can we assist you?” Yu told him he did not need any Government approval and was free to do what he liked. It would be difficult to give him an official letter. It would even be a problem for him as the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee to say that he supported the proposal in that capacity. After the meeting the plaintiff, Hu, Yu and others dined together. 
      
       
     70 In early June 1999 the plaintiff and Zhang again met with Noble at the Club’s Chatswood premises. Zhang told Noble that he and the plaintiff would need to translate the Club’s Information Sheets and other documents into Chinese with some information about International Memberships. He told Noble that they would need to distribute those in China as part of the marketing program. Zhang raised the problem of the Olympic Club website being printed in English and suggested that the website should have a Chinese translation. Noble said that if the plaintiff and Zhang wanted a Chinese language website they would have to do it themselves. Zhang said that he would arrange to get that done and Noble said it was a good idea and they could go ahead with the plan. Zhang had the website set up under the domain name “TOCMS” which was registered with the Department of Fair Trading on 20 July 1999 under the name of his company Haggerso Holdings Pty Ltd. On 22 July 1999 he changed the proprietor of the business name from that company into his own name. 
      
       
     71 Zhang and the plaintiff travelled back and forth from China making an assessment of what had to be done to market the International Memberships and the package. Zhang subsequently became a director of ACSC and a 40 percent shareholder. Between March and June 1999 the plaintiff and Zhang appointed another ten sub-agents. 
      
       
     72 A board meeting of TOC on 7 June 1999 revealed concern about the “financial position, cash, creditors, budget and payments” of TOC. On 9 June 1999 Sherbon wrote to Reading asking that SOCOG “breathe deeply for a bit until cash becomes available to get back on line with payment.” Reference was made to moneys from International Memberships. On 11 June 1999 Reading asked Wyness to arrange for payment of $65,126 to SOCOG and noted that a further $153,166 would be due at the end of June. On 2 July 1999 at the Club Committee meeting McLatchey asked for an external and independent review of the financial position of the Club and on 5 July Wyness wrote to Ernst & Young advising that SOCOG had requested the review. Later that day Ernst & Young met with the Club Committee and the directors of TOC and on 8 July provided its report recommending that the Club Committee “consider whether the Club is a going concern and whether it will be able to meet its debts as and when they fall due.” Thereafter several proposals were put forward.  
      
       
     73 On 10 June 1999 a meeting was held between representatives of the Australian Customs Services (ACS), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the OI Centre “regarding the matter of” the plaintiff. Discussed was the accreditation given by the Olympic Club to the plaintiff and his company to sell Club Memberships in China. Various concerns were expressed. The AFP and ACS stated the view that there were not enough grounds to launch an investigation and they were not willing to progress the matter further. The meeting agreed that the accreditation/contract signed between the Club and the plaintiff should be reconsidered. It was noted that Fergus had indicated that the plaintiff’s contract would be revoked or not renewed after 30 June 1999.  
      
       
     74 On 16 June 1999 Moore of SOCOG wrote to Wyness advising that he was “disturbed” to hear that the Club may have appointed a company AIT International to “sell TOC in Singapore”. By this time TOC had appointed Michael Liew as its agent in Singapore. Moore’s letter told Wyness that the Club had “no rights offshore unless they have been signed off by the IOC, SOCOG, and the National Olympic Committee of the relevant country” and that to Moore’s knowledge there had been no request to SOCOG “nor have we given you the right to sell TOC in Singapore or other offshore territories”. 
      
       
     75 On 17 June 1999 Wyness gave the plaintiff at his request a letter in relation to visas and sub-agents in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “1.  
         Visa for Chinese International Members 
         
        
        
         
          The Olympic Club has been in touch and will be in regular contact with the Australian Immigration Department on this matter. The goal of the Visa program is to screen visitors for any criminal or undesirable element. Provided the Member does not fall into these categories then the Olympic Club will do its upmost to assist you in getting Visas for the Chinese Members 
         
        
        
         
         2.  
         Appointment of Sub agents 
         
        
        
         
          We will be happy to allow you to appoint sub agents provided they are referred to us first for investigation and for our approval. Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.” 
         
        
       
     76 On 25 June 1999 McLatchey wrote to Moore and asked whether Moore had received any response from Wyness to his letter of 16 June 1999. There is nothing to suggest that Wyness replied to that letter. However at the Club Committee meeting held on 2 July 1999 at which McLatchey and Wyness were present, the International Memberships were discussed. There was no protest made about these memberships at the meeting and the minutes recorded that Wyness was to “clarify the information” McLatchey “is to include in a letter to” the National Olympic Committees with “regard to the International Olympic Club”. 
      
       
     77 At the meeting of the Club Committee on 2 July 1999 Wyness had been asked about letterhead being provided to the plaintiff or his company. Wyness gave evidence that Reading had said there had been some “dodgy Chinese letters floating around”. The minutes of that meeting record that Wyness “assured the meeting that TOC had not provided letterhead to the Chinese company purporting to represent the Club, and suggested it may have been computer generated.” 
      
       
     78 On 6 July 1999 Noble met with Fergus and two other officers of the OI Centre, Lesley Honeyman and John Valastro. A record of the outcomes indicated that preliminary discussions with Noble determined that it was not necessary at that stage to contemplate the cancellation of any contract between the plaintiff and the Australian Olympic Club. Various strategies were discussed effectively to manage the risk associated with the arrival of Chinese residents to Australia. 
      
       
     79 Zhang claimed he met with Wyness in July 1999 at the Club’s premises and that Vera Lau who worked at the TOC office at Chatswood during 1999 was also present, as Manager of the International Department of the Club. Part of Lau’s role was to translate English/Chinese conversations, both on the telephone and in person. Zhang claimed to have told Wyness that he had set up the Chinese language version of the Club’s website and requested Wyness to open an account which could be used on the website so that overseas members could pay their money into the account. Zhang suggested that Wyness could then take out the membership fees and pay the rest of the money to Zhang. 
      
       
     80 Zhang claimed that Wyness said that he did not want to do that. He told Zhang that he was the official agent of the Club so that he could open the account himself and pay “us” the membership fees as they are due. Zhang opened an account at the Chatswood Westside Branch of the Westpac Bank in the name of “TOCMS”.  
      
       
     81 On 21 July 1999 there was a meeting at the offices of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). Present were Noble and DIMA officers. Noble had been referred to DIMA by the OI Centre to discuss in particular “the entry of Club members from PRC, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Indonesia”. By this time TOC had appointed a number of other agents in these areas, including Go as the agent for the territory of Indonesia. Noble told the meeting that TOC saw a market for itself and “agents and sub-agents who sub-contract the rights to sell packages” in those territories. DIMA suggested to TOC that a disclaimer be included in the membership application form that personal details might be passed on to DIMA and that membership of the Club did not entitle the holder to a visa for Australia. 
      
       
     82 On 22 July 1999 Sherbon advised the President of SOCOG and Minister for the Olympics (Michael Knight), the President of the AOC (John Coates), the Chief Executive Officer of SOCG (Sandy Hollway), and the Club committee that the Trustee had been advised by the designated administrator that it must put the Trustee Company into administration. Sherbon stressed his grave concerns that such “regrettable action” would create public controversy and have a significant and negative impact on the Club members. He suggested it would further seriously erode “the general public’s perception of SOCOG and the Olympic Movement” and that it would “reflect poorly on the Government”. He requested an urgent meeting to resolve the issue. 
      
       
     83 On 30 July 1999 a mediation took place. At the conclusion a document was signed by McLatchey for AOC, Reading for SOCOG, Wyness for TOC and the representative of Synthesis which noted that the parties had agreed to work together to terminate the current arrangements and that TOCMS, Synthesis and the AOC agreed that ownership of the Club concept and all know-how in relation to the operation of the Club would be transferred to or shared with SOCOG. SOCOG would be responsible for the payment of all operating costs of the Club incurred after 30 July 1999. “In any announcement of public statement concerning the Club the position of all parties is that SOCOG can better run the Club in house to deliver benefits and reduce costs.” The agreement was intended to create legal relations upon execution and the parties agreed to execute such further documents as were necessary to give effect to the agreement. 
      
       
     84 On 3 August 1999 a news release was issued with the headline “SOCOG to Assume Ownership of the Olympic Club: Members Entitlements Remain Unchanged” which reported that SOCOG was to “assume sole control of the Olympic Club” and that all parties recognised the “synergistic benefits of bringing the Club directly into SOCOG.” 
      
       
     85 On 5 August 1999 the PRC Cultural Consul from the Consulate General’s staff in Sydney, Wang Zhiang, attended the Club’s offices at Chatswood with the plaintiff, Zhang, a sub-Agent Mr Lin and Hu and met with Wyness. Consul Wang asked Wyness whether the Club was genuine and an official SOCOG organisation. He also asked whether it was “genuine” that the plaintiff had an agency to sell memberships in China. Wyness said “Yes it is, I can show you some documents which will prove the Olympic Club is a genuine SOCOG body and yes, Zhu is our Olympic Club agent for China.” 
      
       
     86 He showed some documents to Consul Wang and was asked questions about visas for people travelling from China to Australia to attend the Games. Wyness said “We, in conjunction with SOCOG, are in a position to assist people get Visas who wish to travel to the Games. The Australian Government will be making sure genuine Games attendees can get Visas.” Consul Wang asked about accommodation and tickets and was told accommodation would be no problem and SOCOG had a scheme to ensure there would be plenty of accommodation. So far as tickets went the membership packages for China included one ticket to the opening ceremony dress rehearsal. In relation to other events “we cannot guarantee any tickets, but we can help with dealings with SOCOG to get tickets.” 
      
       
     87 During August 1999 information and documentation held by the Club was transferred to SOCOG, in particular to Reading. Michael Brann (Brann), a lawyer with SOCOG was contacted by another SOCOG employee, Elizabeth Langdon, on 18 August 1999 advising that she had been contacted by Consul Wang who requested a meeting to discuss the Club and an offer to 10,000 Chinese tourists to visit Australia and to introduce a new cultural attaché to SOCOG. 
      
       
     88 On 24 August 1999 Reading had a conversation with Wyness in which Reading said to Wyness “Who is Peter Zhu – I have seen some documents in which you refer to him as being an agent of the Olympic Club?” Wyness said words to the effect “Some sort of arrangement has been reached with Peter Zhu regarding the Olympic Club in China.” The documents to which Reading referred were the letter of authorisation for the plaintiff for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 2000 and the letter of 8 March 1999 signed by Wyness. 
      
       
     89 Towards the end of this conversation Reading said to Wyness: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well it’s a bit of a worry, I don’t want loose canons [sic] running around – I know we want to try to make this thing work but you know the position regarding getting approvals – the Police are looking at this fellow – my advice to you is that you protect yourself by reining him in – if you had plans for China I suggest that you better do what you can to stop them.” 
         
        
        
       Reading informed Wyness that he did not want TOC or SOCOG to be exposed. 
        
       
     90 On 25 August 1999, in the absence of the plaintiff, Consul Wang met with officers of SOCOG at SOCOG’s premises. He met with John Bowen (Bowen), the Manager of International Relations with SOCOG, and Margaret McLennan (McLennan), the Program Manager IOC International Relations and Protocol. The Consul informed the SOCOG officers that he was concerned to ensure that the Club was genuine and capable of performing its obligations to the Chinese members. The Consul was informed that the Club was “real” and that it was “genuine”. The officers told Consul Wang that they were not directly concerned with the Club. However they believed that the Club had been taken over by SOCOG and that SOCOG would be running it from now on. They advised Consul Wang they did not have direct information about the Club but would be happy to arrange for someone to meet with the Consul and answer any questions so that he could be satisfied that “it is genuine”. 
      
       
     91 Bowen reported to Reading: 
      
       
        
         
         “He said he looked forward to making contact with you. What he wished to explore were reports he was getting that people in the Chinese community, through the Olympic Club, had access to 10,000 tickets and were proposing to bring that many tourists from China to the Games on arrangements which included travel, accommodation and visas. The deal included access to the Rehearsal for the Opening Ceremony. He wondered whether it was possible that such large numbers of people from China could be looked after on such an arrangement. 
         
        
        
         
         We said that we could not comment but that you would be happy to discuss it with him in a few days. 
         
        
        
         
         It actually sounds quite fishy and we think Wang thinks so too. It would be worth talking to him as soon as we conveniently can. I will leave his contact details with Lyn.” 
         
        
        
       On this message Reading wrote “please tell Wang that no deal is in place.” That message was not communicated to Consul Wang. 
        
       
     92 On 30 August 1999 Zhang wrote to Wyness enclosing “printed material” for the International Members of the Olympic Club in China. These materials included the Olympic Club folder, an application form for International Membership, a document relating to Membership Privileges and Benefits, a Membership Card and a Fact Sheet in Chinese. The letter concluded “we are looking forward to having the approval of the Club and SOCOG.” 
      
       
     93 Wyness said in evidence that he had received a package of documents in Chinese which included the TOC logo. He understood them to have been printed for or on behalf of the plaintiff who sought the approval of the Olympic Club and SOCOG to print multiple copies of the documents. The request caused him concern because the plaintiff appeared to be in breach of provisions in the Agency Agreement which prohibited him from utilising the Sydney 2000 Olympic Club logo. Further, the documents appeared to disclose a breach of the Deed Poll. 
      
       
     94 In evidence he said he received the letter, placed it on his desk and there it remained for several months. Initially he looked at the documents and he recalled glancing at the letter. He said that events overtook the letter as Reading asked him to terminate the relationship “with the group”. He said that he asked for a translation of the document from a Chinese friend. “She was a person I visited for therapeutic massage on different occasions. Perhaps a friend is the wrong term, but she was the only Chinese person I knew well enough to ask to assist me on that occasion. I don’t remember her name.” 
      
       
        
       Termination of Olympic Club Trust 
        
       
     95 On 13 September 1999 TOC as Trustee, SOCOG, AOC, Synthesis and TOC in its personal capacity (TOCMS) executed a Deed of Release and Termination. The Deed recited that TOC had entered into contracts with members of the Olympic Club and that SOCOG had agreed to assume and perform the obligations of TOC pursuant to the member contract. In consideration of covenants contained in the Deed the parties had agreed to terminate the Olympic Club Trust, the Establishment Agreement and other agreements relating to the Olympic Club. 
      
       
     96 SOCOG agreed that from 30 July 1999 it would provide the Member Benefits in accordance with the Member Contracts and otherwise assume all the obligations of TOC as Trustee to the members. From 20 September 1999 the Member Contracts were assigned to SOCOG. During the period from 31 July 1999 until the winding up of the Trust, TOC as trustee agreed to provide all reasonable assistance to SOCOG to enable it to assume responsibility for provision of the Member Benefits. The Trust was terminated effective from 20 September 1999. By cl11.1 of the Deed the parties agreed that in any announcement or public statement concerning the Club, the sole position of all parties in respect of the transfer of control of the Club to SOCOG was that SOCOG could better run the Club in house to deliver benefits to Members and reduce costs. The parties agreed not to make any announcement or statement which was inconsistent with that position. 
      
       
     97 After June 1999 the plaintiff and Zhang had appointed more sub-agents. As from 30 August 1999 SOCOG employed Moiya Roberta Ford (Ford) as the Program Manager of the Club. At her initial briefings, Ford was not told of the existence of the Agency Agreement with the plaintiff or the appointment of the plaintiff as the exclusive agent in China to 31 December 2000. She claimed to be totally ignorant of any concept of International Memberships of the Club until it was raised some weeks later. Until 31 October 1999 Wyness continued in employment working out “his notice”. In mid-September 1999, probably about 10 September 1999, Reading telephoned Wyness and asked him to “terminate the relationship with the group”.  
      
       
     98 In early October 1999 an officer from DIMA contacted Ford about enquiries being made in China in relation to visas. An officer of the OI Centre told Ford that there had been several meetings between the OI Centre and Noble in relation to the plaintiff and that Noble had been informed that the plaintiff had not been charged with any offences “nor were any of his sellers”. Ford was also told that this information was provided to Reading just before the contract was “taken over by SOCOG”. Ford said she was unable to contact the plaintiff.  
      
       
     99 On 14 October 1999 the ownership of the business name “the Olympic Club” was transferred from TOC to SOCOG. 
      
       
     100 On 21 October 1999 the plaintiff returned from China and went to the Club’s premises and met with Wyness. The plaintiff told Wyness that he was just back from China and that things were going very well. There was a lot of interest in the program. Wyness told him that the Olympic Club had been taken over by SOCOG “as you know” and that SOCOG had said they did not want the International Members to continue. The plaintiff said they could not do that. “I have a contract. I paid all this money and I have put all this work and effort in. How can SOCOG just break my contract, I won’t let them.” Wyness said that he was trying to do what he could to help the plaintiff and to make sure that the agreements kept going. Wyness said: “As you say things are going so well with your planning in China, I’ll tell SOCOG that and I’ll see what we can do about letting the contract continue.” The plaintiff thanked him. He said that he could not have the contract terminated. He had put too much time and money and effort into it. “My face will be ruined in China if this contract is terminated. I have dealt with so many big officials and told publicly everyone what we are doing and how good it is. It will ruin my face in China if you do not stop SOCOG from doing this, please help me.” 
      
       
        
       Termination of Agency Agreement 
        
       
     101 On 26 October 1999 the plaintiff wrote to Wyness confirming an understanding that the Club “may have new policies and arrangements”. He asked for an “official document affirming the relationship between SOCOG, the Olympic Club and the International Members’ Department”. He asked other questions about who was responsible for the Chinese International membership and when the Welcome kits would be delivered. (“…we are looking forward to receiving 742 welcome kits for our payment of about $260,000.”) On 29 October 1999 Wyness replied stating amongst other things that instructions from SOCOG were clear that the agreement should be terminated. He went on to deal with other matters raised reiterating that he was happy to help the plaintiff in any way he could. 
      
       
     102 On the same day Wyness wrote to Ford telling her that the plaintiff had purchased up to $260,000 of International Memberships and had now asked for information about when he could start to receive them. A copy of his letter went to Brann and Reading. 
      
       
     103 At a meeting on 2 November 1999 Ford expressed concerns to officers of OI Centre in relation to the Club and the possible continual involvement of Wyness in the development and marketing of the Club and its activities. She probably also expressed concern about Chinese documentation and copies of invoices and cheques totalling $230,006. Despite these discussions on 3 November 1999 Ford wrote to Wyness saying that the “Peter Zhu issue is new to me, I wasn’t aware that we had any International Memberships.” She asked for a copy of the agreement together with details of what it was TOCMS agreed to provide.  
      
       
     104 On 5 November 1999 Wyness wrote to the plaintiff in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Re Agency Appointment 
         
        
        
         
         We refer to the agency agreement executed in March 1999, for the Territory of the Peoples’ Republic of China (the agreement). 
         
        
        
         
         We further refer to our meeting of Tuesday October 19 1999 at which time we notified you that your appointment as an agent of the Olympic Club had terminated on the following grounds: 
         
        
        
         
         1. The term of appointment was stated in the agreement to terminate on 30 June 1999 subject to you exercising your option to extend that term, and you failed to exercise your option. 
         
        
        
         
         2. In any event, you failed to perform the preconditions to exercising your option which are set out in clause 5 of the agreement, in that you 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) only sold 743 memberships as at October 19 1999 in breach of our agreement to sell 2000 memberships. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) you failed to pay AUD$700,000 by 30 June 1999 or at all. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         At our meeting you agreed your appointment had been terminated. 
         
        
        
         
         The Olympic Club will of course fulfil its contractual obligations with respect to the memberships sold by you and we await notification from you as to when you require delivery of the membership kits. 
         
        
        
         
         We otherwise call upon you to return all property which belongs to or was supplied to you by the Olympic Club and you should cease to associate yourself with or represent yourself as having any form of association with the Olympic Club. 
         
        
        
         
         We thank you for your assistance and cooperation.” 
         
        
       
     105 In terms this letter assumed that the Agency Agreement was a legitimate grant of authority to the plaintiff to sell in Mainland China membership of the Club as a component of a travel and accommodation package; see the letter dated 8 March 1999 handed over in accordance with cl 7.1(b) of the Agency Agreement. Moreover it was written at a time when according to the news release SOCOG had assumed sole control of the Club. The Club, controlled by SOCOG, proposed to fulfil its obligations under the contracts to the members of the Club.  
      
       
     106 On the same day Wyness forwarded a copy of the letter to Ford. He suggested that the options were to return the $260,000 or to supply the 743 membership kits which the plaintiff had paid for. SOCOG was aware of the terms of the letter. The letter contained no suggestion that the plaintiff had wrongfully exploited the Olympic Movement’s intellectual property. 
      
       
     107 On 15 November 1999 Fergus wrote to Ford referring to recent dealings with her and her concerns about possible breaches of law relating to the Club’s contract. Fergus recommended that a full audit of the financial transactions of the Club be undertaken “to ascertain if any criminal acts might have occurred”. He also recommended that a professional legal opinion be sought. A contemporary draft letter revealed “no prima facie evidence to suggest any criminal acts have occurred”. 
      
       
     108 On 18 November 1999 the plaintiff replied to Wyness’ letter of 5 November denying that any meeting took place on 19 October 1999. He did not agree with Wyness’ claim that he had admitted that the Agreement was terminated. He denied ever having made such a statement. He further stated that the purported termination was invalid because the conditions referred to had been satisfied “and waived by the Club.” 
      
       
     109 On 29 November 1999 Wyness faxed Ford as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Following our conversation this morning I wanted to give you my reading of the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         In early 1999 we were approached by Tim Goh (sic) who was working with Salesforce regarding a possible corporate purchase. The concept we were offered was that of an Olympic Club merchandise package being made available to international visitors who were to be visiting during the Olympics. The purchase of these memberships was to be made by an Australian based company and delivered to the visitors when they arrived in Australia. There was to be no entry into the ticket ballot and we were advised that our merchandise package would have a high perceived value for these visitors. 
         
        
        
         
         An Agency Agreement would be formed for each country who would be sending visitors. Initially I had been asked by John Moore to contact overseas travel agents who were sending official groups to see if they would buy into the concept and John provided me details of certain companies such as Sportsworld and Jetset etc. 
         
        
        
         
         I asked Gus Noble to meet with Olympic Intelligence and Immigration and he was advised that there was no strong objection to us working with Peter Zhu (note attached). They paid approx. $260,000 in advance memberships but did not fulfil the full conditions to maintain their status with the Club as an agent. On further advice from Paul Reading in approximately September I was asked to wind down the relationship. I met with Mr Zhu at the first opportunity after his return from China and informed him that we were terminating his agreement due to unfulfilled clauses in the agreement. All payments from Mr Zhu and his company were processed through the normal bank accounts and are available to be audited by any outside party with our prior agreement. Gus Noble was in charge of this International program on behalf of the club and would be the person who would advise on any of the finer details that may be required.” 
         
        
       
     110 From 22 November 1999 Go attempted to make contact with Ford. After “fobbing him off” she advised Reading that she intended to explain to Go that the Club was seeking legal advice on the “whole issue” and that the plaintiff had paid $260,000 approximately for around 730 memberships. She intended to advise Go that the “Zhu Contract was terminated by TOCMS in September and that SOCOG had no arrangement with Mr Zhu and would not be entering into any in the future”. She also intended to tell Go that SOCOG would not be offering “any International Memberships or engaging any other agents in the future” and that SOCOG was currently exploring whether to refund the plaintiff money or fulfil obligations to provide the kits. 
      
       
     111 Ford advised Williams and Reading that it would be “far cheaper to put together some kits than to refund the money” and that if they decided to provide the kits “it may close the matter once and for all which would be a really good thing”. This indifference to the position of those who bona fide had paid their money for the benefit of the Olympic Movement is breathtaking. 
      
       
        
       Arrests 
        
       
     112 By May 1999 Ya Fa Wang (YF Wang), a man with business interests in several companies in Australia and China had learnt of the existence of the Club. He had been asked by a group of companies in China (the Group) to look at opportunities for sending some of their employees to the Games. On 28 August 1999 YF Wang returned to Sydney and on or about 16 September, with his wife, met with a sub-agent Shao Qiang Liao (Liao) and his wife at a Parramatta restaurant. They discussed the Club. Two or three days later Liao took YF Wang to meet Zhang who gave him Wyness’ letter of 17 June in relation to visas and sub-agents, a copy of a Facts Sheet in both Chinese and English and a sample of a Membership Certificate. 
      
       
     113 YF Wang prepared a contract between the Group and the “International Division of the Olympic Club” in which the Group agreed to pay $8,700 per package and after signing the agreement to provide a list of 25 members to attend the Games. It was agreed that after paying what was described as the initial payment the Group would be provided with Membership Certificates and that Olympic Club officers would attend Shanghai where Olympic Club Membership Cards would be issued to the 25 members at a press conference which the Group would organise and pay for apart from the airfares of the Club’s representatives to Shanghai. One hundred and twenty five tickets to such events as table tennis, badminton, volleyball and “female soccer” were agreed to be provided to the Group. 
      
       
     114 The initial payment was $72,500, one-third of the total purchase price for the 25 packages. YF Wang met with Zhang and Liao on 22 September 1999 and paid that amount by way of cheque. He was provided with a receipt on the Olympic Club with compliments slip with the details of the bank, branch, BSB, account number and name “TOCMS” and address of the bank. On 23 September 1999 Zhang and Liao provided an executed copy of the contract YF Wang had drafted. The next day YF Wang returned to China. 
      
       
     115 On 12 October 1999 Liao faxed YF Wang in China requesting the list of the 25 people so that Membership Certificates could be provided. On 15 October 1999 YF Wang sent to Zhang and Liao the list that had been requested. Further information was sought as to the date of birth, occupation and address of the 25 people so that details could be entered into the computer when their applications could be examined and approved. Liao informed YF Wang that after the certificates were faxed and confirmed, the balance of the amount for the packages would have to be paid. The details were forwarded and Liao advised that he expected to be able to fax the certificates by 20 October 1999. 
      
       
     116 On 26 October 1999 YF Wang returned to Australia and on 4 November met with Zhang who handed him the Membership Certificates with the names of the 25 persons thereon and a number. YF Wang also met with Zhang about three or four days before Zhang left to go to China. At this meeting Zhang informed YF Wang that he was returning to China to attend the press conference for the presentation to the 25 members and informed him that he also had 25 club packs to be given to them at the presentation. Zhang asked YF Wang to return to China and said that he could take 15 of the packs and Zhang could take the other 10 packs. 
      
       
     117 YF Wang asked Zhang if the Certificates were genuine. Zhang assured him they were. Zhang asked YF Wang to get the 25 people to fill out the forms that he gave him which were headed “The Olympic Club International Membership Application (the China Region)”.  
      
       
     118 Sometime after 23 November 1999 Francis Lee, the Chairman of the Asia Media Council, a friend of and at the behest of YF Wang, contacted the Club and spoke with Reg Roberts (Roberts), a person under the supervision of Ford. Lee advised Roberts that YF Wang had purchased 25 packages at a total cost of $72,500. Lee advised the Olympic Club Membership Certificates were provided with membership numbers and provided a copy of a certificate. Subsequently YF Wang made contact with the Club to ascertain the genuineness of the Certificates and the authority of Liao and Zhang. As a result of that contact the Club forwarded this information, including copies of the Certificates, to the OI Centre. 
      
       
     119 The Strike Force was brought into the matter and DS Nicholls (Nicholls) interviewed YF Wang on 30 November 1999. YF Wang agreed to assist the police who were to engage in surveillance of a meeting that YF Wang set up with Liao at the airport on 1 December 1999 at which he was handing over a photocopy of a cheque for $145,000 for the balance owing for the 25 packages. Liao was arrested and charged with obtaining a benefit by deception and attempting to obtain a benefit by deception. 
      
       
     120 At a meeting on 3 December 1999 Reading asked Nicholls “what should we do” and was informed that the problem had to be “tackled as a team”. The Shanghai conference should be stopped and the OI Centre would contact Chinese law enforcement, the Australian Consulate, DFAT and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. A note made at the meeting stated that “cops also advised that the crims were establishing a website in the name of TOCM”. When Nicholls prepared his statement for the proposed prosecution he did not make mention of any meeting on 3 December with SOCOG or Ford.  
      
       
     121 The mindset of the SOCOG representatives by this stage was that the Certificates were not genuine. There was deep suspicion that the plaintiff and his sub-agents were operating without any authority and fraudulently. There were also suspicions about the bona fides of Wyness and Noble. Meanwhile Ernst & Young advised that the “International Sales” was not a secretive initiative but a strategy well known to TOC and referred to the fact that their 8 July 1999 report had made specific reference to such sales with the estimate of revenues from that program. This did not quell the rising tide of suspicion in SOCOG about the plaintiff’s conduct. 
      
       
     122 After Liao was arrested a search warrant was executed at Zhang’s business premises in Sussex Street, Sydney. On 2 December 1999 Nicholls met with Ford and Roberts. Seized items were inspected and Nicholls was provided with what he described as “certain information”. The items included stationery, application forms, booklets and an official seal. 
      
       
     123 Ford informed Nicholls that Liao had no connection with the Club and had no authority to sell Club memberships. She also informed him that the Certificates that YF Wang had been given contained numbers that were not on the Club database. She informed Nicholls that the information on the Certificates was “not genuine”.  
      
       
     124 On 4 December 1999 YF Wang telephoned Liao. Liao informed him that the Certificates were genuine and provided Zhang’s phone number in China. YF Wang telephoned Zhang that evening in China and was assured by Zhang that the Olympic was genuine and that “if it wasn’t he would return the money” to YF Wang. 
      
       
     125 When the plaintiff heard of Liao’s arrest in Sydney he cancelled the media conference planned for 6 December 1999 and immediately returned to Australia from China. On his return to Australia on 6 December he was arrested at Sydney airport. His home was subsequently searched. All documents relevant to the conduct of his agency were seized.  
      
       
     126 On 12 December 1999 SOCOG issued a news release in which it stated that the CEO of SOCOG, Hollway, had said “he wanted any allegation of fraud to be vigorously pursued” and that  
      
       
        
         
         “SOCOG has authorised no agents or sub-agents to sell Olympic Club material overseas. To the best of our knowledge, any arrangement that may have been in place prior to SOCOG assuming control of the Olympic Club in August was terminated by the previous management of the Olympic Club”. 
         
        
       
     127 On 26 April 2000 the plaintiff was charged with obtaining money by deception and attempting to obtain money by deception. Nearly seven months later on 16 October 2000 the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the plaintiff’s solicitor that the Director had decided that all charges against him, Liao and Zhang, would be withdrawn. The Director also recommended that the matter be referred to the Police Integrity Commission for possible investigation. 
      
       
        
       Pleadings 
        
       
     128 Zhu began his proceedings in the Equity Division, Commercial List. Amongst other relief, Zhu sought: 
      
       
        
         
         “4. A declaration that by its conduct on or about 5 November 1999 [TOC] wrongfully repudiated the Agency Agreement. 
         
        
        
         
         5. A declaration that the wrongful repudiation of the Agency Agreement by [TOC] on or about 5 November 1999 was procured by [SOCOG]. 
         
        
        
         
         6. Damages against [SOCOG] for intentional interference with contractual relations between the plaintiff and [TOC], including aggravated and exemplary damages.” 
         
        
       
     129 Under the heading “Nature of Dispute” Zhu claimed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. This dispute arises out of the events which occurred after [SOCOG] took over ‘The Olympic Club’, of which [TOC] was trustee in or about September 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         2. In particular, on or about 5 November 1999 [SOCOG] caused [TOC] to repudiate an Agency Agreement which had been made between the plaintiff and [TOC] on or about 11 March 1999 in respect of the sale of International Memberships of The Olympic Club in The People’s Republic of China and, on or about 6 December 1999, [SOCOG] caused the plaintiff to be arrested and suffer the humiliation of allegations that he was not an authorised agent of The Olympic Club and was carrying on his agency without lawful authority. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The indicia of authority upon which the plaintiff relies includes an instrument under the seal of [TOC], dated 4 June 1999 and signed by its Managing Director, [Wyness], which in terms states that the plaintiff is an authorised agent of The Olympic Club and is authorised on an exclusive basis in the territory of the People’s Republic of China to sell Olympic Club International memberships to Chinese residents travelling to Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games as a component of a travel and accommodation package for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 2000.” 
         
        
       
     130 Zhu claimed that by filing and service of the summons he “now” accepted the wrongful repudiation of the Agency Agreement by TOC subject to his entitlement to damages. He claimed further that in or about October 1999 SOCOG instructed TOC to terminate the Agency Agreement 
      
       
        
         
         “23. The conduct of [SOCOG] in instructing [TOC] to terminate the Agency Agreement was conduct by [SOCOG], with knowledge of the Agency Agreement, intending to interfere with the contractual relations between the plaintiff and [TOC] under the Agency Agreement. 
         
        
        
         
         24. In furtherance of its said conduct, [SOCOG] caused the plaintiff to be arrested at Sydney Airport on 6 December 1999 upon the basis that the plaintiff was alleged to be carrying on his agency without lawful authority. 
         
        
        
         
         25. By reason of the international interference by [SOCOG] in the contractual relations between the plaintiff and [TOC] the plaintiff has suffered loss and damage.” 
         
        
       
     131 SOCOG filed a further amended defence to the amended summons in which it denied that TOC wrongfully repudiated the Agency Agreement but admitted that in or about mid-September 1999 SOCOG, by its officer Reading, in a telephone conversation with Wyness requested that TOC terminate its arrangements with regard to Zhu. SOCOG further admitted that by at least about mid-September 1999 it knew that TOC had appointed Zhu as its agent to sell international memberships of the Olympic Club to residents of Mainland China. It further admitted that TOC received the sum of $230,006. SOCOG claimed that the termination of the contract between Zhu and TOC was lawful and that TOC’s conduct caused no breach of that contract because the termination was valid by reason, inter alia, of the plaintiff’s obligations under the Agency Agreement, Deed Poll and Indicia and Images Protection Act as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “10 The Plaintiff owed the following essential obligations:

     132 SOCOG claimed (para 11 of its defence) that Zhu was in breach of these obligations, inter alia,  
      
       
     · by failing to obtain or attempt to obtain the approval of the Government of the People’s Republic of China or the Chinese Olympic Committee; 
      
       
     · by purporting to exercise his right to sell International Memberships without obtaining such approvals; 
      
       
     · by causing to be created and distributed itemised documents such as fact sheets;  
      
       
     · by not confining his use of the Sydney 2000 logo or the agency generally to the sale of “International Memberships” as defined in the Agency Agreement or so confining his representations as to his connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, SOCOG and the Olympic Club and his use of various words, phrases, symbols or images; 
      
       
     · by distributing documents without obtaining the written approval of TOC to do so; 
      
       
     · by breach of a fiduciary obligation owed to TOC and other obligations in the Deed Poll; and  
      
       
     · in breach of his obligation pursuant to the Indicia and Images Protection Act, without obtaining any licence from SOCOG, promoting, marketing, and selling travel packages.  
      
       
        
       SOCOG alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations (para 12), breaches of obligations set out in para 10(c) (para 13) and breaches of obligations alleged in para 10(d) (para 14). By reason of these matters which were particularised in SOCOG’s defence in detail it was alleged that TOC was entitled to terminate its contract (para 15). 
        
       
     133 Of particular relevance to this appeal was the following paragraph of SOCOG’s defence: 
      
       
        
         
         “17 Alternatively to paragraphs 9 to 16, even if the Agency Agreement was valid and subsisting, the termination was unlawful and the conduct of [SOCOG] is held to have thereby caused a breach of that conduct [sic contract], [SOCOG’s] conduct was, in the circumstances, justified: 
         
        
        
        Particulars 
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) Pursuant to the  
           Indicia and Images Act 
            [SOCOG] enjoyed statutory rights and bore statutory responsibilities in respect of the Sydney 2000 Games indicia and images. Those obligations included the obligation to maintain a register of licensed uses [sic] of the indicia and images (s16) and the responsibility to exercise its statutory rights of standing pursuant to s43(3) to obtain injunctive relief in respect of contraventions of s12 in respect of the indicia and images. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) By reason of the Plaintiff’s breaches alleged at paragraph 14 above, [SOCOG] was entitled to obtain an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from using any of the indicia or images in respect of the promotion, marketing or sale of the travel packages which the Plaintiff was purporting to promote, market and sell in the Government of the People’s Republic of China. 
           
          
         
        
       
     (iii) By reason of: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (A) the nature of [SOCOG’s] status and function as the Organising Committee for the Sydney 2000 Games; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (B) the obligation owed by [SOCOG] with respect to The Olympic Club pursuant to the Deed of Termination and Release; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (C) the principle embodied in clause 5(g) of the Establishment Agreement; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             [SOCOG] had a responsibility to protect the reputation and goodwill of the Olympic Movement, The Olympic Club and the Sydney 2000 Games. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iv) [SOCOG] repeats the Plaintiff’s breaches alleged in paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 14 above.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     134 Zhu filed a reply dealing with the various breaches relied upon of the Agency Agreement, the Deed Poll and the Act. Paragraph 18 of the reply was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         No Justification for the conduct of the First Defendant 
         
        
        
         
         18 Further and in the alternative: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           a. The plaintiff denies paragraph 17 of the Further Amended Defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           b. Further and in the alternative, to the extent that the conduct of [SOCOG] included direct interference with the contractual rights of the plaintiff, when [SOCOG] caused the plaintiff to be arrested on 6 December 1999, that conduct is, as a matter of law, incapable of being justified. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           c. Further and in the alternative, to any extent that [SOCOG] had available to it a right to move for an injunction to restrain any breach of the Act, breach of covenant under the Deed Poll or other conduct on the part of the plaintiff upon which [SOCOG] now claims to be entitled to rely to justify its conduct, [SOCOG] elected not to exercise that right and chose instead to directly or indirectly interfere with the plaintiff’s contractual relations.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     135 In the alternative, Zhu pleaded that, if TOC was entitled to terminate the Agency Agreement, Zhu was entitled to recover a loss which was referable to 743 International Memberships from SOCOG. Finally, Zhu relied upon a claim of unjust enrichment. 
      
       
        
       Hearing before Bergin J 
        
       
     136 Bergin J heard these proceedings over 20 hearing days between 30 July and 11 September 2001. As already explained neither TOC not Wyness took any part as parties to the proceedings. From her Honour’s reasons for judgment it appears clear that most attention was directed to whether or not TOC had wrongly repudiated the Agency Agreement which in turn depended upon whether or not Zhu was in breach of the terms and conditions of the Agency Agreement and Deed Poll. Bergin J held that TOC had wrongfully repudiated the Agency Agreement and that SOCOG was not justified in procuring the termination of the Agreement. The connection, in her Honour’s reasons, between these conclusions is significant. 
      
       
     137 Bergin J described SOCOG’s defences as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “170 SOCOG concedes that TOC remained legally bound to the plaintiff to perform the Agency Agreement until the purported termination on 5 November 1999. SOCOG also conceded that it instructed TOC to terminate the Agency Agreement and that the other ingredients of the tort of interference were present. It was submitted that the plaintiff may only succeed if he is able to prove that the termination of the Agency Agreement on 5 November 1999 was a wrongful repudiation by TOC. It is submitted the tort is not committed if the interference results, not in any breach of the contract, but merely in the exercise of a lawful right to terminate the contract:  
         Greig & Ors v Insole & Ors 
          [1978] 1 WLR 302 at 333. 
         
        
        
         
         171 SOCOG claims that the termination was valid by reason of circumstances that existed at the time of the termination, which  
         justified 
          (emphasis added) the termination. It claims that the plaintiff has misconducted himself personally and through his sub-agents and that such misconduct was unknown or not fully apprehended at the time the letter of 5 November 1999 was sent to the plaintiff:  
         Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd 
          (1931) 45 CLR 359;  
         Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd 
          (1995) 185 CLR 410;  
         Concut Pty Ltd v Worrell 
          (2000) 75 ALJR 312 Pars [27], [29] and [42]. 
         
        
        
         
         172 SOCOG concedes that the grounds for termination stated in the letter of 5 November 1999 were not available grounds for the termination of the Agency Agreement but that the reliance on those grounds does not matter in the circumstances of this case. It was submitted that the plaintiff’s conduct exemplified by a number and variety of serious breaches of contractual and fiduciary duty owed by him to TOC  
         justifies 
          (emphasis added) the termination. It is submitted that such conduct was inconsistent with the terms of the Agency Agreement in fundamental respects and incompatible with the trust and confidence which TOC was entitled to expect to have in its agent. 
         
        
        
         
         173 It was submitted that the agency relationship is a fiduciary relationship which gave rise to three primary equitable obligations (a) that the plaintiff was required to act strictly in accordance with the agency agreement and not to exceed the authority given to him, (b) that the plaintiff was required to obey the instructions of TOC and (c) that the plaintiff was required to act with good faith and loyalty towards TOC and not prefer his own interests to those of TOC.” 
         
        
       
     138 Bergin J was satisfied that SOCOG was aware or constructively aware of the contractual obligations TOC owed to the plaintiff and was aware that the entry into the deed of release and termination would cause TOC to breach the Agency Agreement. In her Honour’s opinion this was an inducement by SOCOG of TOC to breach its contract with the plaintiff.  
      
       
     139 Under the heading “Justification?” Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “222 As I have already said, SOCOG conceded that the elements necessary for the tort of interference with the contractual relationship between TOC and the plaintiff were present and that the grounds relied upon in the letter of 5 November 1999 from Wyness to the plaintiff purporting to terminate the Agency Agreement were not grounds available to TOC to terminate the agreement. However SOCOG submitted that the termination is valid because there were repudiatory breaches by the plaintiff, of which TOC was unaware as at 5 November 1999, of which SOCOG is now aware, entitling summary dismissal pursuant to cl 15.4 of the Agency Agreement:  
         Shepherd v Felt and Textiles 
           
         of Australia Ltd 
          (1931) 45 CLR 359. 
         
        
        
         
         223 Clause 15.4 entitled TOC to terminate the Agreement if the plaintiff was ‘guilty of conduct  
         justifying 
          (emphasis added) summary dismissal’. Such conduct would have to ‘strike at the root’ of the agreement and be ‘wholly inconsistent with the continuance of confidence between the parties’ to the agreement:  
         Shepherd v Felt and Textiles 
          (per Starke J at 372). In  
         Shepherd 
          the alternative ground for dismissing the agent was that he breached his duty of faithful and loyal discharge of duty towards his employer by positively working to impede or defeat the employer (per Dixon J at 378). An actual repugnance between the employee’s acts and his relationship must be found. Uneasiness as to the future conduct of the Agency would not be enough to warrant or  
         justify 
          (emphasis added) summary dismissal:  
         Blyth Chemicals Ltd v Bushnell 
          (1933) 49 CLR 66 per Dixon & McTiernan JJ at 82. 
         
        
        
         
         224 Mr Pembroke SC submitted that although the alleged breaches when viewed individually may not be so characterised, which was not conceded, when viewed cumulatively, they do strike at the root of the agreement and would lead to the lack of confidence such as would  
         justify 
          (emphasis added) summary dismissal. Mr Pembroke SC also submitted that it is irrelevant to the interests of SOCOG that TOC either waived, or alternatively downplayed the significance of the plaintiff’s conduct which it alleges amounted to repudiatory breaches. 
         
        
        
         
         225 Mr Pembroke used the example of a contract between two parties, A and B, through the wrongful performance of which caused damage to X. It was submitted that there may be a host of reasons why A and B may be content for the contract to remain on foot. It was submitted that it would be entirely inconsistent with the notions of  
         justification 
          (emphasis added) if the attitude of A or B could be determinative as to whether X’s interference was able to be  
         justified 
          (emphasis added). Reliance was placed on another example used in  
         Smithies v National Association of Operative Plasterers 
          [1909] 1 KB 310. Buckley LJ said at 337 ‘no doubt there are circumstances in which A is entitled to induce B to break a contract entered into by B with C. Thus, for instance, if the contract between B and C is one in which B could not make consistently with his preceding contractual obligations towards A, A may not only induce him to break it, but may invoke the assistance of a Court of Justice to make him break it’. 
         
        
        
         
         226 It was submitted that the Court must analyse the circumstances relied upon as  
         justification 
          (emphasis added) by assessing the objective facts and not from the perspective of the parties to the contract, the plaintiff and TOC. Such an approach is submitted to be consistent with the fact that the issue of repudiation turns upon objective facts and omissions and the question to be determined is what effect the plaintiff’s actions would be reasonably calculated to have upon a reasonable person:  
         Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd 
          (1989) 166 CLR 623. 
         
        
        
         
         227 It is important when considering the objective facts to review the circumstances and facts which gave rise to the objective facts the subject of the allegations of repudiatory breaches. This is particularly so where the basis for the  
         justification 
          (emphasis added) is reliant upon the principles enunciated in  
         Shepherd 
          a significant feature of which is that the alleged breaches are not known of at the time of the dismissal or termination. It seems to me that it is also relevant that SOCOG were represented on the Club Committee and took over the operations and management of the Club in August 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         228 This case is different from the examples used or relied upon by Mr Pembroke. SOCOG was not a party without control over or a say in the way in which TOC conducted its activities as Trustee. Indeed SOCOG accepted the plaintiff’s covenants in the Deed Poll signed on 11 March 1999. I intend to look at all relevant facts in assessing whether the conduct, the subject of complaint,  
         would justify 
          (emphasis added) summary termination of the Agency pursuant to clause 15.4 instead of requiring notice to the plaintiff pursuant to clause 15.2 of the Agency Agreement. 
         
        
        
         
         229 Although the plaintiff submitted that SOCOG could not rely upon the principles in  
         Shepherd 
          I intend to decide the case on the basis that it can. No judicial definition of ‘ 
         justification 
         ’ (emphasis added) has been developed. Whether conduct  
         justifies 
          (emphasis added) summary dismissal has been left to the ‘good sense’ of the Court in deciding ‘on which side of the line’ such conduct falls:  
         Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd & Anor v Federated Miscellaneous Worker’s Union of Australia & Ors  
          (1987) 54 NTR 6. In this case I have to decide whether the conduct complained of strikes at the root of the Agency Agreement or  
         justifies 
          (emphasis added) a loss of trust and confidence in the agency relationship. There are a number of repudiatory breaches alleged with which I will now deal.” 
         
        
       
     140 Bergin J reviewed the conduct of the plaintiff which SOCOG claimed warranted summary dismissal under twelve heads and in each case rejected the claim that the conduct entitled TOC to terminate the Agency Agreement. For instance, Zhu made representations to the effect that Chinese persons who became International Members of the Club would be guaranteed a visa to enter Australia. Bergin J was satisfied that this fell into the category of conduct that should have been notified to Zhu, discussed with him, suggestions for changes made and then if he or his sub-Agents did not comply action could have been taken; see cl 11 of the Agency Agreement. Her Honour’s conclusion was the same even if all or some of the alleged breaches were to be treated cumulatively. Amongst these heads was breach of the terms of the Deed Poll about which Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “352 SOCOG alleged that the plaintiff had breached the terms of the Deed Poll by the use of documents and items that included the Olympic symbol and the Club logo. It also alleged that this conduct was in breach of the  
         Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 (Cth)  
         (the Act). 
         
        
        
         
         353 The plaintiff acknowledged in the Deed Poll that he had no right to use any intellectual property belonging to any Olympic Body including but not limited to any Olympic logo, mark or design (clause 2). Clause 5 of the Deed provides that the obligations imposed by it are ‘subject to any rights granted to the Covenantor by any Olympic Body’. Olympic Bodies are defined in the Deed as ‘SOCOG, the Australian Olympic Committee Inc, the International Olympic Committee, the Olympic movement and the official sponsors, suppliers and others who are from time to time authorised to use those rights’. The rights referred to include the intellectual property and words, phrases, symbols or images which suggest a connection or association with an Olympic Body, the Games or any of the Olympic Teams. 
         
        
        
         
         354 It was submitted that TOC was a body that was from time to time authorised to use the rights of SOCOG and the AOC and was therefore an Olympic Body. It was further submitted that TOC granted the plaintiff the right to represent, hold out and promote himself as having a connection or association with an Olympic Body, namely, that he was an authorised agent of the Club for the sale of International Memberships of the Club as a component part of the package. Additionally it was submitted that TOC granted the plaintiff the right to use the intellectual property belonging to an Olympic Body when it provided the plaintiff with the authorities dated 8 March 1999 and 4 June 1999 containing the logo and when it provided the plaintiff with letterhead of the Club and approximately 100 Welcome Kits containing satchels and other merchandising material for use in the Agency. 
         
        
        
         
         355 In all the circumstances I am satisfied that the exception to covenants 1, 2 and 3 of the Deed contained in clause 5 applies and that there was no breach of the Deed Poll. There was no breach of the Act for the same reason. In any event I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that if there had been a breach of the Deed in the circumstances of this case it would have been necessary to notify the plaintiff and request return of the materials or some other action to remedy the conduct, the subject of any complaint. It could not  
         justify 
          (emphasis added) summary dismissal.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     141 After saying she was not satisfied that any breaches by Zhu of his fiduciary duty had been established, Bergin J stated the following conclusions on justification: 
      
       
        
         
         “359 In reviewing the plaintiff’s conduct in relation to the alleged breaches I should return to Mr Pembroke’s submission that conduct in isolation may not warrant summary termination but when viewed cumulatively may warrant such summary termination of the Agency Agreement. Having regard to my findings that in some instances the plaintiff’s conduct would warrant notice being given to him it is important to look at those instances to see if viewed cumulatively they would  
         justify 
          (emphasis added) summary termination. 
         
        
        
         
         360 The areas in which I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s conduct would have warranted notice for either discussion or rectification are the documents in which there appeared to be a blurring of the roles of TOC and the plaintiff. Viewing those matters cumulatively and taking SOCOG’s submissions in relation to the plaintiff’s evidence into account I am still satisfied that the conduct does not warrant summary dismissal. SOCOG’s  
         justification 
          (emphasis added) case fails.” 
         
        
       
     142 Because the plaintiff’s conduct did not, in Bergin J’s opinion, warrant summary termination of the Agency Agreement that part of SOCOG’s justification case failed. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “361 The failure of SOCOG’s case on  
         justification 
          (emphasis added) means that the Agency Agreement was not validly terminated on 5 November 1999. It is therefore necessary to consider the next claim made by the plaintiff that SOCOG interfered with his contractual relationship by causing him to be arrested on 6 November 1999. I will now consider this claim but before doing so I should return to the nature of the relationship between SOCOG and TOC.” 
         
        
       
     143 Bergin J described that relationship as in some respects antagonistic. She referred to the parlous state of TOC’s finances and the controversy surrounding SOCOG during 1999 in relation to what became known as the provision of tickets on a “rich list”. Any public revelation of TOC’s financial state was avoided by the terms of the transfer of the Club to SOCOG. Bergin J observed that it was in this setting that Reading became nervous about SOCOG’s and TOC’s “exposure” to further criticism of the presence of what he described as “loose canons” (sic) such as the plaintiff and his sub-agents. Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
           
          
         “365 Reading had received information that enabled him, when discussing the plaintiff with Wyness, to inform Wyness that the police are ‘looking at this fellow’. The fact that the police were ‘looking’ at the plaintiff and his operations was always envisaged. Noble informed the plaintiff prior to the execution of the Agency Agreement that the plaintiff would have to be ‘checked out’. The continuing process of the provision of the details in relation to the sub-agents was consistent with a further ‘checking out’ of the sub-agents. It was a process to give TOC the opportunity to require the plaintiff to refrain from using the services of any particular sub-agent.” 
         
        
       
     144 Paragraph 5 of the Establishment Agreement enabled SOCOG, through its representation on the Club Committee, to direct TOC to cease activities regarded as likely adversely to affect the goodwill or reputation of the Olympic movement. There was no evidence that the AOC or SOCOG representatives took that view of the plaintiff’s conduct at any time. Reading was not called to give evidence and McLatchey who was called did not give such evidence. This brought Bergin J to consider the cause of the plaintiff’s arrest. 
      
       
     145 The plaintiff submitted that but for the erroneous information provided to W F Wang and Nicholls by Ford and the failure of SOCOG to provide other obviously relevant information the plaintiff’s arrest would not have occurred. The plaintiff submitted the provision of the information that the certificates of membership were not genuine and the failure to inform Nicholls of the arrangement between TOC and the plaintiff and the dispute that had arisen in November 1999 was a wrongful and unlawful act resulting in the exercise of discretion by Nicholls to arrest the plaintiff.  
      
       
     146 No one had told Nicholls that the plaintiff had at least 657 memberships in the data base and had paid nearly a quarter of a million dollars to TOC. No one informed Nicholls that in June 1999 the Agency Agreement had been extended to December 2000 or that the purported termination of the Agency Agreement on 5 November 1999 was being challenged by the plaintiff. 
      
       
     147 Begin J considered that SOCOG had taken the view that not only was the plaintiff involved in a fraudulent conspiracy but Wyness and Noble were also involved in some way. Ford knew that the plaintiff had paid nearly a quarter of a million dollars to TOC and hoped that the “whole thing would go away” if the kits and paraphernalia were given to the plaintiff: 
      
       
        
         
         “372 … It is my view that her failure to inform DS Nicholls of the payment by the plaintiff and the existence of at least six hundred and fifty seven memberships in the database was a significant omission by her and thus by SOCOG. Reading’s failure to disclose that he had sighted the letter extending the plaintiff’s agency to December 2000 and that there was a dispute as to whether the Agency Agreement had been terminated on 5 November 1999 was also a serious omission.” 
         
        
       
     148 Nicholls conceded that if he had been informed by Reading that the Chinese Consul with responsibility for cultural matters and the Olympics had attended SOCOG’s office in August 1999 seeking and receiving assurances from SOCOG that the Club and the plaintiff’s agency were genuine, he would have taken those matters into account in determining what he did next. This information he was not given. He also agreed that he would have been most concerned to ascertain the correct position in relation to the plaintiff’s authority before moving to arrest him, if only to avoid the embarrassment of an inappropriate arrest. 
      
       
     149 Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “376 … After the plaintiff’s arrest DS Nicholls informed him that the Strike Force was investigating a complaint that he had been representing himself as a person who was entitled to sell memberships of the Club in China without having authority to do so. The plaintiff informed DS Nicholls that he was an authorised agent and he was the exclusive agent for the Club in China. DS Nicholls said ‘that is not what I have been told. What authority have you got?’. The plaintiff informed him that he had an Agency Agreement and an authority in writing under seal. He was asked where the authority was and, after looking through the documents he had with him, the plaintiff produced the letter of 4 June 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         377 DS Nicholls went away for a period and on his return said to the plaintiff ‘I have been told that this is a forgery. It must have been put together by photocopying other documents’. The plaintiff then informed DS Nicholls that such allegation was ‘not true’ and that he had paid the Club $260,000 and that he was an authorised agent. DS Nicholls asked who could confirm this claim and the plaintiff informed him that either Wyness or Noble could do so. DS Nicholls then said that he had been told that the agency had been terminated on 5 November 1999. The plaintiff informed him that it was not and that he had written to Wyness disputing such purported termination. 
         
        
        
         
         378 If DS Nicholls had already seen the correspondence purporting to terminate the plaintiff’s agency on 5 November 1999 and the subsequent correspondence, it seems to me that he would not have had to debate the matter with the plaintiff in the manner that he did. It seems to me from the evidence that after the plaintiff produced the 4 June letter DS Nicholls made some inquiries from some person, more probably than not within SOCOG, and was informed that the agency had been terminated on 5 November 1999. Even then it was left to the arrested plaintiff to inform DS Nicholls that there was a dispute about the purported termination.” 
         
        
       
     150 Bergin J was satisfied that had Nicholls been told about this dispute he would not have gone ahead and arrested the plaintiff on 6 December 1999 without a further investigation. Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “380 On 6 December 1999 the plaintiff was returning to Australia to investigate what had happened in relation to the arrest of his sub-agent. Charges were not brought against the plaintiff until 26 April 2000. The DPP’s withdrawal of the charges and referral of the matter to the Police Integrity Commission for possible investigation is a step from which I am able to infer that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction. If there had been a careful, open and commercially sensible assessment of the matter in December 1999 with the provision of accurate information to DS Nicholls there would have been no arrest of the plaintiff on 6 December 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         381 In October 1999 Reading told Ford that he understood that there had been some ‘negotiations’ with the plaintiff and that after he had received the briefing from OI Centre he had advised Wyness to terminate those ‘negotiations’. From the intelligence report I am satisfied that it is more probable than not that Reading informed Ford that his instructions appeared to have been ignored in relation to the termination of those ‘negotiations’. Ford saw the facsimile from Wyness of 29 October 1999 on Olympic Club letterhead and I am satisfied reported to the OI Centre that Wyness had used such letterhead and was not ‘authorised’ to do so. A further inference available from the intelligence report is that Ford expressed her concerns in relation to the ‘on-selling’ of the packages. On 5 November 1999 Ford was provided with the plaintiff’s telephone number and was informed again by Wyness that the plaintiff had paid for 743 memberships. 
         
        
        
         
         382 DS Nicholls arrested the plaintiff on the basis of the information provided by YF Wang, which was itself reliant on the information provided by Ford, and the information conveyed to him by Ford on 2 December 1999 that the twenty five membership certificates provided to YF Wang were ‘not genuine’. On the same day, 2 December 1999, the CEO of SOCOG, Hollway, advised Reading and Ford that there was to be a ‘continuation of full cooperation with police’.” 
         
        
       
     151 The plaintiff submitted that his arrest and the manner of causation of it was analogous to that in Dickenson v Waters Ltd [1931] 31 SR (NSW) 593. It was submitted that SOCOG made an allegation of dishonesty against the plaintiff when Ford told Nicholls and YF Wang that the certificates were not genuine. That allegation was said to have been made with reckless indifference to the truth bearing in mind that Ford knew of the 657 or 743 memberships which the plaintiff was entitled to allocate. It was also submitted that Reading knew the true position because he had seen copies of the correspondence between Wyness and Ford and had discussed with Ford the alternatives of repaying the plaintiff $260,006 or providing the Welcome Kits and the paraphernalia and was seeking legal advice on the matter. 
      
       
     152 Bergin J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “386 The question posed in  
         Dickenson 
          ‘do you want to proceed against these people’ was not put in express terms to SOCOG. However the consultation between SOCOG and the OI Centre and the Strike Force on 3 December 1999 was to the same effect. The information that the Certificates were not genuine provided by SOCOG was pivotal to the exercise of DS Nicholls’s discretion to arrest the plaintiff. In my view to suggest that the complaint was from a third party and not SOCOG does not accurately reflect the reality of the situation. This was a complaint that the plaintiff was acting criminally and at no stage prior to the arrest of the plaintiff did SOCOG withdraw or qualify that information in any way. It had that opportunity on 3 December 1999. It did not inform DS Nicholls that many blank certificates had been issued to the plaintiff and that these were part of a Kit of paraphernalia that the plaintiff was entitled to issue or have issued. 
         
        
        
         
         387 Far from withdrawing the allegation on that day SOCOG went further and as part of the ‘team’ consented to the stopping of the press conference in Shanghai and the notification internationally to policing agencies in respect of the plaintiff and his sub-agents. I am satisfied that but for the information provided by SOCOG that the Certificates were not genuine and the failure to provide the information in relation to the civil dispute that had arisen the plaintiff would not have been arrested on 6 December 1999. I am satisfied that SOCOG’s conduct caused the plaintiff’s arrest and the subsequent seizure of all his documents relevant to the conduct of his agency. 
         
        
        
         
         388 SOCOG’s inducement of DS Nicholls in the circumstances of the existence of the plaintiff’s Agency Agreement was therefore unlawful and an intentional infliction of harm to the plaintiff. It amounted to an indirect interference with the contractual relationship. The plaintiff’s Agency Agreement remained on foot until he accepted the wrongful repudiation of it by the commencement of these proceedings on 22 December 1999.” 
         
        
       
     153 In the course of dealing with Zhu’s claim based on unjust enrichment Bergin J referred to the $30,000 agency fee paid on 8 March 1999 and the $230,006 paid by June 1999. She said:  
      
       
        
         
         “389 …. It was not until this trial commenced before me that SOCOG made an offer to repay the plaintiff this money together with interest. That was not an unconditional offer and the letter stated that SOCOG was only willing to pay that amount together with interest if the plaintiff would agree to the proceedings being otherwise dismissed with no order as to costs. That offer was made on 3 August 2001 and was open until 10.00am on 6 August 2001. No money has been paid into Court and there is absolutely no basis, and none has been argued, upon which SOCOG is entitled to retain the amount of $260,006. 
         
        
        
         
         390 The plaintiff is entitled to the amount of $260,006 with interest upon which I will hear submissions.” 
         
        
       
     154 Bergin J went on to deal with damages under the heading “Loss of Opportunity” for which she awarded a total of $3 million, “Out of Pocket Expenses which was subsumed by the loss of opportunity damages, “Exemplary damages” for which she awarded $200,000 and “Aggravated damages” for which she awarded $95,000. In the result, the plaintiff recovered judgment against SOCOG in the sum of $4,234,319 plus costs. SOCOG did not challenge the right to such damages or their assessment if the tort alleged against it was made out. 
      
       
        
       Appeal 
        
       
     155 Apparently at the trial before Bergin J SOCOG emphasised both in evidence and in argument the alleged breaches or series of breaches of the Agency Agreement and the Deed Poll which it claimed entitled TOC to terminate the Agency Agreement. Bergin J rejected this claim and SOCOG did not seek to revive it on the appeal.  
      
       
     156 Before Bergin J no great attention was directed to the effect of the Indicia and Images Protection Act which rated no mention in Bergin J’s careful judgment until para 352 which I earlier set out. Bergin J did not quote the relevant parts of the legislation or summarise their effect. In para 355 her Honour found no breach of the Deed Poll and, for the same reason, no breach of the Act. Nor did Bergin J mention the Licence Agreement or its terms. Importantly that agreement granted to TOC as trustee the rights relevant in these proceedings “only in Australia” (cl 3.1 and Appendices A1 and A2). Furthermore, “for the avoidance of doubt” it denied to TOC “except to the extent expressly permitted by this agreement or a Transaction Document” the right to use or authorise the use of any or all of the Olympic marks on or in relation to any goods or services of the trustee or any third person, except as expressly permitted in the agreement (cl 3.5(a)). 
      
       
     157 Of SOCOG’s grounds of appeal I need quote only one, ground 10: 
      
       
         
        
         
         “ 
         Justification 
         
        
        
         
         10 The judge erred in failing to hold that by reason of: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the appellant’s responsibility to protect the reputation and goodwill of The Olympic Movement, the Olympic Club and the Sydney 2000 Games; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the breaches of the Agency Agreement referred to in paragraphs 1-5 above; [of these paragraphs I need refer only to para 2: “Breach of Clause 9.1(b)” of the Agency Agreement by the plaintiff’s conduct in utilising his exclusive agency to advance and promote his own travel and accommodation packages] 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the breach of the Deed Poll; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) the respondent’s failure to obtain a licence from the appellant pursuant to the Indicia and Images Protection Act; 
         
        
        
         
         the appellant’s conduct was in all the circumstances justified, so as to constitute a complete defence to the respondent’s claim for inducing a breach of contract.” 
         
        
       
     158 Mr Walker SC, who appeared for SOCOG on the appeal, though not at the hearing before Bergin J, and whose frank and skilful approach to the appeal must be commended, did not challenge Bergin J’s conclusions that TOC had no grounds for terminating the Agency Agreement with Zhu and, by purporting to do so, had wrongfully repudiated it. Moreover, counsel conceded there was a continuation of that repudiatory conduct which entitled Zhu to accept the repudiation by beginning the proceedings and to claim damages for repudiation against TOC. Of course, a liquidator of TOC was appointed and there was nothing to be gained by Zhu pursuing damages against TOC for its repudiation of the contract. Mr Walker also conceded that SOCOG, to use the terms by which the tort is described, knowingly induced TOC to break its contract with Zhu. If rightly found to have committed the tort, SOCOG did not challenge the amount of damages awarded and accepted that, even if it succeeded, judgment to the extent of $260,006 plus interest should stand against it. The question on appeal was whether or not the inducement was without lawful justification. Mr Walker submitted that the claim in tort was not made out if the inducement was justified because of SOCOG’s equal or superior right.  
      
       
     159 Justification as an element in the tort of wrongful interference with a contract has not been, and probably cannot be, defined. It has been said that whether justification in a particular case exists or not should be left to the good sense of the tribunal having regard to considerations which have been discussed in the cases. These are helpfully reviewed in Building Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia & Ors v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104 at 140 and following.  
      
       
     160 In a frequently cited passage in Read v The Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England, Ireland and Wales & 2 Ors [1902] 2 KB 88, Darling J, in upholding an appeal from a decision determined in the defendants’ favour because of their honesty and absence of improper motives, said at 95: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff had entered into a contract by which he became entitled to demand of Wigg & Wright that they should teach him the trade of a stonemason. That was his contractual right. To interfere with that right may give a cause of action against him who does so. For this proposition there is much unquestionable authority; but it is enough to cite these words from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in  
         Quinn v Leathem 
          [1901] AC 495 at 510: ‘A violation of legal right committed knowingly is a cause of action, and … it is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognised by law if there be no sufficient justification for the interference.’ 
         
        
        
         
         It was argued before us on behalf of the defendants that they had here such a sufficient justification, because they had themselves entered into a contract with Wigg & Wright, the terms of which were inconsistent with the contract between Wigg & Wright and the plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         It may well be that a person, or many persons acting in concert, would have a right to demand the fulfilment of a contract entered into with him or them, even though such fulfilment involved him who performed it in breaking a contract made by him with another person. Many examples may be put – for instance, a man who had affected to sell the same article to two separate purchasers could not possibly perform one contract without breaking the other, if both insisted on their rights, yet it could not render the purchaser, who insisted on his contractual rights, liable at the suit of the other purchaser.” 
         
        
       
     161 About justification, Darling J said at 96-7: 
      
       
        
         
         “To resume, I think the plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendants, unless the Court is satisfied that, when they interfered with the contractual rights of plaintiff, the defendants had a sufficient justification for their interference – to use Lord Macnaghten’s words. This sufficient justification they may have had, and they may prove it; but the facts found by the county court judge and relied on by him as enough do not amount to one; for it is not a justification that ‘they acted bona fide in the best interests of the society of masons’, ie, in their own interests. Nor is it enough that ‘they were not actuated by improper motives’. I think their sufficient justification for interference with plaintiff’s rights must be an equal or superior right in themselves, and that no one can legally excuse himself to a man, of whose contract he has procured the breach, on the ground that he has acted on a wrong understanding of his own rights, or without malice, or bona fide, or in the best interests of himself, or even that he acted as an altruist, seeking only the good of another and careless of his own advantage.” 
         
        
       
     162 In Glamorgan Coal Company Limited & Ors v South Wales Miners’ Federation & Ors [1903] 2 KB 545 at 574, Romer LJ said that he agreed with what Bowen LJ had said in Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co (1889) 23 QBD 598 at 618 when considering the difficulty that may arise whether there is sufficient justification or not. “The good sense of the tribunal which had to decide would have to analyze the circumstances and to discover on which side of the line each case fell.” Romer LJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will only add that, in analyzing or considering the circumstances, I think that regard might be had to the nature of the contract broken; the position of the parties to the contract; the grounds for the breach; the means employed to procure the breach; the relation of the person procuring the breach to the person who breaks the contract; and I think also to the object of the person in procuring the breach. But, though I deprecate the attempt to define justification, I think it right to express my opinion on certain points in connection with breaches of contract procured where the contract is one of master and servant. In my opinion, a defendant sued for knowingly procuring such a breach is not justified of necessity merely by his shewing that he had no personal animus against the employer, or that it was to the advantage or interest of both the defendant and the workman that the contract should be broken.” 
         
        
       
     163 In James v The Commonwealth (1939) 62 CLR 339, a claim against the Commonwealth for damages for loss suffered in consequence of the administration and enforcement of invalid legislation, at 370-371, Dixon J dealt with the principle upon which the tort of procuring the breach by a common carrier of his duty of service is founded and acknowledged the difficulty in determining what constituted lawful justification: 
      
       
        
         
         “The principle to which  
         Lumley v Gye 
          (1853) 2 E & B 216; 118 ER 749 is now referred is no doubt wide enough to include within its protection civil rights which exist independently of contract. It may be at once conceded that for a third party, without justification or excuse, knowingly to procure a common carrier to refuse in breach of his duty goods tendered to him for carriage would amount to an actionable wrong. In  
         Lumley v Gye 
          itself Erle J adopted the view that, just as the procurement of a tort was itself a tort, so it was wrongful to procure the breach of a contractual duty, and that the liability involved a principle of which liability for procuring a breach of contract of hiring was only an example or illustration; a class of cases which he said ‘rests upon the principle that the procurement of the violation of the right is a cause of action’ at 232; 755. In  
         Mogul Steamship Co v MacGregor Gow & Co 
          (1889) 23 QBD at 614 Bowen LJ included among the things forbidden ‘the intentional procurement of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming always that there is no just cause for it’. Lord Macnaghten in  
         Quinn v Leathem 
          [1901] AC 495 at 510 placed  
         Lumley v Gye 
          upon ‘the ground that a violation of legal right committed knowingly is a cause of action.’ In more than one respect, however, the elements of the cause of action are ill defined. Sometimes malice is said to be an ingredient; but this seems to mean no more than that the defendant must have knowledge of the existence of the civil right or of the facts from which it arises and must act without lawful justification. What constitutes a lawful justification is a matter of some difficulty: See 
          Glamorogan Coal Co v South Wales Miners’ Federation 
          [1903] 2 KB 545 particularly at 573, 575; [1905] AC 239;

         Civil Law 
         , 3rd ed (1938), sec 983, note b. The question which appears to me to arise in the present case under the head of justification or excuse is whether the bona-fide execution of a law for the time being upheld as valid by the competent judicial power amounts to just cause or excuse notwithstanding that the law is afterwards found to be invalid.” 
         
        
       
     164 The ground upon which Dixon J decided this part of the case against the plaintiff was that the Commonwealth incurred no liability for tort merely because (373) 
      
       
        
         
         “A is induced to refuse performance of what turns out to be in fact a civil duty to B by an intimation made to A by the officers of the Commonwealth that, under the law of the Commonwealth, A is not merely absolved from the performance of the duty but is forbidden under penalties to do what would amount to performance and, by doing it, would expose himself to prosecution; provided that the officers act honestly in the purported execution of their duty to maintain and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth and, perhaps reasonably, as, for instance, on the faith of a statute not yet held to be invalid. Even if the plaintiff overcame the other difficulties I have mentioned, this ground would be fatal to his claim for wrongful procurement of breaches of duty by common carriers. I do not think that a bona fide assertion as to the state of the law and an intention to resort to the courts made known to the third party can be considered a wrongful inducement or procurement.” 
         
        
        
       SOCOG in justification relied upon its duty to maintain the law. 
        
       
     165 In Edwin Hill & Partners v First National Finance Corporation Plc [1989] 1 WLR 225 the defendant bankers held a first legal charge on freehold property as security for the indebtedness of a developer who was unable either to repay the loan or raise finance for carrying out on the land development for which the plaintiffs had been appointed as architects. The bankers agreed to provide the necessary finance on condition that the plaintiffs were replaced by other architects. The developer therefore dismissed the plaintiffs, who claimed damages against the defendants for procuring a breach of their contract with the developer.  
      
       
     166 At first instance the claim was dismissed. The appeal to the English Court of Appeal was also dismissed. Stuart-Smith LJ at 229-230 quoted from the judgment of Romer LJ in Glamorgan Coal Co Ltd v South Wales Miners’ Federation and listed some matters which had been held not to amount to justification: (1) absence of malice or ill-will or intention to injure the person whose contract is broken: (2) the commercial or other best interests of the interferer or the contract breaker. On the other hand justification had been held to exist where there was a moral duty to intervene or the contract interfered with was inconsistent with a previous contract with the interferer. At 233 his Lordship said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Justification for interference with the plaintiff’s contractual right based upon an equal or superior right in the defendant must clearly be a legal right. Such right may derive from property, real or personal, or from contractual rights. Property rights may simply involve the use and enjoyment of land or personal property. To give an example put in argument by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC, if X carries on building operations on his land, they may to the knowledge of X interfere with a contract between A and B to carry out recording work on adjoining land occupied by A. But unless X’s activity amounts to a nuisance, he is justified in doing what he did. Alternatively, the law may grant legal remedies to the owner of property to act in defence or protection of his property; if in the exercise of these remedies he interferes with a contract between A and B of which he knows, he will be justified. If, instead of exercising those remedies, he reaches an accommodation with A, which has a similar effect of interfering with A’s contract with B, he is still justified notwithstanding that the accommodation may be to the commercial advantage of himself or A or both. The position is the same if the defendant’s right is to a contractual as opposed to a property right, provided it is equal or superior to the plaintiff’s rights.” 
         
        
        
       Both the Vice Chancellor and Nourse LJ agreed with Stuart-Smith LJ.  
        
       
     167 By contrast in the BWIU case at 146 the Federal Court held that in the circumstances of that case and in the light of the authorities it would be impossible to regard the appellants as justified upon any of the bases suggested. Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The matter was quite susceptible of determination by other means involving no unlawfulness, and the evidence shows a solution was in fact obtained through arbitration in one particular instance. The court is not required, in the circumstances, to consider what the position might have been at common law had the contracts between the respondent and the builders in truth involved the carrying out of the building work in question by employees working under conditions which breached industrial awards.” 
         
        
       
     168 Mr Walker submitted that Bergin J erred in linking justification with breach of the Agency Agreement. He acknowledged that at the trial a good deal of the argument and evidence was directed to whether there had been a breach of the Agency Agreement which “justified” its termination and a good deal less to whether, if there had not been such a breach, the tort of interference could be “justified”. In some of the passages from her judgment which I have quoted Bergin J, with due respect, seemed to equate justification in the sense of whether TOC was justified in terminating the Agency Agreement with the different question of whether SOCOG was justified in interfering even if TOC had no grounds for termination. 
      
       
     169 In the judgment less attention was directed to Mr Walker’s principal argument on the appeal that SOCOG’s interference was justified by superior right. This proceeded on the premise that if there had been a valid termination by TOC of the Agency Agreement no justification for interference was required. What was not addressed or sufficiently addressed were breaches of the Indicia and Images Protection Act. In para 360 of her judgment Bergin J said that, viewing the matters of complaint about the plaintiff’s conduct cumulatively and taking SOCOG’s submissions in relation to the plaintiff’s evidence into account, she was still satisfied that the conduct did not warrant summary dismissal. Her Honour said: “SOCOG’s justification case fails”. Left unresolved was the separate argument particularly about breach of the statute. SOCOG’s justification case based solely on statutory rights and responsibilities was not dealt with. According to this case although TOC’s termination of the Agency Agreement was unlawful SOCOG’s interference to procure its termination was justified.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: : On 26 November 2001, in proceedings brought by the appellant Con Gatzias against the respondent Melissa Middlehurst for damages for injuries allegedly suffered in a motor vehicle accident, Gibson DCJ ordered that there be judgment for the defendant and that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs. 
      
       
     2 The plaintiff appeals to this Court from those orders seeking, inter alia, a new trial of the proceedings. 
      
       
     3 I will begin by outlining the circumstances giving rise to the proceedings.  
      
       
     4 The plaintiff was born in 1962. He left school in December 1978 and commenced employment as an apprentice electrical fitter in February 1979. 
      
       
     5 On 21 November 1981 he was involved in the first of seven motor vehicle accidents that he has suffered. In that accident he suffered injury to his right brachial plexus.  
      
       
     6 In late 1983 he purchased an interest in a security company in which he then worked. On 2 April 1984 he was involved in a second motor vehicle accident, suffering an injury to his left knee. He was then off work for two weeks.  
      
       
     7 On 4 July 1984 he was involved in a third motor vehicle accident in which he received a fractured left patella, facial injuries and loss of teeth.  
      
       
     8 In late 1985 he sold his interest in the security company, and commenced working as a security guard with Wormald Security.  
      
       
     9 On 12 September 1986 he was involved in a fourth motor vehicle accident, in which he received an injury to this right knee. Apparently he was off work for about a week after that accident. 
      
       
     10 On 15 January 1988 he suffered injuries attempting to apprehend an intruder at St Peters. He suffered injury to his left knee, left leg and back. He was off work until September 1988, and his employment with Wormald was terminated in October 1988. 
      
       
     11 The plaintiff then commenced his own business as an investigator and process server. From 1990, this was conducted under the name Precision Mercantile Agency.  
      
       
     12 In 1990 he underwent an operation for excision of his L4/5 disc. On 26 May 1991 he suffered a laceration to his right knee in attempting to apprehend an intruder at Randwick. On 25 January 1992 he married his second wife. 
      
       
     13 On 2 April 1998 he was involved in the first of three rear end collisions. On that day he consulted his GP, Dr Yip, complaining of severe headache, right side neck pain and lower back pain, and of having experienced sudden pain down the right arm at the time of the accident. 
      
       
     14 On 19 April 1998 he was involved in the second of these three rear end collisions, this being the subject of these proceedings. He went to see Dr Yip on 30 April, complaining of increasing lower back pain radiating to the left leg, numbness and weakness of the right arm and a click of the neck when turning his head.  
      
       
     15 On 10 April 1999 he was involved in the third of the three rear end collisions. 
      
       
     16 On 17 March 2000 the plaintiff commenced proceedings in relation to these three rear end collisions. Proceedings No.1918 of 2000 were in relation to the accident on 2 April 1998, No.1919 of 2000 in relation to the accident of 10 April 1999, that is the third accident, and 1920 of 2000 in relation to the accident on 19 April 1998, that is the second accident, the subject of these proceedings. The particulars served in relation to these proceedings alleged substantially identical injuries, and identical disabilities, out of pocket expenses, wage loss, future medical and treatment expenses, home care services and loss of superannuation. 
      
       
     17 It appears that the plaintiff’s business ceased to operate at a date which has been identified in some places as February 2000, and other places as January 2001. The plaintiff has been unemployed since then. 
      
       
     18 On 2 January 2001 terms of settlement were filed in proceedings No.1918 of 2000 and No.1919 of 2000. The settlement in the former case was for $75,000 plus costs, and in the latter case $45,000 plus costs. 
      
       
     19 The hearing of these proceedings went ahead on 31 May and 1 June 2001 and 20 and 21 September 2001, and judgment was given on 26 November 2001. There was no issue before the primary judge as to the defendant’s negligence. The case was fought on the issue of causation of damage recoverable by the plaintiff.  
      
       
     20 The primary judge made various findings adverse to the credibility of the plaintiff, and ultimately found that the plaintiff had not proved non-economic loss passing the 15 per cent threshold under the Motor Accidents Act 1988, economic loss, loss based on any need for domestic assistance or loss associated with medical or other relevant expenses. In the result, the primary judge gave judgment for the defendant as I have indicated.  
      
       
     21 The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal:- 
      
       
        
         
         1. Her Honour erred in finding that the motor vehicle accidents in which the Plaintiff suffered injury on 2 April, 1998 and 19 April, 1999 were more serious than the Plaintiffs accident on 10 April, 1999. 
          
          
         2. Her Honour erred in determining that the Plaintiffs omission in serving any reports prepared by Dr Cummine were because the reports were adverse to the Plaintiffs position. 
          
          
         3. Her Honour erred in finding that the Plaintiff had provided false information to the Australian Taxation Office or sought to rely on financial information other than that provided to the Australian Taxation Office. 
          
          
         4. Her Honour erred in not awarding damages to the Plaintiff for past economic loss and out-of-pocket expenses after finding such causes and period of incapacity. 
         
        
       
     22 No argument was advanced in support of ground 1. As argued the appeal has focused on four areas. The first is the rejection of the claim for economic loss, grounds 3 and 4. Secondly, one particular aspect of the treatment of medical evidence, ground 2. Thirdly, the rejection of the claim for expenses, ground 4. Fourthly, the question of costs. 
      
       
     23 On the first matter, Dr Morrison SC for the appellant submitted that the primary judge had found that the appellant sustained “soft tissue injury which resolved approximately three to four months after the accident”, yet despite that made no award for economic loss, stating that there was “no evidence before me that the plaintiff had any time off work.” 
      
       
     24 Dr Morrison submitted that this involved error in a number of respects. Firstly, there had been evidence by the appellant that he had time off work and had to employ subcontractors. Secondly, there was evidence by his wife to the effect that he had some time off work. Thirdly, there was an erroneous statement by the primary judge to the effect that as a self-employer the plaintiff may have paid himself his usual salary. Fourthly, there was further evidence supporting economic loss in the evidence of reduced receipts from the business and increased expenses on subcontractors. Accordingly, Dr Morrison submitted, there should have been some award at least for economic loss. 
      
       
     25 Dr Morrison submitted that there was further error by the primary judge in a comment that a litigant cannot provide one set of figures to the ATO and another to the Court, and there was error in the primary judge relying on this comment in rejecting a report of the appellant’s accounting expert and in using this as having some impact on the assessment of the appellant’s credibility. 
      
       
     26 Dr Morrison also pointed to an additional associated error by the primary judge, in asserting that the appellant’s income from the years of the accident and subsequently were higher than the income before the accident.  
      
       
     27 Dr Morrison submitted that these errors vitiated the primary judge’s adverse findings on the credibility of the appellant and required that there be a new trial. 
      
       
     28 Next, Dr Morrison submitted that the primary judge misused the failure of the appellant to tender reports of Dr Cummine, a treating doctor. He submitted that, although it was open to the primary judge to draw the inference that these reports would not have positively assisted the appellant’s case, the primary judge went further, saying that the reports should have been served if they corroborated other medical evidence relied on by the appellant, that the appellant had sought to withhold this evidence from the Court, and that the views of Dr Cummine were adverse to the appellant. 
      
       
     29 Dr Morrison submitted that these errors vitiated the primary judge’s assessment of the medical evidence, and this too either on its own or in combination with the first series of errors required the granting of a new trial. 
      
       
     30 Next, Dr Morrison submitted that the primary judge was in error in finding that the appellant had not proved the loss of out-of-pocket expenses, on the basis that relevant accounts had been paid by the insurer in relation to 2 April 1998 accident and so cannot be sought twice. He submitted that the claim in relation to that accident had been settled for a single lump sum and the Health Insurance Commission had insisted, as it was entitled to, that certain Medicare payments be reimbursed from that judgment. The result of this was that those expenses were paid by the appellant, and Dr Morrison submitted that it was not a reasonable inference that the lump sum settlement in fact included one hundred per cent recovery for all these bills. The primary judge should have addressed this question, and the proper conclusion from the evidence was that some at least of the out of pockets were caused by this accident and recoverable in relation to it. 
      
       
     31 As I mentioned, Dr Morrison submitted that a new trial was justified. In the alternative, he submitted that there should be some award at least for economic loss and out-of-pocket expenses, in relation to which there was no threshold under the Motor Accidents Act. The result of this, he submitted, would be a different costs order from that made at first instance. At worst there should be an order that each party pay its own costs. 
      
       
     32 In my opinion, the appellant’s submissions must be considered in the context of the findings of the primary judge in relation to the appellant’s credibility. The appellant gave evidence that the impact in the 19 April accident was more severe than that of 2 April accident, that he was flung forward and had immediate startling pain in all regions of his body, and that he complained of his pain or injury to the respondent; and when asked why he did not go to the doctor on that day, he answered that it was because he was not sure that the doctor was open on that day at the time of the incident. 
      
       
     33 However, the accident in fact caused no damage to the appellant’s car, and the respondent gave evidence that she was travelling only a few kilometers per hour, and that the appellant spoke to her calmly and exhibited no sign and made no complaint of pain or injury immediately after the accident. 
      
       
     34 The primary judge found the appellant’s credit was damaged by concessions he made about mowing the lawn, driving his car without difficulty and hitching his trailer to his car. The primary judge accepted the respondent’s evidence, and found that the appellant had essentially re-invented his case after settling the two other rear end collision matters, exaggerating the importance of this accident and subsequent problems to the doctors. 
      
       
     35 The primary judge made no express finding to the effect that she could not rely to any significant extent on the appellant’s evidence where uncorroborated, but such a view was clearly implied in the judgment and, subject to one matter to which I will come, was amply justified. 
      
       
     36 The matter to which I refer is the criticism made by Dr Morrison in relation to the comment concerning the ATO figures. It would appear that the primary judge’s view on this played some part in her assessment of the appellant’s credibility, and I think it fair to say also that this was not a case where there was overt reliance on figures different from those in the appellant’s tax returns. Furthermore, it appears that the primary judge was in error in asserting that the appellant’s income of the year of the accident and subsequently was higher than before the accident. 
      
       
     37 On the other hand, the appellant’s claim for economic loss was at rates substantially in excess of his previous earnings, with flimsy support for this. Also, a quarterly breakup of the income of the business and of expenses on subcontractors indicated that there was a fall off in the business’s income in the year ended June 1968 substantially before the accident, and that the increased expenditure on subcontractors in this year was almost exclusively in the period before the accident. 
      
       
     38 In those circumstances, comparison of the financial figures including those supplied to the ATO did to some extent reflect adversely on the appellant’s credibility; and to the extent that the primary judge overstated this case, this was in my view a minor matter in the context of all the other matters taken into account by the primary judge in reaching her adverse view of the appellant’s credibility. Certainly in my view, it is insufficient to make out a case of substantial wrong or miscarriage such as could justify a new trial. 
      
       
     39 The other matter principally relied on as suggesting a ground for a new trial was the matter of comments made about Dr Cummine’s reports. The appellant accepted that there was an inference open that these reports would not have supported the appellant’s case. It is true that the primary judge’s statements went beyond this, but in my view those statements do not show that the primary judge in reaching her conclusions on the medical evidence gave substantially more significance to the failure to serve and rely on Dr Cummine’s reports than was justified by the Jones v Dunkel principle. In my opinion, when one has regard to the very careful consideration of the medical evidence given by the primary judge, any error in the statement of the significance of the failure to serve and rely on Dr Cummine’s points was insignificant in the reasoning to the final conclusion, in which the primary judge generally preferred the evidence of the respondent’s doctors, among other reasons on the basis of inaccurate histories given by the appellant to his own doctors. 
      
       
     40 Turning to the matter of economic loss, I think the statement made by the primary judge about the appellant as self-employer was incorrect, and I think it was not strictly correct to say that there was no evidence that the appellant had any time off work. However, the primary judge had previously rejected the appellant’s evidence that he needed to expend more on subcontractors, and in the light of the primary judge’s view as to the appellant’s credibility and the quarterly breakup of figures to which I have referred, that rejection was plainly justified. In my opinion the primary judge also implicitly rejected the appellant’s evidence about time off work; and in my opinion the evidence of the appellant’s wife did not give any real support to any finding of time off work productive of economic loss. 
      
       
     41 In relation to out-of-pocket expenses, I think that the payment of relevant medical expenses out of the verdict in relation to the 2 April accident is not conclusive on this matter as against the appellant, so to the extent that the primary judge proceeded on that basis there was error. However, the onus was on the appellant to prove out-of-pocket expenses caused by this accident and not recovered otherwise. The appellant did not establish directly that any of his out-of-pocket expenses were not included in the judgment in relation to the other case, although it may be that an inference to that effect was open. On the other hand, the evidence of Dr Yip suggested that even the particular expense most closely related to the accident in this case, namely a consultation of 30 April, was itself more due to the 2 April accident than that of 19 April. 
      
       
     42 In all these circumstances, I am not satisfied that there was error in the result in the finding that no out-of-pocket expenses arising from this accident had been proved. 
      
       
     43 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. I would add that, even if the appellant had established that a very small figure should have been found in relation to economic loss and out-of-pocket expenses, I am by no means satisfied that that would have resulted in a different order as to the costs at first instance. If a plaintiff in proceedings such this claims many hundred of thousand of dollars of damages, and after a trial lasting some days is found to have grossly exaggerated his claim and succeeds only as to a nominal amount, it may well be a correct exercise of discretion to award costs to the defendant. 
      
       
     44 In any event, for the reasons I have given, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Shadbolt, in the District Court, on 14 December 2001, in relation to an offence of common assault, of which he was convicted after trial, and in relation to an offence of robbery in company to which he pleaded guilty in the Local Court. 
      
       
     2 The sentence imposed in relation to the offence of common assault, which had been committed on 25 November 2000, was one of imprisonment for eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months, each to date from 14 December 2001, and to expire on 13 December 2002. 
      
       
     3 The sentence imposed in relation to the offence of robbery in company, which had been committed on 19 October 2000, was one of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years, each to commence on the date fixed for expiry of the non-parole period for the offence of common assault, that is, from 14 December 2002. 
      
       
     4 The sentencing order was, on its face, one providing for an overall term of six years, calculated from 14 December 2001, with a non-parole period of four years, calculated from the same date which was due to expire on 13 December 2005. 
      
       
     5 The position is complicated to the extent that the applicant was taken into custody on 26 November 2000, pursuant to warrant, in consequence of his parole for a prior offence of robbery in company having been revoked on 10 October 2000, that is, prior to the commission of the present offences. 
      
       
     6 The trigger for the revocation of his parole, it would appear, was his arrest for an offence of larceny, with which he was charged on 14 September 2000, and in respect of which he was sentenced to imprisonment for three months on 1 December 2000. 
      
       
     7 The balance of his parole in relation to the prior offence of robbery in company, for which he had received a head sentence of six years, to date from 19 February 1997, was not due to expire until 3 April 2003 as a consequence of the delay between the date of revocation of parole and his return into custody. 
      
       
     8 It would follow that his pre-sentence imprisonment, amounting to just over one year between 26 November 2000 and 14 December 2001, the commencement date for the sentences under appeal, was not solely referable to the offences in respect of which those sentences were imposed. 
      
       
     9 However, as a result of these sentences being partially concurrent, and partially accumulative upon the pre-existing sentence, the minimum continuous period during which the applicant would be required to serve in custody, after having returned to prison on 26 November 2000 before being re-eligible for parole would be one slightly in excess of five years. 
      
       
     10 The facts were succinctly stated by his Honour. In brief, the assault occurred in the circumstances where the applicant and Albert Bolamatu went to a flat occupied by a Miss Bashford for the purpose of recovering a debt. The offenders took certain items under claim of right, but additionally they set out on a rampage of violence, smashing and overturning furniture and issuing threats to Ms Bashford, who was nearing full term pregnancy, and who not surprisingly was placed in great fear. 
      
       
     11 In relation to the robbery in company the brief facts were that the applicant and his co-offender entered a branch of the National Australia Bank. The applicant jumped a counter and demanded money from the tellers, and then assisted the co-offender to gain access to the area behind the security screens. Upwards of $30,000 was taken, but not before a member of the bank staff managed to throw a dye bomb into the bag which the applicant was carrying. 
      
       
     12 The applicant was subsequently detected by way of a fingerprint on a counter at the bank, and by his presentation of one of the dye-marked banknotes. 
      
       
     13 The applicant had an extensive criminal history for violence and dishonesty, including convictions for robbery and related offences, which as his Honour appropriately noted, did not entitle him to any leniency. Subjectively he was shown to be a thirty year old male who had suffered mental health problems since his teenage years. 
      
       
     14 His Honour noted the reports which had been tendered in this respect, including that of Dr Clarke, who stated that what the applicant suffered from was “the classic onset of schizophrenia at the age of sixteen or seventeen years which to some extent abated with medication”, as well as the reports from the Correctional Health Services which rather saw him as suffering from “recurrent drug induced psychosis”. 
      
       
     15 His Honour came to the factual conclusion that he had not been psychotic at the time of the assault but he may have lacked judgment as a result of his illness, and may have been more prone to excitation and temptation when he was off medication, as he had been at the relevant time. 
      
       
     16 He accepted that, when drug free and in a structured environment, he did well, but that things went wrong when he returned home and resumed the use of alcohol and cannabis. Indeed, the medical reports would seem to suggest that he was not well accustomed, or prepared, to cooperate with medication, and that this had led to him committing repetitive criminal offences. 
      
       
     17 His Honour found that special circumstances had been established, referable to his chronic mental illness, and the need for a longer period of supervision, while on parole than that contemplated by s 44(2) of the Act. 
      
       
     18 In fixing the effective non-parole period of four years against the overall head sentence of six years, leaving aside the pre-sentence custody, of one year and eighteen days, the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was 66.66 per cent. When the effect of the partial accumulation, on the prior sentence, is taken into account the ratio of the effective non-parole period, of just over five years, to the overall head sentence of just over seven years, each calculated from 26 November 2000, is one slightly in excess of seventy-one per cent. 
      
       
     19 It is submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that his Honour erred in not making sufficient allowance for the pre-sentence custody, or for the fact of accumulation, and by not reducing the effective overall non-parole period, so as to accord with the finding, which he made, of special circumstances. 
      
       
     20 By the time that his Honour came to sentence the applicant he had not been released back on parole. Although, theoretically, that could have occurred, the fact of the pending charges made it inevitable, in a practical sense, that the Parole Board would not have allowed his release. 
      
       
     21 In those circumstances, it was not obligatory for his Honour to back date the sentencing order. The fact of his pre-sentence custody was, however, a relevant matter for consideration for the reasons identified in R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588, and R v Deeble NSWCCA 19 September 1991.  
      
       
     22 It was submitted that his Honour had not been appropriately informed of the date on which the applicant had been taken into custody as a result of the revocation of parole, and on that basis may have fallen into error. I am not however persuaded that such argument has been made good since, amongst the exhibits tendered, were the records from the Probation and Parole Service which made it crystal clear that he had been returned into custody, following revocation of his parole, on 26 November 2000. 
      
       
     23 It was next submitted that his Honour may have been misled by the applicant’s solicitor, so far as he suggested, during the course of the sentencing proceedings, that the sentence imposed in the Local Court constituted a sentence of six months, whereas in fact it was a sentence of only three months. 
      
       
     24 Whether his Honour noted that error is not at all clear from the reasons for sentence, however had there been a reference back to the sentencing record, then no doubt that error would have been apparent. It is a matter appropriately to be taken into account, since I am of the view that the course which his Honour took erred to some extent, although only to a limited extent. 
      
       
     25 In my view, in the light of the serious nature of the two offences, and the sentencing pattern for offences of robbery in company when committed upon banks, there could be no possible quarrel with the individual head sentences. Indeed, counsel for the applicant accepted that to be the case. 
      
       
     26 Nor, in my view, could there be any legitimate complaint for them having been made partially concurrent and partially cumulative, not only upon one another, but also in relation to the prior offence of robbery in company, since they were committed while the applicant was on parole in relation to it. The principle of totality justified that course, the fact that these offences were committed while the applicant was on parole being a matter of significant aggravation: R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181. 
      
       
     27 I have however reached the conclusion, notwithstanding those considerations, that his Honour erred in relation to the non-parole period. The fact of accumulation, and the fact of revocation of parole, as a result of an offence for which a relatively short sentence was later imposed, and which had expired well before the commencement date of the new sentences, qualified as a special circumstance, which should have been taken into account, in addition to the mental illness of the applicant.  
      
       
     28 The effect of his Honour’s sentencing order which, in substance, discounted the statutory ratio by only four per cent, and when considered against the total period of continuous custody, in my view, did not properly carry into effect the finding of special circumstances. 
      
       
     29 Error having thus been shown, I would grant leave to appeal. I propose that this Court intervene but only so as to reduce the non-parole period for the offence of robbery in company by six months, that is to one of two and a half years, to date from 14 December 2002, and to expire on 13 June 2005. The effect would be that the existing overall head sentence would still be one that expires on 13 December 2007. The effective non-parole period would be one that expires on 13 June 2005. Subject to that adjustment, I would otherwise dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     30 DOWD J: I agree. 
      
       
     31 BELL J: I also agree. 
      
       
     32 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will be as I proposed.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: SLD appears for sentence following his plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with murder. That offence occurred on 29 January 2001, and the plea was entered on 5 February 2002, following arraignment that day. He was committed for trial on 9 October 2001, and the matter was first mentioned in the Supreme Court on 5 November 2001. Since that date there have been a number of adjournments, in order to enable an exhaustive investigation into the background and mental state of SLD. It is accepted that the plea was offered at the first reasonably available opportunity, following preliminary psychiatric assessment.  
     
      
      FACTS 
       
      
    2 At the time of the offence SLD was aged 13 years and 10 months. He lived with his adoptive parents in the near vicinity of the house of his victim, who I shall refer to by her initials CM-C. She was 3 years old. She had been put to bed on the previous evening at about 8.30 pm, and checked by her mother at about 1.00 am. It was a hot night, and while the screen doors were kept closed and locked, the other doors were left open.3 At about 7 am on the morning of 29 January, her father noticed that the screen door and side gate were open. When he went to wake CM-C he found that she was not in the bunk which she shared with her brother. The rail of the bed was down. He went outside to look for her and found her nightgown lying near the gate. He made a quick search of the road and nearby bushes, but was unable to find any sign of her. Police were called, and a search was made of neighbouring homes and nearby bush land. 4 During the morning Mr LD, the adoptive father of SLD, alerted police to the fact that he was aware that a child was missing, and advised them that his son had been absent from their home during the early hours of the morning. His absence had been noticed when his wife had found the rear door of their house to be unlocked, and SLD to be away from his bed. Mr LD had checked the yard and driven around the nearby area looking for him without success. SLD had returned about 2.45 am, gaining access through the window to his sister’s bedroom. When confronted he was wearing only a pair of shorts. He claimed that he had been out walking and playing with his pet duck. Next morning his parents located some of his clothing secreted under their swimming pool.5 Mr LD and police confronted SLD who initially claimed no knowledge of the girl. He then said he had seen her during the night, while he was out walking, and offered to lead police to a cave where he had left her to sleep. He said that she had been unharmed. A frantic search of the bush land was then made, with SLD giving contradictory accounts of where he had seen the young girl. 6 It became obvious that SLD was sending police on a wild goose chase, and they implored him to lead them to the girl. He then stated that he had killed her “with a knife. I stabbed her in the heart.” He directed them to an area in the street where a pool of blood was seen on a concrete drive way. A steak knife was lying nearby.7 At that point SLD was arrested. The naked body of the young girl was found soon after in an area of very tall grass, with a stab wound through the heart. 8 When interviewed by police, SLD claimed that it had been his intention to steal property, and for that reason he had gone out looking for a suitable house. He chose the M-C house because the boys living there had boasted about their computer and video games. He said that having arrived at their house, he cut the mesh on the screen door and went inside to search for the games. Upon seeing the young girl he decided to take her for ransom.9 Later in the interview, however, he said that he had gone to the house intending to kill the eldest boy in the family, who had been one of a group of boys who had picked on him after an incident at Scouts. It was his plan, he said, to kill three of these boys in turn. On other occasions, both when speaking to police and to the experts who have examined him, he suggested that he did not know why he had acted in the way that he had.  
     
      
    10 It was his assertion to police that he had removed the young girl’s clothes in order to find a good place to stab her. Although he denied any intention of sexually assaulting her, he acknowledged having removed her nappy while she was in her bedroom. She had not woken, he said, as he carried her 300 m or so towards his home. He had placed her on the concrete driveway and then stabbed her once in the chest. When she cried out, he blocked her nose and mouth with his hands until she stopped crying and struggling. He then threw her body up an embankment and covered her with long grass, before returning home where he washed himself, and changed his clothes, before making his way back inside.  
     
      
    11 A number of his answers in the ERISP (particularly those given to questions 188, 189, 203 and 204) make it clear that he had intended to kill the girl. It is upon that basis that he is to be sentenced. Whether or not the offence was premeditated or impulsive cannot be resolved, in view of the inconsistent answers which SLD has given, the utterly inexplicable and cruel way in which he behaved this night, and his history of exaggeration, fabrication, and repetitive anti social conduct.  
     
      
    12 During the interview and walk around he made further attempts to mislead police. For example, he initially said that he had buried the girl’s pants or nappy under the swimming pool, and directed police to where they supposedly were. He was present while they dismantled part of the pool. He later said that they were back at her house, where they were then found. He indicated that he had “toyed” with the police because he did not like them and because he had been in trouble so many times that none of them liked or believed him. 13 Somewhat disturbingly he gave one answer (to question 411) which suggested that, once he had killed one person, he expected that it would become easier killing the next one and the one after that. 14 The autopsy showed that the direct cause of death was a stab wound to the chest. No evidence was found of any sexual assault, although in the context of prior sexual misbehaviour on his part, and in the context of a killing where the young girl had been stripped of her clothing, concern must be entertained as to whether there was some sexual connotation involved, even if it fell short of a physical interference with her.15 Clearly, this was an exceedingly disturbing killing of a very young child with devastating consequences for the immediate family, as is apparent from the victim impact statements which I have carefully read. They demonstrate as clearly as could be imagined, the heartbreak and destructive impact of the loss of their child, in circumstances which exceed any parent’s worst nightmare. Nothing I say or do could even begin to adequately reflect their loss, let alone to compensate for it, particularly having regard to the limited role which victim impact statements have in the sentencing process: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 16 The objective criminality of the young person, SLD, whether spontaneous or planned, was extremely high. An adult who abducted a young child from her bed in the middle of the night and who then deliberately killed her, in a senseless and savage way, particularly one who had a lengthy history of deviant and antisocial behaviour, would be at a very strong risk of being sentenced to the maximum term available, that is, imprisonment for the term of his natural life.  
     
      
    17 It was submitted by Mr Zahra SC that while this was a grave offence, it should not be regarded as one which was premeditated or planned. Certainly no finding to that effect can be made to the criminal onus. However, in many ways a motiveless and inexplicable murder of the kind here seen is as serious as one which was pre planned and motivated, for example by revenge or greed, at least so far as it might be an indicator of future dangerousness. 18 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence as extremely high, I record that I have taken into account a number of matters which the authorities recognize as circumstances of serious aggravation. They include the fact that it involved a night time break and enter of the victim’s home (R v Preston NSWCCA, 9 April 1997 at 25), that the victim was abducted while asleep in bed (R v Garforth NSWCCA, 23 May 1994 at p 7-8), that the killing involved the use of a knife (R v Hearne (2001) NSWCCA 37 at paras 18-21), that the killing accompanied an intent to kill, that the victim was a defenceless 3 year old girl, that her murder was utterly callous and cold-blooded, and that following the killing SLD went out of his way to play with police. 19 On the other hand, the present offender falls well short of having attained his majority, having been only in his fourteenth year of life at a time when he committed this terrible offence. Very few people of his age have been convicted of such an offence, and fortunately few attempt it.  
     
      
    20 As a young person, his case is to be considered by reference to quite a different set of sentencing principles, which are in part embodied in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and are otherwise reflected in decisions such as R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, R v SDM (2001) 51 NSWLR 530, R v JB and RJH (1999) NSWCCA 93 (specifically in relation to murder), and R v WKR (1993) 32 NSWLR 447, all of which place significant weight upon the interest of rehabilitation. However, as the authorities also show, where the offence is one of grave criminality, as is the case here, the interests of punishment and personal deterrence do need to be taken into account, and they may provide a counterbalance to the special concern for rehabilitation: R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, R v SK and OZ (2001) NSWCCA 492, R v JB and RJH (supra), R v GDP (supra), and R v JPD (2001) VSC 204.21 While punishment, retribution and personal deterrence are accordingly important elements in the sentencing exercise, I also observe, having regard to the offender’s age, the very special personal circumstances to which I will shortly come, that the case is one where general deterrence assumes less importance than it otherwise might have. All reasonable observers would recognize that this case is largely unique, and that punishment of SLD is likely to provide little by way of deterrence for other potential offenders. 22 The law also recognizes the relevance of emotional immaturity, of intellectual impairment and of a disturbed or deprived background as factors which can mitigate the objective severity of an offence in the case of young offenders: see for example R v Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23 and R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37 in relation to immaturity, and R v Letteri NSWCCA 18 March 1992, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48, where aspects of mental disorder or impaired intelligence exist. Each of these factors is significantly present in this case, and I expressly take them into account as factors reducing his criminality on this occasion. On the other hand they are also matters to be taken into account when assessing what the future holds for SLD and the community when he is eventually released.  
     
      
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
      
    23 In these circumstances, not only in order to assess SLD’s prospects of rehabilitation, but also to consider whether he presents as a continuing risk to the community, it became necessary to inquire, in considerable depth, into his background. My purpose in this regard is to determine, so far as I can, what it was that drove him to this crime, and how it is that his mind otherwise functions. 24 The inquiry made shows that his background is almost as bleak and disturbing as his crime, although nothing could, in truth, parallel it. For that assessment, I depend first upon evidence from his adoptive mother, and from Juvenile Justice Reports prepared by, and evidence led from, Karen Clark, a psychologist attached to the Violent Offenders Program, and from Linda Valenta, a Juvenile Justice Counsellor attached to the Sex Offender Program. 25 This evidence was supplemented by material gathered from the DOCS file which had been assembled in relation to the young person’s mother and family prior to his adoption, as well as by reports from various schools, disability services, Area Health Services and from Barnados Family Services.26 Finally there were reports and evidence, specific to the present offence, from 2 psychiatrists, Drs Westmore and Brent Waters, as well as reports from two clinical psychologists, Timothy Hannan and Peter Champion. In part, their reports were dependent upon the background materials previously mentioned, which had come into existence as a result of long standing contact between his family and DOCS or FACS, and other health and education specialists arising out of the history of family difficulties, and of delinquent or disruptive behaviour on the part of SLD. 27 Together they reveal that SLD was born on 12 March 1987, the youngest of 3 surviving children born to a mother who had an extensive history of substance abuse, including heroin, barbiturates, alcohol and various medications, as well as one involving physical and emotional abuse of her children. She had given birth to three other children, two of whom were still born and one of whom died with SIDS. The oldest of her children was born with narcotic withdrawal symptoms; and she was apparently on the methadone program when SLD and his surviving sister were born, having been a user of heroin earlier in these pregnancies. She had been involved in multiple relationships, which had broken down for various reasons, although mainly as a result of substance abuse. 28 The family had been referred for a Montrose Assessment during July/August 1989, following a series of notifications dating back over the preceding 6 years, mainly concerning the physical and emotional abuse of SLD’s elder half brother, KN. The history then taken recorded continuing incidents involving assaults by SLD’s father of his mother and of the elder brother. This had led to transfers to refuges, to the placement of the children in temporary foster care, and/or of infants homes.29 The Montrose Assessment was less than satisfactory, it being apparent that SLD’s mother was withdrawing from drugs, was displaying a hostile and a threatening attitude to the assessment team, and for a time went absent without leave. Eventually as a result of her lack of co operation, the assessment was terminated. 30 A Psychiatric assessment was undertaken of her at this time which suggested that she had a severe personality disorder along with a significant problem of polydrug abuse. Her own background was reported as having been one of physical, sexual and emotional abuse within a wholly dysfunctional family. 31 Her mother had allegedly been a prostitute who had supplied her and her siblings with drugs from an early age, and had been uncaring and violent towards them. As a result of this background of neglect, she had no positive memories of her own childhood, or her teenage years, part of which had been spent in various institutions, foster placements, and in psychiatric institutions during late adolescence. 32 Two of her own brothers had allegedly died in a car accident, while two of her sisters had died of drug overdoses before reaching the age of twenty years, leaving behind only one sister and herself. She claimed to have commenced living on the streets at the age of twelve, to have been dependent on drugs from that age, and to have supported herself through prostitution and criminal activities, which had resulted in a number of convictions and periods of imprisonment. 33 What was clear to those preparing the Montrose Report and what was to become critical for SLD, was her significant lack of parenting skills and of any capacity to provide properly for the emotional needs of her own children, including SLD. 34 Sadly, the turmoil of her early life was repeated, as is commonly the case, for each of her surviving children, including SLD. His first foster placement occurred in 1989 when he was not quite 2 years of age. He was returned to foster care again that year, and was also moved to houses of safety, until he and his sister were eventually placed into long term foster care as state wards in 1990. They were then adopted by their foster parents in 1993. 35 Paediatric appraisal of SLD in 1989 suggested that he was developmentally on the borderline of normal range. He was reported by Mr. Champion in 1990 as being of an unusual cranio-facial appearance, a condition later diagnosed as Trigonencephaly, this being a physical feature which has led to him having been the recipient of teasing. He was also suspected to be suffering from an xyy chromosomal abnormality, a circumstance which was later confirmed. 36 His speech was regarded by Mr Champion as being, to a considerable extent, unintelligible and he gave the impression, then, of being significantly delayed in language development, and comprehension. When reviewed by Mr Champion 2 ½ years later in a report for the Children's Court, he said that SLD still demonstrated a significant deficit in his language development, as well as some intellectual compromise. He was reported to have had a chaotic cognitive style – involving impulsive and confused thought processes, and a tendency to extreme exaggeration, fabrication and fantasy. Both SLD and his sister were assessed by Mr Champion at this time as demonstrating “very clear signs of serious emotional damage” flowing from their earlier experiences.  
     
      
    37 A further review was conducted by Mr Champion in 2001, following the current charge and other charges which have since been dismissed, and which must accordingly be ignored by me for the purposes of sentencing. By the time of this review, the young person was noted to have had a history of multiple school placements and of suspensions or expulsions from regular schools as well as from those specifically catering for behaviourally disturbed students. Intervening intelligence testing he noted had placed him in the borderline disabled range. As a result, Mr Champion suggested that he was operating in the lowest 5% or so in terms of competence. Hence, he said, his judgment could be expected to have been impaired to some degree, at the time of the offence. 38 An alleged sexual assault, when he was about 10 years of age by his elder brother, with whom it appears SLD currently has his closest emotional ties, and which had led to that brother being sent from the home, along with a conflicting history of substance abuse, were noted by Mr Champion. 39 Additionally, reference was made by Mr Champion to the worrying history of sexualized behaviour on his part which I will mention later. Additionally there was some history of fire lighting and of cruelty to animals. Mr Champion noted that he seemed to distinguish between certain animals, favouring some but considering it appropriate to kill others, for example galahs and pigeons, and that he spoke of developing various weapons such as seed balls with spikes for that purpose. 40 In the course of this interview with Mr Champion, SLD spoke of his “work” with a group of other unidentified individuals who, on his account, broke into homes and stole cars. He claimed to be the specialist “breaker” and to have derived excitement and satisfaction from being part of that group. 41 Mr Champion had reservations about the truth of his claims of involvement in these acts of larceny, which have in fact been repeated to several of the other experts who have seen him. They were unequivocally rejected by his adoptive mother as untrue, and as incapable of occurrence, in view of the restrictions which had been placed upon him at home.42 Similarly his adoptive mother queried the truth of the history which SLD had given to Mr Champion of prior substance abuse, which was itself contradictory, and which has not been consistently given to the various health professionals who have seen him.43 The account of the killing of the young girl which SLD offered to Mr Champion was vague, confused and contradictory of his interview with police. 44 Mr Champion considered his presentation on this occasion to be demonstrably atypical, and although he found no evidence of any of the more overt or florid symptoms of a psychotic process, or of a major mood disorder, he entertained concerns in relation to his problems with reality testing, his tendency to grandiose and magical thinking, his dysfunctional affective display and his confused and disorganized thought processes. Of some concern was his suicidal ideation, his fatalism, his preoccupation with death and his expectation that he would die by his own hand. 45 His current presentation Mr Champion confirmed as indicative of “detachment”, arising from a basic failure in the bonding and attachment process which had resulted in a young man, with few affectionate ties, and with little in the way of a commitment to relationships. 46 His emotional functioning Mr Champion described as “grossly impaired and blunted”, and he considered that this, along with his compromised intelligence and disengagement, were matters which might operate in mitigation. His prognosis he thought to be “very poor”, both in terms of his future mental state, and in terms of his future involvement in criminal offending. The potential for violent offending, however, he found difficult to assess in circumstances where SLD’s account of himself was in such a state of flux. 47 Timothy Hannan retested SLD’s level of cognitive functioning and current mental age, in November 2001. This assessment placed his general intellectual abilities at about the 18th percentile for his age, that is, within the low average range of intellectual functioning. His test age Mr Hannan thought was 2 years and 8 months behind his chronological age.48 For a while it was theorized that the xyy karyotype, which was confirmed to be present in SLD during 2001, was associated with a predisposition to violent criminal behaviour. More recent studies however contradict that proposition and I do not place any reliance upon it as an indicator of future dangerousness for the reasons outlined in Gunn and Taylor, Forensic Psychiatry: Clinical, Legal and Ethical Issues, 1993, Butterworth- Heinemann, Oxford. 49 Further investigations into the existence of some possible organic basis for SLD’s problems have been conducted. They included a CT brain scan, which found no abnormality. 50 Dr Brent Waters recorded a similar history to that mentioned so far. In the course of his report he drew attention to some of the disruptive incidents in which SLD had been involved after he began his secondary education at Hopetoun special school, which culminated in him causing some $10,000 worth of damage to the walls of the school following his assault of another boy and an ensuing confrontation with the vice principal. He was then transferred to the Annexe, a specialist unit at The Entrance High School, which he was still attending at the time of the present offence. Dr Waters made note of the continuation of his behavioural problems, which had included assaults, acts of teasing and intimidation of other students, and the taking of dangerous implements to school. 51 Dr Waters gave particular attention to those aspects of his behaviour which appeared to have had a sexual connotation. They included incidents of exposure at a special camp for disturbed children, at a scout camp, and also at school; incidents of stealing female underwear from a neighbouring home, and possibly from other premises, and an occasion when he urinated on the bed of the girl whose underwear he had taken, which had followed the family initiating police action against him. SLD’s explanation for stealing underwear was that he did it for fun, so that its owners would not have any such items to wear. He denied any sexual motivation.52 SLD gave the impression, Dr Waters said, of being buoyant in his mood, and of behaving in a manner, and expressing himself in a way, that did not appear consistent with remorse. He noted that SLD had attempted to explain his aggression at school as being attributable to taking out “his emotions” on other children, due to the physical abuse which he had experienced at home from his adoptive father. The occurrence of any such abuse, whether by way of correction or otherwise, his adoptive mother dismissed in her evidence as untrue. Dr Waters also recorded that SLD had repeated, in a boastful way, his account of being involved in break enter and steal offences, or “sneaks” as he called them, with other boys. 53 When asked by Dr Waters about the killing of the young girl, SLD suggested that although he had been responsible, he had been big noting and had not told the police the truth in the interview, adding that he was not “in the right zone”, whatever that might mean. The Police interview, he said he had regarded as “exciting” and as something which might attract media attention to himself. 54 He was unable, or unwilling, to explain his reason for the killing, but inferred that others had been present, although they were occupied in taking CDs. When challenged as to whether he was “big noting” again, he indicated that he had felt angry and frustrated when he used the knife, digressing to add that this would show his father “how mean he could be” when he gets angry. Later he indicated that anger at his father, on the night of the offence, had set the killing off.55 At one point in the interview he digressed to complain about the police who he described as “bastards”, adding that he had thoughts of killing one of them. 56 Dr Brent Waters thought him probably quite unreliable as an historian. That was not delusion-based, but rather, it amounted, in his view, to “self-serving simplistic boasts”. No evidence of anxiety or depression emerged, nor was there any evidence of “clear cut regret or distress” concerning the offence.57 It was his opinion that SLD does not now, and did not at the time of the offence, suffer from any form of mental illness, although his long history of antisocial conduct would meet the criteria for a conduct disorder. His measured IQ at his chronological age at the time of the offence, he said, would have been consistent with a mental age of 10 to 10.5 years. 58 He thought SLD to be strikingly lacking in emotion when describing the killing, and to be motivated by gratuitous self aggrandisement when doing so. He added that his history, leaving aside the charges of which he was acquitted, raised a serious question as to whether there was a sexual motivation behind the murder, and whether he had a predisposition towards violent sexual offences.59 When giving evidence he said that, while “to date I think it’s not possible to be certain whether there was a sexual motivation in [his crime]… I think there are enough indicators that there may have been”, and that as a consequence this should be addressed as part of his rehabilitation. Similarly he agreed that it was difficult to know how dangerous he was, given the disjunction between the range of his previous disruptive, aggressive, destructive and intimidating behaviour and the present offence. He pointed out, however, that the pervasiveness of the problems, the absence of a believable story and of believable remorse would “put him quite high up the scale of dangerousness.”60 Dr Waters added that SLD seemed not to think very highly of himself, and to have a need for self-aggrandisement, which had been manifested in his fascination in relation to the media attention he had received. While SLD was reasonably compliant in a setting where there was structure and control, he thought that the people, who were most at risk from him, were those over whom he had the advantage of age and size. Again, he expected that violence, aggression and impulse control needed to be addressed as part of his rehabilitation, and that any program provided for him should also have a socialisation and behavioural element to help him feel better about himself, to develop more mature ways of interacting with others, and to develop empathy and understanding for others. 61 His history of fabrication and confabulation, which made assessment and prediction difficult, Dr Waters said was typical of people who have a deep sense of worthlessness. His early history, Dr Waters thought, was “still reverberating through his life”, since unlike many children who had been adopted at the age of 4 years, with a similar history, and then given a supportive family, he had not changed for the better. While what had happened in these first four years of life was not necessarily irreversible, the likelihood of him now changing into a reasonably socialised adult, he thought to be “reasonably low”. 62 Positive factors which he identified were the fact that during those periods when he had teachers to whom he responded, he had done better, the fact that he was still going through the stages of early adulthood so that some further maturation might occur, and the circumstance reported to him that he seemed not to have presented as a management problem while in custody, and to be responding to the programmes which had been provided. To the correctness of that circumstance or assumption I shall return, since I am not convinced of its accuracy. 63 He made it clear that there would be difficulties in coming to any definite diagnosis, as to the presence of a personality disorder, before the age of 18 years, although SLD’s history of a very disruptive pattern of behaviour from early childhood, which had worsened during early adolescence, meant that the chances of him developing an anti social or substance abuse disorder, or a borderline personality, were in excess of 50% and could be of the order of 70%. The fact that SLD had killed once, he agreed, made it even more likely that such a disorder would develop. 64 His continued expression of homicidal thoughts, Dr Waters accepted could either be genuine reflections of his feelings, or a means of attention seeking. Which it was he could not determine with any certainty, although he accepted that SLD’s observations about it being easier to kill again were of concern.65 Additionally he agreed that while he appeared to respond to a very close supervisional structure, that did not mean that he would continue to behave in the same way after those controls were lifted. 66 In this regard, he accepted the desirability of the possibility of a redetermination or review of sentence for an offender such as SLD when he attained the age of 21 years or thereabouts, because by then he would have been incarcerated for 6 years and his response or progress to the several programs available could be better assessed. 67 This he thought would be long enough to form some view of how entrenched and dangerous he was. However he also cautioned: 
     
      
       
        
        “In some people who are quite dangerous when they are in a tightly controlled environment, they can be quite compliant and almost model citizens and yet their nature, when they are out in the community where they can express themselves will return immediately on their release and I think that the problem with that young man is that he is a bit like that. 
         
         
        A lot of disruptive children are disruptive in detention, they are very troublesome, you have a pretty clear idea of what is happening but he has shown an ability to be much more compliant in those circumstances and also even when he wasn’t in gaol before when he was a child to be quite compliant under certain social situations. Yet when the context changes there are fewer limits, I would think the problems come back straight away so, to some extent, even at the age of twenty-one it is quite possible that you may not know but there may be important things happening over that period. You may start to see a diminution in the self serving talking and you might see prosocial behaviour where he is helpful with other people and demonstrates empathy. There might be some behaviour outbreak and you will be able to see that their behaviour does improve with time.” 
        
       
      
    68 Dr Westmore reviewed SLD on 14 March 2001, 1 December 2001 and 11 July 2002. On the first of those occasions he received a history of him having been involved in break, enter and steal offences, with a friend, and of going out with another friend on the night of the killing, in order to commit some further robberies. According to this version of events, SLD and his friend jump started a vehicle which they found at one of the premises and drove around in it for a while. SLD said that when that friend went home he returned to the victim’s house, where he took some computer games and then abducted the young girl whom he later killed. 69 He was unable to explain to Dr Westmore why he had committed this offence, but said that he had subsequently regretted what he had done and felt sorrow for it. His initial thought, he said, was to take the girl for ransom. 70 He disclosed prior thoughts of killing a number of other people, who included adults, teenagers, and a ten year old. In the case of the teenagers, it was because they had fought and beaten him. He said “the only way to deal with this is to go around and kill them.” In two cases, he said, his thoughts had progressed to the stage of actual planning. 71 He claimed to have had a girlfriend with whom he had been engaging in full sexual activity over about three years. He also claimed to have numerous pets, including scorpions, funnel web spiders, a snake, rats and a pig. He also said that he had lit fires in the bush. His claims in relation to fire setting, and in relation to his “pets”, are unverified. Those relating to sexual activity with a girlfriend, and the commission of robberies were refuted by his mother, as I have earlier observed. 72 Dr Westmore did not think that SLD was clinically depressed, or that there were any psychotic features in his presentation. He had obvious reservations about the truth of the history which he had provided, which he reiterated when giving evidence. 73 When reviewed 8 months later, Dr Westmore again found no evidence to indicate that SLD was suffering from a mental illness. However he raised the possibility of him suffering from a severe personality disorder, but was reticent, due to his age, to provide a definitive opinion to that effect. He expressed particular concern about “the lack of affect displayed by him when discussing this incident” and said that “his lack of emotional expressiveness may have sinister implications for him in terms of his eventual personality profile”.  
     
      
    74 His long term outcome “from a developmental perspective and a dangerousness perspective” he thought to be “most uncertain”. Of some difficulty in this regard, no doubt, were the indications in the history, which was taken on this occasion, that he preferred to keep his thoughts about the incident to himself, and that he tended to do things and think of the consequences afterwards.75 At the most recent review, SLD offered as a reason for the killing, that it was due to “anger from a long period of time” that he could not get out. He suggested that he had come to this realisation a month or so ago when he had become angry with another young person in the juvenile justice institution who he felt like killing. He said that he had visualized doing this, and disclosed that he had experienced similar feelings once every 5 months or so. He also disclosed having thoughts of killing the police officers who had arrested him, and of wanting to blow up the tallest building in Australia “to show how pissed off I can get”. 76 He claimed to have constant thoughts of feeling bad about the murder of the young girl, but said that he did not show his emotions.77 Dr Westmore’s conclusions in relation to this disclosure were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[SLD] has apparently made a connection between his offending behaviour and the affect of anger. This realisation came about when, while in custody he had feelings of anger and developed homicidal thoughts towards another resident. Theoretically the recognition or realisation of this is a positive step, perhaps the first step in his psychological rehabilitation although as can be seen from the content of this report, he continues to harbour homicidal thoughts intermittently and this young man has a large number of complex unresolved psychological issues which are yet to be addressed.  
         
         
        Once again I think the most likely diagnosis is that SLD has a severely troubled personality, the full extent and precise nature of his difficulties will become more apparent as he grows older.” 
        
       
      
    78 In his evidence to me, Dr Westmore accepted that SLD’s propensity for fabrication and confabulation, and of giving unreliable statements, was material to the assessment of his future dangerousness. In this regard, he also recognised that his expression of homicidal thoughts could be genuine or for his own self enhancement, to make him feel empowered or more dangerous. 79 While it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion, the fact of his previous behaviour and his apparent lack of awareness of the impact of his continuing statement of homicidal thoughts, on a listener Dr Westmore said were of concern. Similarly the pervasiveness of his behaviour over the past 10 years, despite strenuous attempts at remediating it and his reluctance to fully self disclose, were troublesome. 80 While his prognosis was poor at the present time, Dr Westmore accepted that in view of his age, immaturity, intellectual deficits, and the problems in understanding the impact of his earlier history, a positive outcome could not be excluded. In this regard he agreed that if SLD was gaining some insight into the connection between anger and behaviour, and if he was able to form a close therapeutic relationship with a psychologist at the detention centre, then these could be positive indicators.81 Dr Westmore agreed with the comments of Dr Brent Waters concerning the possibility that offenders, who comply with the ordered structures of the correctional system, can resume their dangerousness once released, that SLD could fit into this category, and that those most likely to be at risk were the more vulnerable people in society. It was his opinion currently that “the balance of the information…is against him in terms of the dangerousness issue.” 82 He agreed with Dr Waters that there was a tradition or practice not to say that a person has a personality disorder before he or she reaches young adulthood, adding: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “.. as Dr Waters said, the pattern of behaviour during early life leads us to forming the diagnosis in reference to some personality disorder and he has that history of that at an early stage so I am really saying that he has got a very troubled personality at best and in a few years time we will become aware whether or not he has a severe personality disorder”. 
        
       
      
    83 He was also of the view that there would be merit, if it were possible, to redetermine SLD’s position at a later time, observing that by the time he was in his early 20’s, “the patterns of his behaviour are going to be really quite determined and evident”. 84 The report of Karen Clark relating to his behaviour while in custody raised a number of matters of relevance, including his commencement of self harm and tattooing, his claims to have been carrying implements for protection, and to having a plan, which he would not share, in the event of him receiving greater than a five year custodial sentence, as well as a plan to “get even and take care of” a list of people who “have wronged him or his family”. 85 While in custody, she reported, he had been admitted to the Robinson programme, a specialist therapeutic programme for young people with significant issues. She noted that he had continued to attend school, presently at Year 8 level, and appeared to be functioning reasonably well in that school. 86 The description he gave of himself to Ms Clark of being “a cold hearted killer” was somewhat disturbing, as was his perception that others would now be scared of him.87 The feelings he identified to her, as having been present at the time of the offence, were no less disturbing, namely that they included being “charged up”, that is “getting in and out of the house without being caught”, being “angry” with his adoptive father, and “powerful”, that is, “I had the biggest thing in the world – a young child”.  
     
      
    88 His report of being happy with the results of the offence and of not wanting to change anything, and of his motivation of wanting to get back at the girl’s parents for “repeatedly telling him to get off the grass”, reflect adversely on any claim which he might make to remorse or to have an insight into his offending. In this regard, he specifically denied any remorse and claimed that he had spoken to the young girl in the spirit world and had received her forgiveness.89 Ms Clark’s psychological testing of him showed that he is an angry young man who is liable to damage other people when he loses his temper, is a potential cutter - self harmer - and has a problem with interpersonal relations and social skills. His mildly elevated levels on the psychopathology scale, she warned, could portend the later development of more serious clinical problems, a matter which would appear to be of some concern, having regard to his history of elevating violence from late childhood. 90 His anger problem she thought to be driven by revenge, and to be a manifestation of his early emotional and psychological damage. She thought him in need of a structured environment that provided security and containment and also to be in need of intensive treatment. In view of the different persona which he presents to different people, and in different situations, any therapist dealing with him, she suggested, would need to address his highly manipulative behaviour over an extended period. 91 It was her conclusion that  
     
      
       
        
        “should SLD receive the proper treatment, he has some chance of becoming a productive member of society in the future. Without the treatment, revenge and resentment is likely to build up over the years and upon release he is likely to carry out acts of revenge.” 
        
       
      
    92 The treatment she saw as necessary for his many needs included participation in the sex offender and violent offender programmes, as well as psychological and psychiatric attention. 93 When giving evidence she agreed that the program in which he had been engaged so far suggested that SLD had developed a better sense of his issues, had established relationships with staff, and had learned some more appropriate skills and ways to deal with conflicts. Again I will return to that assessment when I refer to his Reiby file. 94 Ms Clark’s report was supplemented by that of Miss Valenta, who concentrated upon SLD’s previously documented history of sexual misbehaviour including his theft of female underwear, genital exposure, his admitted feelings of having some sexual thoughts at the time of the present offence which, disturbingly, had focused on hurting the victim sexually by stabbing her in the genital area, and the fact that he had removed her clothes. By reason of these factors she thought that he may benefit from participation in the sex offender programme. 95 She made it clear that he could not be included in the sex offenders program until he had been sentenced, but she thought that there were some indications from his participation in the Robinson program, and from her discussions with him, that he may respond to treatment.96 The adoptive mother of SLD gave evidence supportive of the proposition that he was less aggressive and disruptive when subject to a more structured and supervised environment, as he had been in his early years at home, and later at the Annexe. His problems had tended to magnify, she said, when he was attending schools which were less well supervised, or when he had teachers whom he did not respect, or with whom he did not have a good rapport. 97 She also confirmed that he has always had a tendency to exaggeration and fabrication, suggesting that he made up the accounts which had been of particular concern to the health professionals because he liked to shock people, and as a control mechanism, because he did not like people to get to know him too closely. She saw his need to be in control of importance for him. 98 She also thought that his behaviour had deteriorated significantly after the sexual assault by his half brother, after which he seemed to lose his sense of humour, to become aggressive, and more angry and hurtful, particularly at home, even though, paradoxically, he still looks up to that half brother. She conceded that this offence had occurred as he approached puberty. 99 Attempts at counselling and the use of drugs such as Epilim and Ritalin, she said had not redressed the problem, nor had the placements at Glenvale and Hopetoun Schools. However, his time at the Annexe to the Entrance High School had been more productive under the influence of strict guidelines and a strong staff, an assessment which is mirrored by the reports from this school which were included in the material tendered on sentence. 100 Attempts by her to inquire of him as to the reasons for the offence, she said, have been wholly unproductive, and have in fact only resulted in violent outbursts. As a result, that has not been pursued and she could provide no further insight into the offence. 101 Mr Fairall, the clinical coordinator of the Robinson Program at Reiby Detention Centre, who has qualifications in psychotherapy and adolescent psychology, gave evidence of his impressions of SLD since the time of his arrest. He said that, on his arrival, SLD presented as disorganized and disoriented to some extent, and “as a peculiar looking child who did peculiar things and who related to people in a peculiar way”. 102 Mr Fairall reported that he had not presented any particular difficulty in going along with the Robinson program, had been attending school and participating in groups. While there had been difficulties and time out from the school, he said that SLD had always been able to negotiate his re-entry to it. He added that while SLD had difficulty in establishing reasonable peer relations, he had developed quite a way to the point where he wanted to be part of the groups. 103 Of some importance Mr Fairall suggested, was his recently reported realization that he had been previously full of anger all of the time, but now there were periods where that was no longer the case. He also thought that SLD was developing some insights into his anger, and that those who were responsible for him were gaining an appreciation of the range of things, such as frustration with equipment not working as he expected, or external threats, which caused his unregulated anger. 104 It was his assessment that SLD used statements which were designed to shock people as a protective mechanism, to keep others such as the psychiatrists who had spoken to him, away, and as a means of exercising power. This he thought could be attributed to his earlier life history, which had left him fearful, vulnerable, alienated, helpless and disorganised.105 A complicating factor, which Mr Fairall identified, was the elaborate fantasy which SLD had built in relation to his natural family, at the expense of his relationship with the real and supportive world of his adoptive family. This involved an unreal belief in the goodness of his natural mother and frank hostility to his adoptive family. It was an area which the program was addressing through organising contact with his unreliable natural mother and half brother, in the hope of exposing him to the reality of his situation. So far this contact appears to have been confined to an occasional letter. 106 Mr Fairall explained that caution has been exercised so far, in relation to exploration of the issues surrounding the present offence, both for legal reasons and because this was seen as representing a very difficult and disturbing area for SLD. However he saw some signs of him beginning to develop an insight, which he thought had something to do with his vulnerability as a child, and with seeing, in the victim, a reminder of his family having been taken from him. He expected him to develop remorse through acquiring a capacity through his own experience to appreciate the impact of a loss of a child. However, he also thought because this was a threatening situation, and because SLD had limited defences, that he would have difficulty exposing his feelings. 107 He had not himself been aware of any consistent pattern of SLD harbouring homicidal thoughts and suggested that, so far as the psychiatrists had received such a history, it might be explicable as a defence mechanism. He agreed, however, that SLD was manipulative, and that he had in recent times expressed homicidal thoughts in relation to another detainee, that he had physically attacked a youth worker, and had lost his temper and caused damage during a family visit. He said that SLD had been the victim of teasing and taunting by other inmates, but so far had not been involved in a fight with them, an observation which is in fact contradicted by the file notes. He conceded that SLD does make known to those who taunt or tease him that he has killed before. 108 In general, Mr Fairall held out some expectation of progress, although he acknowledged that it must be said that problems continue and that the intervention must be regarded as still being in its preliminary stage.109 Mr Fairall’s evidence was confirmed to a substantial degree by Ms Manion. However a review of the incident notes (Exhibit D) shows that, apart from ongoing disruptive and provocative behaviour designed to encourage other inmates to commit mischief, there have in fact, been several incidents of seriously unacceptable or violent behaviour on SLD’s part. These include an occasion in June 2002 in which he and another youth became involved in a fist fight, some little time after each had been disarmed of potentially dangerous cutting implements. 110 On 16 May 2002 he flooded his room, barricaded his room and tried to hit one of the workers while being moved. In April 2002 he engaged in acts of self harm by cutting his left arm, after leaving a suicide note outside his room and on various occasions in March 2002 he was found to have implements in his room which were capable of inflicting injury. In February 2002 he made threats in relation to school staff, and in January 2002 he was found to have taken a set of keys, on an occasion when he was inappropriately out of his room at night, during which incident he threatened a staff member with a tennis racquet.  
     
      
    111 On 31 January 2002 he disclosed having contemplated cutting the throat of a night shift worker and getting his keys in an attempt to escape. He also indicated on this occasion that if he received a sentence of more than 5 years he would kill someone in the unit. 
     
      
    112 On other occasions he has barricaded his door, assaulted other inmates and consistently, it would appear, behaved in an aggressive and disruptive fashion towards staff and other residents, to the point where it is somewhat difficult to understand Mr Fairall’s assessment that he has made any real progress. 113 The additional statements included in the police brief concerning his pre custody behaviour provide some further insight into SLD’s background. In substance they tend to show that his behaviour at home, despite the efforts to control him and the extended assistance provided by a number of health and education professionals, continued typically to be aggressive, and included harassment, including physical and verbal cruelty, of his sister and another adopted child, to the point where at one stage police were contacted with a view to obtaining an AVO. 114 His manner was said to be dominating both of his siblings and of any other children who came to the home to play. His anti social behaviour and excessive anger, when confronted with complaints of inappropriate conduct, had come to the fore on more than one occasion, and had caused him significant problems with his peers and others in authority. 115 Although his adoptive father reported, in his statement, some improvement, at least at school, during the latter part of the year 2000 when SLD had been moved to the Annexe, he had not remained free from problems, having been involved, for example, in an incident late in the year, when he and another boy engaged in the highly dangerous activity of dropping bottles and rocks onto motor vehicles as they passed under a bridge. 116 A statement from the Principal at the Annexe showed, additionally, that he continued to pick on weaker students, and that on one occasion he had stolen some computer games. To his credit on that occasion, he had voluntarily offered an apology to the rest of his class. He had similarly stolen a videocassette while at Hopetoun School, as a pay back to a teacher for not giving him a star sticker for good behaviour. 117 The teachers’ notes for the year 2000, up until his final suspension from Hopetoun School make for very dismal reading, recording incident after incident of aggressive, offensive and disruptive behaviour. 118 During a 1999 camp for young offenders, from which SLD was later excluded because of indecent exposure, he was reported to have expressed an inappropriate interest in killing animals, and to have been consistently non co operative and disruptive, to have engaged in behaviour that had been expressly forbidden because of the dangers it presented for the outdoor activities being undertaken, and then to have threatened a police officer when he was being brought back to the camp after absconding. 119 He has had several other contacts with police due to various antisocial or aggressive incidents, which were noted in the folder of statements tendered in evidence, but which for one reason or another were not pursued, although in the course of them he had displayed a significant lack of respect for police and for other adults, as well as an absence of any appreciation of the significance of his wrong doing. Among the materials tendered were also statements showing that he had displayed a significant lack of respect, and disobedience, during the 2000 season, to those who had tried to coach him in a local soccer team. It was reported that, on more than one occasion, he had assaulted or abused fellow players, behaviour which was again consistent with a pattern of him seeking attention and trying to assert domination over others by threats and violence. 120 In summary, it has been evident, from a very early stage in his life, that SLD has been seriously affected by his background of upheaval, abuse and lack of emotional support, by his intellectual and speech disability, and by his dysmorphic appearance. Despite the enormous contribution put in by many health and education professionals, and the commendable efforts by his foster/adoptive parents who have done their very best for him, he has been quite unable to overcome these deficits, and he remains a very disturbed and problematic young person.121 His school history has been one of bullying, aggressive behaviour and lack of self discipline, with one serious incident of destruction of property at Hopetoun Special School. Of concern are the number of suspensions and expulsions on record, along with recorded threats of violence to teachers and students, of assaults, of possession of weapons at school, and of sexually deviant behaviour. 122 Of further concern is his history of damage to his own home and out of control behaviour, since the age of 10 years, which was reported by his adoptive parents, and which seemed to become worse after the alleged sexual assault by his elder half brother. 123 At times, however, depending upon the degree of control shown by his teachers, there has been some moderation in his otherwise disruptive, bullying and aggressive ways. This is a characteristic which has attracted the notice of his adoptive parents and of the psychiatrists, all of whom emphasise the need for him to be contained in a strictly controlled environment. 124 A report of Jean Mcguiness in 1993 was, in my view, somewhat prescient in so far as she noted that due to SLD’s poor self image, he tended to test limits in order to gain approval, affection and security. More recently it may have manifested itself in the way identified by his mother, and by Mr Fairall, as a means of shocking people with whom SLD felt uncomfortable, so as to maintain his own security, or in the way noted in the Juvenile Justice Report and by Dr Westmore as a means of gaining control.125 Either way, this aspect of his conduct has seriously affected his ability to integrate with or to be accepted by others, a factor which is likely to remain even more problematic as he ages, unless his problems with anger, conflict resolution and socialisation can be appropriately addressed. In this regard, his readiness to resort to aggressive behaviour in order to get his own way, and his lack of sympathy or empathy in the past for others, are of considerable ongoing concern, as are his expression of homicidal feelings, and his unwillingness to make full and reliable disclosure in relation to the killing or in relation to the post sentence plan he claims to have. Additionally he has shown himself to be streetwise and capable of manipulation and deception of others. 126 In my view, his history is such that, consistently with the expert opinions placed before the Court, he must be judged as posing a significant level of future dangerousness and to be at a substantial risk of reoffending in both violent and sexual ways. There are also very strong indications from his history of elevating aggression and disruptive behaviour, and from the killing itself, that he will develop a significant antisocial or borderline personality disorder, of some magnitude. 127 Whether that can be addressed in the course of the Robinson programme, and precisely how SLD would behave once freed of the structured and controlled environment of the custodial system, are problematic in the extreme. There are some indications both of progress and of regression, but clearly SLD has to change to a very significant extent, if he is to overcome the effects of a tragic background, which was not of his making, and if he is to leave behind a pervasive history of seriously anti social, aggressive, disruptive, destructive and homicidal behaviour. 128 These findings do need to be taken into account in structuring a sentence that will reflect the interests of the community, in accordance with the principles noted in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. While preventative detention is impermissible, it is proper for the Court to take into account the risk which the community faces from an offender when he or she is sentenced. 129 Additional to the matters noted so far, SLD is entitled, in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 to the benefit of his plea of guilty which I accept is to be taken as having been offered at the earliest reasonable opportunity, and to have had a significant utilitarian value, as well as having displayed some acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice of the kind noted in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6.130 I do not consider that it displays much in the way of remorse, as distinct from an acceptance that a conviction was inevitable. The presence of remorse and insight remain highly questionable, since there has been very little which SLD has done, or said, to convey that he has any genuine feelings in this regard. On the other hand it is possible that he entertains some regret and shame, but is emotionally unable, by reason of his personality problems, to show that openly. 131 To sentence a person of his age for the offence of murder, is a formidable challenge, for which there is very little, if any precedent in this country or elsewhere. In this regard the various decisions concerning the fixing of a tariff arising out of the conviction of the two boys who murdered Jamie Bulger, when they were aged 10 ½ years, particularly that reported in Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex Parte Venables in the Court of Appeal [1998] AC 407, House of Lords [1998] AC 467, and the later decision of the Court of Appeal in Re Thompson [2001] 1 All ER 737, provide some, although limited, assistance by reason of the very different sentencing regime there involved.  
     
      
    132 In view of the concerns which I will later mention, in relation to sentencing in a case such as the present, it is convenient to make brief reference to the Bulger case, which fell to be dealt with pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Under the sentencing regime so established, the offenders were sentenced to be detained pursuant to her Majesty’s pleasure. 
     
      
    133 Pursuant to s 53(1) of the Act “tariff recommendations”, concerning the minimum period which would need to expire before the offenders were released, were made in 1993 by the trial judge and by the Lord Chief Justice respectively of 8 and 10 years. In the exercise of the power reserved to the Secretary of State, in 1994, the tariff was set at 15 years, which would have permitted a first review after 12 years (that is, 3 years before the tariff date), so as to determine whether the offenders could be released on licence at the expiry of the tariff. Upon appeal the Secretary of State was found to have taken inappropriate considerations into account and the 15 year tariff was quashed.  
     
      
    134 Following that decision and other proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights, a change of legislative policy was announced so as to allow for the tariff in cases involving children aged under 18 years to be set in open Court. In the meantime, the case was referred back to the Lord Chief Justice for a recommendation which the Secretary of State indicated he would accept.  
     
      
    135 After a consideration of the striking progress and genuine remorse which each of the offenders had displayed over the intervening 7 years, and taking into account the undesirability of undoing the good work which had been achieved, by sending them into young offender or adult institutions, Woolf LCJ refixed the tariff at 8 years (at 742). His Lordship did however indicate that had he been determining the matter in 1993, he would probably have selected 10 years as being the appropriate tariff. Moreover, he made it clear (at 741) that the sentencing regime in existence meant that the offenders would be on licence, and liable to be recalled to custody for the rest of their lives, if they did not comply with the terms of their licence.  
     
      
    136 Nothing approaching this procedure is available to me. If a life sentence were to be specified, I could not fix a non parole period. Moreover, there is no procedure in existence for sentencing a young offender to Her Majesty’s pleasure, or for fixing a minimum term and accompanying date for a review as to whether the offender should be released on licence or parole at the end of that period. The only option I have is to fix a head sentence, and if it is one other than imprisonment for life, to specify a non parole period. 137 In undertaking that exercise, I must take into account not only the extreme objective seriousness of the offence, but also the interests of rehabilitation, which have particular significance for a young offender, including the question whether imprisonment in an adult institution will undo any attempts at rehabilitation. They in turn, are to be judged in the light of the offender’s subjective circumstances, both so far as they may explain the offence, and so far as they may provide an indication of whether he will respond to any therapeutic or other program, and whether he will continue to present a danger to society. 138 As the law presently stands, I must impose a sentence in the light of what is presently known, notwithstanding the circumstance that none of the psychiatrists or psychologists who have examined SLD and who have given evidence, can be certain what the future holds, or what truly motivated him. I have given consideration to the possibility of adjourning the sentencing to a date well into the future, so that SLD’s performance in the Robinson Programme can be better assessed, and so that a firmer diagnosis as to his mental state can be made. However, I am of the view that to leave the matter in a state of uncertainty for the period required, would be counter productive, and that a case such as the present does not admit of an application of the kind of principles which underlie Griffiths remands. 139 The only alternative, as I see it, is to impose a significant head sentence which would reflect my assessment that the present offence fell into the upper range of objective seriousness, and that SLD poses a significant risk of recidivism and of being a serious risk to the community in terms of potentially killing again or committing sexual offences. 140 The interests of rehabilitation, and the faint signs that he may yet acquire some control of his anger, and some degree of empathy and social skills, through the intensive programmes available within the Juvenile Justice System and elsewhere within the Correctional System, should in my view, be reflected by fixing an appropriate non parole period. That should be one which will permit an extended period of release subject to supervision on parole, dependant however upon the way in which SLD responds to these programs while in custody, and upon the resolution or development of the personality problems presently evident. 141 I am satisfied, by reference to his age at the time of the offence, his early childhood trauma, his intellectual impairment, the fact that he has not yet matured either intellectually or emotionally, and the special treatment which can be provided initially within the juvenile justice system, and later within the adult system, that these constitute special circumstances, so as to permit a variation of the usual ratio between the head sentence and the non parole period. Additionally they justify permitting SLD to remain in a detention centre for a limited period after attaining the age of 18 years. 142 However, in view of the fact that he is physically very well developed, has limited empathy and a record of bullying and domination of younger children, as well as one of disruptive and aggressive behaviour over the past 8 months while held in custody, I consider that it would be inappropriate for him to remain in a detention centre beyond the age of 19 years. I say that having regard to the interests of the other detainees who are likely to be exposed to the kind of aggressive behaviour and poor example which he has set so far, but also having regard to his own interests since there is a risk that experience, age and superior physical strength will only entrench any tendency he has to dominate other more vulnerable persons. 143 The period between now and the age of 19 years I regard as sufficient for him to gain at least the school certificate, as well as to establish the basis for readjustment and socialisation, and to prepare him for vocational training more relevant to an adult. 144 In the meantime he can benefit from the sexual assault and violent offender programmes, and can then reinforce those gains in the programs specifically available for adults. In that regard I do not consider that a sentence and non parole period can properly be handed down which would free him from transfer to the adult correctional system. Any such sentence would fail to reflect the objective severity of the offence or the need for the protection of the community. 145 SLD, in the light of the forgoing findings, I sentence you for the murder of CM-C to imprisonment for 20 years, to commence from 29 January 2001, and to expire on 28 January 2021. I fix a non-parole period of 10 years to date similarly from 29 January 2001 and to expire on 28 January 2011. Whether you can be released on 29 January 2011, being the earliest possible parole release date, will depend upon such progress as has been made towards your rehabilitation by that time. You will need to understand that even if released to parole, you will be subject to close supervision for the following 10 years, and will be at risk of being returned to custody for the whole or part of that period if you re-offend. 146 In accordance with s 19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, I direct that such of this sentence as shall relate to the period until SLD attains the age of 19 years is to be served in a detention centre. 147 I will refer these reasons for sentence to the Criminal Law Review Division for consideration of a possible amendment of the law so as to cater for special cases such as the present. The cases I have in mind are those involving juveniles who are convicted of offences attracting a possible maximum sentence of 25 years or more, who are aged less than 15 years at the time of the offence, and where the information available at the time of sentencing does not permit the Court to make a proper assessment as to the presence or likely development of a serious personality or psychiatric disorder, and/or propensity for future dangerousness. In such a case it would be desirable, in my view, if the Court could sentence the offender initially to be detained at her Majesty’s pleasure, with provision for review and resentencing at a later date, for example at the age of 21 years, or after say 5 years in custody.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by his Honour the Chief Judge of the District Court in respect of one offence of detain for advantage, an offence under s.90A of the Crimes Act 1900 which, in its unaggravated form, is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. In the event of injury to a victim, such an offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 His Honour when sentencing the applicant took into account on a Form 1 some six additional matters. They included the offence of take and drive a conveyance, an offence under ss.154A(1)(a) and 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty prescribed is five years imprisonment, an offence of malicious damage under s.195(a) of the Crimes Act, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, an offence of larceny under s.117 of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty prescribed for which is five years imprisonment, an offence of attempt to take and drive a conveyance, again an offence under s.154A(1)(a), again punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and two offences of resist arrest, each under s.58 of the Crimes Act 1900 and which carry maximum penalties of five years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 His Honour sentenced the applicant, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to a term of four years imprisonment to commence on 8 May 2001 and to expire on 7 May 2005. In respect of that sentence, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years to commence on 8 May 2001 and to expire on 7 May 2003. 
      
       
     4 We have been provided with extensive written submissions by counsel for the applicant and by the Crown and this morning before us in her oral submissions counsel for the applicant has said all that can be said on the applicant’s behalf. Those submissions however in my view do not disclose that his Honour the learned trial judge fell into any error of law or principle such as might warrant the court interfering with the sentence. 
      
       
     5 The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.6(3), provides that it is only where the court is of the view that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed that the court has power to interfere with the discretion exercised by the primary judge.  
      
       
     6 In this case, it is asserted that there are errors in what the primary judge did, such as would warrant the court interfering. If there were such errors, then the question arises as to whether the sentence as passed was a sentence which was excessive, having regard to those matters to which a court must now have regard, particularly having those referred to in s.21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     7 The argument was put that there were at least four matters which mitigated the objective culpability of the offender’s actions. It was said that there was no planning for the offence charged, that it was not the offender's primary intent to detain his victim for advantage, that the detention was only momentary and that the victim was occasioned no injury. In those circumstances, it was submitted that his Honour’s starting point for sentence calculation must have been too high to end up with the sentence that was passed. It was submitted that there were two errors that could be detected upon a comparison of the facts of this case with the facts of other cases and with sentencing statistics: that his Honour erred in saying cases of this kind deserve long periods of imprisonment when one has regard to sentencing statistics which show that various cases of offences under s.90A have received lesser sentences of imprisonment or indeed sentences of a different nature; and that his Honour erred when he expressed the view that this was a matter where the penalty should be at the lower end of the scale for an offence of this kind, since having regard to the statistics and the nature of some of the cases referred to in them, this sentence was not at the lower end of the scale. Comparison was sought to be made with the circumstances of other cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal in which, so it was said, more culpable behaviour occurred but sentences at primary level were on a par with that passed here and no adverse comment was made on appeal. 
      
       
     8 I am not assisted by reference to the statistics or to other cases as the foundation for arguments of this sort. It is notorious that offences under s.90A are committed in diverse circumstances, ranging from offences of the most serious kind to offences that are verging on having little or limited culpability, having regard to the circumstances in which they were committed, particularly is this so when other offences committed with them are brought forward for punishment.  
      
       
     9 In this case, the short facts were set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. The prisoner was apparently bent on stealing a motor vehicle. He was seen trying to get into the motor vehicle and police were called. He damaged the motor vehicle and as police came up and challenged him, he fled. He was pursued by police until he came to a vehicle being driven by a 72 year old woman. He opened the front passenger door, got into the vehicle, activated the central locking mechanism to prevent police rescue, lent across the driver and whilst police were attempting to enter the vehicle, attempted to force manually the driver to take off so that he could use her as his hostage and driver for his escape. 
      
       
     10 He shouted at her, “Get your foot off the brake, get your foot off the brake” and apparently manually operated the accelerator. The vehicle only travelled about 15 metres whilst the police were encouraging the woman to keep her foot on the brake and the police were able to active the locking system, gain access to the vehicle, rescue the woman and in due course, subject to some resistance which is referred to in two of the matters on the Form 1, restrain and handcuff the prisoner. The victim was not injured, she was frightened, she did not know what was going to happen. 
      
       
     11 All of these events as his Honour pointed out took place just over a month after the prisoner had been released from gaol after serving a sentence of three months which had been imposed in respect of offences of possess car breaking implements and be carried in conveyance without the consent of the owner.  
      
       
     12 The prisoner’s prior record is not such as to operate to dispose a Court to leniency in these circumstances. The trial judge had regard to the fact that he was not primarily seeking to detain anyone and was primarily seeking to get away from the police. He had regard to the fact that the plea, although not entered at the earliest time, was entered in circumstances such as to attract, appropriately as the law then stood, a discount, which, although not quantified, was no doubt substantial. 
      
       
     13 In addition, the trial judge found contrition and in particular contrition about having committed the primary offence into the commission of which the prisoner had fallen, notwithstanding the lack of planning or prior formation of intent. 
      
       
     14 His Honour expressed the view that it was unfortunate in many ways that the prisoner had offended as he had, as he was an intelligent and responsible person who had apparently been struggling against drugs. His Honour referred to the availability of potential residential drug assistance following the prisoner serving the custodial portion of his sentence. He accepted the offence was committed in a moment of panic and was not accompanied by any particular threats or assault “apart from what was involved in taking hold of the steering wheel of the car”. 
      
       
     15 His Honour came to the conclusion that he should impose the sentence that he did, it being such a long sentence, with some considerable degree of reluctance, but did find special circumstances to enable a reduction in the statutory ratio. 
      
       
     16 I do not see that his Honour in any way fell into legal error. I do not see that any lesser sentence in the circumstances would be warranted in law or should have been imposed. In my view, the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted since the matter has been debated to such an extent before us but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     17 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     18 GREG JAMES J: The orders will be as I have proposed. **************

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: This is a conviction appeal by Kalid Kaddour. On 3 July 2000 the appellant was found guilty of driving in a manner dangerous and causing grievous bodily harm. On 30 August 2000 he was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     2 On 14 September 1998 the appellant drove a Lamborghini motor vehicle south in Barrenjoey Road, Mona Vale when it crossed a concrete medium strip into a north bound lane and collided with a Volvo being driven by Mrs Dexter, causing her injury. The accident occurred just south of the intersection with Phillip Road and close to the intersection with Grandview Parade. When it crossed the medium strip the Lamborghini was travelling at a high speed, somewhere between 100 and 105 kph. The speed limit was 60 kph. 
      
       
     3 Although there was evidence that the appellant’s speed at the time of the accident was in excess of 105 kph, the jury were unable to agree on the alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm by driving at a speed dangerous, to wit, more than105 kph. 
      
       
     4 There was evidence that prior to the accident, and for a distance of approximately 6 km, the appellant had been seen by numerous witnesses to be driving at very high speeds. A Lamborghini is a very powerful high performance car, perhaps more suited to racetracks than suburban roads. 
      
       
     5 The defence case at trial relied essentially on the possibility of a mechanical defect explaining the accident. One possible hypothesis raised was that at some point before the accident, the accelerator cable jammed. 
      
       
     6 Eight days after the accident a prosecution expert, Constable Thompson, examined the vehicle. Although the car had suffered significant fire damage, he found no mechanical problems other than those caused by the collision. He examined the accelerator throttle assembly and found that the pedal was jammed due to the collision and fire damage. He also said that the offside fuel bank throttle was free at rest and under its own spring tension. 
      
       
     7 Constable Thompson said in evidence that: 
      
       
        
         
         … the throttle movement was normal, the spring made the throttle come back to rest when it was operated so that there was no sign of jamming or anything untoward on that side of the engine. So it effectively operated normally. 
         
        
       
     8 In cross-examination he said that the pedal was ‘jammed sideways against [a] side kick panel’. 
      
       
     9 The defence called an expert witness, Mr Colin Wingrove, who said that the accelerator cable was jammed and this could have caused the appellant to lose control of the vehicle. Mr Wingrove had examined the vehicle wreck in June 2000, 21 months after Constable Thompson. Unlike Constable Thompson he did not examine the engine, as it was not with the wreck. 
      
       
     10 Mr Wingrove removed part of the accelerator cable from the car, unfortunately damaging it in the process. Although he surmised as to the possible ways the cable could have become stuck, he said that he did not know what had caused the jamming. 
      
       
     11 It seems that the jury did not accept that the accelerator cable was jammed prior to the accident so as to cause the appellant to lose control of the vehicle. 
      
       
     12 When Mr Wingrove gave evidence at the trial he had already read a statement of Constable Thompson. He was cross-examined as to some of the officer’s evidence given at the trial, which was consistent with the statement. It appears that he was not present when Constable Thompson gave evidence.  
      
       
     13 Because of what Mr Wingrove had observed on his inspection of the wreck, sans the engine, and the contents of Constable Thompson’s statement, he says that it did not occur to him at the time of the trial that he should examine the engine. Mr Wingrove says that he did not seek to examine the engine because it did not, at the time, appear to be relevant to his inquiries. 
      
       
     14 After the trial was over Mr Wingrove says that he became aware that the Crown had submitted to the jury that the observation of Constable Thompson that the offside throttle assembly was in the closed position meant that the cable was not jammed at the time of the accident. As a consequence of this awareness, Mr Wingrove examined the fuel injection assembly which he understood had been taken from the engine of the vehicle. He did this in July and September 2001. It must be noted that this was in excess of a year after the jury verdict and almost three years after the accident. 
      
       
     15 In an affidavit sworn 6 December 2001 and read to the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr Wingrove said that he examined the accelerator linkages and saw certain damage, which he described. From his observations he concluded that Constable Thompson’s evidence at the trial was erroneous. In short, he says that the nature of the collision damage occasioned to the entire accelerator linkage mechanism was sufficient to prevent Constable Thompson, during his examination of the engine after the accident, from confirming that the accelerator had returned to the closed position and therefore could not have jammed prior to the accident. 
      
       
     16 Also read upon the appeal was an affidavit of Senior Constable Lee sworn 28 February 2002. In his affidavit he disagreed with Mr Wingrove’s conclusion mentioned immediately above. He says that it is clear that Constable Thompson examined the engine on 22 September 1998, including the associated linkages, cables etc, albeit they were in a burnt and damaged state caused by the vehicle catching alight after the collision. Mr Lee says that from Constable Thompson’s statement it was plain that he carried out functionality tests on the accelerator linkages and found them to be intact, operating correctly and returning to rest. 
      
       
     17 After noting that Constable Thompson had examined the vehicle with the engine and accessories in situ, Mr Lee noted that Mr Wingrove had examined an inlet manifold assembly as a separate component. He says that the lack of an inlet manifold pivot at the end of the throttle shaft would have little significance to its operation. He says that the photographs taken by Mr Wingrove do not show any significant disturbance to the pivot at position ‘C’ marked on the photographs. 
      
       
     18 Mr Lee also examined the photographs tendered at the trial, including exhibit P5. He observed that only a small portion of the inner accelerator cable was protruding from the outer cable and the return spring was at rest. This was clearly indicative of a closed throttle, and if jammed, the cable was jammed at the closed throttle position. Further, the post impact fire, which melted the accelerator outer sheath, would have a gluing effect on the cable, meaning that the only way to determine throttle and cable position, was to measure the protruding inner cable. The photographs did not show any inner cable protrusion at the pedal end of the cable consistent with an open throttle.19 On the hearing of the appeal the court permitted cross-examination of Mr Wingrove and Constable Lee. During Mr Wingrove’s evidence he agreed that he could have examined the engine prior to the trial but he had not been asked to do so by the defence. He said that originally he had not been retained to look at the engine. With reference to Constable Thompson’s statement (para 9) that the accelerator pedal was jammed against the kick panel, he said that he checked whether the pedal was jammed. He agreed that he did not check Constable Thompson’s statement that he found the offside fuel bank throttle assembly to be free, at rest and under its own spring tension. He did not check this until well after the trial concluded. He said that he could have checked this before the trial ‘if it was an integral part of what I was asked to investigate’. In cross-examination before us, Mr Wingrove also agreed that the cable could have been damaged by the fire. Indeed, he accepted that he was unable to say how the cable had been damaged. 
      
       
     20 Mr Wingrove also said that the fuel injection which he recently inspected, being part of the cylinder head, had been removed from the engine. He did not know when or how it was removed, or indeed why it was removed. He did not know whether the damage which he had seen had been caused by its removal from the engine. In further evidence about this, he said that the fire damage could be relevant in that it may indicate that the damage may have pre-dated the accident, although he added ‘I have got no clear idea’. 
      
       
     21 On behalf of the appellant Mr Odgers SC submits that the particular evidence of Mr Wingrove is fresh evidence. It was not evidence which was actually available to the appellant at the trial or which could have been available to the appellant by the exercise of reasonable diligence in the preparation of his case. 
      
       
     22 On the other hand, Mr Lamprati, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, submits that the particular evidence would have been available at trial if due diligence had been exercised.23 In Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 517 Barwick CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         … It will not become an unfair trial because the accused of his own volition has not called evidence which was available to him at the time of his trial, or of which, bearing in mind his circumstances as an accused, he could reasonably have been expected to have become aware and which he could have been able to produce at the trial. 
         
        
       
     24 On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that Mr Wingrove only appreciated the significance of Constable Thompson’s evidence after the trial was over. He then suggested to the defence that it would be advisable for him to look at the engine. 
      
       
     25 Mr Odgers further submits that if the evidence had been available at the trial there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301). See also Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392.  
      
       
     26 In Mickelberg Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that in essence the fresh evidence must be such that, viewed with the evidence given at the trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. The rationale for the rule is a miscarriage of justice and it is for the appellant to persuade the court that the absence of the evidence led to a miscarriage, see R v AT [2000] NSWCCA 342 at [50] and R v Hemsley (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 December 1995). 
      
       
     27 In my opinion the particular evidence relied on by the appellant from Mr Wingrove was evidence which would have been available at the trial if due diligence had been exercised. 
      
       
     28 Mr Wingrove was an expert. He was retained by the appellant to provide a report and give evidence at the trial. Amongst the material he had in his brief was the statement by Constable Thompson, in particular paragraph 9. Constable Thompson’s evidence at the trial was in accordance with the statement. Constable Thompson testified that: 
      
       
        
         
         I examined the accelerator throttle assembly and found the pedal to be jammed due to collision and fire damage. I found the offside fuel bank throttle assembly to be free at rest and under its own spring tension. … I found that the throttle movement was normal, the spring made the throttle come back to rest when it was operated so that there was no sign of jamming or anything untoward on that side of the engine. So it effectively operated normally. 
         
        
       
     29 It was plain that Constable Thompson had carried out an inspection of the engine as well as all of the other parts of the vehicle. The constable’s statement and evidence should have alerted Mr Wingrove to inspect the engine. He did not do so and his reason for not so doing is unpersuasive. 
      
       
     30 By the time that Mr Wingrove did inspect the engine, or rather a part of it, another year had passed after the trial was over. Moreover, it is quite possible that the condition of the item in question had changed in the period which elapsed between the accident in September 1998, when Constable Thompson examined the engine, and July 2001 when Mr Wingrove saw it. The part had been dismantled from the engine under circumstances unknown to Mr Wingrove and he could not know if it had been damaged in that process. 
      
       
     31 The exercise of due diligence, it seems to me, would have required that the expert examine both the wreck and the separated engine prior to the trial. Without such, he was not in a position to meet Constable Thompson’s opinion mentioned above. It is very difficult to accept his ‘excuse’ that it was not a ‘live issue’ at the trial. The explanation provided by Mr Wingrove remains unconvincing. 
      
       
     32 I would reject the fresh evidence since, with reasonable diligence, it could have been available. However, even if the fresh evidence was permitted, it is doubted that it could be concluded that with it there was a significant possibility that the jury would have acquitted the appellant.33 I say this because the fresh evidence is of doubtful quality. That much is apparent from the cross-examination of Mr Wingrove and the evidence of Constable Lee on the appeal. There is doubt as to whether the injection assembly part examined by Mr Wingrove last year was, leaving aside fire damage, in the same condition as it was when the accident occurred and when it was examined by Constable Thompson shortly thereafter. After all, the court (and Mr Wingrove) are not aware of the circumstances in which it had been dismantled from the engine. Mr Wingrove was candid in his evidence when he said that he really could not say when the damage was caused to it. As the Crown Prosecutor observed, we are not talking about comparing oranges with oranges, but oranges with apples. 
      
       
     34 It may also be observed that the vehicle was seen travelling at a very high speed for a considerable distance prior to the accident. It is difficult to see how the jury might have concluded that the appellant lost control because of a jammed accelerator cable. 
      
       
     35 I do not think that it may be concluded that, if the fresh evidence in Mr Wingrove’s affidavit had been before the jury, there was a significant possibility that the jury would have acquitted the appellant. 
      
       
     36 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Appeal against Sentence 
        
       
     37 The appellant submits that the sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years was excessive. At the time of the offence the maximum penalty was 7 years. 
      
       
     38 According to the sentencing statistics provided to the court by the Crown, this was the highest sentence out of 22 convictions for the offence. Similarly the non-parole period was the highest. So, this was not a sentence at the top of the range, it set the range. 
      
       
     39 The court has been provided with a large number of judgments of the court for offences under this provision and also for dangerous driving occasioning death (maximum penalty 10 years). Many of them contain significantly aggravating features such as very high blood alcohol readings and ingestion of drugs. 
      
       
     40 Even allowing for double jeopardy aspects on appeals, it is impossible to comprehend how this case, serious as it is, was the worst or one of the two worst cases of its kind.  
      
       
     41 Although speed was an aggravating factor here, there was no involvement of alcohol or drugs. It is true that the applicant had a bad record for traffic offences over many years, including repeated speeding offences. Further, he was unlicensed at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     42 Although excessive speed aggravated the offence (and excessive speed seems to have occurred over a considerable distance of roadway) when all of the objective circumstances are taken into account, the sentence must be seen as a manifestly excessive one. Not only was there no involvement of drugs or alcohol, but this was not a case of competitive driving or of ignoring warnings. It was driving at a dangerous speed in the circumstances and it was the excessive speed which lead to the applicant losing control and crossing the medium strip to collide with the Volvo. 
      
       
     43 In my view, leave to appeal the sentence should be granted and the appeal against sentence upheld. Accordingly, it is necessary to re-sentence the appellant. 
      
       
     44 Taking account of the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the appellant, a sentence of 4 years imprisonment is appropriate. 
      
       
     45 There is a question as from what date the sentence should commence. His Honour commenced the sentence on 3 July 2000. However, it appears to be common ground that there were two periods prior to 3 July 2000 when the appellant was in custody on other charges with respect to which he was subsequently acquitted. The periods total 4 months. That custody was not related to the dangerous driving charge for which he was on bail. In the circumstances it would not be unreasonable to backdate the sentence to 3 March 2000. I do not understand the Crown to really oppose the backdating.  
      
       
     46 The next question is whether the non-parole period should be 3 years or whether there are special circumstances. The only circumstance relied on is that the appellant has been classified as an extreme high security inmate since mid 2001. This has significant consequences for access visits, employment and isolation. His access to prison facilities is severely restricted and there is no doubt that the experience is a harsher one than the normal situation. Nonetheless, the court does not know when the appellant might have his classification re-assessed. 
      
       
     47 I am not satisfied that his present classification constitutes a special circumstance under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 such as to justify a non-parole period of less then three-quarters of the term of the sentence. I would therefore fix a non-parole period of 3 years so that the appellant will be eligible for release to parole from or after 2 March 2003. 
      
       
     48 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted and the appeal allowed. 
        
        
       3. Set aside the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and, in lieu thereof, the appellant is sentenced to 4 years imprisonment to date from 3 March 2000 and to expire on 2 March 2004. I set a non-parole period of 3 years to date from the commencement of the sentence on 3 March 2000 and to expire on 2 March 2003. 
       
     49 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Stein JA in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour’s reasons. 
      
       
     50 BUDDIN J: I agree with Stein JA.

 v 
  
  
 The Director-General  
  
 of the Department of Fair Trading 
  
 Respondent 
 
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
  
 
 
 
A question of character 
 
 
1.  
This case is about whether the applicant, Mr A D McEvoy, is a person of good character. 
 
  
 
2.  
The applicant appeals under section 23 of the Valuers Registration Act 1975 against the decision of the respondent to refuse his application to be registered as a practicing real estate valuer. The applicant has the necessary formal qualifications to be registered, namely a degree of Bachelor of Commerce with major studies in Land Economy from the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury. His application was refused on the sole ground that he is not a person of good character. 
 
  
 
  
 
  
The requirements of the Act 
 
  
 
3.  
Section 15 of the Valuers Registration Act 1975 relevantly provides as follows: 
 
  
 
  
(1) Where, on receipt of an application under section 13(1) from a person 
 
 to be registered as a practising real estate valuer, The Director- General is satisfied that: 
 
  
   (a) the person is of good character; 
   
    
     (b) the person: 
     
     (i) has successfully completed both a course of study approved by the Minister and a prescribed period of training in valuing land, whether situated within New South Wales or elsewhere, at a standard approved by the Director-General; or 
     
      
       (ii) was, at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the person’s application, a registered real estate valuer and satisfies such requirements, if any, with respect to valuing land, determined by the Director-General for the purposes of this subparagraph; and 
       
       (c) the person is sufficiently experienced and competent in valuing 
      
     
     land, whether situated within New South Wales or elsewhere, to be able, by himself or herself, to value properly all classes of land, 
     
      
       the Director-General shall cause that person to be registered as a practising real estate valuer. 
      
     
    
   
    
   
   (2) Where, on receipt of an application under section 13(1) from a person 
   
   to be registered as a practising real estate valuer, the Director-General, in respect of the person: 
   
    
     (a) is satisfied as to matters referred to in subsection (1) (a)  
     
     and (b) (i) or(ii); and 
     
      
       (b) is not satisfied as to the matter referred to in subsection (1) (c), 
      
     
     the Director-General shall: 
    
   
   (c) cause that person to be registered as a practising real estate 
   
    
      
     valuer subject to such limitation on that person’s right to practise as the Director-General thinks fit;... 
      
     
      
    
   
  
 
4.  
Section 16 provides that the registration of a person as a valuer remains in force for a period of one year, but may be renewed for a like period. Sub-section 23 (1) provides for an appeal to the court by a person aggrieved by a decision of the respondent with respect to an application for registration or an application for renewal of registration. By sub-section 23 (2) an appeal under sub-section 23 (1) is a rehearing. 
 
  
 
  
The relevant facts 
 
  
 
5.  
The applicant is twenty four years old. After completing his Higher School Certificate in 1993 he commenced his university course in 1994. In 1995 he deferred his university course for two years. Following the resumption of his course he completed it in 1999 and was awarded his degree on 12 May 2000.  
 
  
 
6.  
The applicant’s father owned a video store for several years. The applicant worked in the store for several years until some time in 1998 when his parents separated and his father was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a consequence of his admission to the psychiatric hospital the applicant’s father was not bringing in any income. The applicant’s mother was working and the applicant worked to assist in supporting the family, which includes a younger sister (now aged 19) and two brothers (now aged 18 and 11). At the present time the applicant is employed by Australia Pacific Property Consultants and Valuers as a property researcher (for approximately forty hours per week). He also works seven nights a week as a courier for Cuisine Couriers (for about thirty five hours per week) and on weekends works (for about two hours) for Always Better Cleaners.  
 
  
 
7.  
Whilst obtaining his degree the applicant worked part-time in either his father’s video store or in another video store and also worked about ten to fifteen hours a week in a cleaning business. Whilst at university he was also a member of the Students Representative Council, on which he was occupied for between five and ten hours a week. 
 
  
 
8.  
The applicant’s father was also in partnership in a discount store at Seven Hills with Mr G Denning. In February 1999 the applicant was employed in the discount store whilst his father was in the psychiatric hospital. On 23 April 1999 the applicant was convicted of stealing of sum of money from the daily takings at the store. The relevant facts relating to this incident are set out in the Facts Sheet tendered to the Local Court. 
 
  
 
  
    
  The victim and the defendant’s father are business partners. The defendant’s father usually worked at their joint owned shop situated at Shop 54 The Hills Shopping Complex Seven Hills. The victim runs another business at Salamander Bay, but does the purchasing of stock for the shop at Seven Hills. During early March 1999, the defendant’s father was hospitalised. The victim offered the defendant part-time work to run the store at Seven Hills by himself Sun, Mon, Wed, Thur & Fridays. The defendant was given permission to take $40 for working Sundays and $50 each week day from the store’s daily takings. The defendant worked Sunday the 14th of March, Monday the 15th of March and Wednesday the 16th of March 1999. The week’s takings were placed in a drawer underneath the till for the victim to collect. About 10.00 am Thursday the 18th of March 1999, the victim arrived at his store at Seven Hills and found it was not opened. The victim opened the store himself and was informed by a Security Officer that the defendant was in a video shop within the shopping complex. The victim then went and spoke to the defendant. The defendant admitted to the victim that he had taken the store’s takings. Both the victim and the defendant returned to the store where the victim called the Police. The defendant then accompanied the victim to Blacktown Police Station where he was interviewed. The defendant made full admissions to taking $1,400 in cash from the store without permission. The defendant informed Police that he had gone to the Hotel beside the Seven Hills Shopping Complex after closing the store on Wednesday the 17th of March 1999 and had began drinking with friends and using the poker machines. The defendant stated he had run out of money so about 6.30 pm went back to the store and removed the takings for the previous four days totalling approximately $1,400 and returned to the hotel. The defendant stated he had given $250 to a friend to pay off a gambling debt and had spent the rest of the money playing the poker machines and drinking. 
   
   The defendant stated he is addicted to gambling on the poker machines and has committed similar offences prior whilst working for other companies though the matters were not reported to Police. He expressed remorse to the victim and Police for his actions and agreed he requires help for his addiction. 
   
    
   
   The victim is asking compensation for the amount of $1,400 to replace stock and pay outstanding accounts at the Seven Hills Store. 
   
    
  
 
9.  
The Local Court Magistrate convicted the applicant of the offence of stealing property, but did not pass sentence, instead releasing him upon an entering into a bond for two years. The conditions of the bond are as follows: 
 
  
 
  
    
  1. To be of good behaviour. 
  
  
   2. To accept the supervision and guidance of an Officer of the NSW  
   
   Probation Service, and obey all reasonable directions of such officer for such period of the bond as that officer considers necessary. 
   
   3. To pay in total compensation of $1,400 to victim named in charge. 
   
   4. To continue counselling and attendance at Gamblers Anonymous for at 
   
   least six months. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
10.  
In accordance with the conditions of the bond the applicant (a) repaid the sum of $1,400 in instalments over about one year, the last payment being made in about March or April this year; (b) attended addictions meetings once a night for nine weeks at Parramatta Probation and Parol Service; and (c) attended meetings of Gamblers Anonymous once a week for six months. In addition the applicant attended counselling at Baulkham Hills Community Centre fortnightly for six months and attended further counselling at Blacktown Anglican Church. The applicant said in evidence that he found the addictions meetings very beneficial but the Gamblers Anonymous meetings were less so. He admits that he had a gambling problem but says that he has not gambled since his conviction. The applicant’s probation officer has furnished a letter which states that termination of the applicant’s supervision by the Service has been approved, but the other conditions of the bond remain until it expires on 22 April 2001. 
 
  
 
11.  
The applicant is not unaccustomed to being trusted with relatively large sums of cash. As noted above, he was previously worked for several years in a video store owned by his father, in which he handled cash takings which ranged from about $6,000 to $12,000 every day. He said in evidence that on one occasion he overpaid himself $1,000 and which he then repaid to his father.  
 
  
 
12.  
On 1 March 2000 the applicant was offered a position as Assistant Valuer with Australian Pacific Property Consultants and Valuers. One of the conditions of his employment is that he secures registration as a valuer. As noted above, the applicant is presently employed by that firm as a property researcher pending his registration as a valuer. Mr G B Roper, Managing Director of that firm, has furnished a reference in which he acknowledges that he is aware of the applicant’s conviction for stealing. Mr Roper comments favourably on the applicant’s enthusiasm and dedication to his duties and observes that the applicant does not appear to be a repeat offender. Mr Roper concludes by stating that whilst he would like to retain the applicant, without registration he becomes a financial luxury which he cannot afford. 
 
  
 
13.  
On 8 March 2000 the applicant completed an application form for registration as a real estate valuer and lodged it with the respondent. The application form contains a number of questions. Question (ii) on the application form is: 
 
  
 
  
Have you been convicted of any offence or had any offence proved against you under any Act or regulation, including the Valuers Registration Act 1975? (Excluding minor traffic offences) 
 
  
    
  
 
14.  
The applicant answered this question  
“Yes” 
 and disclosed the conviction for stealing. He attached to the form a statement setting out the circumstances of the conviction and included a number of character references. In his statement, setting out the circumstances of the conviction, the applicant states: 
 
  
 
  
    
  At the time I was under a large degree of pressure as my parents were in the process of separation and have since filed for divorce. This is after I was brought up in a stable and loving environment for almost 23 years. 
   
    
      
    
   
    
  My father and his partner were in ownership of this business in Seven Hills where I was employed as a part time casual. My father then incurred hospitalisation for several months in a recovery unit at Westmead Hospital because of a mental psychosis disorder (aggressive and controlling personality) which he has still today and was not able to support the family financially when he flat walked out of home and left my family. 
   
   ... 
   
   At the time of the offence occurred, my mother was struggling to pay various expenses at home, including to send my two younger brothers to school in a proper uniform. I felt that I had to support the family in any way I could although I soon realised that committing the offence quickly made things even worse than they were already. It was and still remains a complete aberration of my character and one for which I am deeply ashamed. 
   
   … 
   
   I am working hard to right the wrong I have done and continue to successfully re-establish my credibility. 
   
   … 
   
   I have supplied two credible contactable references, which are respected people, aware of what I have done but who continue to believe in me because it was very out of character for me to ever do something like this. I never ever intend to do anything of this nature in the future and it is my strong desire to represent the role of real estate valuer with the utmost of respect and integrity.. 
   
    
  
 
15.  
In answering question (ii) on the application form the applicant failed to disclose two convictions at Nowra Local court on 22 May 1995 for possession of a prohibited drug and for self administration of a prohibited drug. Those offences occurred on 9 February 1995. The Magistrate found each charge proved but dismissed the charges under section 556A of the Crimes Act 1900. The applicant said in his evidence before me that the prohibited drug was a dexamphetamine which he took whilst in the company of a friend. The friend had taken a substantial quantity of the drug and as a consequence the friend’s erratic behaviour drew attention to both of them. The applicant also said of this incident that his friend knew somebody who had the drug, that he (the applicant) “ 
was pretty young, I was nineteen and I just sort of took it without thinking 
.” The applicant says that he did not disclose this conviction because he thought that the dismissal of a charge under section 556A of the Crimes Act was not a conviction. He now accepts that this understanding was mistaken. 
 
  
 
16.  
Question (iii) on the application form is: 
 
  
 
  
Have you been disqualified or suspended from holding any licence, permit or certificate? 
 
  
    
  
 
 To this question the applicant answered  
“No 
”. On 20 May 1996, however, the applicant had been convicted at Parramatta Local court of dangerous driving, was fined $600 and disqualified from driving for nine months. The applicant’s answer to question (iii) was clearly wrong. He explained his answer in evidence by stating that he misunderstood the question: he thought it related to something of relevance to his application such as a real estate licence, or auctioneer’s licence or the like. 
 
  
 
17.  
In addition to a number of written references the applicant called two character witnesses. One of those witnesses, Mr D C M Norman, is a family friend who has known the applicant and the applicant’s family since the applicant was about six years old. The two families had initially met through their sons and have remained close friends. Mr Norman described the applicant as a respectful, forthright; and he was delighted that his son had a friend of his character. He said that the separation of the applicant’s parents and the admission of the applicant’s father to a psychiatric hospital had a significant impact upon the applicant. He said that it is his belief that the applicant was not thinking properly at that time. He further said in evidence: 
 
  
 
  
I feel his conduct is explained by his family problems at the time. There was so much trauma in the family. That external stimulus is no longer present. The applicant has had a huge wake-up call. The support of his family was not available. 
 
  
   
    
      
    
   
    
  The submissions of the parties 
   
    
  
 
18.  
Mr J A Breene, who appears for the applicant, submits that the test of good character is in the context of an applicant seeking registration as a practising real estate valuer subject to limitations pursuant to section 15 (2) of the Valuers Registration Act, since he has not had the necessary practical experience, coupled with the fact that registration must be renewed annually. The test of good character is, in his submission, one which must be determined at the date of assessment of the application for registration, which is today. Mr Breene relies upon the fact that the applicant has satisfied all the conditions of the bond, including repayment of the money and upon his rehabilitation since the offence. Mr Breene notes that the other offences are not offences of dishonesty. 
 
  
    
  
 
19.  
Mr P J Bambagiotti, who appears for the respondent, made the following submissions. (1) The registration of a person as a valuer amounts to a holding out by the respondent that he is a person of good character. In the present case the bond relates to a crime of dishonesty and is still current. (2) Members of the public would assume by his registration as a valuer that the applicant is a person of good character, where his conviction for dishonesty was reasonably proximate to the present time, occurring only a little more then a year ago. (3) The applicant has had a history of a gambling addiction, alcohol abuse and the use of illegal drugs, which suggests that one could not be satisfied that the applicant can control himself. (4) Of the greatest concern is the applicant’s failure to disclose the prior drug offences and the disqualification from driving. The respondent relies upon applicants who fill in the application form for registration to display candour and honesty, which was lacking in the present instance. Mr Bambagiotti supported his submissions by reference to a number of decided cases on the question of good character, some of which I discuss below. 
 
  
    
   
    
  Good character 
   
    
  
 
20.  
Section 15 of the Valuers Registration Act prescribes good character as a threshold question. Unless an applicant for registration satisfies the test of good character then he or she cannot be considered for registration as a real estate valuer. The concept of good character has been the subject of a number of decided cases, some of which I refer below. 
 
  
    
  
 
21.  
In  
Re Arnold 
 (1932) 11 LVR 14, Pike J considered an application by a person to be registered as a land agent. Section 4 of the Land Agents Act 1927 provided that no person shall be qualified to be registered if he does not satisfy the court as to his good fame and character. Pike J said (at 14): 
 
  
    
   
    
  I think the same principles should be applied in an application by a person to be registered as a land agent as are applied by the Supreme Court when dealing with either applicants to be admitted as articled clerks or applications by solicitors, who have been struck off the role, to be re-admitted to the roll. The Court acts in order that the public may be protected and that persons who receive the imprimatur of the Court should be such that the Court can fairly recommend them to the public as honest persons in whom confidence may be reposed. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
22.  
In  
Re Davis 
 (1947) 75 CLR 409, the appellant was admitted as a barrister by the Supreme Court of NSW but had failed to disclose to the Barristers Admission Board or to the Court that he had some years earlier pleaded guilty to and been convicted of breaking and entering a dwelling-house and stealing articles of jewellery and clothing therein, for which offence he was released on a bond to be a good behaviour for three years. The appellant had produced certificates of good fame and character from two solicitors who did not know that he had been so convicted. The Legal Practitioners Act 1898 provided that:  
 
  
    
   
    
  No candidate, however qualified in other respects, shall be admitted as a barrister unless the Board is satisfied that he is of good fame and character. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
23.  
In considering the question of good fame and character Latham CJ said (at 416-417): 
 
  
    
  But intrinsic character is a different matter. A man may be guilty of grave wrongdoing and may subsequently become a man of good character. If the appellant had frankly disclosed to the Board and to the two solicitors the fact of his conviction, that disclosure would have greatly assisted him in an endeavour to show that he had retrieved his character. But his failure to make such disclosure in itself, apart from the conviction, excludes any possibility of holding that he was in 1946, or had become in 1947, a man a good character. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
24.  
Dixon J, after referring to the facts of the case, including the fact that since 1934 the appellant had led a life of scrupulous honesty, said (at 426): 
 
  
    
   
    
     
      
        
      He has shown industry, perseverance and courage amidst the most adverse circumstances, and has overcome many disadvantages and obstacles encountered particularly in his early years. His mental breakdown and even his descent into criminality will evoke much human sympathy. It is always so upon moral questions, particularly when a man, whose conduct or actions have been in many respects praiseworthy, mars his life by a crime. 
      
       
      
       But, though concern for an individual who is overtaken by the consequences of past wrongdoing is a very proper human feeling, it is no reason whatever for impairing in his interests the standards of a profession which plays so indispensable a part in the administration of justice.  
      
     
     ... 
     
     But a prerequisite, in any case, would be a complete realisation by the party concerned of his obligation of candour to the court in which he desired to serve as an agent of justice. The fulfilment of that obligation of candour with its attendant risks proved too painful for the appellant, and when he applied to the Board for his certificate he withheld the fact that he had been convicted.  
     
      
    
   
  
 
25.  
In  
Sakellis v Officer in Charge of Police, Paddington 
 (1968) 2 DCR (NSW) 3, a person applied for a license as a commercial subagent. The applicant was required to satisfy the court under the relevant legislation that he was,  
inter alia 
, of good fame and character, that he was a fit a proper person to hold a license and, subject to sub-section 13 (2) of the Act, had not been convicted of an offence punishable on indictment. Sub-section 13(2) of the Commercial Agents and Private Inquiry Agents Act 1963 provided,  
inter alia 
, that where, in dealing with an application, the court is satisfied that the applicant has been convicted of an offence punishable on indictment, it may grant the application if, in the opinion of the court, the offence is such that, either from its nature or from the circumstances in which it was committed, it ought not, having regard to the public interest, to disqualify the applicant from being or acting as a subagent. The applicant had some twelve months previously pleaded guilty to breaking, entering and stealing from his employer. The applicant said that he was driven to it by emotional and financial strain resulting from domestic difficulties. The applicant had been placed upon a bond to be of good behaviour for three years and was further required to place himself under the supervision and guidance of the Adult Probation Officers. The bond was still current when his application for a license was considered. 
 
  
    
  
 
26.  
Henchman DCJ referred to  
Ex parte Davis 
 (1949) 50 SR (NSW) 158, in which Herron J said (at 167): 
 
  
    
   
    
  It would be difficult indeed that a man who was convicted of breaking, entering and stealing could be regarded as a man of good character at the present time. It seems to me that generally speaking, a man who commits a serious crime may thereby forfeit privileges which are thereby available to honest men. One of these privileges is the entry into a profession which is in the public eye. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
27.  
In holding that the applicant was not a person of good fame and character, Henchman DCJ said (at 9): 
 
  
    
   
    
     
       
     I cannot agree with the applicant’s counsel’s submission that there can be a different standard of honesty in different occupations. A man is either honest or he is not, and in my view if he is not, he is unfit for any licence of the present type granted by the public. This not to say a man convicted once on a crime involving dishonesty may never again be a fit and proper person to hold a licence, ... . 
      
       
        ... 
       
      
     
     Among the functions he is to perform is the swearing of affidavits for the information of courts and the giving of evidence. It is unthinkable that a person should be certified by a court as a suitable person for a licence if that person were to have to admit in cross-examination in a court that he has been convicted of breaking, entering and stealing and was still under a bond in respect to that offence.

In  
Law Society of NSW v Foreman 
 (1994) 34 NSWLR 408, Mahoney JA defined character as follows (at 449): 
 
  
    
   
    
  Character involves, inter alia, two thing: the acceptance of high standards of conduct; and acting in accordance with those standards under pressure. Character is tested not by what one does in good times but in bad. 
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
29.  
In  
Re Habis 
 (The Licensing Court of NSW, 9 July 1998, unreported) a Licensing Magistrate refused an application by a person for a certificate of registration as a real estate salesperson where the applicant had pleaded guilty some nine months previously to stealing money from his employer. That was the same offence for which the applicant in the present was convicted. The sum stolen in  
Habis  
was a larger amount, namely $8,983. The applicant in that case had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 100 hours community service and placed upon a bond for two years to be of good behaviour and to accept the supervision and guidance of the NSW Probation Service. Section 57.8 of the Property Stock and Business Agent’s Act 1941 provided that a certificate of registration shall not be issued to an applicant who is not of good fame and character or who is not otherwise a fit and proper person to hold a certificate of registration. The Licensing Magistrate said : 
 
  
    
   
    
  The fact that there is less than one year elapsed from the date that the matters were finally disposed of is not a sufficient period of time to permit Mr Habis to satisfy this Court that he is a person in whom the trust of the Court can be reposed and a suitable person to be granted or a fit and proper person to be granted the certificate which he seeks. 
   
    
      
     
      
    Conclusions 
    
   
    
  
 
30.  
In my opinion the application for registration as a valuer should be refused. I have come to this opinion for the following reasons. 
 
  
    
  
 
31.  
Firstly 
, the nature of the profession for which the applicant seeks registration is, I think, a relevant consideration. A registered valuer is sometimes required to prepare valuation reports which may be contrary to interest of those who have engaged the valuer’s services. The requirement that a registered valuer be a person of good character is necessary to ensure that he or she is able to resist any pressure from those whose interests may be contrary to the valuer’s true opinion. 
 
  
    
  
 
32.  
Registered valuers also give expert evidence in the court. They are in the privileged position of expert witnesses, being permitted to give evidence of opinion (section 76 Evidence Act 1995). That is something which non-experts are not generally permitted to do. Expert witnesses in the court are subject to the Expert Witness Practice Direction 1999, which includes the following statement: 
 
  
    
   
    
  An expert witness’s paramount duty is to assist the court impartially. That duty overrides the expert witness’s obligation to the engaging party. An expert witness is not an advocate for a party.  
   
    
      
    
   
  
 
33.  
These obligations show that a valuer must demonstrate both honesty and candour in the face of pressure from the engaging party to present valuation report favourable to that party’s interests. As noted by Mahoney JA in  
Law Society of NSW v Foreman 
, good character requires the individual to act in accordance with high standards of conduct when under pressure. 
 
  
    
  
 
34.  
I accept the applicant’s evidence in the present case that when he committed the offence of stealing he was under some pressure caused by his family situation, by the need to bring in an income for his family to make up for his father’s incapacity to do so; and to meet his then gambling addiction. He has, however, not demonstrated an ability to maintain a high standard of conduct when under such pressure. He has not demonstrated that he can satisfy the test described by Mahoney JA in  
Foreman. 
 
  
    
  
 
35.  
Secondly 
, the act of registration as a valuer amounts to a public certification that the person is an honest person in whom confidence can be reposed (in  
Re Arnold 
). Both the public and the court must be able to repose confidence in registered valuers and must be able to accept without question their honesty and good character. In cases of this kind greater weight must be given to the public interest and to the need to maintain public confidence in the profession than to the consequences of the imposition of a penalty to the individual ( 
Dad v General Dental Council 
 [2000] 1 WLR 1538 at 1543. PC). Entry to a profession which is in the public eye is a privilege which is reserved for those who are of good character ( 
Ex parte Davis, Sakellis 
). I do not think that a person who is still under a bond in respect of a serious criminal offence can be said to be a person of good character ( 
Sakellis 
). The seriousness of the offence in this case is illustrated by the fact that it is both an indictable offence and one which carries the maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment (section 156 Crimes Act 1900). 
 
  
    
  
 
36.  
Thirdly 
, the applicant’s failure to disclose the convictions for the two drug offences and the disqualification excludes any possibility of holding that, at the time of making his application for registration, he was a person of good character (in  
Re Davis 
). I have referred above to the applicant’s explanation for those failures. Nevertheless the applicant was convicted of the two drug offences, which are serious offences. The applicant recognised that he should disclose the stealing offence although he was placed on a bond and so also he should have recognised that he must disclose the drug offences although receiving the benefit of section 556A of the Crimes Act. As to the disqualification, the question on the application form for registration is unambiguously clear, for which there could be only one answer. The obligation of complete candour and disclosure is an important element of good character. Its absence does not give one confidence that in the course of his work as a registered valuer the applicant will not overlook in his valuation reports all relevant facts or opinions which may bear upon the question of value. Its absence suggests that the accuracy and reliability of the applicant’s work would have to be checked. 
 
  
    
  
 
37.  
For the abovementioned reasons I conclude that the applicant is not a person to be held out as being of such good character as to be registered as a real estate valuer with its attendant responsibilities, obligations and benefits. 
 
  
    
  
 
38.  
This conclusion does not necessarily mean, however that the applicant can never be registered as a real estate valuer. As in the case of  
Davis 
, who given time, was able to demonstrate that he was a person of good fame and character and ultimately obtained admission as a barrister, so too the present applicant by his subsequent conduct may likewise be able to demonstrate that he is a person of good character and he has overcome the shortcomings which he has displayed to the present time. At the present time, however, he does not satisfy that test.

   2. The Applicant’s application for registration as a real estate 
   
   valuer is refused.

 JUDGMENT 
  
 
 
HIS HONOUR:  
 
 
 
  
Introduction 
 
 
1.  
In 1941 the Royal Australian Navy constructed two large underground marine fuel oil bunkers on the eastern side of the Domain adjoining Lincoln Crescent, on the western side of Woolloomooloo Bay. The bunkers were large, each having a capacity of about 4,000,000 gallons (US) and constructed so as to be bomb-proof, with massive reinforced concrete walls and a substantial reinforced concrete roof supported by a large number of steel columns. The top of the roof was covered with turf. 
 
 
2.  
The Domain bunkers were used for the fleet base at Garden Island. There was a pumping station in Lincoln Crescent next to the bunkers and a fuel oil pipe line was laid from the pumping station under Lincoln Crescent and around the shore of Woolloomooloo Bay to the fleet base. A branch pipe line was constructed under the Finger Wharf in Woolloomooloo Bay, with further sub-branches to wharves 6 and 7 (on the eastern side of the Finger Wharf) and wharves 8 and 9 (on the western side of the Finger Wharf).  
 
 
3.  
In 1993 the State Government decided to allow an exclusive private development of the Finger Wharf, together with wharf 11 (which lies between Lincoln Crescent and the bay). It did so by way of a development agreement dated 24 August 1993 made between the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales (as it was then called) in its capacity as landowner and a developer, Wedderlight-Delmo Pty Ltd. By the development agreement the Maritime Services Board granted to the developer the exclusive right to develop and manage the re-development of both wharf 11 and the Finger Wharf into a mix of residential units, shops and a hotel, together with an associated marina. The agreement provides for the strata subdivision of the completed project and leases of the separate lots and common property for a term of 99 years from the lease commencement date.  
 
 
4.  
The decision of the State Government to lease the public waters of Woolloomooloo Bay for an exclusive private development is somewhat surprising. (The exclusive nature of the development is illustrated by the recent sale of one unit at the end of the Finger Wharf for, I understand, $9,000,000.) The redevelopment involved replacing almost every stick of timber in the Finger Wharf. In particular, it involved the replacement of the existing timber piles and headstocks (or bearers) upon which stood the structure of the wharf.  
 
 
5.  
As a result of a novation agreement dated 15 December 1994, a change of company name and the enactment of the Ports Corporation and Waterways Management Act 1995, the parties to the development agreement became the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation in lieu of the Maritime Services Board (as owner of the area to be developed at Woolloomooloo Bay) and relevantly the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd in lieu of Wedderlight-Delmo Pty Ltd.  
 
 
6.  
The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd is a company in which Walker Corporation Ltd owns 50% of the shares and Masklyon Pty Ltd, a company controlled by Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd (“the defendant”), owns the remaining 50% of the shares. The development is in essence a joint venture between Walker Corporation Ltd and the defendant.  
 
 
7.  
By an agreement dated 31 October 1997, which is not in evidence, the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd engaged Wharf Developments Pty Ltd to design, construct and complete the works which are the subject of the development agreement.  
 
 
8.  
Wharf Developments Pty Ltd as principal entered into two agreements with the defendant as contractor. The first agreement was for services diversion and early work (“the early works agreement”). The early works agreement which was tendered in evidence is undated, but it provides that the contractor shall commence the works on 19 May 1997.  
 
 
9.  
The second agreement, which was also tendered in evidence, is also undated but appears to have been made on or about 31 October 1997 (“the design and construct contract”). Under the design and construct contract the principal engaged the contractor to design, construct and complete the works to satisfy the obligations of the principal to the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd. The relationship between the early works agreement and the design and construct contract is explained by clause 65 of the latter: 
 
 
  
  The parties agree that the Contract applies retrospectively to all work undertaken by the Contractor which is work under the Contract and applies whether the work was undertaken (or should have been undertaken) prior to or after the date of this Contract. 
   
   
  .... 
   
   
   
  The parties acknowledge that: 
   
   
  (a) by letter dated 29 August 1997 they entered into an agreement for the performance by the Contractor of certain early works, including service diversions (“the Early 
    
  Works”); 
   
   
  (b) the Early Works form part of the work under the Contract to be performed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract; 
   
   
  (c) the agreement between the parties for the Early Works is determined at the date of this contract and the parties shall have no further rights, entitlements, liabilities or obligations under that agreement (including accrued rights or liabilities) and the rights, entitlements, liabilities and obligations of the parties with respect to the Early Works are from the date of the Contract governed exclusively by the Contract; ... 
   
   
  
 
10. A 
 subcontract agreement dated 5 December 1997 was made between the defendant as contractor and McConnell Dowell Constructors (Australia) Pty Ltd (“McConnell Dowell”) as subcontractor. The subcontract agreement describes the following works to be performed by McConnell Dowell under the heading “ 
Description of works 
”: 
 
 
  
  Provide labour, materials and equipment so as to replace and modify the wharf at Woolloomooloo sub-structure including but not limited to demolition, construction and reinstatement of existing piles, apron structure, pool piles, plant room, roadway restoration and the like all in accordance with performance specification drawing and contract documents. 
   
   
  
 
11.  
Although the subcontract agreement is dated 5 December 1997, it was signed on 12 December 1997 and the date for its commencement is stated as being 3 November 1997. By clause 36 thereof the subcontract applies retrospectively to all work undertaken by McConnell Dowell, being work under the subcontract, whether undertaken prior to or after the date of the subcontract.  
 
 
12.  
McConnell Dowell entered into what might be described as a sub-subcontract with a demolition contractor, Moltoni Corporation Pty Ltd (“Moltoni”) for the demolition and disposal of the Finger Wharf deck, the supporting headstocks and girders and the underdeck piping. Moltoni was also to dispose of the timber piles after they had been extracted by others. This sub-subcontract was entered into as a result of conversations and correspondence which took place between Mr Craig Beveridge of McConnell Dowell and Mr R C Moltoni of Moltoni between June 1997 and 7 November 1997.  
 
 
13.  
On 25 February 1998 Mr C Manihera, a workman employed by Moltoni, was operating a demolition excavator on the Finger Wharf to remove headstocks and bearers. In the course of removing a headstock, a section of the pipe under the wharf was knocked and then fell into the water. The pipe contained oil, which also spilled into the water. The quantity of oil which spilled into the water has been variously estimated at between 30,000 and 90,000 litres. For reasons to which I later refer, I find that the quantity of oil that went into the water was probably about 40,000 litres. 
 
 
The Charge 
 
 
14.  
The defendant is charged with an offence against the Environmental Offences & Penalties Act 1989 in that it did pollute waters contrary to s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. The defendant admits that there was an act of pollution of the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay. The defendant denies, however, that  
it 
 polluted the waters. The defendant denies liability for the act of an employee of a sub-subcontractor to a subcontractor. This is the first case of which I am aware in which a criminal charge has been brought against a defendant which is three entities removed from the act itself. None of the many authorities cited by counsel are cases in which liability has been found to exist in circumstances such as this.  
 
 
15.  
I set out s 16 of the Clean Waters Act so far as is relevant. The deeming provision in subsection (2) of s 16 is also relied upon by the prosecutor:  
 
 
  
  Prohibition of pollution of waters 
   
   
  16.(1) A person shall not pollute any waters. 
   
   
   (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be deemed to pollute waters if: 
   
   
    
    (a) the person places any matter (whether solid, liquid, or gaseous) in a position where: 
     
     
      
      (i) it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates; or 
       
       
      (ii) it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate, 
       
       
      into any waters, on to the dry bed of any waters, or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or causes or permits any such matter to be placed on such a dry bed in such a drain, channel or gutter, 
       
      
     
    and the matter would, had it been placed in any waters have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters. 
     
    
   
  ... 
   
   
  (7) Any person who contravenes the provisions of this section is guilty of an offence against the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989. 
   
   
  
 
16.  
The prosecutor identified five issues, any one of which, it is submitted, if resolved beyond a reasonable doubt in favour of the prosecutor makes the defendant guilty of the offence. The five issues, as I understand them, which the prosecutor submits are each satisfied are as follows: 
 
 
  
  (i) The defendant was directly responsible for the offence by reason of the control exercised by it over the works which were being carried out on the wharf. Such control was exercised with the knowledge that the defendant had of the existence of the pipeline and of the fact that it contained oil.  
   
   
  (ii) The defendant was the occupier of the wharf and hence the pollutant was under the control of and in the possession of the defendant, so that when the pollutant got into the water it did so as a direct result of where it is. That is to say, it was the act of the defendant which placed the pollutant in the water. The prosecutor relies in support of this issue on  
  Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
   (1974) 1 NSWLR 659.  
   
   
  (iii) The defendant is vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of McConnell Dowell and/or Moltoni and of Moltoni’s employee, Mr Manihera. 
   
   
  (iv) The deeming provision, subsection (2) of s 16, makes the defendant directly liable: the defendant either caused or permitted the pollutant to be placed in a position where it fell or descended, or was likely to fall or descend, into the water. 
   
   
  (v) The defendant was under a non-delegable duty of care to ensure that there was no pollution of the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay from pollutant in the pipe line. On this issue the prosecutor relies, in particular, on  
  Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd 
   (1994) 179 CLR 520.  
   
  
 
 
17.  
It is apparent that there is some overlapping of these issues. There is also some overlapping of the evidence which relates to each issue.  
 
 
18.  
The prosecutor concedes that no single piece of evidence adduced in this case is sufficient to establish the guilt of the defendant. The prosecutor relies upon the cumulative effect of the whole of the evidence to establish the guilt of the defendant. This includes an examination of the various contractual documents (to which I have briefly referred); other documentary material evidencing the respective roles of and arrangements between the various parties involved in the project; further documentary material which is said to evidence the control exercised by the defendant over the works; and the general conduct of the defendant both before and after the spill on 25 February 1998. The evidence is voluminous, as might be expected in a case which occupied some six weeks of hearing time. In addition to the substantial documentary evidence, there is some 1350 pages of transcript, 12 substantial affidavits, together with detailed written submissions (particularly by the defendant) and the citing by counsel of some several dozen authorities.  
 
 
  
A preliminary question of jurisdiction 
 
 
19.  
The Clean waters Act 1970 and the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 were repealed on 1 July 1999. However, liability for offences committed under legislation which is subsequently repealed continues: s 30(1) Interpretation Act 1987.  
 
 
20.  
The Court has jurisdiction under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (Chapter 8, s 215) to deal with offences against that Act. Schedule 5 of the Act (specifically clause 10) enables regulations to be made to extend Chapter 8 (with modifications, if any) to proceedings in connection with any repealed Act or Regulation (in respect of offences committed against the Act or Regulation before its repeal or in respect of any other matter that continues to have any force or effect); and those Regulations may also make provision for the continued operation of any such repealed Act or Regulation to those proceedings.  
 
 
21.  
Clause 17(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations (Savings and Transitional) Regulation 1998 extends Parts 8.2 and 8.4 of the Act (which includes s 215) to proceedings in connection with a repealed Act in respect of offences committed against a repealed Act before its repeal. This provision applies whether the proceedings were pending on the commencement of the Act (as is the present case) or whether the proceedings are instituted after that commencement. Clause 17(2) effects such modifications as are necessary for the purpose of applying those Parts to any such proceedings. 
 
 
22.  
Thus, not only does liability for offences committed under the repealed legislation continue, but the Court continues to have jurisdiction to deal with such offences.  
 
 
 
 
  
The early works agreement 
 
 
23.  
This agreement was not in force at the time of the offence. It had been replaced and superseded by the design and construct contract between Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and the defendant. I was thus inclined to the view that the early works agreement is of no relevance. The prosecutor, however, relies upon it as evidencing the control which the principal authorised the defendant to exercise over the activities on the Finger Wharf and as evidencing a continuous course of conduct by the defendant by which it exercised such control. Having regard to clause 65 of the design and construct contract (to which I have referred in paragraph 9 above) and to the purpose for which the prosecutor relies upon the early works agreement, I accept that the agreement may have some marginal relevance. 
 
 
24.  
The agreement describes the works as “ 
services diversion and early works as defined in the scope of works (Annexure “A”)” 
. Annexure “A” to the agreement and which is headed  
“Scope of Works” 
 states ( 
inter alia 
): 
 
 
  
  The Services Diversion package as described herein shall be limited to sewer diversion, stormwater diversion, electrical diversion and Telstra diversion. 
   
   
  The Early Works Package as described herein, shall be limited to wharf 11 bulk and detail excavation, wharf 11 dewatering, piling, brick retaining walls and demolition, in addition the early works package shall be deemed to include Asbestos and Hazardous Material removal from the existing Finger Wharf. 
   
   
  
 
25.  
Clause 1.0 of the Scope of Works document is headed “ 
Services Diversion 
”. The clause then states: 
 
 
  
  Simply stated, the diversions will re-route existing stormwater, sewer, Telstra and Energy Australia (33KV) around the site following the direction of Lincoln Crescent and Cowper Wharf Road. 
   
   
  
 
26.  
Clause 2.6 of the Scope of Works document is headed “ 
Asbestos and Hazardous Materials Finger Wharf 
”. The clause then states: 
 
 
  
  Generally in accordance with hazardous materials report prepared by New Environment, and date 21 May 1997, remove all hazardous material from finger wharf including, but not limited to asbestos, PCB and the like. 
   
   
  2.6.1 Prepare method statements and authority approvals including, but not limited to EPA and WorkCover Authority. 
   
   
  2.6.2 Isolate site and prepare materials including, scaffolds, decontamination centres and the prior to commencement on site. 
   
   
  2.6.3 Remove from site in an approved manner any hazardous material generally in accordance with hazardous materials. 
   
   
  2.6.4 Provide all data sheets including locations and signed transfer sheets from locations, all materials are transferred to. 
   
   
  2.6.5 Prior to disestablishment allow New Environment to inspect site and remove remaining hazardous material. 
   
   
  2.6.6 Obtain certification from New Environment that all hazardous material has been removed from site. 
   
   
  2.6.7 Disestablish site and obtain certification from EPA and WorkCover Authority of site decontamination. 
   
   
  
 
27.  
The reference in clause 2.6 to the report prepared by New Environment is a reference to a report headed “ 
Hazardous Materials Survey Report 
” prepared by New Environment Management and Technology Pty Ltd dated 21 May 1997. There is no mention in that report of oil or oil residues in any pipeline. 
 
 
28.  
Clause 2(c) of the Special Clauses of the agreement provides: 
 
 
  
  (c) In addition to complying with all relevant requirements of the Pollution Control Legislation in respect of the Works, [the defendant] must: 
   
   
    
    (i) ensure that all practical measures are taken to prevent the processes plant and equipment used in carrying out the Works from causing directly or indirectly any adverse affect or alteration of the environment; 
     
     
    ... 
     
     
    (iii) provide appropriate training and information to personnel to assist them in understanding and carrying out their responsibilities under the Pollution Control Legislation; 
     
     
    ... 
     
     
    (vi) establish a proper system (“System”) to ensure compliance with all Pollution Control Legislation by the Proprietor and its agents and subcontractors during the course of the Works and ensure that this is adequately supervised; 
     
     
    (vii) review and monitor procedures under the System to ensure that it is operating effectively and complies with the Pollution Control Legislation. 
     
     
    ... 
     
     
    
   
  
 
29.  
Clause 4 of the Special Clauses is headed “ 
Clean-up 
” and provides as follows: 
 
 
  
  If any damage or pollution of the environment occurs which are caused by the Works[ the defendant] must at the cost of the Proprietor (except if caused by a breach of the [defendant]): 
   
   
  (a) rectify the damage or pollution and undertake any clean-up operations necessary to restore the damaged or polluted area so as to comply with all Pollution Control Legislation; and 
   
   
  (b) pay any fine or damages levied under the Pollution Control Legislation or determined by any Governmental Agency. 
   
   
  
 
30.  
Clause 6 of the Special Clauses is headed “ 
Removal of Rubble etc 
” and provides as follows: 
 
 
  
  [The defendant] must clear away and remove all waste materials and rubble arising from the Works and will ensure that no waste materials, rubble, rubbish, oil, spirits or inflammable fluids are discharged into or allowed to flow into or are deposited into Woolloomooloo Bay from, or onto any land joining, the Development Area. 
   
   
  
 
31.  
It is convenient if I now set out my conclusions on the effect of the early works agreement. It is to be noted that there is no mention in clause 1.0 of the scope of works document of the diversion or re-routing of any oil pipeline. Next, clause 2.6 of the Scope of Works document requires the removal of hazardous materials from the Finger Wharf “ 
generally in accordance with the hazardous materials report prepared by New Environment, and date 21 May 1997 
” ... . Since there is no reference in that report to oil or oil residues in any pipeline there is no requirement, in my opinion, under clause 2.6 for the defendant to remove oil or oil residues from any pipeline in accordance with the hazardous material report.  
 
 
32.  
Clauses 2(c), 4 and 6 of the Special Clauses refer to obligations of the defendant in respect of, caused by, or arising out of “ 
the works 
”. The works are relevantly those described in the Scope of Works document. Those works are certain specified services diversion, which do not include any work relating to the oil pipeline, and the removal of hazardous materials under clause 2.6 in accordance with the hazardous materials report prepared by New Environment, which report contains no reference to the removal of oil or oil residues in any pipeline. I am not at all satisfied, and am certainly not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that these clauses relate to other than such work as specified in the Scope of Works document. That is to say, I am not satisfied that they impose upon the defendant any contractual obligation or responsibility for anything outside the Scope of Works, such as responsibility for oil or oil residues in the pipeline. The reference in clause 6 of the Special Clauses to oil, spirits or inflammable fluids is, I think, a reference to oil, spirits or inflammable fluids arising from the works, such as spills from or arising from the use of machinery employed in and about the works. Contrary to the prosecutor’s submission, I do not therefore regard the early works contract as having the relevance which the prosecutor suggests that it has. If it has any evidentiary value at all, it is exculpatory of the defendant.  
 
 
 
 
  
The design and construct contract 
 
 
33.  
I have briefly referred to this contract in paragraph 9 above. Clause 9 allows the contractor, with the agreement of the principal, to assign or subcontract the whole or any part of the work under the contract. Clause 9.3, a clause upon which the prosecutor relies, provides: 
 
 
  
  Agreement of tenderers, any review of the scope of works and selection of subcontractors under this clause 9 shall not relieve the contractor from any liability or obligation under the contract. Except where the contract otherwise provides, the contractor shall be liable to the principal for the acts and omissions of subcontractors and employees and agents of subcontractors as if they were acts or omissions of the contractor. 
   
   
  
 
34.  
Clause 12.1 provides that the contractor accepts total responsibility for and assumes the risk of the conditions of and relating to the site, including but not limited to physical conditions on the site or its surroundings, the existing building and “ 
hazardous chemicals, substances or other material (including but not limited to asbestos 
”. Clause 12.4 provides: 
 
 
  
  The contractor, prior to the date of the contract, was required to fully investigate the site and actual and potential site conditions. The contractor warrants that it has carried out this investigation and that the site and the existing building and other improvements on the site are suitable for the execution of the work under the contract. 
   
   
  
 
35.  
Under clause 27.1, the principal gave to the contractor access to and possession of the site. Clause 27.2 provides that the principal, the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation and the mortgagee bank and any of their agents and employees are able to have access to the site for any purpose, after giving reasonable notice to the contractor. Clause 27.2 also provides that the contractor shall permit the execution of work on site by persons engaged by the principal and shall co-operate with them and co-ordinate the contractor’s work with their work.  
 
 
36.  
Under clause 4.1(e) the contractor undertook and warranted to the principal that it would execute and complete the work so that the works, when completed, would comply with all legislative requirements. The term “legislative requirements” is defined in clause 2 as including: 
 
 
  
  (a) Acts, Ordinances, regulations, by-laws, orders, awards and proclamations of the Commonwealth and the State or Territory in which the work under the Contract or any part thereof is being carried out; 
   
   
  (b) the Building Code of Australia; 
   
   
  (c) certificates, licences, consents, permits, approvals and requirements of organisations having jurisdiction in connection with the carrying out of the work under the Contract; and 
   
   
  (d) fees and charges payable in connection with the foregoing. 
   
   
  
 
37.  
Clause 14.1 requires the contractor to satisfy all legislative requirements and, in so doing, to obtain all necessary development and building approvals required in order to complete the work under the contract. Clause 15 requires the contractor to provide all things and take all necessary measures to protect people and property, avoid unnecessary interference with the passage of people and vehicles and prevent nuisance and unreasonable noise and disturbance. Clause 15 also provides: 
 
 
  
  The contractor must indemnify the principal for and against all claims, demands, proceedings, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever connected with noise, disturbance, or pollution arising out of the execution of the works. 
   
   
  
 
38.  
Under clause 16.1 the contractor is responsible for the care of the whole of the work under the contract (including the existing building) from the date of commencement of the work under the contract to 4 pm on the date of the issue of practical completion. Under clause 16.2 the contractor is responsible for the reinstatement or rectification of any loss or damage which occurs to the work under the contract so that such work conforms in every respect to the provisions of the contract. Under clause 17.1 the contractor must indemnify the principal against (a) loss of or damages to property of the principal, including existing property in or upon which the work under the contract is being carried out; and (b) claims by any person against the principal in respect of personal injury or death or loss of or damage to any property, arising out of or as a consequence of the carrying out by the contractor or its agents, sub-contractors or employees of the work under the contract.  
 
 
39.  
Clause 25 requires the contractor to personally superintend the execution of the work under the contract or, at all times when work under the contract is taking place, to have a competent representative present on the site. (Pursuant to this clause the contractor appointed a representative on the site, Mr A Scionti.) 
 
 
40. 
  
Clause 38 requires the contractor to keep the site and work clean and tidy and to regularly remove rubbish and surplus material. Clause 39 provides that if urgent action is necessary to protect the work under the contract or other property or people and the contractor fails to take the action, the representative of the principal may take the necessary action at the contractor’s cost. 
 
 
41.  
Clause 50(a) provides that the contractor shall procure that “ 
all waste materials and rubble arising from the Works is cleared away and removed from the Site and no waste materials, rubble, rubbish, oil, spirits or inflammable fluids are discharged into or allowed to flow into or are deposited into Woolloomooloo Bay from, or onto any land adjoining the Site 
.  
 
 
  
The subcontract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell 
 
 
42.  
I have set out (in paragraph 10 above) the description of the works. One of the contract documents forming part of the subcontract is headed “Specification and Scope of Works for Piling, Substructure and Substructure Remedial Works” prepared for the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd by Robert Bird and Partners Pty Ltd and dated June 1997. An addendum to the Specification, based on a meeting between the contractor and the subcontractor on 30 October 1997 describes the scope of work as follows: 
 
 
  
  The subcontractor shall provide all labour, materials and equipment and all things necessary, so as to replace and rectify Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf sub-structure including but not limited to the demolition, construction and reinstatement of existing piles and apron structure, plant room, pool piles and structural concrete slab, structural connections, underpinning, piles protection, miscellaneous and ancillary items and the like so as to compete [sic] a fully fit for purpose sub-structure all in accordance with performance specifications, drawings and subcontract agreement. 
   
   
  
 
 The same document continues: 
 
 
  
  The subcontractor acknowledges that it accepts all risks associated with but not limited to: 
   
   
  (a) Design and construction of Substructure piling including but not limited to existing timber piles. 
   
   
  (b) Construction and design development of apron slabs and decking as designed and specified by Robert Bird and Associates. 
   
   
  (c) Design and construction of structural and non-structural connections. 
   
   
  (d) Construction and Design development of Wharf 6 Heritage Wharf. 
   
   
  
 
43.  
The same document contains the following statement ( 
inter alia 
): 
 
 
  
  The subcontractor shall be responsible for any obstructions encountered in completing the works including but not limited to piling works. 
   
   
  
 
44.  
Clause 2 of the subcontract is headed “ 
Scope of Contract 
”. Clause 2(a) is an acknowledgment that the subcontractor “ 
has perused and has actual knowledge 
” 
  
of all contract documents, including the development agreement (to which I have referred in paragraphs 3 and 5 above), the head contract (defined as the contract between the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd and Wharf Developments Pty Ltd) and any additional documents comprising those agreements 
. 
 
 
45.  
Clause 2(b) obliges the subcontractor to “ 
do all things necessary to enable and ensure performance by the Contractor of its obligations and enjoyment by the Contractor of its rights and advantages under the Development Agreement and the Head Contract 
.”  
 
 
46.  
Under clause 2(c) the subcontractor agrees to indemnify the contractor “ 
against all losses and liabilities arising from any conduct or omission by the Sub-Contractor which amounts to or results in default by the Contractor under the Development Agreement or the Head Contract 
. 
 
 
47.  
Clause 2(e) states that the Scope of Works “ 
shall be deemed to include all items of work necessary or convenient for their proper execution and completion and the effective and efficient use and operation of the Principal Works although not specifically called for by the Contract Documents 
”. Clause 2(e) also requires the subcontractor to keep the contractor “ 
informed in writing of all matters it might need to know for its purposes including any relevant time constraints and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sub-Contractor shall do all things appropriate to enable the Contractor to notify and make any claims in respect of delay and/or Variations 
” 
. 
 
 
48.  
Clause 3A(f) provides that if the subcontractor has design obligations in relation to the works, it must submit such design documentation to the contractor for approval. The clause then continues: 
 
 
  
  Neither the Contractor nor its agents or consultants owe a duty to the Sub-Contractor to review anything submitted by the Sub-Contractor for errors, omissions or compliance with the Sub-Contract. No comments, reviews, rejection of or approval by the Contractor, its agents or consultants relieves the Sub-Contractor from, or alters or affects the Sub-Contractor’s obligations under the Sub-Contract or otherwise. 
   
   
  
 
49.  
Clause 6(a) relevantly provides: 
 
 
  
  If the Sub-Contractor shall: 
   
   
  ... 
   
   
  (ii) fail to proceed with the Works consistently, diligently, expeditiously and in a safe, proper, workmanlike and competent manner to the satisfaction of the Contractor and the [Contractor’s] Representative; or 
   
   
  (iii) refuse or neglect to comply to the satisfaction of the Contractor with any instruction from the Contractor; or 
   
   
  .... 
   
   
  THEN the Contractor may give the Sub-Contractor notice in writing specifying the default and if such default shall continue for two (2) days after the receipt of such notice the Contractor may, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies it may have, terminate this Agreement. 
   
   
  
 
50.  
By clause 7(b) the subcontractor agrees at its own expense “ 
to comply with all laws and with all requirements of all authorities in any manner relating to the Works or their execution 
”; and will not assign, charge or sub-let the contract or any portion thereof without the consent of the contractor.  
 
 
51.  
Clause 14 requires the subcontractor to remove all debris and rubbish resulting from the subcontractor’s work “ 
in accordance with the Contractor’s instruction and to the satisfaction of the Contractor within 24 hours of its creation, failing which the Contractor may cause it to be removed at the cost of the Sub-Contractor 
” 
. 
 
 
52.  
Clause 15 provides: 
 
 
  
  The Sub-Contractor shall attend meetings as required and comply with directions and instructions given by the Contractor’s supervisory staff only, all to the satisfaction of the Contractor. 
   
   
  
 
53.  
Clause 16 provides that the subcontractor shall not assign or subcontract this agreement without the consent of the contractor being first obtained. 
 
 
54.  
Clause 20 provides: 
 
 
  
  The Sub-Contractor shall be responsible for co-ordinating the execution and the location of the Works and working with all other Sub-Contractors and adequate protection of its equipment, materials, Works and adjoining or affected works for the extended duration of the Principal Works, and shall allow for all time and costs associated with the requirements of this clause. 
   
   
  
 
55.  
Clause 23 states: 
 
 
  
  Before arranging deliveries of materials to the Site the Sub-Contractor must advise the Site personnel sufficient time in advance so that delivery time can be allocated. 
   
   
  
 
56.  
Clause 24 provides: 
 
 
  
  (a) Risk of conditions 
   
   
   The Sub-Contractor accepts all responsibility for and assumes all risk of and associated with conditions of, affecting or relating to the Site and its environs (“Site Conditions”). Site Conditions include, but are not limited to: 
   
   
    
    (i) physical conditions on the Site or its surroundings, including but not limited to artificial things and the existing building; 
     
     
    (ii) climatic and weather conditions relating to the Site; 
     
     
    (iii) the means of access to and around the Site; 
     
     
    (iv) hazardous chemicals, substances or other material (including but not limited to asbestos); and 
     
     
    (v) water, sub-surface and geotechnical conditions of the Site. 
     
    
   
  (b)  
  Acknowledgment by Sub-Contractor 
   
   
   The Sub-Contractor acknowledges that: 
   
   
    
    (i) the Contractor has made available to the Sub-Contractor material and information relating to the Site and to the Site Conditions (‘Site Information’); 
     
     
    (ii) the Site Information may not be complete and/or accurate; 
     
     
    (iii) the Contractor does not guarantee and makes no representation as to the completeness or accuracy of the Site Information; 
     
     
    (iv) the Contractor has advised the Sub-Contractor to make and rely on its own inquiries; and 
     
     
    (v) the use of the Site Information is at the Sub-Contractor’s own risk. 
     
     
    
   
  
 
57.  
Clause 25 is headed “ 
Site Rules 
”. It provides ( 
inter alia 
) that the subcontractor’s employees must complete site registration forms prior to commencing work on the site; all such employees must be supplied by the subcontractor with appropriate safety equipment; the subcontractor must give the contractor at least 24 hours’ notice before inducting personnel on the site and must not induct construction workers unless such notice has first been given; and the subcontractor must give the contractor at least 48 hours’ notice before the commencement of any labour or of subcontractors of the subcontractor in relation to the works. 
 
 
58.  
Clause 26 is headed “ 
Safety 
” and lists a number of items and matters relating to safety for which the subcontractor must seek and obtain the contractor’s approval before commencing work on the site. Those matters include a site safety plan, a safe work method statement, a general and task induction policy, a first aid procedure and record, a rehabilitation policy and a plant/equipment register.  
 
 
59.  
Clause 27 is headed “ 
Environmental Protection 
” and it states: 
 
 
  
  The Sub-Contractor must ensure that no materials, pollutants or the like enter harbour waters and shall take steps to ensure that its actions do not cause or contribute to pollutants within the environment including harbour waters. 
   
   
  
 
60.  
Clause 28 contains a number of special provisions, including: 
 
 
  
  (d) This Agreement represents the whole of the Agreement between the parties and there are no other Agreements, arrangements, understandings or representations between them touching the subject matter of this Agreement. The Sub-Contractor warrants that is  
  [sic] 
   has relied only on its own enquiries and investigations for all its purposes and not on anything communicated to it by the Contractor or the Proprietor 
  . 
   
   
  
 
61.  
Clause 30 requires the sub-contractor to attend meetings on the site from time to time as required by the contractor for the purpose, among other things, of co-ordinating the works, programming and planning. 
 
 
62.  
Clause 33 provides that the subcontractor will do everything in the performance of its obligations under the subcontract in a way which will accommodate the contractor’s obligations under the design and construct contract; and the subcontractor must comply with any directions given by the contractor for that purpose.  
 
 
63.  
The Third Schedule to the subcontract lists the following services provided by the contractor to the site: toilets, electricity, access lighting and water.  
 
 
64.  
Forming part of the subcontract is a number of special conditions, some of which are said by the prosecutor to be relevant. The first is Special Condition 1.01: 
 
 
  
  Employee Registration 
   
   
  The Sub-Contractor shall provide the Contractor with written notification of the names of each of its employees, including particulars of the union membership ... Any employees proposed to be employed on site, shall complete an application for employment form and provide the Contractor with a copy ... No workmen will be permitted on site until they have attended and satisfactorily completed and approved Safety Induction Course ... 
   
   
  
 
65.  
Special Condition 1.03 provides: 
 
 
  
  Supervisor 
   
   
  The Sub-Contractor shall provide a permanent full-time Supervisor, authorised to receive and issue instructions, approved by the Contractor, for the duration of the project. 
   
   
  
 
66.  
Special Condition 2 is headed “ 
Site Safety 
”. Special Condition 2.02 provides: 
 
 
  
  The Sub-Contractor shall provide a detailed description of safety systems and procedures that it intends to apply on site, for the purpose of carrying out the Works 
  . 
   
   
  
 
This is followed by a list of what is to be included in the Safety Method Statement. It seems that this condition is intended to supplement clause 26 of the subcontract, which I have noted in paragraph 58 above. 
 
 
67.  
Special Condition 2.03 sets out health and safety site rules, for example: 
 
 
  
  It is important that materials and waste are stacked in safe locations. All exits, walkways and stairwells must be kept clear at all times. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately to the Contractor’s Foreman, Site Manager or Safety Co-Ordinator. 
   
   
  
 
68.  
Special Condition 2.04 refers to the attendance by all employees to an approved Safety Induction Course. Special Condition 2.05 refers to the service by employees on the Safety Committee. 
 
 
69.  
The Specification and Scope of Works prepared by Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd describes in detail the scope of the work, the manner in which it is to be done and the standards which it must satisfy. There is no mention in the document to the pipeline.  
 
 
70.  
I have referred in paragraph 42 above to the addendum to the Specification and Scope of Works. It is to be noted that the reference to “ 
miscellaneous and ancillary items and the like 
” is an expansion of the description of works set out earlier in the subcontract and which I have quoted in paragraph 10 above. The prosecutor relies, in particular, on the additional words.  
 
 
71.  
The contractual documents include a Project Productivity Agreement. Clause 1.0 describes the objectives as follows: 
 
 
  
  The primary objective of this agreement is to provide a frame-work for Multiplex and its sub-contractors to manage those issues relating to productivity/performance payments in a manner that complies with the NSWs government’s Code of Practice and Multiplex’s contractual and legal obligations. 
   
   
  
 
72.  
Clause 1.1 states that additional objectives of the agreement are to improve productivity by initiatives aimed at ( 
inter alia 
) OHS&R, which I take to be a reference to occupational health and safety. 
 
 
73.  
Clause 11 of the Project Productivity Agreement sets out a procedure for settling disagreements over safety issues. It includes a provision that the contractor will nominate, in order of priority, the areas to be inspected by the representatives of the Safety Committee as safety rectification work is completed. The clause also provides, however, that any disagreement between the contractor and the Safety Committee shall be determined by the recommendation of a WorkCover inspector.  
 
 
74.  
The subcontract agreement also contains schedules which set out the programme of the works; that is to say, the dates upon which each component of the works will be commenced and will be completed. The schedules contain no reference to the pipeline under the wharf nor any reference to the removal of oil or oil residues from the pipeline.  
 
 
75.  
I have described in paragraphs 42 to 74 above the provisions of the subcontract which I consider to be of relevance to the issues in this case. The prosecutor in its submissions appeared to accept the proposition that the subcontract does not clearly delineate who had control over the site and the works to be performed under the subcontract. For this reason the prosecutor relies on what occurred on the site in practice. I will presently refer to the documentary and other evidence on the issue of control. Before doing so, however, I should refer to one document which can be conveniently described at this point and then I shall refer to the sub-subcontract between McConnell Dowell and Moltoni.  
 
 
76.  
On 14 November 1997 McConnell Dowell sent to the contractor a memorandum which read as follows: “ 
Please find attached this memorandum, copies of our method statements and job safety analysis for both demolition and tube steel piling works 
”. The first attachment to the memorandum is a copy of a Hazard Identification Register. This identifies various hazards and the recommended action relating to each such hazard. One of the identified hazards is “ 
Explosion 
” and the recommended action is “ 
no oxy cutting 
”. Another identified hazard is “ 
Pollution 
” and the recommended action is “S 
ilt curtain in place. Ensure pipe end seal 
”. The Hazard Identification Register also identifies various “ 
basic job steps 
” and potential accidents or hazards relating to each job step are also identified. One of the job steps is “R 
emoval of timber 
” and the potential accident or hazards relating thereto are “ 
falling debri  
[sic]”, “ 
crushing 
”, “ 
falling into water 
” and “ 
falling 
”. Another basic job step listed is “R 
emoval of concrete units 
” and the listed hazards relating thereto are “ 
falling debri 
 [sic] 
”, “crushing” 
, “ 
falling into water 
” and “ 
falling through concrete 
”. Yet another basic job step listed is “ 
Removal of oil/fuel pipes 
”, for which the listed hazards are “ 
explosion 
” and “ 
pollution 
”.  
 
 
77.  
Also attached to the memorandum of 14 November 1997 is a document headed “ 
Preliminary Method Statement for Demolition Works 
”. This document includes the following statements: 
 
 
  
  10. The headstocks have steel holding stirrups, one on each side of the pile which will be oxycut to allow lifting off of the headstock. 
   
   
  11. Any piles that are already broken off will remain attached to the headstock and removed as a unit. 
   
   
  12. Removal of oil pipes involves disconnection of the pipes at one point then pulling the pipeline towards the work area and cutting on the work deck with hydraulic shears. This will eliminate fire and explosion risks as well as totally controlling oil spillages from pipe residues. 
   
   
  
 
78.  
The prosecutor submits that the memorandum of 14 November 1997 and the attached method statements and job safety analysis were sent to the contractor pursuant to cl 26 of the subcontract, which requires the subcontractor to seek and obtain the contractor’s approval of a “ 
Safe Work Method Statement 
” ( 
inter alia 
) and pursuant to Special Condition 2.02 which requires the subcontractor to provide a safety method statement of safety systems and procedures that it intends to apply on the site. 
 
 
The sub-subcontract between McConnell Dowell and Moltoni 
 
 
79.  
In early October 1997 Mr Craig Beveridge, McConnell Dowell’s Project Manager, invited Moltoni to submit a tender to undertake the demolition of certain parts of the Finger Wharf. By letters dated 6 October, 10 October and 1 November 1997 Moltoni submitted a preliminary proposal to McConnell Dowell to carry out works which essentially involved the dismantling and removal of the wharf deck and supporting headstocks and girders. 
 
 
80.  
According to Mr Moltoni, on 5 November 1997 Mr Beveridge telephoned Mr R C Moltoni (Moltoni’s Managing Director) and said: 
 
 
  
  “We have decided to award you the contract provided you agree to do the following extra work as part of the demolition. We want you to be responsible for disposing the timber piles after they have been extracted and loaded by McConnell Dowell, providing penetrations in the concrete deck for piling access and removal and disposal of the under deck piping.” 
   
   
  In relation to the piping I said: “Yes, we will remove the piping. Do the pipes have any oil residue in them?” 
   
   
  Beveridge said: “We have been told by Multiplex that the pipes have been drained by the Navy.” 
   
   
  I said: “OK”. 
   
   
  
 
81.  
The abovementioned statement of Mr Beveridge was admitted as a statement of what was said to Mr Moltoni but not as to the truth of the statement. The reference by Mr Beveridge to the removal and disposal of under deck piping was, according to Mr Moltoni, the first occasion that this had been discussed. 
 
 
82.  
On 6 November 1997 McConnell Dowell sent a facsimile transmission to Moltoni confirming its intention to utilise Moltoni’s services, noting the price and describing the scope of work, which included “ 
the demolition and disposal of the existing under deck piping 
”. The facsimile goes on to request Moltoni to complete and return the site induction forms together with its various method statements as soon as possible. The facsimile concludes by congratulating Moltoni on its successful bid.  
 
 
83.  
On 7 November 1997 Moltoni sent to McConnell Dowell its work method statement, which incudes the following: 
 
 
  
  REMOVAL OF OIL PIPES. Pipes will be removed in several operations. This will involve disconnection of the pipes at one point then pulling the pipeline towards the work area and cutting on the work deck with hydraulic shears. This will eliminate fire and explosion risks as well as totally controlling oil spillages from pipe residues.  
   
   
  
 
84.  
According to Mr Moltoni the reference above to “ 
pipe residues 
” reflects his understanding at the time of preparing the method statement, that notwithstanding Mr Beveridge’s previous advice that the pipes had already been drained, there may nonetheless be an accumulation or surface coating of oil at the elbows or bends of the pipes which could cause major problems such as fire and explosion risks when heating the pipes during oxy-acetylene cutting.  
 
 
85.  
On 14 November 1997 Mr Moltoni, Mr S King (Moltoni’s General Manager) and Mr D Blair (Moltoni’s Site Foreman) inspected the site in more detail, including an inspection of the pipes underneath the wharf. Immediately after this inspection Mr Moltoni had a conversation with Mr Beveridge which he described as follows: 
 
 
  
  I said:  
  “ 
  There are a lot more pipes than I thought. Are you absolutely certain that the pipes are clean so there will be no spillage because our method statement provides for the pipes to be sheared and removed.” 
   
   
  Beveridge said: “Multiplex have informed us that the pipes have been drained.” 
   
   
  
 
86.  
Again, the statement of Mr Beveridge above was admitted as a statement of what he said and not as to the truth of the statement. 
 
 
87.  
Shortly after the meeting and inspection on 14 November 1997 Mr Moltoni prepared a document headed “ 
Woolloomooloo Wharf Demolition 
” which briefly outlined the method to be adopted by Moltoni in carrying out the works. The relationship between this document and the work method statement described in paragraph 83 above is unclear since only the front page of the document is in evidence. (Mr Moltoni was unable to locate the rest of the material forming the document.) The front page of the document includes the following statement: 
 
 
  
  Moltoni Corporation has been contracted by McConnell Dowell to dismantle the timber and concrete deck wharf structure. 
   
   
  
 
88.  
After the oil spill which occurred on 25 February 1998, Moltoni sent a letter to McConnell Dowell dated 4 March 1998 as follows: 
 
 
  
  RE: OIL PIPE REMOVAL TO FINGER WHARF 
   
   
  We write to clarify our position with regard to the above, following the recent oil spill incident. 
   
   
  We are currently undertaking works for McConnell Dowell, at the above referenced site. 
   
   
  No demolition work was programmed or being carried out on the pipe at the time of the incident. 
   
   
  Our scope of works is as stated in the MacDow letter of intent of 6 November 1997. Item five includes removal and disposal of underdeck piping. This was an addition to our quoted works; our quote 6 October 1997 along with other concessions in final negotiations. 
   
   
  This portion of the works was accepted on the basis that the lines were drained and purged of oil and gases and would be removed by Moltoni ONLY AFTER CERTIFICATION THAT PURGING WAS COMPLETED. 
   
   
  Our method statement revision 1 clearly employs mechanical removal systems and does not at any time undertake to address oil/gas collection and line purging, as this was to be done by others. 
   
   
  The issue was further addressed on site on or about 14th November when myself and Stephen King discussed in detail the methodology for the various site works. 
   
   
  
 
89.  
According to the evidence of Mr Moltoni, Moltoni amended its work plan to take account of a changed circumstances, namely the fact of the oil spill and the fact that the pipes contained oil. According to Mr Moltoni, had Moltoni been informed that the pipes contained oil it would have been possible to take this into account by amending the work plan and then working according to the plan. This would have involved purging the pipe and then removing the purged pipe in sections. According to Mr Moltoni, Moltoni was not contracted by McConnell Dowell to conduct any inspections of the Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf nor was it contracted to purge the pipe.  
 
 
 
 
Consideration of the contractual milieu 
 
 
The early works agreement between Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and the defendant 
 
 
90.  
I have set out in paragraphs 31 and 32 above my conclusions on the effect of the early works agreement. Shortly stated, this agreement requires the defendant to carry out services diversion “ 
limited to sewer diversion, stormwater diversion, electrical diversion and Telstra diversion and the removal of asbestos and hazardous material from the Finger Wharf 
”. As to the removal of asbestos and hazardous material the agreement requires the defendant to remove all hazardous material from the Finger Wharf, including but not limited to asbestos, PCB and the like “ 
generally in accordance with hazardous material reports prepared by New Environment 
”. As noted in paragraph 27 above, there is no reference to oil or oil residues in any pipeline in the report headed “ 
Hazardous Materials Survey Report 
” prepared by New Environment Management & Technology Pty Ltd. I am not satisfied that this agreement imposed any contractual obligation or responsibility on the defendant for anything outside the scope of works (described in paragraph 24 above). In particular it does not impose on the defendant any contractual obligation or responsibility for oil or oil residues in the pipeline.  
 
 
  
The design and construct contract (between Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and the defendant 
) 
 
 
91.  
Under clauses 9.3 and 12.1, being provisions upon which the prosecutor relies, the contractor (the defendant) is not relieved from any liability to the principal for the acts and omissions of subcontractors and employees and agents of subcontractors and accepts responsibility for an assumes the risk of the physical conditions of the site, including the existing building and hazardous substances. This explains the existence of many of the provisions in the subcontract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell, namely, to ensure that McConnell Dowell complied with the defendant’s obligations to its principal, Wharf Developments Pty Ltd.  
 
 
92.  
Although, pursuant to clause 27.1, the contractor has “ 
access to and possession of the site 
”, it is not exclusive possession. Clause 27.2 reserves to the principal, to the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation and to the mortgagee bank and any of their agents and employees access to the site for any purpose. Moreover, clause 27.2 requires the contractor to permit the execution of work on the site by persons engaged by the principal and to co-operate with them and co-ordinate the contractor’s work with their work. Thus, whilst the defendant was pursuant to the design and construct contract an occupier of the wharf, it was not the sole or only occupier.  
 
 
93.  
It might be thought that clause 4.1(e), together with the defined term “ 
legislative requirements 
” in clause 2, requires the contractor to execute and complete the work in accordance with all legislative requirements, including the  
Clean Waters Act 
. I do not think that the clause can be construed in this way. It requires the contractor to execute and complete the work so that “ 
the works, when completed 
” would comply with all legislative requirements. The clause is directed to ensuring that the completed works will comply; that is to say, the physical structure in its completed state will comply with legislative requirements.  
 
 
94.  
The requirement under clause 15 for the contractor to indemnify the principal for and against all claims etc connected with noise, disturbance or pollution arising out of the execution of the works does not, in my opinion, mean that it is thereby to be regarded as criminally liable for such occurrences. It is a provision which merely protects the principal if the principal is found liable for any such occurrence. Thus, as I understand the operation of the clause, if the principal is fined for a pollution offence arising out of the execution of the works, then clause 15 would operate to require the contractor to pay the amount of such fine to the principal by way of indemnity. I read clause 17.1 in the same way.  
 
 
95.  
Clause 16 relates to “ 
work under the contract 
”. It is to be noted that there is no mention in the contract of the pipeline, neither is there any reference to the contents thereof. The “ 
work under the contract 
” does not, therefore, include the removal of the pipeline or its contents. Clause 16 requires the work under the contract to conform to the provisions of the contract.  
 
 
96.  
Clause 39 is a provision which is designed to meet the kind of pollution incident which occurred on 25 February 1998. Urgent action was necessary and even if the contractor was not responsible for the incident which resulted in the need for urgent action, this clause required the contractor to take the action which in this case it did, namely to take steps immediately to stop the flow of oil into Woolloomooloo Bay and to effect a cleanup. This clause does not, however, make the contractor criminally liable for such incidents. 
 
 
97.  
Clause 50(a) may be compared with clause 6 of the Special Clauses in the early works agreement, which I have set out in paragraph 30 above. For the same reasons to which I refer in paragraph 32 above, this clause refers to the obligations of the contractor arising from “ 
the works 
”, which do not include any work relating to the removal of the pipeline or its contents. I repeat what I have said in paragraph 32 above and what I have said there applies equally, in my opinion, to this clause. 
 
 
  
The subcontract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell 
 
 
98.  
It is to be particularly noted that neither the description of the works (which I have set out in paragraph 10 above), the Specification and Scope of Works prepared by Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd, nor the expanded description of works in the addendum to the specification (which I have noted in paragraph 42 above) make any reference to the pipeline or its removal, nor is there any express reference to the contents of the pipeline. If it was intended that the removal of the pipeline and its contents form part of the subcontract, then it must be implied from the expanded definition of the scope of works in the addendum to the specification, which I have noted in paragraph 42 above, or from cll 2, 2(b) or 2(e) of the subcontract, noted in paragraphs 44, 45 and 47 above.. 
 
 
99.  
As noted in paragraph 70 above, the prosecutor relies upon the reference to “ 
miscellaneous and ancillary items and the like 
” in the description of the Scope of Works which I have set out in paragraph 42 above. A reading of the whole of the Specification and Scope of Works documents and its addendum, however, does not support the prosecutor’s assertion. There is, for example, a detailed description of the means by which the headstocks are fixed to the piles and the method by which they are to be removed. There is no detailed description, or any description, however, of the means by which the pipeline is attached to the underside of the wharf nor the method by which it or its contents is to be removed. There is no evidence in this case, either expert or non-expert, to the effect that the removal of the pipeline or its contents is or was necessary so as to complete a fully fit for purpose sub-structure. 
 
 
100.  
As mentioned in paragraph 98 above, cll 2 and 2(b), described in paragraphs 44 and 45 above, are also relevant in this context. The head contract (between The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd and Wharf Developments Pty Ltd) is not in evidence. There is thus nothing to suggest that there is any requirement of that contract which refers to the removal of the pipeline or its contents. There is nothing in the design and construct contract between Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and the defendant which requires the removal of the pipeline or its contents. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that the removal or the pipeline or its contents is necessary or convenient for the purpose of clause 2(e), described in paragraph 47 above. 
 
 
101.  
The acceptance by the subcontractor of all risks associated with the works (noted in paragraph 42 above), its responsibility for any obstruction then encountered (noted in paragraph 43 above), together with the indemnity under clause 2(c) (noted in paragraph 46 above) is, if anything, exculpatory of the defendant. 
 
 
102.  
The prosecutor relies upon a number of provisions as evidence of the control exercised by the defendant over the subcontractor’s work. These relate particularly to safety (clauses 6(a), 14, 15, 25, 26, Special Conditions 1.01, 1,03, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04 and clause 11 of the Project Productivity Agreement are examples); and to programming, sequencing or scheduling (clauses 20, 23, 30, 33 and the schedules which set out the programme of works are examples). None of these conditions, however, show that the defendant exercised direct control over the subcontractor as to  
how 
 it did its work but rather show the defendant’s role as being one of co-ordinating and checking what was actually being done. Other provisions of the subcontract, to which I have not referred, show the defendant as checking and testing the work; that is to say, ensuring that the work was being done in accordance with the subcontract. These are, in my opinion, no more than provisions designed to ensure that the defendant was getting what it was paying for. Clause 33 is clearly a clause which falls into this category. 
 
 
103.  
Other provisions of the subcontract are exculpatory of the defendant. I refer to the subcontractor’s acceptance of all risks associated with the works (noted in paragraph 42 above), its responsibility for any obstructions encountered (noted in paragraph 43 above), and to clauses 2(c), 3A(f), 7(b), 20, 24 and 27 (noted in paragraphs 46, 48, 50, 54, 56 and 59 above). In view of these provisions I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that under the provisions of the subcontract the defendant was relevantly in control of the site and of the works which were being performed by Mc Connell Dowell and by McConnell Dowell’s sub-subcontractor, Moltoni, when the pipe was broken. Neither am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the provisions of the subcontract create a liability on the defendant for the offence under s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act. It is therefore necessary to look to evidence outside the terms of the subcontract to see whether any liability attaches to the defendant. 
 
 
104.  
I should also refer at this point to the memorandum of 14 November 1997 and the attached method statements and job safety analysis sent by the subcontractor to the contractor, to which I have referred in paragraphs 76-78 above.  
 
 
105.  
The prosecutor submits that the defendant by approving the method statement became liable for the oil spill for the following reasons: the hazard was identified; the method of dealing with the hazard was identified; the removal of the oil/fuel pipes was identified together with the potential hazard; and a specific method of removal of the oil pipes is described. 
 
 
106.  
The removal of the oil pipes described in the method statement sent by the subcontractor to the defendant is the first indication in any document with which the defendant is concerned that the pipes were to be removed. It seems that the subcontractor for reasons known only to itself, thought that the pipeline should be removed and had asked Moltoni to remove and dispose of it. The reason why the subcontractor included the removal of the pipes in its sub-subcontract with Moltoni is not explained. No one from McConnell Dowell and no one from Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd gave evidence. It may merely have been more convenient for McConnell Dowell to have the pipeline removed so that it could more easily go about performing its work without it getting in the way. There may be other reasons. Whatever the reason, in the absence of evidence from anyone from McConnell Dowell or from Robert Bird & Partners, one can only speculate.  
 
 
107.  
The method statements and job safety analysis is not described as a “ 
safe work method statement 
” within the meaning of clause 26 of the subcontract, neither is it described as a “ 
Safety Method Statement 
” within the meaning of Special Condition 2.02. There is no evidence from anyone to say what the purpose was in sending this material to the defendant. There is nothing in the evidence to show that the defendant “ 
approved 
” the method statements or otherwise expressed a view as to their suitability. There is evidence which suggests that both McConnell Dowell and Moltoni were experts in their fields. It is equally reasonable to suppose that the defendant was relying upon their knowledge and expertise in relation to the manner in which their work was to be done; and that the method statements and job safety analysis were forwarded to the defendant merely for its information. In that event clause 3A(f) of the subcontract (which I have set out in paragraph 48 above) would apply.  
 
 
108.  
Moreover, there is no evidence which suggests that the method statements and job safety analysis are inadequate. There is oral evidence, to which I later refer, by Messrs Moltoni, King and Blair that the work method statements complied with the relevant Australian Standard for demolition. If the work method statements were furnished to satisfy the requirements of clause 26 and Special Condition 2.02, then there is no evidence to suggest that the hazards are not properly identified, that the recommended action is inappropriate, or that the work methods are inappropriate. McConnell Dowell and Moltoni are designated to implement the appropriate action and to carry out the particular work. 
 
 
109.  
For the reasons described in paragraphs 106 to 108 above, I have and continue to entertain a reasonable doubt that the forwarding of the work method statements and job safety analysis to the defendant make the defendant liable for the manner in which the work described therein is carried out and thus liable for the offence under s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act. Neither am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, if it can be said that the defendant tacitly or inferentially approved the work method statements, it thereby became liable for the offence. 
 
 
  
The sub-subcontract between McConnell Dowell and Moltoni 
 
 
110.  
It is clear that McConnell Dowell asked Moltoni to remove and dispose of the pipeline and that Moltoni agreed to do so. Moreover, as appears from paragraph 83 above, Moltoni prepared and sent to McConnell Dowell a work method statement which included a description of the manner of removal of the pipes. The work method statement clearly allows for the management or control of “ 
oil spillages from pipe residues 
”. It is clear that both McConnell Dowell and Moltoni were aware that the pipeline was there and that it may have contained, at the very least, oil residue. There is also evidence to which I later refer (and which I accept) that it is industry practice to treat all pipelines as charged unless it is established to the contrary. There is no evidence that anyone physically checked the pipeline to see whether it contained any oil, in which case the industry practice should have been observed by those who were working on or around the pipeline, namely McConell Dowell and Moltoni. None of the evidence surrounding the sub-subcontract or the work to be performed thereunder implicates the defendant.  
 
 
 
 
 The defendant’s knowledge of the pipeline and its contents 
 
 
111.  
In the early 1990s - precisely when is not established by the evidence - the Domain bunkers were decommissioned. In early 1997 - again, precisely when is not established by the evidence - the Department of Defence employed TWCA Pty Ltd to carry out the cleaning and remediation of the Domain bunkers. It seems that TWCA Pty Ltd engaged Beralon Pty Ltd as its contractor to carry out the actual work of remediation which, I understand, included the use of high pressure water jets for cleaning out all oil and oil residues. It seems that Beralon Pty Ltd then subcontracted the work to another firm, Gardner Perrott.  
 
 
112.  
In May 1997 Gardner Perrott commenced the work on the Domain bunkers. Mr K Welsh and Mr N Nordstrom were employed by Gardner Perrott. Mr Welsh gave evidence. He recalled seeing work being undertaken across the road (at Wharf 11) and seeing the name “Multiplex” on the fence, on a building and on hard hats and flak jackets worn by workmen on site. On 15 July 1997 Mr Welsh saw that an excavator, which had been digging in Lincoln Crescent, had apparently fractured a large cast iron pipeline under the road. The pipeline appeared to contain bunker oil. The pipeline appeared to come from the bunkers and went in the direction of Cowper Wharf Road. Mr Welsh saw Multiplex employees attend to the broken pipe. 
 
 
113.  
Mr Nordstrom also saw the broken pipe. He thought that the pipe contained a residue of bunker oil and it appeared to have been flushed with kerosene or a cutting stock, which he describes as a derivative of diesel and used to break down heavy oils such as bunker oil. Mr Nordstorm also saw repairs made to the broken pipe.  
 
 
114.  
The defendant called evidence from Mr S Brubaker, a self-employed excavator operator, who had been excavating for sewer trenches in Lincoln Crescent in May, June and July 1997. In the course of doing so Mr Brubaker exposed what he described as a concrete encased steel pipeline, but which was not broken. The presence of the pipeline was reported to the defendant’s employees “ 
because they were in charge of the site 
”. One of those employees was Mr Brett Levy. There is other evidence that Mr Levy was the defendant’s foreman on the site. A piece of the concrete encasement to the pipe had, according to Mr Brubaker, flaked off the pipe. Because of the proximity of the pipeline to the location of the sewer trench, the excavation work had to be continued by hand.  
 
 
115.  
Mr Levy’s diary was tendered in evidence. It contains entries of who was employed on the project each day and notes of what was done each day. There is no reference in the diary to any broken pipe in Lincoln Crescent.  
 
 
116.  
The prosecutor submits that Mr Brubaker, or some other subcontractor of the defendant, broke the oil pipeline in Lincoln Crescent, being the oil pipeline which runs from the Domain bunkers to the Garden Island fleet base. The prosecutor further submits that the defendant became aware of the break and of the fact that the pipeline contained oil.  
 
 
117.  
The prosecutor also tendered a plan which was in the defendant’s site office at Wharf 11 and which shows a number of services in the vicinity, including an “ 
existing underground navy fuel (oil) pipeline 
” from the pumping station in Lincoln Crescent, along Lincoln Crescent and Cowper Wharf Road to the fleet base, with a branch pipeline along the Finger Wharf. The prosecutor submits that the defendant was thus aware of both the presence of the pipeline and the fact that it contained oil.  
 
 
118.  
I do not have to resolve the disputed evidence between Mr Welsh and Mr Nordstrom, on the one hand, and Mr Brubaker and the evidence contained in Mr Levy’s diary, on the other hand. There is other evidence, which is undisputed and which establishes that the defendant was aware of the existence of the pipeline and of the fact that it contained oil. 
 
 
119.  
It seems that possibly as a result of the discovery of the pipeline in Lincoln Crescent the defendant made appropriate inquiries, which resulted in a facsimile sent by TWCA Pty Ltd to the defendant on 28 May 1997. The facsimile reads as follows: 
 
 
  
  Attached is a diagram showing the extent of the current pipeline. It should be assumed that there is still furnace fuel oil remaining in the pipeline. 
   
   
  The position of the Commonwealth regarding the existing oil supply pipeline is as follows: 
   
   
  They have no objection to Multiplex capping off segments of the pipeline under its jurisdiction so long as the following criteria are met: 
   
  
 
·  
Multiplex will take full responsibility for any sections to be removed, their content and associated capping, both during and after removal. 
 
 
·  
All statutory and EPA requirements relating to any works on the pipeline are to be strictly adhered to. 
 
 
·  
Multiplex is to ensure that all caps fitted to the pipeline are fit for purpose and are of a design approved for use in the appropriate petrochemical installations. 
 
 
·  
Multiplex is to keep the Commonwealth’s agent (GHD/TWCA Pty Ltd) advised of all works relating to the pipeline at all times. 
 
 
  
  In the particular case of the interference with your stormwater line in Lincoln Crescent, the Commonwealth would prefer that the pipeline be removed back to the boundary at the pump room of the Oil tanks site and capped at that location. 
   
   
  Please advised ( 
  sic)  
  of your intentions prior to commencing work on the pipeline. 
   
   
  
 
120.  
The diagram referred to in the facsimile shows the pipeline, described as “ 
existing underground navy fuel (oil) pipeline 
”, extending from the pumping station adjacent to the Domain bunkers along Lincoln Crescent and Cowper Wharf Road to the fleet base and also shows the branch line along the Finger Wharf. 
 
 
121.  
Moreover, there is undisputed evidence that it was industry practice to treat all pipelines as “ 
charged 
” or “ 
live 
” unless the contrary was established; that is to say, to treat all pipelines as full. Evidence to this effect was given by Mr D Blair (Moltoni’s operations manager), Mr S P King (general manager of Moltoni) and Mr C Manihera (Moltoni’s excavator operator). No evidence was led to the contrary, so that all involved parties, namely Moltoni, McConnell Dowell and the defendant must be taken to have been aware of the industry practice. The statement in the facsimile, “ 
it should be assumed that there is still furnace fuel oil remaining in the pipeline 
”, is itself no more than a statement of the industry practice.  
 
 
  
The amount of the spill 
 
 
122.  
Mr C C Alsop, who is the General Manager Port Services of Sydney Ports Corporation went to the Finger Wharf on being informed of the spill. He described in his evidence the steps taken to contain the spill and to recover the oil from the surface of the water. He estimated that approximately 48 tonnes of oil were recovered from Woolloomooloo Bay and up to about 12 tonnes of the spill had either evaporated or was dispersed. Mr Alsop conceded, however, that the estimation of the amount of oil in an oil spill is an inexact art and in this case the estimate could be plus or minus 50%, that is to say, it could have been as little as 30 tonnes or it could have been as much as 90 tonnes. 
 
 
123.  
Dr I D Doig, an engineer experienced in the engineering of piping systems, calculated the volume of the pipes that fell into the water under the Finger Wharf on 25 February 1998 and the volume of pipes under the wharf which were undisturbed. The total volume of piping of both that which fell and that which remained but which could drain into the break in the piping was 41.370 cubic metres. Based on an assumption that the pipes had been completely filled with oil having the density of Shell marine fuel oil, this equated to a mass of 38.432 tonnes.  
 
 
124.  
Following the spill the undisturbed pipes were purged of oil. Some estimate was made of the quantity of oil which was removed from those pipes still attached to the wharf, but these estimates are necessarily inaccurate since the water used to flush out the pipes was also removed together with the oil, resulting in the removal of oily water which had an average of about 8% by volume of oil. The best estimate seems to be that about 2400 litres of oil was removed in this manner. 
 
 
125.  
I therefore find that, having regard to the concession made by Mr Alsop and the evidence in paragraph 122 and 123 above, the probable amount of oil which spilled into the bay was in the vicinity of about 40,000 litres. 
 
 
126.  
Samples of the oil residue remaining in the pipes after the spill and of the oil slick were analysed by a chemist, Mr D K M Ho, who found that there was a 91-99% certainty of a match in one pair of samples, an inconclusive result with another pair of samples and a non-match with yet another pair of samples. Mr Ho also found, however, the existence of another oil, namely diesel, as well as fuel oil, which is consistent with an attempt at some time in the past to flush the pipeline with diesel.  
 
 
  
Evidence allegedly demonstrating control by the defendant 
 
 
127.  
Mr A Hawkins 
, an environmental protection officer employed by the prosecutor, went to the Finger Wharf on Wednesday, 25 February 1998 after the oil spill had occurred and met two employees of the defendant, Mr A Scionti and Mr R Fadel, (There is other evidence that Mr Scionti was the defendant’s construction manager, having overall responsibility for the Finger Wharf project as well as for other projects; and that Mr Fadel was the defendant’s site manager, responsible for the day-to-day operations on the Finger Wharf site and also responsible for industrial relations and occupational health and safety.) Mr Hawkins was informed that there had been an oil spill, that Sydney Ports was on the site and “ 
they were containing the spill 
”. It is not clear to me whether the reference by Mr Hawkins to “ 
they 
” is a reference to Sydney Ports Authority or to the defendant. Having regard to the context I infer that it is a reference to the Sydney Ports Authority.  
 
 
128.  
Mr Hawkins returned to the Finger Wharf on Friday 27 February 1998 with Mr G Harper, an environment protection officer employed by the prosecutor. Mr Hawkins took some photographs. They met Mr A Stewart. (Other evidence establishes that Mr Stewart was the defendant’s project manager, responsible for the construction, programming, subcontracting and procurement for both Wharf 11 and the Finger Wharf.) Mr Stewart showed Mr Hawkins and Mr Harper where the pipe had been broken. Further photographs were taken. 
 
 
129.  
On Saturday 28 February 1998 Mr Hawkins again went to the Finger Wharf and took further photographs. He then attended a meeting on the Finger Wharf at which there were representatives of Sydney Ports Authority including Mr C Alsop, representatives of the defendant including Mr Stewart, representatives from McConnell Dowell and a representative from Gardner Perrott. The latter had been brought onto the site that morning to purge the remaining oil from the pipeline on the Finger Wharf. 
 
 
130.  
On Monday 2 March 1998 Mr Hawkins attended a further meeting at the Finger Wharf at which those present were Mr Pullman and Mr Alsop of Sydney Ports Authority, Mr Stewart and Mr Fadel of the defendant, Mr S Sprattley of Gardner Perrot, a representative of McConnell Dowell, a representative or representatives of Moltoni and a representative of ABB Engineering Construction Pty Ltd. The latter had been called in to prepare a plan or work method for removing the pipes from the water and from underneath the wharf. Those at the meeting discussed three objectives:  
first 
, how to remove oil from the remaining portion of the pipeline under the Finger Wharf;  
second 
, how to remove the pipeline itself; and  
third 
, how to recover the pipes which were in the water. Mr Hawkins told the meeting that before any pipes were to be removed there had to be a plan in writing for the removal of both the oil and the pipes, which should be reviewed by the prosecutor for comment. Mr Hawkins said that if Mr Stewart obtained the plan for removing the pipes he could send it to the Environment Protection Authority for review. 
 
 
131.  
On Tuesday 3 March 1998 Mr Hawkins, accompanied by Mr W Hicks, who was the manager of the prosecutor’s Sydney Region Catchment Section, attended a meeting at the Finger Wharf. Most of those who had been at the meeting on the previous day were present. Mr Hicks told Mr Stewart that the work of removing the remaining pipes from the sea bed and from under the wharf, which pipes contained oil, raised a potential for further pollution and they may need to apply for a licence. However, following discussions within the Environment Protection Authority about the matter, Mr Hawkins subsequently told Mr Stewart that there was no need to apply for a licence.

On Friday 6 March 1998 Mr Hawkins attended a meeting at the Finger Wharf at which Mr Stewart was present, amongst others. Mr Hawkins thinks that there was discussion about the removal of the pipes under the Finger Wharf and that there was discussion about a draft work method statement that had been prepared. On the same day Mr Stewart sent a facsimile to Mr Hawkins on the defendant’s letterhead together with a two page method statement or work procedure for stage 1 headed “ 
ABB 
”. The prosecutor responded by facsimile on the same day setting out in its facsimile to the defendant its response to ABB’s work procedure.  
 
 
133.  
On 7 March 1998 Mr Stewart, again on the defendant’s cover sheet, sent a facsimile to Mr Hawkins being three pages of work procedure for stage 2, also headed “ 
ABB 
”. 
 
 
134.  
On 9 March 1998 the prosecutor sent a facsimile to the defendant stating that it agreed in principle with the procedures outlined in the ABB work procedure document. Also on 9 March 1998 Mr Stewart sent a facsimile on the defendant’s letterhead to the prosecutor, to the Office of Marine Administration, to Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and to the defendant’s head office which included the work procedure for “ 
Stage 2: pipe work section B 
” for the draining, cleaning and removal of pipe work, section B, from under the eastern side of the Finger Wharf. 
 
 
135.  
On 10 March 1998 Mr Stewart sent a facsimile on the defendant’s letterhead to the prosecutor, to the Office of Marine Administration and to Wharf Developments Pty Ltd which states: “ 
Please find following for your review and approval ABB’s Stage 2 method statement for pipe sections C, D, E and F 
”. The facsimile included both text and diagrams of the work procedure, headed “ 
ABB 
”. On the same day Mr Hawkins sent a facsimile to the defendant setting out the prosecutor’s response to ABB’s work procedures for stage 2, sections B, C, D, E and F. 
 
 
136.  
On 11 March 1998 Mr Harper received by facsimile from Sydney Ports Corporation a copy of its incident report dated 25 February 1998. The incident report shows that the incident was reported to the Corporation by Mr C Beveridge and Mr D Jones “ 
working for company McDonnell/Dowell 
 [sic]”.  
 
 
137  
On 12 March 1998 Mr Stewart sent a facsimile on the defendant’s letterhead to the prosecutor, to the Office of Marine Administration, to Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and to the defendant’s head office, which facsimile included ABB’s work procedure for stage 2 pipe work, sections G and H. On 13 March 1998 the prosecutor sent by facsimile its reply in which it stated that it agreed in principle with the procedures outlined in the document.  
 
 
138.  
On 19 March 1998 Mr Hawkins, Mr Harper and Mr C McElwain (all of the prosecutor) met Mr Stewart at the Finger Wharf and took further photographs. Mr Hawkins asked Mr Stewart for and was given a map showing the location of the pipes under the Finger Wharf. The map was tendered by the prosecutor for the purpose of showing the location of the pipes as known to the defendant after the event.  
 
 
139  
On 26 June 1998 Mr Hawkins and another officer of the prosecutor, Mr K Hardy, went to the Finger Wharf and met Mr Beveridge of McConnell Dowell, who gave them a piece of pipe that had been retrieved. The piece of pipe was about 600 mm in length and had a diameter of 300mm.  
 
 
140.  
In cross examination Mr Hawkins produced his notes of the meeting of 2 March 1998. The notes set out the three-aims or objectives which I have described in paragraph 130 above. The notes then contain the following, attributed to Mr Beveridge: “ 
If you rig it and lift it, we’ll spill oil 
”. The word “ 
you 
” has been crossed out and the word “ 
we’ll 
” substituted. The note also states: “ 
Overall co-ordination: McConnell Dowell 
”. It is suggested by the defendant that these notations imply that McConnell Dowell was the overall co-ordinator of at least the cleanup and recovery. It is not clear to me, however, whether an inference may also be made from this that McConnell Dowell was also the co-ordinator of the whole of the substructure works.  
 
 
141.  
In his notes of an interview with Mr Manihera on 1 October 1998, Mr Hawkins recorded Mr Manihera as stating: “ 
We knew pipes were there from the start but McConnell Dowell didn’t want to worry about them until we got to them 
”. Mr Manihera is also recorded as having said, “ 
I didn’t take direction from MCD 
”, meaning McConnell Dowell, and that Mr D Blair was his boss. 
 
 
142.  
I have set out in some detail the evidence of Mr Hawkins because the prosecutor relies upon it (and upon other post-spill conduct on the part of the defendant) as showing that the defendant exercised control over what was happening on the Finger Wharf. 
 
 
143.  
The defendant, however, asserts that the defendant’s actions 
  
 are equally explicable as those of a “ 
good citizen 
” anxious to effect a cleanup after the event. It also seems to me that the defendant’s actions are explicable as those of a contractor anxious to avoid any further interruption or delay to its programme of works. The defendant also asserts that the evidence of Mr Hawkins described in paragraph 140 and 141 above is consistent with the fact of McConnell Dowell being in control of the works and that the defendant’s actions in forwarding the work method statements prepared by ABB Engineering to the prosecutor were done by it only at the prosecutor’s request. 
 
 
144.  
I make the observation at this stage that I am not satisfied on this evidence that the prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt, or at all, that the defendant was relevantly in control of the work on the sub-structure either before or after the event. 
 
 
145.  
Mr G J Harper 
, who is employed by the prosecutor as an environment protection officer, went to the Finger Wharf on Friday 27 February 1998 with Mr Scanes and Mr Scott, both of whom are employed by the prosecutor as environmental scientists. They met Mr Stewart, who took them to the section of the wharf where the pipeline had been broken. Mr Harper asked Mr Stewart what had happened. According to Mr Harper, “ 
he said that he understood that some subcontractors to Multiplex had been working on one of the piers when the spill occurred. That seems to be all he knew at that point 
” 
.  
Also according to Mr Harper, Mr Stewart “ 
said that the navy had led him to believe or Multiplex to believe that the pipe was clean and that the tanks around the Botanical Gardens had also been cleaned 
”. In cross-examination, however, Mr Harper agreed that it was possible that Mr Stewart said that it was “ 
his understanding that the navy had said the pipes had been drained with residual oil remaining therein and the tanks at the Botanical Gardens had been cleaned out 
”. 
 
 
146.  
Mr Harper took some samples of the oil from the water and took some photographs. He said, “ 
We arranged with Mr Stewart that if any work was done on removing the pipes or any work was done on the pipes over the weekend, that he would contact the EPA’s pollution line so that it could be arranged for Andy Hawkins to go out over the weekend and obtain a sample of oil from the pipe network 
”.  
 
 
147.  
On Friday 13 March 1998 Mr Harper went to the Finger Wharf and had a conversation with Mr Stewart. Mr Harper said in his evidence: “ 
Mr Stewart indicated that Multiplex had written to McConnell Dowell suggesting that McConnell Dowell were responsible for the mishap that had occurred 
”. On the same day Mr Harper took further photographs and samples of the oil.  
 
 
148.  
On 24 March 1998 Mr Harper received an eight page facsimile from Mr Stewart on the defendant’s letterhead. The facsimile contained two pages of a work method statement for the removal of oil from the remaining pipe under the Finger Wharf and the subsequent removal of the pipes when drained of oil. That facsimile cover sheet shows that it was also sent to the Office of Marine Administration, to Wharf Developments Pty Ltd and to the defendant’s head office and states that it is forwarded “ 
for your review and approval 
”. The facsimile includes a hazard identification schedule on a McConnell Dowell letterhead which lists each job step, the potential hazard and the means to be undertaken in relation to each job step. This suggests that McConnell Dowell had identified the potential hazard relating to each job step and was to do the actual work. On 27 March 1998 Mr Harper telephoned Mr Stewart and discussed with him some of the details of the work method statement.  
 
 
149.  
In cross-examination Mr Harper agreed that the defendant’s site office was not at the Finger Wharf but was at the end of Lincoln Crescent, near Wharf 11. Mr Harper also agrees that in his conversation with Mr Stewart on 27 March 1998 he understood that the work method statement had been prepared by and would be carried out by McConnell Dowell. A little later in his cross-examination in relation to that conversation the following exchange took place: 
 
 
  
  Q: And he told you in that conversation that the work statement, the method statement, for the removal of bunker oil, pipeline and contents had been prepared by and the work would be conducted by McConnell-Dowell? 
   
  A: Yes 
   
   
  Q: And you accepted at face value, didn’t you? 
   
  A: Yes. 
   
   
  Q: And you saw nothing from your observations that contradicted that statement? 
   
  A: No. 
   
   
  
 
150. 
  
Mr M Callaghan 
, an environmental protection officer employed by the prosecutor, went to the Finger Wharf with Mr Hawkins and Mr McElwain on 9 November 1998, more than eight months after the event. They met Mr Stewart at the defendant’s site office, which was then located at the south western corner of the Finger Wharf near Cowper Wharf Road and they then inspected the wharf. 
 
 
151.  
On 13 November 1998 Mr Callaghan conducted a record of interview with Mr Beveridge, the project manager of McConnell Dowell. Mr Callaghan said in his evidence that had he been conducting the investigation of this case “ 
from day one 
” he would have interviewed or obtained statements from a large number of people involved with the project and with the clean up. Mr Callaghan also gave the following evidence: 
 
 
  
  Mr Lloyd: Q: If McConnell-Dowell was the contractor and Moltoni was the subcontractor employing the workers that actually broke the pipe in performing their duties, you would have tried to speak to all the McConnell-Dowell employees as to their supervision, if I can use that expression, of Moltoni and the way Moltoni did its work? 
   
  A: Not necessarily speak to all the McConnell-Dowell employees, but speak to those who were in control, had some control. 
   
   
  Q: I suppose a person that would have been useful to have spoken to if there was such a person would have been the demolition foreman of McConnell-Dowell? 
   
  A: Yes. 
   
   
  Q: Were any statements to your knowledge obtained from Ian Smith, Tony White, Rob East, Andrew Andreou, Neil Jones David Hudson, Dion Jones, John Miow, Russell Faulkner, Michael Petracca, all of - and Ian Stewart, all of McConnell-Dowell? 
   
  A: Not by me they weren’t. 
   
   
  Mr Lloyd: If any statements have been taken from those people, I call for them. 
   
   
  Ms Kelly: Not produced. 
   
   
  ... 
   
   
  Mr Lloyd: I’ll rephrase it, your Honour. 
   
  Q: Mr Callaghan, is it fair to say that so far as oral evidence that the prosecutor seeks to put before this court in the prosecution of my client, from McConnell-Dowell, as I understand the prosecutor’s case, the only oral evidence appears to be some tape recordings of a record of interview that you had with Mr Beveridge? 
   
  A: I’m not aware of any other evidence, but that’s what I obtained, yes. 
   
   
  Q: And you weren’t asked to interview anybody else from McConnell-Dowell to take a witness statement or a record of interview? 
   
  A: I may have been. 
   
   
  Q: But you can’t recall now? 
   
  A: I can’t recall who they were. If there were more - probably more than I was actually asked to get through, one reason or another I did. 
   
   
  
 
152.  
Mr Callaghan had on 23 December 1998 taken a photocopy of one page of Mr Beveridge’s diary, which was tendered in evidence. The document is in handwriting which is difficult to read. It is dated 6 November 1997, that is to say, before the spill. It is headed “ 
Demolition Check list - Moltoni 
”. Amongst other items the document contains the following statements: “ 
Supply all method statements, risk analysis, permits 
” and “ 
All disposal to EPA standards ... 
”. The last item in the document is: “ 
Remove and dispose of CI pipelines either side 
”. At the foot of the page there is written a sum, “ 
$860,000 
”.  
 
 
153.  
Mr Callaghan had also obtained a facsimile from Sydney One Call Service on 8 December 1998 in the course of his investigation in order to see if anyone had made inquiries of that Service as to the presence of any services around the Finger Wharf site or leading to it. The facsimile from Sydney One Call Service states: “ 
Please find a copy of inquiry No 974600293 processed on Friday 14 November 1997. 
  
The inquiry was issued in the name of Andrew Andreou of McConnell Dowell 
 ....”. 
 
 
154.  
I have previously described some of the evidence of  
Mr Moltoni 
 (in paragraphs 80-89 above). Mr Moltoni also said: 
 
 
  
  During the course of the work, there were site meetings from time to time. These were not held on a regular basis. We received instructions from day to day or for up to several days to a week. Most of these directions were oral and came from McConnell Dowell supervisors. 
   
   
  
 
 In cross-examination Mr Moltoni conceded that he did not receive  
any  
instructions from the defendant relating to the works. The instructions came from McConnell Dowell. Moreover, when tendering for works, all his conversations were with Mr Beveridge. Mr Moltoni also said that Moltoni was paid by McConnell Dowell after Moltoni presented an invoice for the completed work to that time.  
 
 
155.  
Mr Moltoni was aware of the existence of the pipeline when tendering for the job. He had seen the plan at the defendant’s site office showing the location of the pipeline. In tendering for the job to McConnell Dowell he had submitted with the tender the Moltoni Group Profile which shows ( 
inter alia 
) that Moltoni was a significant company with over 30 permanent employees and a turnover of over $8 million per annum, that it had a reputation for specialist and high risk demolition projects and that it has successfully completed major demolition projects including wharf demolition for the Fremantle Port Authority. Mr Moltoni agreed that he was satisfied in his own mind that in doing this job it conformed to the relevant Australian Standard. He also said that as far as demolition contractors in Australia are concerned, there are probably three or four that operate Australia-wide and Moltoni was in that group.  
 
 
156.  
Mr Moltoni also gave the following evidence relating the inclusion of the pipeline in the tender: 
 
 
  
  Q: When you first tendered for the job you were not told that the job involved the demolition of the oil pipeline under the wharf. This is back in July, August, September? 
   
  A: No. Specifically the pipelines, any of the pipelines, were excluded from our scope. 
   
   
  Q: Then you said in your affidavit you had a conversation with Mr Beveridge on, I think, 5 or 6 November when you were asked to include that work? 
   
  A: Mmm. 
   
   
  Q: By that stage you had already agreed a contract price, hadn’t you? 
   
  A: We’d narrowed down a contract price, yes. 
   
   
  Q: And what price was that? 
   
  A: 860,000. 
   
   
  Q: What was the price you first quoted? 
   
  A: 875. 
   
   
  Q: So prior to being told you were doing this, it had gone down to 860? 
   
  A: That’s right. 
   
   
  Q: And when he asked you to include that other work - that is, the removal of the wharf oil pipeline, the pipeline underneath the wharf - did you have any discussion with him about price for the additional work? 
   
  A: Yes, we did. He indicated that if we wanted the works we were to include the pipelines and the pipelines under the deck as part of our cost. 
   
   
  Q: That is, no extra price? 
   
  A: No extra price. 
   
   
  Q: ‘If you want the job, you have got to do that also’.  
   
  A: That’s right. 
   
   
  
 
157.  
Before commencement of the work Mr Moltoni went personally on several occasions to see Mr R Rech of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales. He did so firstly to touch base with the regulatory authority and secondly to run past him what he proposed to do.  
 
 
158.  
In relation to the pipeline Mr Moltoni gave the following evidence:  
 
 
  
  Q: I understand you at no time checked with Multiplex as to the status of any oil in the pipeline because it was inappropriate for you to do so, given that your contract was with McConnell-Dowell? 
   
  A: That’s right. 
   
   
  
 
159.  
Mr Moltoni also said, however, that the defendant had safety officers who would from time to time ask Moltoni to keep the site clean; and that there were from time to time site occupational and health safety meetings at which representatives of the defendant were present, as well as representatives of McConnell-Dowell and any other sub-contractor who was on the site.  
 
 
160.  
Mr D Blair 
 was Moltoni’s supervisor at the Finger Wharf. Part of his duties was to supervise Moltoni’s workers. Mr Blair’s evidence was that Moltoni’s workers, including himself, got their day-to-day instructions from Mr John Miow, who he understood to be the supervisor of demolition with McConnell Dowell.  
 
 
161.  
Soon after the pipeline was broken on 25 February 1998, a person who Mr Blair thought was from McConnell Dowell tried to close a valve which was on the main pipeline about half way along the wharf. Mr Blair subsequently, after giving it more thought, agreed that the person who turned the valve off was Russell Faulkner of McConnell Dowell. After a short time a group of people managed to close the valve using a monkey wrench. Over the following days Moltoni workers were involved in attaching a wire rope and bulldog clamp to the pipes that had partially fallen into the water. This was done, according to Mr Blair, to make the site safer because if the holding brackets failed then the wire rope would stop the pipes from falling further.  
 
 
162.  
Mr Blair stated that he was never told that the main oil pipeline or any of the other pipes under the wharf might have been full or partly full of oil. If he had been so told he would not have allowed the Moltoni workers to continue to work near the pipes until they had been drained and removed because of the risk of damaging them. However, Mr Blair also said that he knew that it was industry practice in demolition work to treat all pipes as live. Mr Blair also agreed that the pipeline was not all on the same level and that it had hollows and elbows in it, in which one could always expect to find pools of oil or residual oil even if the pipeline was largely empty.  
 
 
163.  
The pipeline had been exposed before the spill whilst working at the northern end of the wharf. The fact that the pipeline had been exposed was reported by Mr Blair to an employee of McConnell Dowell named Michael, but Moltoni continued to work in the vicinity of the pipes. Mr Blair subsequently identified Michael as being Michael Petracca. Mr Blair had, before the spill, a conversation with Mr Beveridge of McConnell Dowell. According to Mr Blair: “ 
He just basically said the pipeline was empty 
”. There is no evidence, however, that anyone physically checked the pipeline to see whether it was either empty or charged. In the absence of any such checking I am inclined to the view that the industry practice ought to have been observed. There is no evidence, expert or otherwise, to suggest that under the circumstances the industry practice ought not to have been observed.  
 
 
164.  
As to the question of the involvement of the defendant, Mr Blair gave the following evidence:  
 
 
  
  Q: Personnel from Multiplex did not give you any instructions or directions in relation to what work you were to do or how you went about that work, did they? 
   
  A: No. 
   
   
  Q: That is, you are agreeing with me? 
   
  A: Yes. 
   
   
  Q: You received your instructions from McConnell-Dowell through a person by the name of John Meon?  
  [sic] 
   
  A: That’s correct. 
   
   
  Q: And was he, as you understood it, the demolition supervisor from McConnell-Dowell? 
   
  A: That’s correct. 
   
   
  
 
 Mr Blair said that he was the sole supervisor of his own staff working under him. Moreover, the area in which Moltoni was working was barricaded to keep out persons other than demolition workers and signage was put up to warn people not to enter the barricaded area. 
 
 
165.  
Mr S P King 
 is Moltoni’s general manager. On 14 November 1997 he visited the Finger Wharf with Mr Moltoni and inspected the site. The inspection included an inspection by both persons of the pipes underneath the wharf. Immediately after the inspection a conversation took place with Mr Beveridge in which Mr Beveridge said: “ 
Multiplex have informed us that the pipes have been drained 
”. Again, this conversation was admitted as to the fact that it occurred but not as to the truth of what was said. Mr King admitted in cross-examination, however, that it was industry practice to treat all pipelines as live.  
 
 
166.  
Mr King acknowledged that he was a signatory to the hazard identification register which had been subsequently forwarded by Mr Beveridge to the defendant with McDonnell Dowell’s “ 
work method statement and job safety analysis 
” on 14 November 1997. Mr King said that the hazard identification register was prepared on the assumption that there was residue oil in the pipeline. He was then asked the following question and gave the following answer: 
 
 
  
  Q: What do you mean by residue oil? 
   
  A: The inside of the pipeline would be coated with oil. It wouldn’t be likely it would have been cleaned out 100 per cent. 
   
   
  
 
167.  
Mr C Manihera 
, to whom I have previously referred, was employed by Moltoni on the Finger Wharf site as an excavator operator. His job was to operate an excavator to pull up the bearers, headstocks and concrete floor from sections of the wharf. He got his instructions from Mr Blair and he understood that Mr Blair got his instructions from McConnell Dowell. 
 
 
168.  
Mr Manihera knew the oil pipeline was there. This is because he and Mr Blair would inspect the underside of the wharf whenever the excavator was moved to ensure that the piles would support the weight of the excavator. Mr Manihera was also aware of the industry practice to which I have previously referred. In this respect he gave the following evidence: 
 
 
  
  Q: You had learned that it was industry practice in demolition to treat all pipelines as live, hadn’t you? 
   
  A: That’s correct. 
   
   
  Q: Meaning to treat a pipeline, if it was an oil pipeline, as potentially full? 
   
  A: That’s correct. 
   
   
  Q: And you had learnt that in a course run by WorkCover by TAFE prior to the time of this oil spill? 
   
  A: That’s correct. 
   
   
  
 
169.  
Whilst he was working on the day of the spill Mr Manihera saw the pipes. He spoke to an employee of McConnell Dowell and said: “ 
What do I do? 
” He was told: “ 
Leave them, don’t touch them. 
” Mr Manihera also said to Mr Blair: “ 
What should I do? 
” Mr Blair said: “ 
Leave them, don’t touch them til I get back to you. 
” Mr Manihera then described in his affidavit what happened as follows: 
 
 
  
  16. We worked near the pipes and we chained up the last headstock, pulled it, it swung around and it clipped the main pipe. There were little hook brackets holding the main pipe to the timber. When the pipe was knocked, the hook straightened and the pipe went down like dominos. I could hear the pipe falling into the water. 
   
   
  17. I shut the excavator down straight away. Then I ran along to see what happened. The first thing I was worried about was to make sure no one was hurt. Then I reported it to a bloke named Reg. I think his name was Reg Fidel. After that, I reported it to David Blair. 
   
   
  18. When I looked at the pipes, there was oil pouring out into the water. 
   
   
  19. I then went to look for a shut off valve to stop more oil coming out of the pipes. I did this with another man. I think he worked with McConnell Dowell. I saw him shut the valve off. It took a while though because the valve was rusty. It was lucky we turned it off though - it stopped more oil going into the harbour. 
   
   
  20. David Blair and I got into a boat to see what the damage was underneath the wharf on that day. I saw pipes hanging down under the wharf and I could oil on the water  
  [sic]. 
   
   
  
 
170.  
Mr Manihera also gave the following evidence: 
 
 
  
  Q: And you say you reported it to a bloke named Reg Fadel. Why did you report it to him? 
   
  A: I was - after I made sure no one was hurt, I started running down towards the office to report it and Reg was walking back through the main road and I reported it to Reg. I reported it to Reg because he was a higher authority. 
   
   
  
 
171.  
Mr Manihera knew Mr Fadel as a person who would do safety inspections “ 
to make sure all of us guys were keeping our safety standards up so just to take away any hazards where anyone might get hurt or anything. They would do it on all the contractor work and if they found something, they would come and approach us so we would have to go and fix it 
”. Mr Manihera then gave the following evidence: 
 
 
  
  Q: Can you give us an example of what sort of thing Mr Fadel could tell you to do? 
   
  A. If we had a barricade missing or a sign had fallen over, they would tell us to get the safety gear up to standard. 
   
   
  Q: You said “they”. There was Mr Fadel and who else? 
   
  A: Usually it was Reg Fadel and a couple of union guys. 
   
   
  
 
172.  
Mr R Rech 
 is employed by the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales as the Construction Team State Co-ordinator. He was at the time of the oil spill the Acting Co-ordinator. Mr Rech was called by the prosecutor to give evidence as an expert, although there is no evidence that he holds any formal qualifications. The evidence he gave was based, it seems, solely on his experience as an officer of WorkCover since 1986. He said that his evidence “ 
demonstrates the performance that I would require from those involved in demolition 
”.  
 
 
173.  
Mr Rech said that the holder of a licence under the Occupational Health & Safety (Demolition Licensing) Regulation 1996 who is undertaking demolition activities is responsible for how the demolition activity is conducted. In the present case, since the structure being demolished was less than 4 metres in height, a licence under the Regulation was not required. In Mr Rech’s opinion, in the absence of a licence it is the head contractor who has the responsibility for the conduct of the demolition activities. It was his understanding of the situation at the Finger Wharf that the person conducting the demolition, namely Moltoni, was not in complete control of the demolition site, so that primary responsibility rested with the head contractor, here being the defendant, although some responsibility would also rest with the other contractors, being McConnell Dowell and Moltoni.  
 
 
174.  
Mr Rech described what was involved in a proper risk assessment of the pipeline. That would have involved an assessment of whether or not it was securely attached to the underside of the wharf and to establish what are its contents. The former could be assessed, at least initially, by a visual inspection. As to the latter, an initial step would be to tap the pipeline with a hammer. Inspection or drainage points and end caps would enable the contents to be checked. It would also be necessary to identify whether any valves in the pipeline were open or shut or blocked. Mr Rech also said that a pipeline of this size needs to be treated as if it were “ 
live 
” until it could be shown to be otherwise. He said: 
 
 
  
  Given the size of the pipeline at the Finger Wharf, even if the pipeline was apparently empty, it is my view that it would need to be purged prior to its demolition to ensure that it did not contain inflammable, explosive or toxic gases or liquids. This is similar to the requirements in relation to decommissioning underground fuel tanks at service stations. ... Only after it has been established that the pipeline is not a risk could work commence nearby. 
   
   
  
 
175.  
In Mr Rech’s opinion, the work method statement and hazard identification of 24 March 1998 (which I have described in paragraph 148 above), which he had seen and which post-dates the spill, should have been in place and executed in the first instance. The method statement and hazard identification of 14 November 1997 (which I have described in paragraph 76 above) did not address the risk of explosion or pollution arising from the possibility of the pipeline being full or nearly full of oil.  
 
 
176.  
Mr Rech had not seen, neither did he want to see, either the contracts or the particular clauses in the contracts which deal with the issue of control. It was put to Mr Rech in cross-examination that as a matter of law and logic, if there were contractual terms that affected who had control of the site (and of what was happening on the site) he would want to see them. Mr Rech said: “ 
Under the Occupational Health & Safety Act they can’t contractually contract out of their obligations”, 
 so he ignored the contracts. It was also put to Mr Rech in cross-examination that apart from the legal position, contractually it was necessary to know what was occurring on the site. Mr Rech said, “ 
No. .... Under the Occupational Health & Safety Act that doesn’t apply 
”. Mr Rech also said: “ 
The legal contracts are not relevant as far as I am concerned as a WorkCover Inspector ....As far as the Occupational Health & Safety Act is concerned, Multiplex is in charge 
”. Mr Rech said that he also based his opinion on the fact that Mr McElwain told him that contractually the defendant was in control of the site. He said he took that for granted. He said that he had no reason to doubt it. According to Mr Rech, the defendant provided the site sheds, the facilities, security, chaired safety committee meetings, interacted with the unions, interacted with WorkCover and had a manager on site and accordingly it is responsible under the  
Occupational Health & Safety Act 
.  
 
 
177.  
Mr Rech said that it is the custom and practice that where more than 20 people are employed on a construction site and where the majority of them wished to have a safety committee under the Occupational Health & Safety Act “ 
the company must constitute a safety committee 
”.  
 
 
178.  
Mr C S F McElwain 
 is one of the solicitors having the conduct of these proceedings for the prosecutor and had the primary conduct of the matter. On 18 February 1999 he served notices under s 25 of the Pollution Control Act 1970 on Mr Scionti and on Mr Stewart requiring them to furnish the information specified in a number of questions set out in the notices.  
 
 
179.  
Mr McElwain acknowledged in cross-examination that he could have served similar notices on a number of other persons or obtained witness statements from a number of other persons in addition to Mr Scionti and Mr Stewart, but had not done so. Those other persons included other employees of the defendant, employees of McConnell Dowell, Mr Brubaker, persons connected with TWCA Pty Ltd, persons connected with Gutteridge Haskins and Davey Pty Ltd, persons from ABB Engineering Construction Pty Ltd, persons from Gardner Perrott and persons from the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd. Mr McElwain further agreed that he had not obtained the minutes of safety walk meetings, service co-ordination meetings, occupational health and safety meetings or WorkCover meetings. Mr McElwain also said that he had not made any inquiries as to whether the pipeline on the Finger Wharf had been drained at any time.  
 
 
180.  
The information required under s 25 of the Pollution Control Act is somewhat ambiguous. Many of the questions asked of Mr Scionti are ambiguous so that many of the answers do not necessarily relate to the Finger Wharf but could just as readily relate to Wharf 11. I think it is fair to say that Mr Scionti’s answers assert that responsibility for the spill rests with McConnell Dowell. In particular Mr Scionti states that McConnell Dowell were told: “ 
to check all services and make their own arrangements as their contract encompassed all demolition and service disconnections 
”. I observe that this statement is consistent with clause 24 of the contract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell. It is also consistent with the substructure programme submitted by McConnell Dowell to the defendant and accepted by the defendant on 4 December 1997, in which McConnell Dowell indicates that it will locate services.  
 
 
181.  
Similarly, many of the questions asked by the defendant of Mr Stewart are ambiguous. Although Mr Stewart accepts that his position with the defendant entitled him to give directions to McConnell Dowell, no topic or subject is specified. Again, Mr Stewart’s answers appear to throw liability upon McConnell Dowell and he states that he would expect McConnell Dowell to carry out the contract in a diligent manner.  
 
 
  
Consideration of the abovementioned evidence 
 
 
182.  
The prosecutor relies on the above evidence, and in particular on the defendant’s involvement in safety inspections (noted in paragraphs 171 and 177 above) and its chairing of safety committee meetings as demonstrating a sufficient degree of control over the works so as to make it liable for the spill. The safety inspections and safety committee meetings, however, seem to me to have been more concerned with general “ 
housekeeping 
” matters rather than technical or structural matters.  
 
 
183.  
Although Mr Stewart furnished the post-spill work method statements to the prosecutor, this appears to have been at the prosecutor’s request (as noted in paragraph 130 above). I have previously observed that the defendant’s involvement in the post-spill cleanup and rectification works, alleged by the prosecutor to demonstrate control over the works on the part of the defendant, is equally explicable for other reasons. (See paragraph 143 above.) It is to be noted that the spill was reported to the Sydney Ports Corporation by Mr Beveridge and Mr Jones of McConnell Dowell. The notations made by Mr Hawkins of the meeting of 2 March 1998 suggests that McConnell Dowell was the overall co-ordinator of the cleanup and recovery operation.  
 
 
184.  
Other evidence points to McConnell Dowell as being relevantly in control, rather than the defendant.  
 
 
185.  
As noted in paragraphs 148 and 149 above, it seems that McConnell Dowell had accepted, at least post-spill that it had to identify the potential hazard and to do the actual work. The evidence of Mr Callaghan, noted in paragraph 151 above, suggests that the investigation by the prosecutor was not as thorough as it should have been. The extract from Mr Beveridge’s diary obtained by Mr Callaghan appears to confirm that Moltoni, as McConnell Dowell’s sub-subcontractor, was to supply all work method statements, risk analysis and permits and to remove and dispose of the pipeline (see paragraph 152 above). Mr Moltoni’s evidence, noted in paragraph 156 above, confirms that Moltoni was to include the removal of the pipeline in its work. 
 
 
186.  
It seems that McConnell Dowell was involved in checking on the presence of services, as appears from its inquiry of Sydney One Call Service (noted in paragraph 153 above).  
 
 
187.  
Mr Moltoni received day-to-day instructions from McConnell Dowell’s supervisors, did not receive  
any  
instructions from the defendant relating to the works and when tendering for the works stated that all his conversations were with Mr Beveridge (as noted in paragraph 154 above). Mr Moltoni considered it inappropriate to check on the status of the pipeline with the defendant given that his contract was with McConnell Dowell (noted in paragraph 158 above).  
 
 
188.  
When the pipeline had been exposed prior to the spill, Mr Blair reported this fact to Mr Petracca of McConnell Dowell. Mr Blair also said that personnel from the defendant did not give instructions or directions as to what work was to be done and how it was to be done and that he received his instructions from McConnell Dowell’s demolition supervisor (as noted in paragraph 164 above). I have referred to Mr Manihera’s evidence in paragraphs 141 and 167 above, which suggests that McConnell Dowell was controlling or directing the demolition work being carried out by Moltoni.  
 
 
189.  
The opinions of Mr Rech were based, it seems, on his understanding of the operation of the Occupational Health & Safety Act, rather than on an understanding of either the contractual arrangements between the various parties or on an understanding of the actual roles performed by the various parties on the site. His statement that in the absence of a licence (which was not required) then it is the head contractor who has responsibility for the conduct of demolition activities was a statement (a) made from the point of view of the regulatory authority under the Occupational Health & Safety Act, (b) was made in ignorance of the various contractual obligations between the parties and (c) could easily apply to McConnell Dowell as the head contractor  
for the demolition activities. 
 The defendant is, of course, not charged with any offence under the Occupational Health & Safety Act, but under a different Act. 
 
 
190.  
I should refer to Mr Rech’s statement that, even if the pipeline was apparently empty, it needed to be purged before its demolition. I also should refer to Mr Rech’s further statement that in his opinion the post-spill work method statement of 24 March 1998 should have been in place and the previous method statement of 14 November 1997 was apparently inadequate. Mr Moltoni, Mr Blair and Mr King were, as I have said, aware that it was industry practice to treat such pipelines as “ 
live 
”. Mr King said that the hazard identification in the 14 November 1997 method statement was prepared on the assumption that there was oil residue in the pipeline. Mr Rech’s evidence suggests that the hazard identification in the work method statement of 14 November 1997 was thus inadequate. It seems to me that the actions of McConnell Dowell in engaging the services of Moltoni and of the defendant in approving Moltoni as a sub-subcontractor to McConnell Dowell were the acts of responsible bodies, having regard to Moltoni’s experience and expertise in major demolition projects, noted in paragraph 155 above. In other words, I am of the opinion that both McConnell Dowell and the defendant were reasonably entitled to rely upon Moltoni’s acknowledged experience and expertise in producing the hazard identification and method statement of 14 November 1997 Moreover, I am of the opinion that the defendant was reasonably entitled to rely upon the experience and expertise of McConnell Dowell in subcontracting to it the substructure works, including the hazard identification and method statements which McConnell Dowell furnished to the defendant.  
 
 
191.  
I am thus left with the overall impression that the evidence that I have described in paragraphs 127 to 181 above does not satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt, or at all, that the defendant exercised such control over the works being performed by Moltoni or by McConnell Dowell as to render it criminally liable for the spill. Such evidence as exists which might implicate the defendant is counterbalanced, in my view, by evidence which is exculpatory of the defendant. 
 
 
Other documentary evidence 
 
 
192.  
The prosecutor relies upon a large amount of documentary evidence which, it asserts, demonstrates that the defendant exercised such control over the site and the works being carried out thereon as to attract liability for the offence. The documents upon which the prosecutor relies fall into two major categories: those which precede the spill on 25 February 1998 and those which relate to the defendant’s control over the cleanup activities and its aftermath after the spill. The defendant, on the other hand, asserts that much of the documentary material in evidence is exculpatory of the defendant.  
 
 
193.  
The prosecutor relies in particular on a large number of documents which are said by it to supports its submission that the defendant exercised control of and responsibility for various aspects of the work, including the timing and scheduling of the work, access to the site, directions with respect to the work and the method of work, control over demolition activities and specific control over safety matters. The prosecutor also asserts that the material upon which it relies shows that the defendant had control over the cleanup activities after the spill on 25 February 1998, that the defendant relevantly had possession of the site and of the pollutant and that the defendant was aware of the hazard and of demolition work near the pipeline.  
 
 
194.  
Whilst I acknowledge that many of the documents upon which the prosecutor relies support the propositions for which it contends, they do not lessen the impact of the subcontract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell and the sub-subcontract between McConnell Dowell and Moltoni. For example, whilst the defendant may initially have been responsible to its principal, Wharf Developments Pty Ltd, for general control of and responsibility for the works, the prosecutor’s contentions overlook the fact that the defendant then passed control and responsibility to McConnell Dowell and specifically control and responsibility for the substructure works.  
 
 
195.  
I do not propose to set out all of the documentary evidence upon which the parties have relied. To do so would result in a judgment of unwieldy proportions without progressing or advancing a resolution of the issues, since much of the documentary evidence which was tendered is equivocal. That is to say, many of the documents advance neither the prosecutor’s case nor the defendant’s case. By way of example, I now describe the first few documents upon which the prosecutor relies and which, the prosecutor submits, demonstrate the defendant’s general control over and responsibility for the works.  
 
 
196.  
The first such document is a development programme prepared by the defendant and dated 6 November 1995. This document is a typical table which sets out the various stages of the development and the estimated time for the completion of each such stage. As noted in paragraph 6 above, it must be remembered that the development is essentially a joint venture by both Walker Corporation and the defendant. This document is typical of the kind of exercise that any developer would prepare for its purposes and basic to its planning, financing and marketing of the project.  
 
 
197.  
The next documents upon which the prosecutor relies are minutes of a building application committee meeting held at Sydney City Council on 22 May 1997. The aim of the meeting is said in the minutes as being: “ 
To expedite the approval of the ‘skeletal’ DA for the Finger Wharf to allow work to commence on Wharf 11 
”. Those present at the meeting included staff of Sydney City Council, Mr Robert Bird of Robert Bird & Partners, Mr J Adamus of Adamus Consulting Practice, Mr J Oultram of Clive Lucas Stapleton (architects), Mr J McInerney and Mr B Bennett of City Plan Services, Mr J Reddy of The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd, Mr G McGilvery and Mr M Rose of Walker Corporation Ltd and Mr R West, Mr A Scionti, Mr G Baxter and Ms C Hart of the defendant. The minutes note,  
inter alia 
, that the defendant required approval by 30 June 1997 for the Wharf 11 structural works and Level 1 slab, that the Finger Wharf substructure works, pile renewal and rectification approval is required by 1 August 1997, that a demolition approval is required for the stripping out of the Finger Wharf by 14 July 1997 and that the defendant and the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd had confirmed that a site rectification deed was being put in place for the project. Attached to the minutes is a table prepared by the defendant which sets out the time lines for the various approvals required. It seems to me that no particular significance can be attributed to these minutes and the attached table. As with the previous document they represent no more and no less than the kind of planning which any developer would undertake. It says nothing about who will do the work and who will control the work which is to be done.  
 
 
198.  
The next document is a table setting out a preliminary development programme dated April 1997. It sets out time lines for finance, for Wharf 11 building application documentation, demolition and excavation and for the Finger Wharf building application documentation, substructure works and main constructions works. The comments which I have made in relation to the first two documents apply equally to this document. Indeed, by its reliance on such documents as these my immediate impression is that the prosecutor’s case, having nothing better upon which to rely, is devoid of any substantial evidence implicating the defendant.  
 
 
199.  
The next document upon which the prosecutor relies is a facsimile transmission from McConnell Dowell to the defendant dated 11 November 1997, seeking permission “ 
pursuant to clause 16 of the draft subcontract agreement 
” to assign various portions of the work, and in particular to assign demolition to Moltoni Corporation Pty Ltd. The facsimile also states: “ 
The contractors mentioned have been selected on the basis of their expertise on similar projects ... 
”. I note that this statement supports the defendant’s submission that Moltoni was experienced in demolition work generally and in wharf demolition work in particular.  
 
 
200.  
Next is a document of the defendant dated 5 December 1997 and said to be a quality compliance audit of McConnell Dowell’s work and documentation. It seems to me that this document, rather than evidencing any form of control or direction by the defendant, is nothing more than a survey by the defendant to ensure that it was getting what it was paying for. That is to say, the defendant was checking to see whether McConnell Dowell was performing its part of the subcontract as it had agreed to do so that the defendant could be satisfied that what it was paying for was in fact being done. 
 
 
201.  
The next document is a facsimile transmission dated 14 January 1998 sent by the defendant to Mr Beveridge which states: “ 
Please find attached a description of incomplete works under the wharf. The attached needs to be rectified ASAP 
”. There is a two page list containing 35 items which accompanied the facsimile transmission, such list including the following: “ 
Grid 30. North-south Central Roadway. Existing pipe to be removed 
”. ...” 
Grid 16. East-west Central Roadway. Remove existing pipe 
”. ... “ 
Grid 22-23. Central Road. Remove old oil pipeline 
”. Most of the other items in the list require the removal of formwork. Again, this document appears to me to be explicable as the act of a principal to ensure that it is getting what it is paying for. It does not seem to me to be an attempt at telling McConnell Dowell  
how 
 to do the work. It does, however, confirm the fact that McConnell Dowell had full knowledge of the existence of the pipeline.  
 
 
202.  
The next document is a letter dated 22 January 1998 from the defendant to McConnell Dowell which states: “ 
Due to the crane being serviced on Tuesday 27 January 1998 it will cease to operate after 3.00 pm. Please contact myself on 9358 2055 if this arrangement causes a problem 
”. The letter is signed “ 
George Diamond. Site Engineer 
”. I must confess that I have no idea why the prosecutor relies upon this document. There is no evidence of what task the crane was performing on the site and no evidence of how it affected McConnell Dowell’s work. I do not see how this letter advances the prosecutor’s case, neither do I see its relevance. There are many other documents which fall into this category and about which I could make similar comments. 
 
 
203.  
The next document is a report provided by McConnell Dowell to the defendant on the subject of building and apron piles dated 28 January 1998. The report lists by pile number the piles which have been completed and those which are currently under construction. The prosecutor notes that some of the piles would have been adjacent to the oil pipeline. It seems to me that this report was merely furnished by McConnell Dowell to the defendant for information. It is not evidence, as the prosecutor asserts, of any control exercised by the defendant over the works.  
 
 
204.  
The next document is headed “ 
Notes From Meeting With McConnell Dowell Subcontractors Wednesday 4/2/95 5 pm 
”. There is no evidence of who was present at the meeting, neither is there any evidence of who prepared the document. The prosecutor relies on a statement in the document which reads: “ 
Bird Engineers not to give instructions directly to McConnell Dowell or subcontractor workers, but to give recommendations to MPX Management who will pass the message on through foremen 
”. I assume that the reference to Bird Engineers is a reference to Robert Bird & Partners. I should observe that no evidence was called to explain the role of Robert Bird & Partners.  
 
 
205.  
Next is a facsimile transmission from the defendant to Mr Beveridge which states: “ 
We confirm that static pile testing is not required. We do however require written certification from Hardcastle and Richards that the installed piles comply with their design. Please provide this certification for the 1st 24m. of piling for the main building & the north building piles to date. The certification needs to include the building raking piles 
”. It seems to me that all this facsimile transmission does is to require certification by McConnell Dowell’s engineers, Hardcastle and Richards, that the piling complies with their design. That is to say, the defendant requires certification that McConnell Dowell had done its job and for which it is being paid by the defendant. This document does not, in my opinion, support the prosecutor’s argument that the defendant was in control of the works being performed by McConnell Dowell. There is no suggestion that the defendant was by this facsimile instructing McConnell Dowell  
how 
 it should be doing its work. The defendant was, on the contrary, relying upon others, namely Hardcastle and Richards, in relation to how the work should be done. 
 
 
206.  
The abovementioned documents are the first few examples of those upon which the prosecutor relies. As I have said, I do not propose to go through each of the very large number of documents in evidence since this would become an unwieldy exercise. It is sufficient to say that I have read and re-read all the documentary material which has been tendered. As noted in the few examples given above, many of them do not necessarily demonstrate control over or responsibility for the works on the part of the defendant, but are equally explicable on the basis of the defendant ensuring that it was merely getting what it was paying for under its subcontract with McConnell Dowell. I have referred in paragraph 143 above to the defendant’s explanation for its post-spill involvement in the cleanup and its aftermath. The additional documentary material relied upon does not persuade me beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had control of and responsibility for the works which were being performed by McConnell Dowell and whose subcontractor’s employee was responsible for the oil spill which occurred on 25 February 1998.  
 
 
The prosecutor’s submissions 
 
  
 
207.  
I have set out (in paragraph 16 above) the five issues identified by the prosecutor and which it says are each satisfied in this case. It seems to me, however, that there is some overlapping of the issues. Issues (ii) and (iv), for example, appear to be in substance the same. It also seems to me that as between those two issues and issues (i) there is some overlapping. The prosecutor’s own submissions tended to blur any distinction between these issues.  
 
 
208.  
As I understand the prosecutor’s submissions, it asserts that the defendant was the occupier of the Finger Wharf for the purpose of the definition of “occupier” in s 5 of the Clean Waters Act and was in control of the premises pursuant to its contract with Wharf Developments Pty Ltd. The defendant was accordingly in possession of the pollutant on premises which it controlled and the pollutant got into the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay as a direct result of being where it was (cf  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
, at 662-663). The defendant was thus directly liable under s 16(1) of the Act.  
 
 
209.  
Further or alternatively, the prosecutor relies upon the deeming provisions in s 16(2) of the Act: the defendant placed, or caused or permitted the pollutant to be placed in a position where it fell or descended, or was likely to fall or descend, into the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay (in this context the prosecutor referred to  
Environment Agency v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd 
 [1998] 2 WLR 350 [1998] All ER 481 HL.) 
 
 
210.  
In support of these assertions the prosecutor’s counsel spent some days in submission canvassing the detailed evidence, both oral and documentary, upon which the prosecutor relies. Again, I do not propose in this judgment to set out all the detailed evidence to which the prosecutor’s counsel referred. To do so would be to depart from what Kirby J has described as “ 
the judicial trinity 
” for effective judgment writing: “ 
brevity, simplicity and clarity 
” ( 
On the writing of judgments,  
64 ALJ 691 at 704, 708). It is sufficient to note in a general way the nature and scope of the submissions as I understood them. 
 
 
211.  
In the prosecutor’s submission,  
inter alia 
, the defendant was in control of the premises pursuant to its contract with Wharf Developments Pty Ltd; the defendant controlled who went on to the site, approved the work methods, was responsible for safety on the site and gave directions as to the work methods and safety issues; the defendant was aware of the location of the pipeline and was told to assume the presence of marine fuel oil in the line; the defendant was in possession of the substance in the pipe; as a direct of result of where the oil was, being in the pipeline, it got into the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay; the defendant failed to tell McConnell Dowell or anyone else to assume that marine fuel oil remained in the pipes; the defendant failed to comply with the relevant Australian Standard for the demolition of structures (as required by condition 8 of the building approval); the defendant permitted work in the vicinity of the pipeline when the risk of damage thereto was apparent; and the defendant did not take specific precautions to prevent pollution by the presence of the hazard, namely the oil in the pipeline.  
 
 
212.  
I now turn to issue (iii) as identified by the prosecutor, that of vicarious liability. The prosecutor submits that the defendant is liable for the acts and omissions of McConnell Dowell and its employees and of Moltoni and its employees. The prosecutor relies, in particular, on  
Tiger Nominees Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission 
 (1992) 25 NSWLR 715,  
State Pollution Control Commission v Australian Iron & Steel Ltd 
 (1992) 74 LGRA 387 and  
Environment Protection Authority v Taylor Woodrow (Australia) Pty Ltd 
 (1997) 101 LGERA 226. The prosecutor submits that there is no need for there to be a contract between the defendant and McConnell Dowell’s employees, or between the defendant and Moltoni or Moltoni’s employees, for the defendant to be vicariously liable for their acts or omissions. In this respect the defendant relies upon  
Mousell Bros v London & North Western Railway 
 [1917] 2 KB 836. The prosecutor places importance on the fact that the offences created by s 16 are “ 
result offences 
” as described in  
Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission 
 (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 and  
Bathurst City Council v Environment Protection Authority 
 (1995) 89 LGERA 79. Again, the prosecutor’s counsel referred extensively to the evidence, both oral and documentary, which is said to support its submissions on this issue.  
 
 
213.  
As to issue (v) as identified by the prosecutor, that is, the defendant owed a non-delegable duty of care to prevent the pollution of the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay, I have noted that the prosecutor relies on  
Burnie Ports Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd 
. The prosecutor submits that the principle of non-delegable duty established by  
Burnie Ports 
 is separate from the defendant’s contractual obligations, although the latter are relevant in determining the control that the defendant had over the Finger Wharf in terms of access and the work to be done. The prosecutor submits that there are two points of identity in this case with  
Burnie Ports 
:  
firstly, 
 the presence of a pipeline which had furnace oil remaining in it and  
secondly 
, demolition activity occurring above and around it. There was a foreseeable risk of pollution unless precautions were taken to avoid that risk. The prosecutor concedes, however, that  
Burnie Ports 
 has not been applied to attach vicarious liability to a defendant in a criminal case.  
 
 
214.  
Finally, the prosecutor submits that a defendant cannot contract out of criminal liability; or put another way, the defendant cannot avoid liability for an offence under the Clean Waters Act by provisions of contract. The prosecutor, referring to  
May v O’Sullivan 
 (1955) 92 CLR 654, also submits that since no one from the defendant has given evidence, it may thus be legitimate to more readily draw an inference of guilt. 
 
 
215.  
I have attempted to summarise the prosecutor’s principle submissions, as I understand them. The prosecutor also made a number of subsidiary submissions. For example, the prosecutor submits that the involvement of the defendant in the post-spill clean up and other conduct of the defendant is evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant. I comment on the prosecutor’s subsidiary submissions as necessary in the course of these reasons.  
 
 
  
The defendant’s submissions 
 
 
216.  
The defendant’s approach to the case is that there are three basic or essential allegations against it:  
 
 
(1) The defendant by its acts and/or omissions directly introduced into the waters of Woolloomoolloo Bay oil which was, prior to the spill, in the possession of the defendant on land it occupied, or caused or permitted the same. (The prosecutor’s issues (i), (ii) and (iv).) 
 
 
(2) The defendant is vicariously liable for the acts and/or omissions of McConnell Dowell and/or Moltoni and their respective employees. (The prosecutor’s issue (iii).) 
 
 
(3) The defendant was under a non-delegable duty to protect the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay. (The prosecutor’s issue (v).) 
 
 
217.  
The defendant’s approach to the issues is consistent with the view that I have taken of the issues identified by the prosecutor and which I have briefly discussed in paragraphs 207 to 213 above. In answer to the three basic allegations made against it the defendant says: (1) no sufficiently proximate act or omission on the part of the defendant caused the spill, (2) the evidence adduced by the prosecutor does not establish beyond reasonable doubt vicarious liability on the part of the defendant for the acts or omissions of McConnell Dowell and/or Moltoni or their employees and (3) the principle of a non-delegable duty to protect the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay is not an available head of liability under s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act. The defendant also relies upon an overall defence to allegations (1) and (2) of honest and reasonable mistake, namely: that McConnell Dowell was taking steps to deal with potential hazards such as pollution or explosions in removing the pipeline; that the work method statements and the statements contained in the hazard identification register would not only reduce the possibility of explosion or pollution, but would if implemented eliminate fire and explosion risks as well as totally controlling oil spillage from pipe residues; and that McConnell Dowell had accepted and was carrying out its obligations under its contract with the defendant.  
 
 
218.  
As to issue (1) as identified by the defendant, it submits that the prosecutor must prove that the defendant  
caused 
 the oil to get into the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay; that what  
caused 
 a certain event to occur is essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense; and that none of the omissions relied upon by the prosecutor could ever as a practical question of fact using one’s ordinary common sense establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant  
caused 
 the oil to find its way into Woolloomooloo Bay. The defendant also submits that as a matter of common sense the immediate and proximate cause of the oil getting into Woolloomooloo Bay was the negligent act of an employee of Moltoni. A further causative act, according to the submission, was the failure of McConnell Dowell (which had undertaken the responsibility to remove the pipeline and its contents) and of Moltoni to ensure that the pipeline was purged or cleared of its contents prior to the spill. The only acts or omissions proven beyond reasonable doubt to have caused the pollution are the acts of Moltoni’s employees or, at the very least, the Court could not find beyond reasonable doubt that any acts or omissions of the defendant caused the pollution. 
 
 
219.  
The defendant also submits that the acts or omissions of Moltoni and of employees of McConnell Dowell are  
novus actus interveniens 
 in relation to causation of the spill, should it ever be found that the defendant’s acts or omissions had causal significance; and that no act or omission on the part of the defendant can be said to constitute the legal or proximate cause of the oil spill.  
 
 
220.  
The defendant submits that the following circumstances, or any of them, exclude any  
 
acts or omissions of the defendant as a causative factor: the negligence of Mr Manahera in striking the oil pipe, having earlier been told by Mr Blair to leave it alone, the failure of McConnell Dowell to have purged the pipeline of oil, knowing the industry practice to treat it as “ 
live 
”, or the assurance given by Mr Beveridge to Mr Moltoni in November 1997 that the pipeline had been drained. The defendant submits that these things could not in any way be regarded as “ 
in the general run of things as a matter of ordinary occurrence 
” but rather were “ 
so far out of the ordinary course of things that in the circumstances any [acts or omissions] of the defendant fade into the background 
”. The defendant also referred in this context to  
Empress Car Co (Abertillery) 
  
Ltd v National Rivers Authority 
. 
 
 
221.  
The defendant submits that  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
 is not authority for the proposition that s 16(1) creates an offence  
not 
 requiring proof of causation. The prosecutor seems to have made the submission that the defendant is liable because it simply “ 
possessed 
” the oil in the pipeline.  
Majury 
 makes it clear, however, that causation still has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The defendant submits that a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal,  
Environmental & Earth Sciences Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority 
 [1999] NSWCCA 192, confirms the necessity for causation to be proved. It has never been held that s 16(1) creates an offence of absolute liability (as distinct from one of strict liability in which no  
mens rea 
 needs to be proved). 
 
 
222.  
The defendant further submits on this issue that the prosecutor has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was either in possession of the oil in the pipeline or that the pipeline was on land occupied by the defendant at the relevant time. The defendant submits that at all relevant times McConnell Dowell and/or Moltoni were the persons in possession, occupation or control of the pipeline. 
 
 
223.  
As to issue (2) as identified by the defendant, that of vicarious liability, there is here an unusual situation that a person whose act breached the pipeline is an employee of a sub-subcontractor to a subcontractor to the defendant. The defendant submits that it is thus necessary for a court to consider not only the extent to which the defendant had an involvement in the work of the subcontractor, to consider not only the relationship between McConnell Dowell and Moltoni, but also to consider what relationship, if any, existed between the defendant and Moltoni. The defendant submits that the cases in this Court of  
Environment Protection Authority v Munters Pty Ltd 
 (1998) 98 LGERA 279,  
Environment Protection Authority v Taylor Woodrow (Australia) Pty Ltd 
 (1997) 101 LGERA 226 and  
Environment Protection Authority v Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd 
 (1994) 83 LGERA 51 adequately state the principles of law dealing with questions of vicarious liability in prosecutions under s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act. The defendant also relies upon  
Hetherington v Mirvac Pty Ltd 
 [1999] NSWSC 443 as demonstrating that the liability of a principal for the acts of an independent contractor is not unlimited and, when the principles to which that case refers are applied to the facts of this case, could not result in an adverse finding against the defendant on this issue. 
 
 
225.  
The particular facts relied upon by the defendant to refute the allegation of vicarious liability include the following: Moltoni received no instructions from the defendant, other than safety directions consistent with the duties of the safety committee established under the relevant legislation; Moltoni spoke only to Mr Berveridge of McConnell Dowell during the tendering process, not to the defendant; Moltoni never checked the status of the pipeline with the defendant because its contract was with McConnell Dowell; when demolition was occurring the area was barricaded by Moltoni; the hazard identification register was completed by McConnell Dowell and Mr King signed and dated it; when the pipe was found to be close to the works Mr Blair of Moltoni reported that fact to Mr Petracca of McConnell Dowell; the only evidence of control over Moltoni is of McConnell Dowell exercising control over Moltoni and not the defendant exercising control over Moltoni; the defendant subcontracted the substructure works to Mr Connell Dowell because of the latter’s acknowledged expertise in such works; the Moltoni tender documents reveal the unquestionable expertise of Moltoni in demolition works and in particular in wharf demolition; and the defendant did not control and supervise either McConnell Dowell or Moltoni in the manner in which the work was done. 
 
 
226.  
As to issue (3) as identified by the defendant, it submits that the concept of a non-delegable duty of care does not appear to have been previously applied so as to impose criminal liability for a strict liability offence such as 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act. The offence in this case is not a “ 
status 
” offence, the hallmark of which is the nomination of a class or status of person under a statutory obligation, such as a licensee or occupier, so as to give rise to liability for a non-delegable statutory obligation. The defendant relies on  
R v Winson 
 [1969] 1 QB 371, in which Lord Parker CJ, speaking for the Court of Appeal, said that the doctrine of delegation “ 
comes into play and only comes into play in cases ... to which knowledge is inherent 
”; that is, those offences requiring  
mens rea 
.  
 
 
227.  
The defendant further submits that if, despite its submission that s 16(1) does not impose a non-delegable duty, the court finds to the contrary, then the factual matrix of this case does not come within the classes of case in which the existence of a non-delegable duty has been recognised, such as employer/employee, hospital/patient, school/student and claims that previously came under the rule in  
Rylands v Fletcher 
 [1866] LR 1 Ex.265. The defendant submits that expansion of the principle beyond these classes of case is to be exercised with caution (relying upon  
Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris 
 (1995) 188 CLR 313, per Kirby J at 399 ff). Alternatively, the critical aspect of proximity which may elevate the ordinary duty of care to the special duty of care is what is described as the “ 
central feature of control 
”, which the defendant did not have. The defendant submits that either the owner of the wharf and of the pipeline (the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation), the owner of the oil (the Commonwealth of Australia), the ultimate developer (the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd) or the entity responsible for the design and construct contract (Wharf Developments Pty Ltd) better sit within the notion of a “ 
central feature of control 
”. Also absent in this case, in the defendant’s submission, are key factors found in the tort cases of non-delegable duty of care and said to be required before the duty applies, including the special dependence or vulnerability on the part of an identifiable injured party.  
 
 
228.  
As with the prosecutor’s submissions I have attempted to summarise only the defendant’s principal submissions. I comment on the defendant’s subsidiary submissions as necessary in the course of these reasons. 
 
 
Consideration of the issues 
 
 
229.  
It is, I think, convenient to consider the issues in the way they have been identified by the defendant and which I have noted in paragraph 216 above. As I have also noted, the issues identified by the prosecutor tend to overlap, particularly the prosecutor’s issues (i), (ii) and (iv). There is even some overlapping of the prosecutor’s issues (iii) and (v). It is to a consideration of the issues as identified by the defendant that I now turn. 
 
 
Issue (1): Did the defendant pollute the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay or place, cause or permit the pollutant to be placed in a position where it fell or was likely to fall into those waters 
. 
 
 
230.  
I have reformulated this issue to encapsulate the prosecutor’s issues (i), (ii) and (iv) and the defendant’s issue (1).  
 
 
231.  
I have set out in paragraph 15 above the provisions of s 16(1) and (2) of the Clean Waters Act. As noted in the same paragraph, the prosecutor relies upon both subsection (1) and on the deeming provision in subsection (2). As to subparagraph (1) I have noted in paragraph 208 above the prosecutor’s submission that the defendant was in possession of the pollutant and was in control of the premises. I have also noted the prosecutor’s assertion that the defendant was within the definition of “ 
occupier 
” in s 5 of the Clean Waters Act: 
 
 
  
  ‘Occupier’, in relation to any premises, means the person in occupation or control of the premises ... 
   
   
  
 
232.  
I accept the defendant’s submission that the definition of “ 
occupier 
” is inapplicable. Nowhere in s 16 does the word “ 
occupier 
” appear. The word does, however, appear elsewhere in the Act, for example, in ss 17 and 18. The limited operation of a definition in a statute is explained by Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Taylor JJ in  
Gibb v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
 (1956) 118 CLR 628 at 635: 
 
 
  
  The function of a definition clause in a statute is merely to indicate that when particular words or expressions the subject of definition, are found in the substantive part of the statute under consideration, they are to be understood in the defined sense - or are to be taken to include certain things which, but for the definition, they would not include. Such clauses are, therefore, no more than an aid to the construction of the statute and do not operate in any other way. As was said by Sutherland ( 
  Statutes and Statutory Construction 
  , 2nd Ed., vol.2, p. 687), 
   
   
    
    “Such definitions can, in the nature of things, have no effect except in the construction of the statutes themselves”. 
     
     
    
   
  
 
233.  
It follows that where a word is defined in a statute having a particular meaning, that is an artificial meaning which applies solely to the use of that word in the statute. The ordinary meaning of the word does not apply. Conversely, if a word is not defined then the word should be construed according to its ordinary meaning ( 
Louinder v Stuckey 
 [1984] 2 NSWLR 354 at 357, 360 CA). Insofar as the prosecutor asserts that the defendant was the occupier of the Finger Wharf, the defined meaning of the word “ 
occupier 
” has no application and the ordinary meaning of that word must apply, so far as it may be relevant. 
 
 
234.  
The prosecutor also relies on the definition of “ 
pollute 
” (s 5), a word which is used in both subsections (1) and (2) of s 16: 
 
 
  
  “ 
  pollute”, in relation to any waters, means: 
   
   
    
    (a) to place in or on, or otherwise introduce into or on to, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, so that the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed; or 
     
     
    (b) to place in or on, or otherwise introduce into or on to, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any refuse, litter, debris or other matter, whether solid or liquid or gaseous, so that the change in the condition of the waters or the refuse, litter, debris or other matter, either alone or together with any other refuse, litter, debris or matter present in the waters makes, or is likely to make, the waters unclean, noxious, poisonous or impure, detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property of persons, undrinkable for farm animals, poisonous or harmful to aquatic life, animals, birds or fish in or around the waters or unsuitable for use in irrigation, or obstructs or interferes with, or is likely to obstruct or interfere with persons in the exercise or enjoyment of any right in relation to the waters; or 
     
     
    (c) ..., 
     
    
   
  and “pollutant” and “pollution” have corresponding interpretations; 
   
   
  
 
235.  
It can be seen that the offence is established if, pursuant to the deeming provisions in subsection (2) of s 16 it is proved that the defendant placed the pollutant (the marine fuel oil) in a position where it falls or descends, or is likely to fall or descend into the waters, or caused or permitted such matter to be placed in such a position. Moreover, the definition of “ 
pollute 
” is extended to include acts of omission. 
 
 
236.  
In  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
, McClemens CJ at CL considered the effect of similar provisions of the Clean Waters Act. The Act was amended after this decision, but not in a material way. The definition of “ 
pollute 
” with which McClemens CJ at CL was concerned was relevantly as follows: 
 
 
  
  (a) to place in or on the waters any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, so that the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed; or 
   
   
  (b) .... 
   
   
  
 
 Section 16(1), in the form in which it was considered by McClemens CJ at CL, so far as was material, provided: 
 
 
  
  A person shall not ... cause ... any waters to be polluted 
  . 
   
  
 
237.  
McClemens CJ at CL rejected a submission by the defendant in that case that to justify a conviction the prosecution has to prove a placing in or on the water and a causal connection between that placing and the pollution: and the further submission that before there could be a conviction there had to be an active act of placing in or on the water, such as would happen if a man went to the side of a river and threw in the contents of a garbage tin. His Honour said (at 662-663): 
 
 
  
  In my opinion, there is a placing in or on the water, if the pollutant in the possession of the defendant and on his land gets into the water as a direct result of its being where it is; in other words, if the defendant causes it to get there 
  . 
   
   
  
 
238.  
McClemens CJ at CL then turned to the question of whether the defendant  
caused 
 the waters to be polluted. In this respect his Honour referred to and applied the decision of the House of Lords in  
Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
 [1972] AC 824. That was a prosecution under the English Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951, s 2(1) of which provides: 
 
 
  
  .... 
   a person commits an offence ... (a) if he causes or knowingly permits to enter a stream any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter ... 
   
   
  
 
 His Honour relied upon the case only for the purpose of considering the proper definition of the word “ 
cause 
”. His Honour noted (at 663) that Lord Wilberforce (at 834) analysed the distinction between “ 
causing 
” and “ 
knowingly permitting 
” and emphasised that “ 
causing 
” must be given a common sense meaning. His Honour noted (at 664) that Viscount Dilhorne said (at 839-840): 
 
 
  
  What, then, is meant by the word “ 
  caused 
  ” in the subsection? If a man, intending to secure a particular result, does an act which brings that about, he causes that result. If he deliberately and intentionally does certain acts of which the natural consequence is that certain results ensue, may he not also be said to have caused those results even though they may not have been intended by him? 
   
   
  
 
Finally, his Honour referred (at 664) to the judgment of Lord Pearson who expressed the view (at 847) that what or who has caused a certain event to occur is essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense rather than by abstract metaphysical theory. 
 
 
239.  
The facts in  
Majury 
, briefly stated, are that the defendant occupied land upon which was erected a factory and three holding tanks containing potassium cupro cyanide. Between two of the tanks there was a valve on a connecting pipe. The valve was faulty, causing the chemical to escape and drain into the Cooks River. There was no want of proper care on the part of the defendant. McClemens CJ at CL noted that it was conceded that the defendant was the occupier of the premises; and his Honour found as a fact that the process of storing the chemicals was under the exclusive control of the defendant. 
 
 
240.  
In applying  
Alphacell 
 to these facts, McClemens CJ at CL said (at 664): 
 
 
  
  I find as a question of fact that the defendant caused the pollution here. In fairness to the defendants I also find specifically that there is no evidence of want of proper care on its part, but that is not the test. The test is whether it caused the pollution. In my opinion it did. There is no question here of the act of a third party or the act of God. 
   
   
  
 
241.  
Majury 
 was approved and adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
Environmental & Earth Sciences Pty Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority 
 [1999] NSW CCA 192. In that case the appellant had engaged a subcontractor to remove underground tanks at a decommissioned service station and to remove and treat contaminated soil. The contaminated soil was removed to adjoining land where a process of bio-remediation was adopted to allow the removal of contamination of the soil by hydrocarbons. The appellant was responsible for supervising the manner and method of disposal of the contaminated soil and the work was carried out under its instruction. The appellant’s site supervisor supervised the excavations, the on-site placement of soil and on-site validation. Certain bunds were erected by the appellant, hay bale were put in place and silt fences were erected. The work was not executed properly and dirty water bypassed the bunds, the hay bales and the silt fences. One hay bale had been removed. Dirty water flowed downhill from the site and entered a creek. The Court found that there could be no reasonable basis for the conclusion that the works were properly executed and proper supervision was maintained. 
 
 
242.  
Apart from its endorsement of  
Majury 
, I do not derive any assistance from this case. The defendant was, as noted above, responsible for supervising the manner and method of the works. The work was not executed properly and was not properly supervised. Under those circumstances it is not surprising that the verdict of guilty was upheld. Those facts are, however, quite different from those of the present case, in which the prosecutor has not proved that the defendant supervised the manner and method of the work being performed by McConnell Dowell or by Moltoni or their respective employees. 
 
 
243.  
In  
Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
, upon which McClemens CJ at CL relied, the appellants had a manufacturing plant in which wash water was run into two settling tanks and then recirculated and reused. There were two pumps which drew the water out of the settling tanks. At the bottom of the intake pipes of each pump there was a rose, similar to the rose of a watering can, intended to keep out foreign matter while admitting a sufficient flow of water. The pumps failed when bracken, ferns and leaves which had entered the intake pipes through the holes in the rose became wrapped around each impeller. The water overflowed the tanks into a river. The defendant was convicted by magistrates of an offence which was created if a person “ 
causes or knowingly permits to enter a stream any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter 
”. 
 
 
244.  
In the House of Lords, both Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Salmon doubted that the word “ 
knowingly 
” before “ 
permits 
” made any difference to the meaning of the word “ 
permits 
”. Lord Salmon thought that the word “ 
knowingly 
” is probably otiose (at 849). Viscount Dilhorne (at 840) said that whether the inclusion of the word “ 
knowingly 
” before “ 
permits 
” makes any difference to the meaning of “ 
permits 
” is open to doubt, quoting Lord Godard CJ in  
Lomas v Peek 
 [1947] 2 AllER 574, 575: 
 
 
  
  If a man permits a thing to be done, it means that he gives permission for it to be done, and if a man gives permission for a thing to be done, he knows what is to be done or is being done, ... 
   
   
  
 
245.  
As to the meaning of the word “ 
causes 
” in this context, I have referred to the references in the judgments in  
Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
 which were relied upon by McClemens CJ at CL in  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
. In addition to the passages relied upon by McClemens CJ at CL there are other passages from the judgments in  
Alphacell Ltd 
  
 v Woodward 
 to which I wish to return.  
 
 
246.  
Lord Wilberforce, after noting (at 834) that the relevant words are “ 
...if he causes or knowingly permits to enter a stream any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter; ... 
 said: 
 
 
  
  The subsection evidently contemplates two things -  
  causing,  
  which must involve some active operation or chain of operations involving as the result the pollution of the stream;  
  knowingly permitting 
  , which involves a failure to prevent the pollution, which failure, however, must be accompanied by knowledge. 
   
   
  
 
247.  
After stating that “ 
causing 
” must be given a common sense meaning, Lord Wilberforce said:  
There may be difficulties where acts of third persons or natural forces are concerned ... 
.  
 
 
248.  
Viscount Dilhorne noted (at 838) that the immediate cause in that case was the blocking of the impellers. He continued: “ 
When the works were operating, there was, under the system they had instituted, bound to be an overflow into the river unless the pumps provided were of sufficient capacity and working sufficiently to prevent that happening .... In these circumstances I see no escape from the conclusion that it was the acts of the appellants that caused the pollution 
”. After making the statement referred to by McClemens CJ at CL and which I have quoted in para 238 above, Viscount Dilhorne also said (at 840):  
 
 
  
  We have not here to consider what the position would be if pollution were caused by an inadvertent and unintentional act. In such case it might be said that the doer of the act had not caused the pollution although the act had caused it. Here the acts done by the appellants were intentional. They were acts calculated to lead to the river being polluted if the acts done by the appellants, the installation and operation of the pumps, were ineffective to prevent it. Where a person intentionally does certain things which produce a certain result, then it can truly be said that he has caused that result, and here in my opinion the act intentionally by the appellants caused the pollution. 
   
   
  
 
249.  
Lord Pearson said (at 845): 
 
 
  
  Nevertheless, I think that the magistrates and the majority of the Divisional Court were right in holding that the overflow was caused by the activities of the appellants. Those were positive activities and they directly brought about the overflow. What other cause was there? There was no intervening act of a trespasser and no act of God. 
   
   
  
 
250.  
Lord Cross of Chelsea said (at 846) that the section shows “ 
that a man cannot be guilty of causing polluting matter to enter a stream unless at the least he does some positive act in the chain of acts and events leading to that result 
”. In upholding the finding of guilty in that case Lord Cross said: 
 
 
  
  The appellants having started to operate their plant on that day could only escape being held to have caused polluted effluent to enter the river if they proved that the overflow of the tank had been brought about by some other event which could barely be regarded as being beyond their ability to foresee or control 
  . 
   
   
  
 
251.  
Lord Salmon said (at 847) that although the appellants clearly did not cause the pollution intentionally, they caused the pollution by the active operation of their plant. Lord Salmon also said: 
 
 
  
  There was no intervening act of a third party, nor was there any act of God to which it could be attributed. The appellants had been responsible for the design of the plant, everything within their works was under their control; they had chosen all the equipment. 
   
   
  
 
252.  
Both parties in the present case have relied upon the House of Lords case of  
Environment Agency v Empress Car Co (Arbertillery) Ltd 
. In that case the defendant maintained a diesel tank in a yard which was drained directly into a river. The tank was surrounded by a bund to contain spillage, but the defendant had overridden this protection by fixing an extension pipe to the outlet of the tank so as to connect it to a drum standing outside the bund. It appears to have been more convenient to the defendant to draw diesel from the drum than directly from the tank. The outlet from the tank was governed by a tap which had no lock. The tap was opened by a person unknown and the entire contents of the tank ran into the drum, overflowed into the yard and then into the river. The defendant was charged with an offence against a provision as follows: 
 
 
  
  A person contravenes this section if he causes or knowingly permits any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter or any solid waste matter to enter into any controlled waters. 
   
   
  
 
253.  
The case was about whether the defendant  
caused 
 polluting matter to enter the river. In upholding the original conviction of the defendant by the Crown Court the House of Lords held that there was evidence upon which it was open to the Crown Court to find that the defendant had caused the pollution. The principal judgment was delivered by Lord Hoffmann. After referring to the statement of Lord Wilberforce in  
Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
 which I have set out in paragraph 246 above, Lord Hoffman, said (at 354): 
 
 
  
  Putting the matter shortly, if the charge is “ 
  causing 
  ” the prosecution must prove that the pollution was caused by something which the defendant did, rather than merely fail to prevent. It is, however, very important to notice that this requirement is not because of anything inherent in the notion of “ 
  causing 
  ”. It is because of the structure of the subsection which imposes liability under two separate heads: the first limb simply for doing something which causes the pollution and the second for knowingly failing to prevent the pollution. The notion of causing is present in both limbs: under the first limb, what the defendant did must have caused the pollution and under the second limb, his omission must have caused it. ... Liability under the first limb, without proof or knowledge, therefore requires that the defendant must have done something. 
   
   
  
 
254.  
Lord Hoffmann went on to state (at 355) that it was not a requirement that the positive act of the defendant be the immediate cause:  
 
 
  
  The only question was whether something which the defendant had done, whether immediately or antecedently, had caused the pollution. 
   
   
  In the present case, the Crown Court found that the escape was caused by the way the company maintained its tank of diesel fuel. Maintaining a tank of diesel is doing something and therefore, provided that it was open to the court to find the necessary causal connection established, they were in my view entitled to convict. 
   
   
  
 
255.  
Lord Hoffmann proceeded to express the opinion that the active intervention of a third party may, but does not necessarily, negative causal connection. At p 359 Lord Hoffmann said: 
 
 
  
  While liability under section 85(1) is strict and therefore includes liability for certain deliberate acts of third parties and (by parity of reasoning) natural events, it is not an absolute liability in the sense that all that has to be shown is that the polluting matter escaped from the defendant’s land, irrespective of how this happened. It must still be possible to say that the defendant caused the pollution. Take, for example, the lagoons of effluent in  
  Price v Cromack 
   [1975] 1 WLR 988. They leaked effluent into the river and I have said that in my view the justices were entitled to hold that the pollution had been caused by the defendant maintaining leaky lagoons. But suppose that they emptied into the river because a wall had been breached by a bomb planted by terrorists. I think that it would be very difficult to say, as a matter of common sense, that the defendant had caused the pollution. 
   
   
  
 
256.  
On the question of third party involvement or a natural event, Lord Hoffmann also said that foreseeability is not the criterion for deciding whether a person caused something or not. As to the deliberate acts of third parties “ 
... it seems to me that the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary is the only common sense criterion by which one can distinguish those acts which will negative causal connection from those which will not 
” (at 361). Finally, Lord Hoffmann said (at 362): 
 
 
  
  The distinction between ordinary and extraordinary is one of fact and degree to which the justices must apply their common sense and knowledge of what happens in the area. 
   
   
  
 
257.  
On the question of third party involvement or a natural event, Lord Clyde said (at 363): 
 
 
  
  Furthermore, in determining whether the prosecution has proved that the defendant caused the pollutant to enter the waters account has to be taken of natural forces, acts of God and the actions of third parties, if the evidence justifies taking such considerations into account either as contributing causes or even as excluding any operation of the defendant as a causative factor. 
   
   
  
 
258. 
 The Australian authorities, like the English authorities to which I have referred, support the view that the word “ 
knowingly 
” is otiose and also construe the word “ 
permits 
” as meaning “ 
to intentionally allow 
”. Examples of such cases are  
Broad v Parish 
 (1941) 64 CLR 588 at 595, Starke J;  
Miller v Williams 
 (1990) 53 SASR 82 at 87-92; and  
Regina v Lonie & Anor 
 [1999] NSWCCA 319 at [87] et seq. In  
Miller v Williams 
 Cox J said (at 90) that there does not have to be actual knowledge - “ 
a belief that a contravention is highly likely or probable will suffice 
”. Cox J drew a distinction between knowing that something will happen and having reason to anticipate or suspect that it will happen: “ 
the latter is entirely consistent with complete unsuspecting ignorance on a defendant’s part ... but it does not put the test high enough for a crime ... 
”. 
 
 
259.  
In  
Regina v Lonie & Anor 
 the relevant phrase was “ 
suffers or permits 
”. Smart AJ, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal said at [89] that the question of “ 
permitting 
” is usually one of fact. Smart AJ at [90] adopted what was said by Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ in  
Adelaide Corporation v Australasian Performing Rights Association 
 (1928) 40 CLR 481 at 504: 
 
 
  
  Mere inactivity or failure to take some steps [by the owner of the town hall] to prevent the performance of the work [a song in a vocal concert by another] does not necessarily establish permission ... It is a question of fact in each case what is the true inference to be drawn ... . 
   
   
  
 
260.  
In applying the principles which emerge from the abovementioned cases I draw the following conclusions. Subsection (1) of s 16 of the Clean Waters Act is fairly straightforward and clear: a person shall not pollute waters. The offence is clearly established if a person puts a pollutant into waters. In the present case, for example, Mr Manahera infringed this subsection, since it was he who broke the pipe which contained the oil, which then fell into the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay. There is no doubt that he polluted the waters. He placed or otherwise introduced into or on the waters, within the expanded definition of “ 
pollute 
”, a pollutant. I set aside for later consideration the issue of vicarious liability. I do not think it can be said that the defendant polluted the waters in this sense. 
 
 
261.  
I have noted the prosecutor’s submission that the defendant was directly liable under subsection (1) because it was in possession of the pollutant on premises which were under its control and the pollutant got into the waters as a direct result of being where it was. I have also noted the prosecutor’s reliance on  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
 for this submission. 
 
 
262.  
I do not agree with the submission. In  
Majury 
, upon which the prosecutor relies, the offence was: “ 
a person shall not ...  
cause ... 
 any waters to be polluted 
”. The word “ 
cause 
” is no longer part of subsection (1). The submission is only vindicated by recourse to subsection (2). It is under subsection (2) that a defendant may become liable by being in possession of the pollutant on premises which are under its control and the pollutant gets into the waters as a direct result of being where it is. In applying the deeming provision of subsection (2), however, the concept of  
causing 
 extends liability in a common sense way to the natural consequences of what the defendant may have done or omitted to do. This includes liability for the ordinary or natural consequences of the defendant’s conduct, but not for any extraordinary consequences or other contributing causes which exclude any operation of the defendant as a causative factor. 
 
 
263.  
Having regard to the meaning given by the courts to the words “ 
permits 
”, namely, “ 
to intentionally allow 
”, I do not think there is sufficient evidence in this case to require a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant permitted the pollution of waters within the meaning of subsection (2). I have previously referred to both McConnell Dowell and Moltoni’s respective expertise in demolition work and in particular in the demolition of wharf structures. I have also previously referred to the preparation by Moltoni of a work method for the removal of the oil pipes, of which work method Moltoni said: “ 
This will eliminate fire and explosion risks as well as totally controlling oil spillage from pipe residues 
”. In my opinion the only basis upon which the prosecutor might be able to establish liability on the defendant under the subsection is by reliance on the word “ 
causes 
”: that is to say on an assertion that the defendant caused the pollutant, which was in its possession on premises which were under its control, to be placed in a position where it fell or was likely to fall into the waters. 
 
 
264  
I have set out (in paragraph 211 above) some of the facts upon which the prosecutor relies in submitting that the defendant is liable under the deeming provision in subclause (2) of s 16. I have also set out (in paragraph 218 - 222) the defendant’s principal submissions on this issue.  
 
 
265.  
The defendant did not, under the terms of its subcontract with McConnell Dowell, exercise control over the manner in which the work was being done (as noted in paragraph 102 above). I have previously expressed the view (in paragraphs 103 and 109 above) that the provisions of the subcontract do not satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was relevantly in control of the site or of the works which were being performed by McConnell Dowell and by McConnell Dowell’s sub-subcontractor, Moltoni.  
 
 
266.  
I have also previously expressed the view (in paragraph 107 above) that the terms of the subcontract do not require the defendants’ approval of work methods for work carried out by McConnell Dowell or by its sub-subcontractor. I have referred in this context to clause 3A(f) of the subcontract (noted in paragraph 48 above) and there is nothing in the documentary evidence upon which the prosecutor relies to suggest that the defendant approved work methods.  
 
 
267.  
I have noted the nature of the involvement of the defendant in safety matters on the site as described in the evidence of Mr Moltoni and Mr Manahera (in paragraphs 159 and 171 above) and which seem to relate to “ 
housekeeping 
” matters rather than controlling the method of carrying out structural work. I reject the opinions of Mr Rech. He said that he based his opinions on the fact that Mr McElwain had told him that contractually the defendant was in control of the site and he took that for granted. He was not interested in establishing the contractual position which affected who had control of the site or in establishing what was actually happening on the site. There is evidence that the defendant established a safety committee to deal with occupational health and safety matters and that representatives of the defendant were members of that committee. The Occupational Health & Safety Act 1993 requires that there be such a committee when a group of workers under different employers are engaged on the same site. A major priority was the safety of workers. The opinions of Mr Rech as to liability under the Occupational Health and Safety Act are of no relevance, however, to questions of criminal liability under the Clean Waters Act.  
 
 
268.  
Mr Moltoni said that most of the directions on the site were given by McConnell Dowell supervisors and he did not receive any instructions from the defendant. When tendering for the works all of Mr Moltoni’s conversations were with Mr Beveridge. Moltoni was paid by McConnell Dowell (see paragraph 154 above). Mr Moltoni said that at no time did he check with the defendant as to the status of any oil in the pipeline because his contract was with McConnell Dowell (see paragraph 158 above). Mr Blair’s evidence was that Moltoni’s workers got their day to day instructions from Mr John Miow of McConnell Dowell (see paragraph 160 above). Similarly, Mr Blair said that personnel from the defendant did not give instructions or directions in relation to the work. Such instructions came from the demolition supervisor of McConnell Dowell (see paragraph 164 above). I have also referred (in paragraph 167 above) to Mr Manahera’s evidence that he got his instructions from Mr Blair and he understood that Mr Blair got his instructions from McConnell Dowell. 
 
 
269.  
I have set out (in paragraphs 182-191 above) my conclusions relating to the evidence of what actually happened on the site and which left me with the impression that I cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant exercised control over the method and manner of the doing of the substructure works. The overall impression to be gained from the whole of the evidence is that control and responsibility for the substructure works had been passed to McConnell Dowell (as I have noted in paragraph 194 above).  
 
 
270.  
The prosecutor relies,  
inter alia 
, upon directions passed on to McConnell Dowell by the defendant and which were issued by Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd. I have noted that no one from Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd was called to give evidence and explain its role. In the absence of such evidence I can only draw assumptions. The main assumption which I draw is that Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd was the structural engineer acting for The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd. This appears from the Specification and Scope of Works prepared by Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd, the cover sheet of which states that it is prepared for the Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd. It seems to me that, in the absence of direct evidence on the point, the defendant’s involvement was at most to simply pass on directions given by Robert Bird & Partners acting for The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd (the proprietor) relating to the design of the works.  
 
 
271.  
The defendant has pointed out the absence of any witnesses from The Wharf at Woolloomooloo Pty Ltd, Wharf Developments Pty Ltd, Robert Bird & Partners Pty Ltd or McConnell Dowell (amongst others) to explain their various roles and responsibilities in relation to the Finger Wharf project. The evidence establishes that the defendant had some involvement in progressing and scheduling of the work on the Finger Wharf; involvement in some safety issues arising from occupational health and safety legislation; and in ensuring that the quality and structural stability of the completed works was in accordance with the subcontract. The evidence shows that the area in which Moltoni was working was barricaded to keep out persons other than demolition workers and signage was put up to warn people not to enter the barricaded area. The evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt who actually physically occupied or controlled the Finger Wharf while the substructure work was being carried out or which was the subject of the substructure works. And that is to say, I am left with the impression that control and responsibility for the substructure works was with McConnell Dowell and its sub-subcontractor, Moltoni. 
 
 
272.  
This case is quite unlike  
Majury v Sunbeam Corporation Ltd 
 in which it was conceded that the defendant was the occupier of the premises and the process of storing the pollutant was found to be under the exclusive control of the defendant. In the present case the defendant was not the sole occupier of the Finger Wharf. As noted in para 271 above, it is not clear whether the defendant was the occupier of that part of the Finger Wharf while the substructure work was being carried out or which was the subject of the substructure works. The evidence is unclear as to how many occupiers there were of the Finger Wharf at various times and particularly at the time of the oil spill. I have referred (in paragraph 92 above) to the design and construct contract, which does not give exclusive possession of the Finger Wharf to the defendant, but reserves to Wharf Developments, to the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation and to the mortgagee bank and any of their agents and employees access to the site for any purpose. In the present case the evidence does not satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was relevantly in possession of or in control of the Finger Wharf, the pipeline or the oil in the pipeline during the substructure works. (I have noted, amongst other things, that the defendant’s site office was at that time in Lincoln Crescent, adjacent to Wharf 11). 
 
 
273  
In short, the evidence does not satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in possession of the pollutant on premises which it controlled; that is to say, that the defendant was relatively in control of the site and of the manner in which the works were being performed thereon at the time. Neither am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the pollutant to be placed in a position where it fell or was likely to fall into the waters, within the principles discussed in paragraphs 236-262 above.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
Issue (2): Vicarious Liability 
 
 
274  
It is settled law that s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act can attract vicarious criminal liability so as to make a master vicariously responsible for the acts of an employee ( 
Tiger Nominees Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission 
 [1992] 25 NSWLR 715. 
 
 
275.  
It is therefore necessary to consider the nature of vicarious liability and what circumstances must exist to give rise to such liability.  
 
 
276.  
The concept of vicarious liability is a development of the law of torts, in that one person becomes liable for something that someone else has done. It most commonly applies to employers, who will be held liable for the torts of their employees. Vicarious liability is a form of strict liability, whereby the person held to be vicariously liable for the tort need not have been personally at fault. Vicarious liability may arise even if the occurrence of the tortious act, or the omission of the other person, is unknown to the party found to be vicariously liable ( 
Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co Ltd v Long 
 (1957) 97 CLR 36). Historically, an employer or master is responsible to third persons for the tortious actions or omissions of employees or servants which have occurred in the course of the employment or service. In  
Bartonshill Coal Co v McGuire 
 (1858) 3 Macq 300, Lord Chelmsford LC said (at 306): “ 
Every act which is done by a servant in the course of his duty is regarded as done by his master’s orders and consequently is the same as if it were his master’s own act 
”.  
 
 
277.  
The cases make a distinction between the acts of employees and acts of independent contractors. The basic principle is that head contractor will not usually be vicariously liable in negligence to a third party for the negligent acts or omissions of an independent contractor or subcontractor. In  
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Producers and Citizens Co-operative Assurance Co of Australia Ltd 
 (1931) 46 CLR 41, Dixon J said (at 48): 
 
 
  
  In most cases in which a tort is committed in the course of the performance of work for the benefit of another person, he cannot be vicariously responsible if the actual tortfeasor is not his servant and he has not directly authorised the doing of the act which amounts to a tort. The work, although done at his request and for his benefit, is considered as the independent function of the person who undertakes it, and not as something which the person obtaining the benefit does by his representative standing in his place and, therefore, identified with him for the purpose of liability arising in the course of its performance. The independent contractor carries out his work, not as a representative but as a principal.  
   
   
  
 
278.  
There are two exceptions to this principle: (i) where the principal has  
directly 
 authorised the doing of the tortious act ( 
Stoneman v Lyons 
 (1975) 8 ALR 173); and (ii) where the principal engages the independent contractor to exercise a duty of the principal and the independent contractor fails to do so ( 
Smith v Lewis 
 (1945) 70 CLR 256,  
Perl Exporting Ltd v Camden LBC 
 [1984] 1 QB 342,  
Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office 
 [1970] AC 1004 and  
Kondis v State Transport Authority 
 (1984) 154 CLR 652).  
 
 
279.  
The distinction between employees and contractors has been modified to meet the ever-widening definition of employee (Chin B,  
Losing control: The difference between employees and independent contractors after Vabu v Commissioner of Taxation 
 (1996) 34 Law Society Journal (No 10) p 52). It is to be noted, however, that in the case of  
Vabu Pty Ltd 
  
v The Commissioner of Taxation 
 (Court of Appeal, 6 September 1996, unreported) Meagher and Sheller JJA held that there was no employer/employee relationship between a courier company and the couriers who worked for it. The Court found that the couriers worked for themselves rather than providing “ 
their labour in the service of another 
”.  
 
 
280.  
Liability for the acts and omissions of an independent contractor may arise if the work done was “ 
subject to the control and direction of the employer in the actual execution of the work 
” ( 
Humberstone v Northern Timber Mills 
 (1949) 79 CLR 389 at 396). Thus, vicarious liability of a principal for an independent contractor may arise through “ 
direct authorisation of the tortious act 
” ( 
Kondis v State Transport Authority 
 (1984) 154 CLR 672 at 698, per Brennan J). 
 
 
281.  
It is self-evident that the question whether vicarious liability exists ultimately depends upon the circumstances of the case ( 
Mount Albert Borough Council v Johnson 
 [1979] 2 NZLR 234,  
Environment Protection Authority v Munters Pty Ltd 
 (1998) 98 LGERA 279). The rationale behind imposing vicarious liability upon an employer has traditionally been the nature and degree of control exercised by the employer over the “ 
actual performance of the work 
” of the employee ( 
Honeywill & Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd 
 [1934] 1 KB 191; [1933] All ER 77). The degree of control is not necessarily the determining factor of the existence of vicarious liability. The High Court, in  
Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd 
 (1986) 160 CLR 16, moved away from the “ 
control test 
” to determine whether an employer/employee relationship existed. Following this trend, Meagher JA said in  
Vabu Pty Ltd v The Commissioner of Taxation 
 that “ 
the old test of control is now superseded by something more flexible 
”. Control, however, is still one of the main factors in determining both the relationship between the parties and whether a non-delegable duty exists ( 
Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris 
 (1997) 71 ALJR 1428, 146 ALR 572 which I discuss under issue (3)).  
 
 
282.  
In  
Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd 
 Mason J stated: “ 
The existence of control, whilst significant, is not the sole criterion by which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment 
” (at 24). In that case, a sawmiller (Brodribb) had general supervision over the operations of sniggers and truckers, but did not exercise control over the method by which sniggers and truckers carried out their work. Evidence was adduced that the sniggers and truckers provided and maintained their own equipment, set their own hours of work and were paid according to the volume of timber delivered to the mill (at 25). The High Court held unanimously that neither a trucker nor",2001-12-02 00:00:00,NSW Land and Environment Court

    Judgment [No 10] - Direction on Identification 
     
      
    1 KIRBY J: An issue arose during the trial in respect of which I gave a ruling, undertaking to later provide reasons. This judgment contains those reasons.  
     
      
    2 The Crown foreshadowed a request under s165(2)(a) of the Evidence Act, 1995 for a warning that certain evidence may be unreliable. The evidence was from a witness who identified the deceased at a time, and in circumstances, inconsistent with the Crown case. 
     
      
    3 It is the Crown case that the deceased went to the accused’s flat at about 5.00 pm on 30 April 1982. She was travelling to Brisbane by bus that evening. The bus was scheduled to leave at 11.00 pm. She was supposed to meet friends beforehand at the New England Hotel. When she did not appear at the hotel, her friends became concerned. They went to the flat of Mr Rose, arriving at about 10.45 pm. Mr Rose answered the door. He told the deceased’s friends that his wife was not there, and that she had “gone off with a young bloke” at about 6.30 pm. 
     
      
    4 The disappearance of Mrs Kristine Rose received considerable publicity. Within three days of her disappearance, on 3 May 1982, Mr Dawson came forward. He was the proprietor of the Centrepoint Laundromat in Armidale. He told the police that he had seen the photograph of the missing woman on television. He recognised her. She had been to his laundromat between 9.00 pm and 9.30 pm on the night that she disappeared (30 April 1982). He spoke to her. She told him that she was on her way to Brisbane by bus. 
     
      
    5 Mr Dawson was again interviewed on 26 May 1982, after the body of Kristine Rose had been found in a creek bed six kilometres from Armidale. He said that he was certain that the woman in the photograph was the woman in the laundromat. 
     
      
    6 The Crown relies upon s165(1)(b) of the Evidence Act, 1995, which is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “s165(1) Unreliable evidence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) identification evidence; .... ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Once a party requests a warning, the Judge is obliged to provide that warning (s165(2)(a)), unless there are good reasons for not doing so (s165(3)). 
     
      
    8 Mr Stratton contends that the warning should not be given. He points to the definition of “identification evidence” in the Dictionary which accompanies the Act. Identification evidence is the identification of the accused. The definition is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Identification evidence means evidence that is: 
        
       
       
        
         
         (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where: 
          
           
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) an act connected to that offence was done; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such assertion.” 
         
        
       
      
    9 Mr Stratton suggests that the asymmetry in the Act is quite deliberate. It is consistent with the approach taken with respect to accomplice evidence. In respect of that part of an accomplice’s evidence that may support an accused, no accomplice direction should be given (Jamison, Elliot and Blessington (1992) 60 A Crim R 68; Gleeson CJ with whom Lee AJ and Hope AJA agreed; R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151, per Ipp AJA, para 27). 
     
      
    10 The argument has some force. However, I think the better view is that a warning under s165 is appropriate. I take that view for a number of reasons. First, providing a warning is consistent with the purpose of s165. If I may be forgiven for quoting my own judgment (with which Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ agreed), the purpose was stated in R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298, in these terms: (at para 62) 
     
      
       
        
        “In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may over-estimate the probative value of certain evidence (see ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 1017)…..” 
         
        
       
      
    11 Secondly, identification evidence is specifically dealt with in s116 of the Act. If Mr Stratton’s argument were right, s165(1)(b) has little or no work. Section 116(1)(a) and (b) mirror the requirements of s165(2)(a), (b) and (c). I think the better view is that s116 is the specific provision dealing with identification of defendants in criminal trials. Section 165 is the general provision. It is not confined to criminal proceedings (contrast s165(1)(d) and (e) with s165(1)(g)). It includes situations analogous to the various categories identified in s165(1), where the danger of the evidence is not obvious and the purposes of s165 are served (such as the identification of a motor vehicle, or objects) (R v Clout (1995) 41 NSWLR 312, per Kirby ACJ (with whom Allen and Dowd JJ agreed); R v Lowe (1997) 98 A Crim R 300, per Hunt CJ at CL, esp 314 to 318). 
     
      
    12 Thirdly, the generality of s165 is reinforced by the opening words. The section applies to evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable” (cf R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; esp Howie J). There follows the words “including the following kinds of evidence”, with a list of seven classes of evidence. The list is not exhaustive (Beazley JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreed) in R v Lewis (CCA, unreported, 8.9.98) at p17)). The combined force of these two expressions (“of a kind that may be unreliable” and “including the following kinds of evidence”) authorises the use of analogy. 
     
      
    13 Here, the same considerations that may make the evidence of an eye witness identifying an accused unreliable, apply to the identification by Mr Dawson of the deceased. The need to acquaint a jury, with matters of which they may otherwise be unaware, applies equally to such evidence. 
     
      
    14 Having said that, it must be acknowledged that the matter is not free from doubt. This has been a long trial, and one postponed for almost two decades. I believe that caution is warranted. In the circumstances, I will not tell the jury, in terms, that the evidence of identification may be unreliable. Rather, I will draw to their attention the need to consider the reliability of such evidence, and the sorts of issues that they may think appropriate to address.

      Regina v JCJ 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Barr J: The applicant, to whom I shall refer as ""JCJ"", seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her by Shadbolt DCJ. The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of enticing away her sister, whom I shall call ""the complainant"", with intent to hold her for the advantage of herself and another, whom I shall called ""CA"", and to a count that she had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation constituted by the presence of CA. 
      
       
     2 The first count attracted a maximum sentence of fourteen years’ imprisonment and the second twenty years’. For each count his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years and fixed a non-parole period of one year. 
      
       
     3 I should observe at the outset that the indictment was not calculated to express precisely the criminality of the case that was by common consent conducted before his Honour. The substance of the case, as will appear, was the detention of the complainant for a period of some thirty-six hours. The section under which the charge was brought embraces a charge of such detention. No point is taken upon appeal about the form of the indictment. If the point had been taken before the sentencing Judge his Honour would have directed the amendment of the indictment so as to plead detention. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was nineteen years old and had a sister aged sixteen and a half years. Their father, who had separated from their mother, had died and left each of them a substantial amount of money in trust. The applicant met CA, a man, at the end of 1996 and soon afterwards entered into a sexual relationship with him which continued throughout the events which followed. During their relationship they apparently spent a good deal of the applicant’s money. CA began to get ideas about getting his hands on money held in trust for the complainant. He and the applicant borrowed $1200 from her on a promise to repay it within a week. They did not repay it. It must be inferred that CA was also sexually attracted to the complainant. He and the applicant devised a plan. The applicant told the complainant one evening that she had a financier who was temporarily in the district and who would hand over the $1200 if she went to meet him. The applicant named a point on a main road not far from where the complainant was living. The complainant went to the place, saw nobody and returned home. The applicant saw this and persuaded the complainant to return to the spot. There was a car waiting. In it were CA and another man, who was driving. The complainant got in and they took her to a park. There CA threatened her at knife point, berated her for her allegedly inappropriate way of dealing with the applicant and him and forced her to drink a bottle of vodka. She passed out. She awoke the next day in the flat occupied by the applicant and CA. She was feeling ill from the vodka. She found that most of her clothes had been removed and that she had been put in the shower. She was held captive for about thirty-six hours. She was put in terror by CA who held a bread knife to her throat. He told her that it would be easy to kill her. He and the applicant discussed ways of killing people, some of them quite revolting. The things that CA said and did over the hours reduced any resistance the complainant might have offered to his demands.  
      
       
     5 He made her masturbate herself in front of him, perform fellatio on him and submit to a large number of acts of sexual intercourse. It is unnecessary to say more than that the details of what CA did and said were disgusting. The applicant was present for most of this period and for most of the things that CA said and did. She committed the second offence when she required the complainant to perform fellatio in a particular manner on CA. 
      
       
     6 As a result of the acts perpetrated upon her and the threats made to her the complainant experienced serious difficulties. During the months immediately afterwards she felt constantly fatigued and run down and suffered from severe bouts of anxiety. She was anxious when in cars with people, even her closest friends, whenever she did not know exactly where they were going. She experienced nightmares and feelings of shame and embarrassment. She had to complete her HSC over two years rather than the one year she had intended to take. She resented the loss of a year in her academic life. She felt betrayed by what her sister had done. As she said in her victim impact statement, she lost so much innocence and was forced to grow up at sixteen. 
      
       
     7 Some distinction needs to be made between the written submissions and the oral submissions made in this court.  
      
       
     8 It was submitted in writing on behalf of the applicant that the sentences of three years’ imprisonment and the non-parole period were manifestly excessive. It was submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to the evidence of the relationship between the applicant and CA. It began at the beginning of 1997. It was not long before the applicant's father died after a long illness. CA had an overbearing personality and the applicant soon became convinced that her former life had been worthless, whereas CA had introduced her to a wonderful world. She became enthralled by him. The relationship was not very old by the time he began to subject her to mental and then physical abuse. He frequently became angry with her and lashed her with his tongue. Later on he beat her. On an occasion he took a pillow and put it over her face and sat on her. Even so, she could not contemplate leaving him because she could not comprehend a world without him. 
      
       
     9 Experts' reports were put before his Honour, one from a senior hospital social worker who had come in contact with the applicant during her father's fatal illness, and two reports from clinical psychologists. It appears that the applicant had had a history of difficulty at school, having suffered depression, social withdrawal and an eating disorder. She had seen a number of health professionals, a school counsellor and a psychiatrist. There had been evidence of mood deterioration with emotional lability, tearfulness, fearfulness, anger outbursts and argumentativeness. No doubt these symptoms were contributed to by the deteriorating family situation in which her mother separated from her father and her father contracted his last illness. 
      
       
     10 According to Mr Borenstein, clinical psychologist, the applicant's resulting disequilibrium, social isolation and lack of self-definition made her vulnerable to the sort of pathological relationship she shared with CA. He thought that he had led her down a destructive path which she could not escape, given the degree of her emotional attachment to him and because of the control which he thereby exercised. 
      
       
     11 According to Dr Lennings, psychologist, the applicant appeared to suffer from a mixed disorder characterised by depression and anxiety best thought of as a rather chronic adjustment disorder. The primary problem appeared to be the development of a mixed type of personality disorder in which both schizoid and borderline features were prominent. The schizoid features contributed to the inability to appreciate the needs of others and her sense of social and emotional isolation and the borderline features were marked by her excessive dependence needs and her inability to obtain true insight into them. 
      
       
     12 Dr Lennings thought that the applicant had shown a long history of anxiety and depression since at least early adolescence and had developed a personality disorder characterised by emotional distortion and severe dependency. Such a disorder had led to the suspension of her reality testing and critical faculties. It was highly likely, he thought, that her excessive dependency led her into attempting to please and accommodate the needs of those she was dependent on irrespective of the cost to her own self-esteem and identity. 
      
       
     13 His Honour expressed himself as satisfied that the applicant was deeply under the influence of CA. His Honour concluded that the part she played in the criminal activity was in consequence much less than his. Having reviewed these matters and the manifestations of the applicant's psychological malaise, his Honour observed that those subjective circumstances should weigh very heavily in her favour. 
      
       
     14 His Honour gave considerable thought to the applicant's psychological state which, he observed, was undoubtedly febrile. Nevertheless, his Honour observed, the offences were extraordinarily grave, committed as they were on a young woman by a person in a position of trust.  
      
       
     15 An unusual event took place during the hearing. The Crown Prosecutor not only supported defence counsel's submissions and informed his Honour that the imposition of a sentence other than one of full time custody would not be appealably wrong, a submission, I think, that was not justified. The Crown Prosecutor went on to tell his Honour that he had spoken to the complainant, who had an earnest desire that the applicant should not be sent to prison. His Honour already knew that as a result of what the complainant had said in her victim impact statement, which was in evidence. Even so, the Crown Prosecutor offered to call the complainant to give evidence. He had closed his case and was refused leave to re-open it. In the circumstances defence counsel called the complainant. When cross-examining her the Crown Prosecutor went to some trouble to adduce from her evidence of her understanding of the control which CA must have exercised over the applicant, judging by her own experience at his hands. In due course the Crown Prosecutor, as I have said, supported the submission of the defence counsel. 
      
       
     16 His Honour observed that neither counsel had drawn to his attention any case where, in the face of pleas of guilty to such counts, a course other than full time imprisonment had been taken. His Honour doubted the existence of any such case and described as unhelpful the submissions of the Crown Prosecutor. With respect to his Honour, that is a view that, in my opinion, his Honour was entitled to take. 
      
       
     17 The written submissions in this court were based upon an underlying premise that his Honour was bound to impose a sentence less than a sentence of full time custody. Realistically, I think, by the time the matter was argued in this court counsel was taking a rather different approach to the matter. 
      
       
     18 Two submissions were made. The first attacked the process by which his Honour arrived at the sentences ultimately imposed. His Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Had the matter gone to trial I am of the view that a sentence of six years imprisonment would have been appropriate having regard to all the objective circumstances and the subjective circumstances. But she pleaded guilty. She is now contrite and has saved the State a trial and intends to assist the Crown in prosecuting CA. I am of the view that this should sound in the discount of fifty per cent."" 
         
        
       
     19 It was submitted first that the starting point of six years selected by his Honour was too high. It was submitted that this was an entirely unusual case and reference was made in general and in particular to the evidence, lay and expert, going to demonstrate the thrall in which the applicant was to CA throughout the currency of these matters. Understandably, no statistical material could be put before this court. 
      
       
     20 This offence was of a nature so serious as to be quite unusual. But I have not been persuaded, in view of the enormous seriousness of the acts carried out by the applicant, that his Honour fell into error in taking a six year sentence as a starting point, even giving full weight to the multiplicity of evidence demonstrating the vulnerable position the applicant was in and the control that CA exercised over her. 
      
       
     21 The second attack was made upon some remarks that his Honour made which may be read as doubting whether the applicant, when she appeared before him, was genuinely contrite. The circumstances that gave rise to his Honour's remarks were as follows. After the offences the relationship between the applicant and CA continued. After they were charged they continued to be together. They had a common solicitor and apparently intended to plead not guilty at a joint trial. On the weekend before the trial was due to begin the applicant, having received some advice, saw a new solicitor. That was apparently because she realised that CA had been having conferences with their solicitor without her knowledge. She ended her relationship with CA.  
      
       
     22 Evidence of these matters began to be adduced before his Honour but his Honour cut the evidence short, apparently because he believed that privileged matters might otherwise be unwittingly exposed.  
      
       
     23 Later on, having observed and accepted that CA had influenced such serious control over the applicant, his Honour drew attention to the circumstances in which she had separated from him and wondered quite how she might have done so at such short notice and on what his Honour assumed was advice or recommendation of the new solicitor. So his Honour doubted the genuineness of the applicant’s claim to be contrite. 
      
       
     24 This court was informed that there was evidence which would have been adduced if his Honour had not stopped the questions. It would have shown that matters were not as his Honour assumed and that the reason for and that the circumstances in which the applicant broke free of CA were not as his Honour had understood. 
      
       
     25 It is apparent, though, from what his Honour said at a later point in his judgment that he came to the view that the applicant was contrite. His Honour said so having seen and listened to the applicant as she gave evidence. I do not doubt that that was his Honour’s ultimate unqualified finding. 
      
       
     26 My opinion in this regard is fortified by the fact that his Honour allowed the applicant a fifty per cent discount from the sentence he would otherwise have imposed for the combined circumstances of the plea of guilty, her contrition and her offer of assistance in giving evidence at any trial of CA if called upon to do so. 
      
       
     27 As the authorities make clear, fifty per cent is about the most that his Honour could properly have allowed for the combination of those circumstances. It seems to follow, therefore, that the applicant could not reasonably have expected to be given any greater consideration than she was for her contrition. 
      
       
     28 There is one last matter. I have already observed that there was before his Honour evidence that the complainant did not want the applicant to be sent to prison. During the hearing of this appeal the court was informed about a letter that the complainant had written to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The letter reiterated the complainant's earnest wish that the applicant not go to prison or remain in prison. It referred to the complainant's observation of the suffering that the applicant had undergone both before and after sentence. 
      
       
     29 This court would not wish the complainant or the applicant or any members of their family to misunderstand the great sympathy that this court holds towards people in positions like those of the complainant. As well as being a most serious matter, this is also a very sad matter and has caused anguish and suffering not only to the complainant but to others as well. 
      
       
     30 Two things need to be said, however. The first is that this is not a sentencing court. This court does not hear the facts and argument a second time and impose a sentence. This court has no power to sentence unless error is demonstrated in the court below. It will be apparent from what I have said that I detect no error in his Honour's approach. 
      
       
     31 The second thing is this, that whilst it is always open to persons in the position of the complainant to make known to the Court their desire, it is the Court whose opinion must be given effect to. Only the court can have the breadth of view and understanding of the principles necessary for the proper administration of a fair system of sentencing. The Court, for example, has to consider sentences by reference to the deterrence that they may cause to other people who have nothing to do with the case. 
      
       
     32 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     33 ADAMS J: I agree with what has been said by the learned presiding Judge but I wish to add a comment of my own. Some of the argument in this case has proceeded upon the basis which seems to me to be mistaken that the complainant exercised no free will at all in relation to the acts for which she was convicted. The defence of duress is available to a person whose will does not accompany the acts with which they are charged. No such defence was raised to these charges in the District Court. It must follow, therefore, that to some extent or other her own will did accompany her acts with which she is charged and it is to that extent that she is held to be criminally responsible for what occurred. The judgment of how far her will accompanied those acts, that is, had her actual assent, is very much a question for the sentencing Judge to determine. He had a great deal of material before him and he clearly accepted the medical evidence which was submitted on the applicant's behalf. For myself I am not so certain that I would have started at the commencement point that his Honour nominated before making the fifty per cent discount. On the other hand, I think that the fifty per cent discount was significantly more generous than the authorities could justify.  In the end, therefore, I am not satisfied that his Honour's sentence was wrong. For these reasons, together with those articulated by the learned presiding Judge, I agree with the orders his Honour proposes.34 BARR J: The orders of the court, therefore, are as I have proposed.

      WEDNESDAY 31ST OCTOBER 2001 
      
      
      Regina v Hung Duc DANG 
     The appellant was indicted on one charge of murder (s 19A Crimes Act 1900), robbery in company (s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900), and use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension (s 33B Crimes Act 1900). The appellant pleaded guilty to the second and third counts and not guilty to the count of murder. Following a trial by jury the appellant was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of two and two and a half years respectively for the first two counts and a cumulative sentence of seven and a half years for the offence of manslaughter. It was the Crown case that the principal and appellant had embarked upon a joint criminal enterprise to rob someone, and that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter by reason of the principles applicable to extended criminal enterprise (common purpose) when following their commission of such a robbery his co-offender killed a would-be pursuer). The evidence showed in this regard that both the appellant and the principal carried knives. After committing the robbery they were pursued from the scene by bystanders to the robbery. Shortly after separating but while still being pursued the principal stabbed the victim who was attempting to detain him. In the meantime the appellant drew his knife and wounded one member of the group who had followed him. The appellant appeals against the conviction on the basis that it was not capable of being supported by the evidence and the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to whether: (1) the killing occurred at a time when the joint enterprise to rob was still on foot, or whether it was an act isolated from that venture for which the principal alone was responsible; (2) it was in the contemplation of the appellant that the co-offender might do an unlawful and dangerous act with a knife by stabbing someone otherwise than in self defence.The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that the sentence imposed for manslaughter was manifestly excessive.HELD (Appeal dismissed)1: Whether the stabbing was part of the joint criminal enterprise The Crown case was that the offence was similar to a bank robbery, in that the joint enterprise did not come to an end until the robbers had made an escape from the scene of the crime. That was an appropriate analogy to make and the evidence did not leave occasion for any reasonable doubt. 2. Whether the use of a knife other than in self defence was in the contemplation of the appellantWhat was in issue was the subjective contemplation of the appellant concerning the possible use by the principal of the knife which he was carrying. In deciding that question it was open to the jury to draw an inference as to what was in his mind, by reference to the surrounding circumstances, and the admissions in the ERISP. The evidence did not leave open as a reasonable possibility any inference other than what the Crown needed to prove to establish manslaughter. McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 applied3. Whether the sentence for manslaughter was manifestly excessiveThe offences committed by the appellant were serious and there was a need for general and personal deterrence. Although the sentence was a heavy one it was not outside the legitimate range of sentencing discretion.House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) HCA 54 applied.ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. (2) Leave to appeal sentence granted, but appeal dismissed.(3) Conviction and sentence below confirmed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL 
     2   WOOD CJ AT CL: The appellant was indicted before James J, on 22 May 2000, in the Supreme Court, on the following charges: 
      
       
      a) the murder of John Lawrence Hammond (S 19A Crimes Act 1900) - maximum penalty life imprisonment; 
       
       
      b) robbery in company of one ladies handbag, the property of Monica Kaskardi: (S 97(1) Crimes Act 1900) - maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment); and 
       
       
      c) the use of an offensive weapon, namely a knife, to prevent lawful apprehension (S 33B Crimes Act 1900) - maximum penalty 12 years imprisonment) 
       
     3   All of the offences charged were committed on 25 April 1999. The appellant pleaded guilty to the second and third counts, and not guilty to the count of murder. A jury was empanelled, but later discharged without returning a verdict in relation to the last mentioned count. A fresh trial commenced on 16 October 2000, confined to the count of murder. The appellant again pleaded not guilty. On 19 October 2000, he was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  
     4   He was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of two, and two and a half years, respectively, for the offences of robbery in company and the use of a knife to prevent lawful apprehension. For the offence of manslaughter he was sentenced to a cumulative sentence of imprisonment of seven and a half years, with a non parole period of four years. This resulted in a total effective sentence of ten years, with a six and a half year non parole period. 
     5   He now appeals against the manslaughter conviction upon the sole ground that it was not capable of being supported having regard to the evidence, or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice. He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, upon the basis that it was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
      Facts 
       
     6   On the afternoon of 25 April, the appellant and his co-accused Nhat Than Ton went into the City together. Each was carrying a knife; that carried by the appellant having been given to him by Ton. Although they did not set out with any specific plan to rob anyone, the appellant acknowledged that they had a mutual understanding that, if an opportunity arose to take someone’s handbag, they would do so. 
     7   At about 9.00pm. Monica Kaskardi, who was on her way to meet friends in George Street in the City, withdrew some money from ATM machines at the Westpac Bank, and at the Colonial State Bank in Castlereagh Street. The last mentioned bank was located midway between Liverpool and Bathurst Streets. After walking five or ten steps and crossing to the opposite side of Castlereagh Street, she felt someone grab her bag from behind. She fell to the ground. The strap to her bag broke and the man pulling upon it moved away. That man she identified as the appellant. Another man, who was shown to be Ton, was standing beside him. 
     8   These two men ran off in a northerly direction along Castlereagh Street. Ms Kaskardi ran after them. At first they stayed together, but after a short distance, upon Ton’s instruction, they split up. The appellant turned to the right into Bathurst Street and then left, into Elizabeth Street. Ms Kaskardi followed him. Three other men joined in this pursuit and eventually overpowered him. In the course of the struggle which occurred before he was subdued, one of the men (Phillip Merino) suffered a cut to his hand. That injury was inflicted by the knife which was carried by the appellant, and which he produced during the struggle 
     9   The circumstances in which this knife was used by him require further mention since they have some relevance for the way in which the Crown case was presented. When the pursuers, Yakup Erklic and Phillip Merino found the appellant, he was hiding behind a pylon. They jumped on him, and during the ensuing scuffle, Mr. Erklic saw the appellant swing his left arm at Mr. Merino. He noticed that Mr. Merino was bleeding from a large gash in the right wrist. He instructed the appellant to drop the knife, which he then did. When police arrived he was handed over to them.  
     10   Mr. Hong Ta, who was driving down Castlereagh Street shortly after Ms Kaskardi’s bag was snatched, saw an Asian woman chasing a man who was about fifteen metres in front of her. A little further down the street, he saw two people (Mr. Hammond and the co-accused Ton) on the western footpath of that street, near the fire station, struggling with one another. Mr. Hammond had hold of the co-accused who was trying to break free. Mr Hammond yelled out help, and the co-accused ran off. A paramedic who responded almost immediately found that Mr. Hammond had two lacerations under his left armpit. He said to the paramedic, “I went to help a girl in distress and a guy swung around and stabbed me”.  
     11   When taken to hospital, he was found to have a stab wound to the interior axilla with penetration of the soft tissues above the rib cage on the left; and another stab wound in the left posterior axilla, which penetrated the chest, left lung and left pulmonary hilum and which had damaged a major pulmonary vein leading to significant blood loss into the plural cavity. He was also seen to have some superficial incised wounds to the left upper arm. His subsequent death was attributed to blood loss and possibly to an air embolism, occasioned by the second of the wounds mentioned. 
     12   The co-accused was not arrested until 27 April. He was charged with murder, to which he had pleaded by the time of the appellant’s trial.  
     13   The appellant did not give evidence at his trial but relied upon his good character and upon the answers in the ERISP, it being submitted on his behalf that: 
      
       
      a) there was no evidence that the appellant had contemplated the use of the knife by his co-accused to stab anyone; 
       
       
      b) the criminal enterprise between him and the co-accused had been a spur of the moment event, which had concluded before Mr. Hammond was stabbed. 
       
     14   It was common ground that neither the accused or Ton presented their knives at the time of the robbery. It was, however, the Crown case that they had the knives available for use, in order to stab anyone who tried to stop them, and that their joint enterprise remained on foot while they were making their escape from the scene of the robbery. 
      
       
      Directions to the Jury 
       
     15   It was upon that basis that the case was left to the jury, who were relevantly instructed in the following terms, first in relation to the offence of murder: 
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that the accused is guilty of the crime of the murder of Mr. Hammond or, if not of the crime of the murder of Mr. Hammond, of the crime of the manslaughter of Mr. Hammond, pursuant to certain legal principles which can be conveniently referred to as principles of joint criminal enterprise or common purpose. If two persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise then, subject to certain conditions - and that qualification is important - each of them can be legally responsible for an act of the other done in the course of the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise. The Crown must establish inter alia the existence of a joint criminal enterprise and the participation in that joint criminal enterprise by the accused. In the present case, broadly speaking, the Crown says that the accused and Mr. Ton entered into a joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi, the accused participated in that joint criminal enterprise and that Mr. Ton killed Mr. Hammond in the course of the carrying out of that joint criminal enterprise.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour appropriately drew attention to the existence of a real issue as to whether the stabbing of the deceased occurred in the course of the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise to rob Monica Kaskardi, or after the enterprise had concluded.  
      (Summing up paras 96-99). 
       
     16   His Honour then went on to deal with the extended joint criminal enterprise or common purpose aspect of the Crown case concerning those events which the appellant contemplated might be done as incidents in the joint criminal enterprise to rob Ms Kaskardi. In this regard the jury was instructed: 
      
       
        
        “The fifth element of the offence of murder which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is that, at the time of entering into the joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi and up to and including the time of the stabbing the accused contemplated that, as an incident in the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi, Mr. Ton might use the knife to stab someone, otherwise than in self-defence, with the intention of killing or with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm and the accused, having that contemplation, continued to participate in the joint criminal enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi.” 
        
       
     17   In amplification of this direction, his Honour explained that it was sufficient for the Crown to show that the appellant contemplated the possibility that the knife might be used in this way (summing up p. 105), in the course of which he instructed the jury: 
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused contemplated that Mr. Ton  
        would 
         use the knife to stab someone, in the circumstances referred to in element five. It is, however, necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused contemplated that there was a  
        substantial risk, as distinct from a slender chance 
        , that Mr. Ton  
        might 
         use the knife to stab someone in the circumstances alleged. However, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused contemplated that it was  
        probable 
         that Mr. Ton might use the knife to stab someone in the circumstances mentioned.” 
        
       
     18   The circumstances “referred to” or “alleged” or “mentioned” of which his Honour spoke in this paragraph, derived their content from the preceding paragraph in which his Honour had repeated that the Crown had to prove that the accused contemplated that, as an incident in the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise, Ton might use the knife to stab some one, otherwise than in self defence, and with the intention required for murder. This qualifications to the directions his Honour regarded as supported by the decisions of the High Court in Johns v The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 108 per Stephen J at 119, and per Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ at 130 to 131; and in Miller v The Queen (1980) 32 ALR 321 at 326/7. 
     19   In McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108, the Court approved (at 115) the following passage in the judgment of Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ in Johns at (130 -131): 
      
       
        
        “In our opinion these decisions support the conclusion reached by Street CJ [in the court below] namely ‘that an accessory before the fact bears, as does the principal in the second degree, a criminal liability for an act which was within the contemplation of both himself and the principal in the first degree as an act which  
        might 
         be done in the course of carrying out the primary criminal intention - an act contemplated as a  
        possible 
         incident of the originally planned particular venture’.” 
        
       
     20   Approval was also given, in the judgment, to the principle referred to by Sir Robin Cook, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, in Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen (1985) AC 168 at 175, whereby a secondary party, acting in concert with a primary offender, is criminally liable for acts done by the primary offender of a type which the secondary party foresees but does not necessarily intend. 
     21   In Johns, Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ similarly spoke in terms of the act in contemplation being of the “kind (which occurred) should the occasion arise” (at 131-132) and see also R v Powell (1999) 1 AC 1 at 28. 
      
       
     22   When directing the jury on manslaughter, his Honour effectively repeated these directions, so far as the aspects of joint criminal enterprise and the contemplation of the appellant were concerned. In explaining the difference between murder and manslaughter, his Honour concentrated upon the circumstance that, for the latter offence, it was not necessary for the Crown to show that at the time of stabbing the deceased, Ton had the intention of killing him or of inflicting grievous bodily harm. Rather, it had to show that his act was unlawful and dangerous, as that expression has been explained in Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313. 
      
       
      His Honour then added: 
       
       
        
        “As I have told you, a dangerous act is an act which a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised would expose the person stabbed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused contemplated that, as an incident in the carrying out of the joint criminal enterprise to rob, Mr. Ton  
        might do an unlawful and dangerous act with the knife by stabbing someone, otherwise than in self- defence 
        , and that the accused, having that contemplation, continued to participate. 
        
       
       
        
        What I said previously about the word ‘might’ in giving you directions about element 5 of murder applies also to element 5 of manslaughter. It is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused contemplated that an act of such a kind as to be a dangerous act  
        might 
         be done.” ( 
        summing/up paras 190 and 191) 
        
       
     23   The case was accordingly left, both in relation to murder and manslaughter in accordance with the judgment of the High Court in McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 where it was said (at 114): 
      
       
        
        “… each of the parties to the arrangement of understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose.” 
        
       
       
     24   This kind of case has been conveniently tagged as one involving an “extended joint criminal enterprise”: R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 and R v Chai (2000) NSW CCA 320. 
     25   There was no objection to these directions either at trial, or upon the appeal. They were both correct in law and sufficient. 
     26   The single question, which was pursued at the appeal, concerned whether or not the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported upon the evidence (S 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912), the case being one, so it was submitted, where the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to whether: 
      
       
      a) the stabbing of Mr. Hammond occurred at a time when the joint enterprise to rob Miss Kaskardi was still on foot, or whether it was an act isolated from that venture, for which Ton alone was criminally responsible; and/or as to whether 
       
       
      b) it was in the contemplation of the appellant that Ton might do an unlawful and dangerous act with the knife which he had in his possession by stabbing someone, otherwise than in self defence. 
       
       
      Joint Enterprise 
       
     27   As to the first of these propositions, it was the Crown case that, similarly to a bank robbery, the joint enterprise which was here involved, did not come to an end until the robbers had made an escape from the scene of the crime. In my view, that was an appropriate analogy, and the evidence did not leave occasion for any reasonable doubt about it.  
     28   It was not to the point that any decision to rob Ms Kaskardi was impulsive or not pre-planned. Each of the appellant and Ton were involved in the robbery, and the only rational inference that could be drawn is that their enterprise continued until such time as they safely made good their escape with the proceeds from their respective pursuers. They were each followed from the scene and they were each stopped within a very short time, and within a very short, distance from the location of the robbery. It is not as if Ton, having made good his escape, then committed some other crime quite unrelated to the enterprise upon which he had embarked with the appellant. 
     29   I am quite unpersuaded, upon the evidence, that there was a reasonable possibility open that the joint enterprise had come to an end before Mr. Hammond was stabbed. This ground lacks merit. 
      
       
      Contemplation of Appellant 
       
     30   Moving to the second element, there were admissions in the ERISP to the effect that the appellant knew that Ton had a knife.  
     31   In relation to what was in his contemplation concerning that knife, the Crown case depended upon the following answers given in the ERISP: 
      
       
        
        “Q135. Why did you have the knife in your hand? A. Why? Just my friend, he, he just gave it to me.  
        He goes, In case 
        , you know? 
        
       
       
        
        Q.136 OK. But why did you have the knife in your hand when you were confronted by this man? A. ‘Cause there’s many of them and like, they were screaming, and I dunno if they have weapons or something too. I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.137 What was your intention when you had the knife in your hand? A. My intention? Just defend myself.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q.139 Did you have the knife out right from the theft or did you take it out, out -- A. Nah, nah, afterwards. I, I just like, after the theft I just ran. And like I took the knife out when like, when they, I confront them.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. 147 And so Tan gave you the knife that cut this man? A. Yeah, he had like two there, so he had one, the old one so I took, took the other one. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.149 Did you see the knife that Tan had? A. No. He just goes, he put it in his sleeve and then, I dunno. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 150 So how do you know that Tan had a knife? A. He told me you know, Hide it quick, I hide mine, where are you hiding yours? That’s it.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. 213 Why did Tan need to have a knife for? A. To have some reason. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 214 Well what’s that reason” A. Self defence.” 
        
       
     32   Although some of the answers to these questions related to the purpose which the appellant had in mind, when using his knife, they were also relied upon as supporting an inference that he had contemplated a similar possible use by Ton of his knife. 
     33   It was the Crown case that, in context, the only reasonable inference open was that when using the expression “self defence”, in the answer to Q.214, the appellant had meant the possible use of the knife by Ton to avoid being apprehended, and not for use in self defence in the legal sense.  
     34   The defence case, as pursued upon appeal, however, was that an inference was reasonably open that the appellant only had in contemplation the possible use of the weapon, by Ton, “in case” some circumstance arose justifying its use in lawful self defence. That use, it was suggested, may have related to something entirely unconnected with any robbery or unlawful conduct on the part of himself and Ton, for example if they were set upon by others in the course of their visit to the city.  
     35   Alternatively, it could have related to the possibility of someone applying excessive, ie unlawful force in trying to arrest them when they had committed an offence - ie in circumstances where they had become the victims of unlawful aggression, against which they were entitled to defend themselves.  
     36   Independently, it was submitted that the expression “self defence” did not necessarily involve the use of the knife to actually stab someone, but was also capable of extending to the brandishing of it, so as to frighten off an aggressor or someone minded to arrest either of them. 
     37   The drawing of an inference which was rationally consistent with the appellant’s innocence, so far as this element was concerned, was supported, so it was submitted, by the spontaneous nature of the robbery enterprise, it being unlikely, so the argument went, that the appellant had time or occasion to contemplate whether Ton might use his knife to stab someone, or even what might happen after the bag was snatched. Additionally, it was put, it was important that there was no evidence of the appellant having known or suspected that Ton had used a knife, on any prior occasion, to stab someone. 
     38   These matters were fully canvassed before the jury. The critical question as to whether the appellant had the contemplation required in law to establish manslaughter was quintessentially one for them. It was not a question that fell for decision by reference to the words of the ERISP alone. That each man had a knife, and that the appellant had produced and used his weapon offensively, to resist a citizen’s arrest, unerringly supported the inference which the jury must have drawn, in reaching its verdict, that the appellant contemplated the possible use by Ton of his knife, in order to stab someone. It is important in that regard that the crown did not have to prove hat he contemplated that it would be used in that way. 
     39   In approaching the question of competing inferences it is necessary to recall what was said by Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 503: 
      
       
        
        “… with respect, Young CJ was in error in the view which he expressed below that the appellant could only succeed in his argument if the two inferences said to be open - one consistent with innocence and the other consistent with guilt - were equally open. There are not, as Dixon CJ observed, degrees of consistency and, if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, then it ought to have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance.” 
        
       
     40   That question, in the context of the appeal there under consideration, their Honours observed could be: 
      
       
        
        “… rephrased to ask whether the jury, acting reasonably, could have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that the appellant fired, without an intent to kill, the shot which hit (the victim). In considering that question, the Full Court were required to make their own assessment of the evidence, within the limits imposed by the fact that they neither saw nor heard the witnesses (see  
        Chidiac v The Queen 
         (1991) 171 CLR at 443-444,453, 462;  
        Carr v The Queen 
         (1988) 165 CLR 314 at 331) They were required to act upon that view of the facts which the jury were entitled to take having seen and heard the witnesses. (see  
        Chidiac 
          
        at 452)” 
        
       
     41   The relevant test in relation to the ground relied upon, which was formerly tagged; “the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground”, has moved on. Greater emphasis is now placed upon the review which the appellate court is required to undertake (M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; Fleming v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 250 and R v Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 416), it being accepted that “a doubt experienced by an appellate Court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced”.  
     42   Due respect must, however, still be afforded to the jury decision. So it was that in M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 493), in a passage approved in Jones (at 451): 
      
       
        
        “… the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to these considerations.”  
        
       
     43   The test posed in Knight, concerning whether or not an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, remains relevant. If this court were of the view, after making its own review of the evidence, that such an inference or hypothesis was reasonably open, then it would be necessary to quash the conviction, in accordance with s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     44   Applying the common sense approach, which is to be attributed to the determination, of that question, I am not persuaded that there was reasonably open an inference consistent with the appellant’s innocence, or that as a result the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. The only sensible or rational inference open, from the answers in the ERISP, from the circumstance that each offender carried a knife and used it to resist arrest, is that their possible use to stab someone for that purpose was very much in the appellant’s contemplation. If a knife is produced in order to deter a citizen, or a police officer bent upon effecting an arrest, there is inevitably a substantial risk that it could be used to stab that person, since merely waving or brandishing it could never be confidently assumed to be enough.  
     45   I do not mean by this observation to suggest that the question is to be decided by reference to an objective test. What was in issue was the subjective contemplation of the appellant: McAuliffe v The Queen (supra). However, in deciding that question it was open to the jury to draw an inference as to what was in his mind, by reference to the surrounding circumstances.  
     46   The Crown needed to prove, in this case, that the accused had in contemplation a substantial or real risk of Ton using his knife to stab a person minded to effect an arrest - either deliberately or inadvertently in the course of a struggle. In this regard, it is of significance that the jury acquitted the appellant of the offence of murder, which would have required proof that he had contemplated the use of the knife with the deliberate intention of killing or causing grievous bodily harm, but convicted him of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, for which the Crown only needed to prove that he contemplated its possible use to stab someone. 
     47   The alternative possibilities advanced by the appellant were to my mind fanciful, in the real life setting of this case. It is unrealistic to imagine any situation in which he could have contemplated the use of the weapon by way of lawful self defence, in circumstances where the co-offender was facing arrest for an offence of robbery committed in a public place. It is equally hypothetical and contrary to common sense, to suggest, in this case, that all he had in contemplation was the carriage of knives, not for the purpose of preventing apprehension for the kind of offence which they had in mind, but in case they were innocently set upon for no good reason, and as a result needed a weapon to defend themselves.  
     48   The carriage of a knife is unlawful, and in my view there was no room for attributing to the appellant, subjectively, any contemplated use by Ton of his weapon, which was consistent with his innocence of the charge of which he was convicted. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     49   In those circumstances, I find it unnecessary to consider whether the verdict could properly be sustained upon another less onerous basis which was raised, not at trial, but in the course of the hearing of the appeal. That alternative involved the proposition that manslaughter would have been proved had the appellant contemplated that Ton might do an unlawful and dangerous act by brandishing the knife, otherwise than in self defence, in order to frighten away someone attempting to apprehend him, as distinct from having contemplated that Ton might do an unlawful and dangerous act by stabbing that other person.  
     50   This would potentially require consideration of 
      
       
      (a) whether the brandishing of a knife at a person endeavouring to effect an arrest, is an act of the same type or kind as its use, in those circumstances, to stab such person; and 
       
       
      b) whether it would then matter if the actual act of the co-offender involved an act of stabbing and not one of brandishing the weapon. 
       
     51   While each act would constitute an unlawful assault, and while each might well result in the would-be arrester suffering a knife wound, they would differ so far as that consequence would be unintentional in one case, and intentional in the other case.  
     52   It is at least arguable that each of these questions was answered by the High Court in Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108, where Gibbs ACJ (with whom Stephen, Jacobs and Aickin JJ agreed) said (at 113): 
      
       
        
        “The relevant principle, in its application to a case similar to the present was stated as follows by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Reg v Reid 
         (1975) 62 Cr App R 109 (at p112) 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘When two or more men go out together in joint possession of offensive weapons such as revolvers and knives and the circumstances are such as to justify an inference that the very least they intend to do with them is to use them to cause fear in another, there is, in our judgment, always a likelihood that, in the excitement and tensions of the occasion, one of them will use his weapon in some way which will cause death or serious injury. If such injury was not intended by the others, they must be acquitted of murder; but having started out on an enterprise which envisaged some degree of violence, albeit nothing more than causing fright, they will be guilty of manslaughter.’”  
          
         
        
       
     53   This was a case where the question in issue concerned whether or not the act constituting the offence was no more than an unintended incident of carrying out a common design, or was something outside its scope – often a difficult question: see e.g. R v Anderson & Morris (1966) 2 QB 110 and Varley v The Queen (1977) 51 ALJR 243. By analogy similar principles are arguably applicable to a case of extended joint criminal enterprise, which would mean that the act carried out by the principal in the first degree need to be of the same kind or type as the act contemplated as a possibility by the accused. 
     54   To establish manslaughter, the Crown would nevertheless have to prove that the act in the subjective contemplation of the accused, viewed objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. A risk of fright or a risk of trivial injury would be insufficient: Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313. To that extent, this passage in Markby may now require further explanation in any direction to the jury in respect of a count of manslaughter. It would not, in my view, however, be necessary for the Crown to establish that the accused contemplated or foresaw the actual consequences of the act. 
     55   In circumstances where the case was left to the jury by reference to whether or not what was in contemplation was the possible use of the knife to stab, I consider it inappropriate to address the question whether the case could have been left in the alternative way mentioned of its possible use by way of being brandished. In particular, that would have called for attention to the question whether a reasonable person, in the position of the appellant, would have realised that an act of Ton, in brandishing his knife at someone attempting to apprehend him, would have exposed him to an appreciable risk of serious injury. That factual issue, which, I am satisfied, would need to be left for determination upon an objective basis, was not considered by the jury and I see no warrant for this Court embarking upon it. 
      
       
      SENTENCE 
       
     56   It was submitted that, while the sentences for the offences of robbery in company, and the use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension were within range, the sentence for the offence of manslaughter, was manifestly excessive, particularly by reason of the accumulation. In this regard, it is relevant to note that: 
      
       
      a) the appellant was aged twenty-one years when he appeared for sentence; 
       
       
      b) he came from a good background and had a supportive family; 
       
       
      c) he had no prior criminal record; 
       
       
      d) he was not the person directly responsible for inflicting the fatal injuries, and to that extent, his objective criminality was considerably less than that of Ton; 
       
       
      e) he had expressed remorse and contrition for his actions, although he was assessed as having limited insight. 
       
     57   The co-offender Ton was sentenced by Adams J, to imprisonment for twenty-two years with a non parole period of fourteen years for the offence of murder to which he had pleaded guilty. As I have observed, his objective criminality was considerably greater than that of the appellant. Additionally, in his favour was the fact that he was younger than the appellant, and the fact that he had pleaded guilty, for the utilitarian value of which he had received a discount of 20%. 
     58   Special circumstances were found in the case of the applicant in so far as: 
      
       
      a) the sentence for manslaughter was to be served cumulatively upon the other sentences which were for fixed terms, and hence were not themselves subject to any possibility of release upon parole; 
       
       
      b) the appellant was a youthful first offender, who would serve his sentence upon protection; 
       
       
      c) there was a need for counselling to address his lack of insight and drug use. 
       
       
      As a result, a non parole period was set equivalent to 65% of the total term. 
       
     59   The offences of which the appellant was convicted were serious. In relation to the offence of robbery in company, and the offence involving the use of a knife to prevent arrest, there was a need for a sentence that involved a considerable element of general and personal deterrence, for the reasons noted in Ranse NSWCCA 8 August 1994; Draper NSWCCA 9 December 1988; Rothapfel NSWCCA 4 August 1992 and Bell NSWCCA 29 September 1997. Similar considerations apply to an offence of manslaughter involving, as it did here, the contemplated use of a knife by a co-offender to stab someone, so as to avoid lawful apprehension. 
     60   Sentencing for the offence of manslaughter is notoriously difficult, given the wide variety of circumstances and differing degrees of objective criminality involved. Nevertheless, it remains a most serious crime, in that it involves the taking of a human life: Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397. The overall sentence was a heavy one, but I am not persuaded that it was outside a legitimate range of sentencing discretion in the sense explained in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505, and Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) HCA 54. No error of law has, to my mind, been shown. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal against sentence but I would also dismiss that appeal. 
     61   The orders I propose, therefore, are that: 
      
       
      a) the appeal against conviction be dismissed; 
       
       
      b) leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal dismissed; 
       
       
      c) convictions and sentences below be confirmed. 
       
     62   CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      REGINA v GARY WAYNE WHAITES 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Justice Blanch, the Chief Judge of the District Court on 29 March 2000. The applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to one count of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse. 
     2 The offence occurred on 12 September 1987 and was charged contrary to s61C(1)((b) of the Crimes Act, as it then was. The maximum prescribed penalty for such an offence was twelve years' penal servitude. 
     3 The facts of the offence were summarised by his Honour and I draw on that for present purposes. The victim was a Swedish tourist and she and a friend were having car trouble in the Kings Cross area. The applicant stopped to assist. Eventually he drove the car to a service station but when the victim's girlfriend alighted, the applicant continued driving and did not stop until he reached the Royal National Park. He drove to a secluded spot along a gravel road and tried to kiss the victim. She resisted. There was a violent struggle and the applicant told the victim to remove her clothes and then started forcibly to remove them. Resistance continued. He then commenced to get undressed and produced a small folded knife with a four centimetre blade and held it close to the victim's face. However, she continued to resist. He punched her with a closed fist.  
     4 His Honour noted that the statement of facts which had been tendered went on to describe acts of a sexual nature which occurred thereafter. However, he indicated that it was necessary for him to take care to approach the matter of sentence on the basis of the offence as charged and that it did not contain an element of sexual intercourse being forced. In those circumstances his Honour imposed (in terms then appropriate) a minimum term of penal servitude of four years and ten months with an additional term of two years. It is against that sentence that this application is brought.  
     5 It is necessary to relate some matters of history concerning the applicant and his offending. The applicant has a considerable criminal record, only some parts of which it will be necessary to refer to for present purposes. As I have already stated, the offence with which the Court presently deals was alleged to have occurred on 12 September 1987. The applicant was, after being charged, held in custody for approximately two months. He failed to appear for trial which was scheduled for 11 July 1989. The material before the Court shows that he fled to Western Australia where he was convicted of offences and later he moved to South Australia where he was also convicted of offences, one of which it is important to mention in some detail.  
     6 The applicant was charged in South Australia with an offence of rape. Ultimately he pleaded guilty to that offence and on 17 October 1990 he appeared before the South Australian Supreme Court charged under the name of Gary Wayne Henson and was sentenced by Cox J to a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years. It should be noted, however, that at the time of that sentence the presiding judge observed that it had been agreed by counsel that the applicant was entitled to a credit for about eight months in custody, and having regard to a system of remissions in force in South Australia, his Honour allowed a credit of twelve months. 
     7 The next factor which needs to be mentioned is that whilst the non-parole period of the sentence imposed in South Australia was current, the applicant on 23 July 1993 appeared in the District Court of South Australia and was convicted of an offence of escaping from custody for which he was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. Thus, when the applicant appeared for sentence in the District Court in New South Wales, some thirteen years had passed since the commission of the offence. The applicant was taken into custody in South Australia on 8 January 2000 and, as I have mentioned, he was before the District Court on 29 March of that year.  
     8 The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal which have been expressed as follows, first that his Honour erred in law in not taking into account the plea of guilty and not stating the discount in respect thereof and, secondly, that his Honour erred in law in not applying the principles in R v Todd 1982 2 NSWLR 517 properly or adequately in respect of totality and otherwise. Mr Papayanni of counsel who has appeared for the applicant commenced his submissions in relation to the second ground by asserting that when the applicant appeared before Blanch DCJ, his Honour was not made aware of the time served prior to imposition of sentence in South Australia. Accordingly, Mr Papayanni contended that a true calculation would demonstrate that the applicant spent a period approaching seven years in custody rather than five years. Part of that custody no doubt must relate to the imposition of sentence for the escape. In the course of proceedings in the District Court the applicant intervened to assert that he had served six years in South Australia, when the matter was being mentioned by counsel appearing for him and for the Crown. The essence of Mr Papayanni's submissions is based upon an overview of the totality of sentence imposed and time actually served. If one were to take the sentence imposed by Blanch DCJ and the sentence imposed by Cox J and translate them both into terms of head sentence and non-parole period, Mr Papayanni contends that for the combined offences it can be postulated that there is an equivalence of head sentence of seventeen years with a non-parole period in the order of about eleven and a half years. In short, Mr Papayanni submits that such a sentence must be assessed as too much for the offences there involved. 
     9 When looking at the matter of totality, it would be appropriate in my view to consider not two offences but three. I refer to the sentence imposed during the currency of the non-parole period for escape in South Australia. Hence it seems to me that the appropriate picture to be analysed by this Court involves a consideration of whether or not a notional sentence of head term of seventeen years and a non-parole period of about eleven and a half years is excessive for the combined offences of the rape in South Australia, the offence under s 61C and the escape in South Australia. 
     10 The principle to be applied where there has been a delay and there is the complicating factor of interstate impositions has been dealt with in this Court in R v Todd. Street CJ, made these observations: 
      
      
       
        
         
         “Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach – passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.” 
         
        
       
       
     11 When the applicant was before the District Court Blanch DCJ was clearly aware of the principle which is enshrined in that quotation. His Honour referred to a necessity to reflect the possibility that the matters - that is to say the offence before him and the rape in South Australia - could have been dealt with at the same time or at least dealt with whilst the applicant was serving a sentence in South Australia. Manifestly there would be no jurisdiction in an interstate Court to deal with an offence occurring elsewhere, but it is clear that his Honour had in mind the principles elaborated in R v Todd.  
     12 The first ground of appeal is focused upon the absence of any observation by his Honour in his remarks on sentence concerning the plea of guilty other than the introductory remark at the commencement. As I have already observed, the maximum penalty prescribed by the statute was twelve years' penal servitude and, accordingly, the imposition by his Honour, which amounted to an effective seven years adjusted to allow for two months in custody in 1987, represents more than half the maximum period. It does not seem to me that the learned judge would have been likely to have overlooked the significance of the plea of guilty, given his experience in such matters. Nevertheless, what is now before this Court is a question which can be asked in terms as to whether, giving weight to the plea of guilty and giving weight to the matter of totality, it can be said that a sentence such as I have theorised of seventeen years head sentence with a non-parole period of eleven and a half years, is an unfairly onerous punishment for the applicant for the totality of his offences. 
     13 In relation to the individual offence dealt with in the District Court, I am of a view that the facts manifest circumstances which, while they may not reveal the worst case, are nevertheless of a very serious order. I have, however, on an overall view taking into account the necessity to give the applicant a proper discount for his plea of guilty, including the utilitarian value of his plea and having the advantage of the authority of R v Thomson 2000 49 NSWLR 383, decided since his Honour's imposition, concluded that Mr Papayanni's submission has been made good and that this Court should proceed to re-sentence. It can be observed that after release in South Australia the applicant was not re-arrested and brought to New South Wales until a period of several years had elapsed. Whilst that time was not entirely crime-free, it can certainly be said that nothing of the seriousness of the offences with which the Court now has to deal occurred.  
     14 There was also before his Honour a psychiatric report from Dr Clarke which expressed an opinion concerning the risk to the community being lessened in the event that a diagnosed condition of the applicant was appropriately treated. 
     15 Taking all these matters into account on the question of the re-sentence, I would propose the following, that the application for leave to appeal be granted, the appeal allowed, the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced as follows, to five years' imprisonment to commence on 8 January 2000 and to expire on 7 January 2005. I would specify a non-parole period of two years and ten months to commence on 8 January 2000 and to expire on 7 November 2002. I would specify 7 November 2002 as the date upon which the applicant would be eligible for parole. I have reduced the non-parole period by two months for reasons which co-ordinate with those expressed by Blanch DCJ.  
     16 WOOD CJ at CL: Yes, I agree. The order of the Court will be as Grove J proposed.

        REGINA v MALCOLM JAMES STEWART 
        
        
        HEADNOTE 
        
        
       CRIMINAL LAW:  
        The appellant was convicted of a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal from a dwelling house contrary to s 112(2) of the  
       Crimes Act 1900 
       . 
        The Crown case was that the appellant and a co-offender, Braddick, armed with offensive weapons, entered a dwelling house and stole property from those premises. Braddick pleaded guilty to the charge and gave an undertaking to give evidence against the appellant and as a result his sentence was reduced to take into account the offer of assistance. In accordance with that undertaking he gave evidence implicating the appellant. 
        
        
       On appeal it was asserted that the warnings given by the trial judge under s 165(2) of the  
       Evidence Act 1995 
        in respect of the evidence of Braddick were inadequate. 
        
        
       HELD 
        
        
       Per Hulme and Howie JJ, Spigelman CJ, dissenting 
       : The appeal should be dismissed. 
        
        
       Per Hulme J 
       : Although the judge failed to comply with s 165(2)(b) of the  
       Evidence Act 
       , rule 4 of the  
       Criminal Appeal Rules 
        should be applied as there was no possibility of a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       Per Howie J 
       : There was no breach of s 165(2) of the  
       Evidence Act 
        and the warnings were not otherwise inadequate in the circumstances of the case, and in any case rule 4 of the  
       Criminal Appeal Rules 
        should be applied. 
        
        
       Per Spigelman CJ 
        (dissenting): The trial judge failed to comply with s 165(2)(b) of the  
       Evidence Act 
        and a miscarriage of justice occurred. 
        
        
       Per Spigelman CJ and Hulme J 
       : The trial judge was required to warn the jury in respect of the discount of sentence granted to Braddick and the consequences of the failure to comply with the undertaking,  
       per Spigelman CJ 
       : because Braddick came with s 165(1)(d) of the  
       Evidence Act; 
         
       per Hulme J 
       : because of the scheme by which sentencing discounts are subject to appeal under s 5DA of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
       . 
        
        
       Per Hulme and Howie JJ, Spigelman CJ (not deciding): 
        Evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable” in s 165 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        generally refers to evidence, the unreliability of which may not be apparent to the jury, or where the court has some special appreciation of the likelihood of the evidence being unreliable or where for some other reason the jury may be misled in evaluating the reliability of the evidence. 
        
        
       ORDERS:  
       Appeal against conviction is dismissed. Application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

        REGINA v MALCOLM JAMES STEWART 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of both Howie J and Hulme J in draft. The facts and issues are set out in their Honours' reasons and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. 
      
       
     2    Howie J approaches the construction of s165 of the Evidence Act 1995 against the background of the pre-existing common law position. A similar issue arose with respect to other provisions of the Evidence Act in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297. The approach adopted by the High Court with respect to provisions there under consideration, is in my opinion, applicable to s165.  
      
       
     3    Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at [10]: 
      
       
        
        “It is clear from the language of the Act, and from its legislative history, that it was intended to make and that it has made, substantial changes to the law of evidence in New South Wales…. the sections of the Act relevant to this case undoubtedly make express provision different from the common law. It is language of a statute which now determines the manner in which evidence of the kind presently in question is to be treated. The appellant argues that the meaning and effect of that language, properly understood, is to be determined in the light of, and in a manner that conforms to, the pre-existing common law. For reasons that will appear, that argument must be rejected.” 
        
       
     4    Gaudron and Kirby JJ said at [46]: 
      
       
        
        “The Act specifies new rules of evidence in place of those developed by the common law.” 
        
       
     5    McHugh said at [88]: 
      
       
        
        “The Act has made substantial changes to the law of evidence. Notwithstanding s9, reference to pre-existing common law concepts will often be unhelpful.” 
        
       
     6    Section 165 must be construed together with s164. The whole of s165 and the relevant part of s164 are set out by Howie J. The two sections constitute reform of the law of a fundamental kind. The origins of these provisions are found in the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission.  
      
       
     7    In its Interim Report (The Law Reform Commission, Report No 26, Evidence, vol 1, Canberra, 1985) the Commission said: 
      
       
        
        “1015 Warnings The present law is too rigid and technical. There is a strong case for saying that it does not adequately serve the rationale of minimising the risk of wrongful convictions. Warnings can be required when not necessary and avoided when they should be given in the circumstances of the particular case. In addition, warnings, in their present form, distract attention from the issue of reliability of the evidence in question. Finally, the directions to be given are so complex that they are likely to be ignored. There is also a strong case for arguing that the law does not provide an appropriate guide for and control of the judge. Attention is focused on technicalities instead of the needs and merits of each particular case. The law, in its complexity, creates problems that can exceed the help it may give. What is required is a simpler regime, under which the trial judge must consider whether a direction appropriate to the circumstances should be given. It must also be flexible. 
        
        
        … 
        
        
        1016 It is proposed that the existing requirements of law and practice be abolished. This will have the consequential effect of removing the obligation to direct juries about what is corroboration, what evidence may amount to corroboration and that, notwithstanding the absence of corroboration, the jury may still convict if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. In the case of ‘accomplice evidence’ it will remove the obligations to direct juries about who is an accomplice and that it is for the jury to determine whether the witness is or is not an accomplice.” 
        
       
     8    It is plain that a significant change in the law was intended. I agree with the characterisation by the learned authors of Cross on Evidence Australian Edition at [15260]: 
      
       
        
        “Sections 164 and 165, though they have statutory and common law precursors, constitute an attempt at a fresh start.” 
        
       
       
       See also  
       Conway v The Queen 
        (2000) 98 FCR 204 at [220]. 
        
       
     9    The proposition that the pre-existing common law is unlikely to be of assistance in construing s165 is reinforced by the scope of the matters contained within it. The above extracts from the Commission Report come from the chapter on corroboration. However, s165 extends to matters dealt with by quite discrete areas of the pre-existing law of evidence as amended by the Act, e.g. hearsay, admissions and identification evidence. These are disparate categories to which a new single scheme applies. 
      
       
     10    In its Final Report the Commission proposed to retain what it described, at par [239], as a “general residual obligation to warn the jury in appropriate cases”. (The Law Reform Commission, Report No 38, Evidence, Canberra, 1987.) This covered what the Commission identified in its Interim Report at par [1017] to be a “disadvantage” arising from specifying the categories, namely of the possibility that “some category may emerge in the future which should be treated in the same way”. 
      
       
     11    In order to make provision for this “general residual obligation” the Law Reform Commission had originally recommended a provision in the identical form to that which has been enacted as s165(5): 
      
       
        
        “165(5) This section does not affect any other power of a judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.” 
        
       
     12    Notwithstanding the use of the word “power”, this was the only provision that could be understood as implementing the recommendation for a “general residual obligation”. This ambiguity may be the explanation for the final form of the Act, to which I will hereinafter refer. 
      
       
     13    The Act as finally adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament, and subsequently by the New South Wales Parliament, went beyond the draft prepared by the Commission. Specifically, the list of categories, which in the Commission’s draft was exhaustive, was made inclusive by the enactment of the introductory words of s165(1) as follows: 
      
       
        
        “This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: …” 
        
       
     14    The Commission’s two reports are of no direct assistance for the construction of these words, which were not contained in the Commission’s draft of the legislation. 
      
       
     15    It may be that the parliaments, by the addition of these introductory words to the subsection, intended to provide explicitly for what the Commission had recommended and which was implicit in the subsection of the draft as presented by the Commission that became 165(5). Perhaps the word “kind” was adopted in the same sense as the Commission had in par [1017] of its Interim Report used the word “category”. If so, it would encompass in express terms what the Commission regarded as necessary to make provision for, i.e. “that some category may emerge in the future which should be treated in the same way”. 
      
       
     16    The word “kind” is a word of a breadth and generality which it may be appropriate to read down. Any reason that could be advanced for questioning the reliability of evidence in the specific circumstances of a case can be stated at different levels of generality. Once stated at a level of generality higher than the specific facts of a particular case, such a reason could satisfy the description of “a kind” of evidence. That would have the result that in every case in which an assertion of lack of reliability is made, the compulsory provisions for a warning on request in s165(2) would apply, subject only to the exception in s165(3). The acknowledgment, in s165(5), that there will be other circumstances in which a judge will be required to warn or inform the jury with respect to these matters, suggests that the word “kind” must be read down in some way. 
      
       
     17    I do not find it necessary for purposes of resolving the case now before the Court to determine this matter or to reconsider other judgments of this Court in the way that Howie J has done. 
      
       
        
       Application of s165 
        
       
     18    The reason why it is unnecessary to express a final view on the above matters is because the relevant witness in the present case, Mr Braddick, falls within the provisions of s165(1)(d). He is a person “who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”. The terminology “might reasonably be supposed to”, was intended to encompass all those who, as a matter of fact, were actually “criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”. Mr Braddick was so concerned by his own admission and conviction.  
      
       
     19    By reason of the applicability of s165(1)(d) it is not necessary to decide, in the present case, the true scope of the introductory words “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”. Specifically, it is unnecessary to recognise a category, such as Hulme J suggests, of persons who have been sentenced with respect to the matter giving rise to the proceedings and who might be at risk of losing the benefit they had received on sentence. That issue, in my opinion, falls to be determined in the present case under s165(2)(b) i.e. the obligation of a trial judge to identify for the jury the “matters that may cause” the evidence of a particular witness to be unreliable. 
      
       
     20    The present case should be determined on the basis that his Honour failed to specifically identify for the jury the fact that the benefit on sentence, which Mr Braddick had obtained, was at risk. The relevant extracts from his Honour’s summing-up are set out by Howie J.  
      
       
     21    I agree with the observations of Howie J that a direction under s165(2) should not employ the word “accomplice”. The use of such terminology may give the appearance to the jury that the judge has formed an opinion on the issue it has to determine. Counsel’s request to the trial judge for an “accomplice” warning was a shorthand formula invoking s165(1)(d). His Honour acceded to the request. The only issue is whether his Honour complied with the statutory obligation to “inform the jury of matters that may cause [the evidence] to be unreliable” within s165(2)(b). 
      
       
     22    His Honour did inform the jury that Mr Braddick’s undertaking to give evidence in the trial of the Appellant was taken into account on sentence. There was no reference, however, to the fact that Mr Braddick could lose the benefit of that reduction in sentence if he failed to give evidence of the character that he did eventually give. This is not a matter which would necessarily be known to the jury. In my opinion it constituted a failure to satisfy the requirements of s165(2)(b). 
      
       
     23    I agree with Hulme and Howie JJ that the Appellant’s submission that the directions actually given amounted to “little more than recitation of a formula” should be rejected. His Honour gave a comprehensive warning which, save in one specific respect, was all that was required. Nevertheless, the matter to which his Honour failed to refer was, in my opinion, of considerable significance.  
      
       
     24    Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is a mechanism by which the benefit on sentence that Mr Braddick had received could be removed from him. A jury would not know that there was any such mechanism unless they were informed of its existence by the trial judge. The only fact that was before the jury was that Mr Braddick had received a benefit. This was both adduced in evidence and referred to in his Honour’s summing-up. The jury were never informed that he could lose that benefit. 
      
       
     25    The mandatory requirements of s165(2) need to be observed, subject only to a decision to the contrary under s165(3). Respectfully, I do not agree with Howie J that the fact that there are numerous circumstances in which witnesses can receive benefits or lose advantages by giving evidence detracts from the requirements of s165(2)(b). The risk of loss is a “matter” within that provision. 
      
       
     26    For the reasons given by Hulme and Howie JJ, s165(3) has no application in the present case. The section does apply to an inadequate warning under s165(2). However, his Honour never turned his mind to the determination of whether or not there were good reasons for not giving a warning which encompassed the possible loss of a benefit on sentence. In my opinion, no such reasons exist. 
      
       
     27    At this stage of my judgment, I reach the same conclusion as Hulme J, though by a different route, in that I find that s165(1)(d) applies to this case. Accordingly, it is not necessary to identify or consider a category of evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable”, pursuant to the introductory words of the subsection. 
      
       
        
       Application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 
        
       
     28    No complaint was raised at the trial to the effect that his Honour’s s165 warning was defective. Hulme and Howie JJ would both refuse leave. I am unable to agree. 
      
       
     29    Mr Braddick’s credit was central to the trial. There was no other evidence linking the Appellant to the offence. Mr Braddick commenced to give evidence exculpatory of the Appellant. Leave was given to cross-examine him and the Crown sought to play the audiotape of his ERISP. Mr Braddick then agreed to give evidence in accordance with the ERISP. It would have been open to the jury to infer that the benefit that had been given to him on sentence would have affected Mr Braddick’s decision to give the evidence he eventually gave, overcoming his initial reluctance to do so. That knowledge could have affected the jury’s readiness to accept his evidence. 
      
       
     30    The jury deliberated for a considerable period of time in a case in which the trial was short and the facts were in a narrow compass. There can be little doubt that the delay that occurred was due to the jury considering in detail the reliance they could place upon the evidence of Mr Braddick. Nothing else in the trial really mattered. 
      
       
     31    The jury reported an inability to agree. A direction in accordance with Black v the Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44 was given. The jury reported an inability to agree a second time. The trial judge sent the jury a note to continue to try to reach agreement in accordance with his earlier direction. The jury continued deliberating for a further period of more than half an hour. The jury came back and reported, for the third time, that they were deadlocked. The jury was sent home after being told that they would be asked again the next morning to try to reach a verdict and if they had not done so after about an hour that they would be discharged. The jury returned the next morning and after deliberation of fifty minutes returned with a verdict of guilty. These are important circumstances of the trial.  
      
       
     32    If the jury had been informed that Mr Braddick was at risk of an increased sentence by reason of his failure to give evidence in accordance with his original statement to the police, that could have made a substantial difference. The only issue in the trial was Mr Braddick’s credit. In my opinion, a miscarriage of justice occurred. In these circumstances, leave under rule 4 should be given.  
      
       
     33    I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. 
      
       
     34    HULME J: In this matter, I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment of Howie J in draft form. Save and except for some remarks of His Honour under the heading “Were the Directions Inadequate or Erroneous” I agree substantially with those Reasons and with the order proposed by His Honour. In respect of a number of the matters canvassed by His Honour under the heading to which I have referred, I prefer to express my own views. 
      
       
     35    I also agree with what His Honour has said in rejecting the criticism that the warning given to the jury was “cursory and amounted to little more than recitation of formula” and in respect of the suggestion that the warning given was diluted by remarks to the effect that such a direction was given in every case where an accomplice gave evidence. 
      
       
     36    However, in my view evidence given under or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding under which the witness giving it is rewarded or stands to lose a reward for that evidence, certainly when that arrangement or understanding is one envisaged by Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or the subject of an undertaking referred to in s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act, is evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable” within Section 165 of the Evidence Act. Such evidence falls sufficiently into a category to be regarded as of a “kind”. It is also of a kind that may be unreliable. In that latter regard, the “kind” commonly shares many of the attributes of, or reasons for, unreliability which evidence of a witness “who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding” or “who is a prison informer” - the kinds of evidence referred to in Section 165(1)(d) and (e) - has. 
      
       
     37    In reaching this conclusion I am not unconscious of the fact that incentives to give untruthful evidence not uncommonly exist in other circumstances and unless a degree of discrimination is exercised in categorisation, there will be a temptation to regard the evidence in many of these circumstances as falling within the description “evidence of a kind”. Thus it could be argued that evidence of any one with a bias or with an interest in the result of proceedings was “evidence of a kind”. The latter circumstance would cover nearly every case and if the words “of a kind” are to have any operation, clearly evidence of the nature of that in this last example does not come within the section.  
      
       
     38    The ease with which the language used in s165 can be applied to circumstances which, if “of a kind” has the significance Howie J and I would afford to it, Parliament cannot have intended to be within that language means that some test of what is and what is not evidence to which the section applies is necessary. For the reasons given by Howie J, whether the evidence is such as could not be expected to fall within the general experience and understanding of a jury and in respect of which the courts have special knowledge is an, if not the, appropriate test. The fact that some of the specific examples included in s165(1) of evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, e.g. that which may be affected by age or mental ill health, are of evidence which a jury could be expected to regard as suspect in accordance with their general knowledge, does not invalidate this conclusion.  
      
       
     39    On this test also, because a jury could not be expected to know of the incentive or often the extent of the incentive, to a witness to give an account favourable to the Crown and adverse to an accused, and the courts do have such knowledge, the evidence of persons having the benefit of Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and to whom Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act does or may apply is in my view, “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable” within s165. 
      
       
     40    Quite independently of him being “a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding” but because he received a discount on his sentence in return for an offer of assistance by way of giving evidence against the Appellant, and was liable to have that discount removed, the evidence of Brian Braddick was thus evidence to which, subject to subsection 165(3), subsection 165(2) applied. 
      
       
     41    However, such obligation to warn as subsection 165(2) imposes is conditioned on a request and so far as the material before this court goes, all that was asked for was “a direction on accomplices”. Was this broad enough to require Judge Garling to refer to the fact that Braddick had been given a discount on his sentence and that if he failed to fulfil his undertaking in that regard he might well have his sentence increased? While often present, these matters of course are not necessary incidents of a witness having been an accomplice.  
      
       
     42    In my view, subject to the operation of subsection 165(3), his Honour was obliged to refer to the discount and the risk of Braddick’s sentence being increased. The reason lies in the terms of subsection 165(2). Those subsections, and the opening words of subsection 165(1) provide:- 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
         
        
        (a) … 
        
         
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
         
        
        (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
        
        (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
        
        (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
        
        
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
        
       
     43    Subsection 2 directs attention to “the evidence”. The evidence must fall within the description “of a kind” for s165 to apply to it at all but once the section does, the warnings and information required are such as do or may have a bearing on the evidence given and there is no need to confine these to only those matters which would bear on the reliability of evidence of the “kind”. After all, an assessment of whether a witness’ evidence should be accepted will often depend on the totality of matters bearing on its reliability. The request for a “direction on accomplices” necessarily referred to the evidence of Braddick and, subject to subsection (3), the judge was obliged to inform the jury of all matters that may cause “it”, i.e. that evidence, to be unreliable. The discount Braddick received on his sentence and the fact that discount was liable to be lost if he failed to fulfil his undertaking were matters which were relevant to any assessment of the reliability of Braddick’s evidence and, subject as I have said to subsection (3), the judge should have informed the jury of these matters. 
      
       
     44    And clearly the imparting of that information to the jury or the reminding them of it should have occurred in the context of the warnings referred to in paragraphs (a) and (c). That is clearly the intent of the subsection. 
      
       
     45    His Honour’s observation that Braddick “was sentenced, as part of his sentence, it was taken into account, as the law requires, he was going to give evidence in this trial” was sufficient in its terms to inform the jury that Braddick was likely to have derived some benefit in, or discount from, his sentence in consequence of the prospect of his giving evidence although, having regard to the purpose behind s165, the remark suffered from the disadvantage that it was made some time removed from the accomplice warning his Honour gave. The transcript of the summing up shows the 2 topics were 4 pages removed from one another, albeit all of those pages were devoted to Mr Braddick. However, his Honour made no reference to the risk that the benefit or discount was liable to be lost. And this was important. It is one thing for a jury to think that a witness may have derived a benefit for promising to give evidence. It is quite another, and more important, for the jury to know also that if the evidence given is not to particular effect, a sentence on the witness is liable to be increased.  
      
       
     46    My agreement with the Reasons of Howie J extends to his Honour’s view that s165(3) refers not just to the general requirement to give a warning when requested but also applies to the content of the warning and that in most cases where a judge considers there are good reasons for not complying with subsection (2) the judge should indicate what these reasons are. In this case his Honour did not provide any such reasons and none sufficient for not giving the warning are apparent. Thus the mandatory requirements of s165 were, in my opinion, breached. 
      
       
     47    However, there was no request for further directions. In light of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, whether the Appellant should be allowed to rely on the point depends on the significance of his Honour’s omission. Having regard to what his Honour did say about the Appellant giving evidence in the trial being taken into account in his sentence and the context in which this topic and the accessory warning appear, I do not regard the failure which I have identified in this regard as significant to the fairness of the trial or to the ultimate result.  
      
       
     48    So far as the omission to refer to the fact that if Mr Braddick did not give evidence to particular effect, the sentence on him was liable to be increased is concerned, Howie J has reproduced the evidence which was given and then set out reasons why rule 4 should prevent this omission from being relied on. I agree substantially with these and with his Honour’s conclusion in this regard.  
      
       
     49    I am furthermore satisfied that in the context of the trial and his Honour’s summing up, there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. For the reasons given by Howie J I also would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss that appeal. 
      
       
     50    HOWIE J: On 14 July 2000, the appellant was convicted by a jury of aggravated break, enter and steal from a dwelling house contrary to section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced by Judge Garling to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence from 14 July 2000. The non-parole period is to expire on 13 January 2003. The applicant appeals to this Court against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
      
       
     51    The applicant relies upon only one ground of appeal in respect of the conviction. It is asserted that the trial judge erred in that his directions to the jury under s 165(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 in respect of the chief Crown witness, Brian Braddick, were inadequate. In light of the limited nature of the ground of appeal it is necessary to give only a brief account of the evidence at the trial.  
      
       
     52    It was alleged by the Crown that the appellant and Braddick, while they were both armed with offensive weapons, entered a dwelling house and stole property from those premises. There was no dispute at the trial that at about 9 pm on 14 July 1999 at least two men, one of whom was Braddick, gained entry to a residential dwelling at 12 Jaycee Avenue, Nowra through an unlocked garage door. While in the garage these persons armed themselves with hockey sticks that they found there. They then entered into the living area of the house through a closed, but unlocked, door. 
      
       
     53    On that evening the son of the householders, Aaron Pease, had been left alone while his mother and stepfather had gone out to a social gathering. He was watching television in his bedroom when he heard footsteps in the hallway. He opened his door and saw a man wearing a black beanie. After telling the intruder to leave the house, Aaron ran to the bathroom and locked the door. Someone outside the door told him they would not hurt him. He heard more noises and then opened the door slightly. He saw that the man with the beanie was in the bedroom and another man with a jumper over his head was near the bathroom door. Both were armed with hockey sticks. 
      
       
     54    The man nearest him with the jumper said, “If you don’t open the door we will bash the crap out of you”. He heard the other man with the beanie say, “No we won’t”. Aaron then locked the bathroom door again and heard someone yell out, “Where’s the money? All we want is the money”. He then heard the sound of objects breaking. He went to the bathroom window and began to cry for help. When he heard the sound of a hockey stick against the bathroom door, he climbed out of the window. He went to the house of a neighbour and the police were contacted. 
      
       
     55    Two police officers responded to the call. As they drove along the Princess Highway, they saw Braddick, who was carrying a bag, exit from a hole in a fence of one of the premises in Jaycee Avenue. When he became aware of the police vehicle, Braddick returned back through the fence. He was pursued by one of the officers who followed a trail of compact discs apparently dropped by Braddick as he attempted to make his escape. The officer saw Braddick climb over a fence and followed after him. 
      
       
     56    In the meantime other police had attended the area. One of them, having seen the heads of three persons near a fence, ran towards that area. He came upon the appellant who was standing alone outside 4/1 Jaycee Avenue not far from where the officer had seen the three people. The officer told the appellant that he was after three persons who broke into a house. The appellant asserted that he had done nothing wrong but was told to lie on the ground. The appellant repeated that he had done nothing wrong and said he had been standing urinating near where the officer had come across him. The appellant was searched but no items stolen from 12 Jaycee Avenue were found on him. 
      
       
     57    About this time Braddick was arrested a short distance away. He was moderately affected by alcohol and admitted he had stolen the compact discs. Police searched the area and found a quantity of items stolen from 12 Jaycee Avenue piled up near 4/1 and 5/2 Jaycee Avenue. When first questioned by police, Braddick admitted the offence but maintained that he was by himself. He later took part in an ERISP in which he implicated the appellant as being involved. 
      
       
     58    On 16 March 2000 Braddick pleaded guilty to aggravated break enter and steal at Nowra District Court. He gave an undertaking to give evidence against the appellant and, as a result, his sentence was reduced in order to take into account the offer of assistance. He was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 12 months. 
      
       
     59    The Crown called Braddick to give evidence at the trial of the appellant. At the outset of his testimony the following questions and answers took place (T 18): 
      
       
        
         
         Q. You were charged in respect of an aggravated break,  
          
         enter and steal offence committed on 14 July 1999 is that correct?  
          
         A. Yeah that's correct.  
          
         Q. You appeared at this court on 16 March this year and pleaded guilty to that offence before his Honour, is that correct?  
          
         A. Yeah. 
          
         Q. In the course of the proceedings on your sentence matter you undertook to give evidence against this accused Malcolm Stewart, is that correct?  
          
         A. I signed papers, yeah.  
          
         Q. Did you say anything to the court about giving evidence? A. I'm not too sure, like I don't remember.  
          
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Now listen to me, you gave evidence before me didn't you, didn't you? A. I can't--  
          
         Q. You clearly remember when you were in this court?  
          
         A. I remember I was standing in the court, but I don't know if I gave any evidence against Malcolm.  
          
         HIS HONOUR: You can't remember that, okay. Yes Mr Crown.  
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Do you recall that you received a non-parole period of 12 months from his Honour in respect of the break, enter and steal offence? A. Yeah.  
          
         Q. Do you also remember you got a period on parole of 12 months after that? A. Yeah, I think.  
          
         Q. Do you agree that his Honour indicated that the sentence imposed upon you was discounted because of your offer of assistance?  
          
         A. Yeah, I do, do understand that.  
          
         HIS HONOUR: Sorry I didn't hear his reply. 
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: ""I did understand that"".  
         
        
       
     60    Initially Braddick told the jury that, when he committed the offence, he was quite intoxicated and he thought that he was alone. He said that, while he heard someone speaking during the commission of the offence, he did not recognise it as the voice of the appellant whom he had known all his life. In light of this evidence and the different account he had given in the ERISP, the Crown sought, and was granted, leave to treat him as an unfavourable witness under s 38 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
     61    There then followed a short period of cross-examination of Braddick by the Crown Prosecutor in the presence of the jury during which the Crown sought leave to play the audio tape of the ERISP. However, this became unnecessary because after a short adjournment Braddick indicated that he was willing to give evidence in accordance with the ERISP. Braddick then gave evidence that he, the appellant and another man had left the house of Braddick’s girlfriend, where they had been drinking alcohol, to purchase more beer. On the way they decided to rob the premises at 12 Jaycee Avenue. They entered the garage, removed some property, and then, having armed themselves with the hockey sticks they found there, Braddick and the appellant entered the house through a closed but unlocked door. 
      
       
     62    Braddick then gave an account that was generally in accord with the evidence given by Aaron Pease as to what happened inside the house. He admitted that he might have made some threat to Aaron while the boy was locked in the bathroom and said it was the appellant who attempted to reassure him by indicating that he would not get hurt. He said that property was taken from the house including tools and a stereo and it was piled up where it was found by the police. 
      
       
     63    Defence counsel cross-examined Braddick to the effect that he was too drunk to accurately remember what happened that night, that he told police untruths in the ERISP and that he had implicated the appellant to improve his own situation. Braddick admitted he had told lies earlier in his evidence. 
      
       
     64    The appellant gave evidence denying any involvement in the offence. He said that he remained at the house drinking but that Braddick had disappeared for about half an hour. The appellant went outside to urinate and he saw Braddick running away from police. The appellant was then arrested. 
      
       
        
       Request for a warning 
        
       
     65    It is clear that on any version Braddick was involved in the offence with which the appellant was charged. His evidence was vital to the Crown case. However, there was some support for his version in the evidence of the police officer as to the appellant being located not far from the stolen property and near where the police officer had seen three people at the fence. 
      
       
     66    Before the summing up commenced the trial judge raised with both counsel what directions he should give to the jury. The following is recorded in the transcript: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour enquired of counsel that other than the standard directions did counsel also want a direction on accomplices. Counsel agreed. His Honour enquired as to right for (sic) silence and evidence on oath and witnesses generally. Agreed to by counsel. Discussion ensued on directions to be given to jury including elements of the case.” 
         
        
       
     67    The appeal has been conducted before this Court on the basis that what was said by the trial judge and counsel as to the appropriate directions to be given to the jury was sufficient to amount to a request for a warning under s 165(2) of the Evidence Act. Section 165 is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         165 (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
          
           
           (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies; 
            
           (b) identification evidence; 
            
           (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like; 
            
           (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding; 
            
           (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer; 
            
           (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant; 
            
           (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person - evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
           
          
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
          
           
           (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable; and 
            
           (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable; and 
            
           (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
           
          
         (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
          
         (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
          
         (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
         
        
       
     68    One of the complaints made before this Court is that his Honour did not comply with s 165(2)(b) in that he failed to inform the jury of certain factual matters that had a bearing upon the reliability of Braddick as an accomplice. There is nothing to suggest that these matters were raised with the trial judge either before the summing up or after it. There was no objection raised by defence counsel to anything said by his Honour in the summing up and no request for further directions. 
      
       
     69    Before dealing with the particular issue raised in this appeal and the adequacy or otherwise of the directions given to the jury about Braddick’s evidence, it is necessary to consider the scope of the obligation imposed upon a trial judge to give a warning to the jury about evidence which is before them and the content of such a warning. 
      
       
        
       Warnings to juries at common law 
        
       
     70    Before considering the provisions of the Evidence Act, some reference should be made to the position at common law. It will not always be helpful, and at times it may be positively misleading, to consider the common law rules of evidence when construing the provisions of the Evidence Act. However, s 165 has its origins in the common law requirement that the trial judge give a warning to the jury in respect of potentially unreliable evidence and s 165(5) recognises that a trial judge has power to make comments and give warnings to the jury in respect of the evidence in the trial in addition to those required by the section. 
      
       
     71    As a result of the experience of judges gained in conducting criminal trials, the common law established categories or classes of evidence that were considered to be potentially unreliable and about which, as a rule of practice, judges were required to warn the jury. The warning normally cautioned the jury about the potential unreliability of the evidence, the reason why the evidence might be unreliable and the manner in which the jury should consider the evidence. Usually the jury were told of the need to “scrutinize the evidence with care” before convicting upon it. In respect of some categories, the evidence was thought to be so unreliable that the trial judge was required to tell the jury that it was dangerous to convict on the evidence unless it was corroborated. The categories in which such a warning was required was evidence given by the following types of witnesses: complainants in sexual assault cases, Kelleher v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 534; accomplices, Davies v DPP [1954] AC 378; and children giving sworn evidence, Hargan v The King (1919) 27 CLR 13. 
      
       
     72    The common law also recognised that there would be, from time to time, potentially unreliable evidence that did not fall within these established categories and yet in respect of which a warning might need to be given. Whether a warning should be given and what should be said to the jury in such a case was a matter falling largely within the discretion of the trial judge and depended upon the circumstances of the particular case. The fundamental obligation on the trial judge was to put the defence fairly and adequately: Reg v Spencer [1986] AC 128 at 142. If a warning was not given in a case calling for a warning, or if the warning was insufficient to bring home to the jury the potential unreliability of the evidence, any conviction resulting might be set aside on appeal because a miscarriage of justice had occurred: Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 604. 
      
       
     73    The need for a warning about evidence not falling within the established categories was considered by the High Court in Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315. The chief Crown witness was a schizophrenic who had suffered from an episode of that illness on the night in question and had been admitted to a mental hospital. The trial judge gave a direction to the jury that they must scrutinise the evidence of the witness with special care, but did not warn them that it would be dangerous to convict upon the evidence of the witness unless it was corroborated. The High Court held that the warning given was sufficient. Gibbs CJ, in a judgment with which the majority of the court agreed, declared (at 319): 
      
       
        
         
         “………..What is required, in a case where the evidence of a witness may be potentially unreliable, but which does not fall within one of the established categories in relation to which the full warning as to the necessity of corroboration must be given, is that the jury must be made aware, in words which meet the justice of the particular case, of the dangers of convicting on such evidence”. 
         
        
       
     74    As to the contents of the warning to be given in such a case, his Honour said (at 319): 
      
       
        
         
         “The warning should be clear and, in a case in which a lay juror might not understand why the evidence of the witness was potentially unreliable, it should be explained to the jury why that is so. There is no particular formula that must be used; the words used must depend on the circumstances of the case.” 
         
        
       
     75    Brennan J delivered a separate judgment in which he considered the circumstances in which a warning was to be given. His Honour stated (at 323-324):  
      
       
        
         
         “It must be remembered that the sole raison d'etre of the rule requiring a warning to be given ‘is to ensure that the jury is alive to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a class of witnesses whose testimony may, for reasons already indicated, be untruthful’: per Mason J. in  
         Kelleher v The Queen 
          (1974) 131 CLR 534, at p 560. The courts have had experience of the reasons why witnesses in the three accepted categories [accomplices, children giving evidence on oath, and complainants in sexual assault cases] may give untruthful evidence wider than the experience of the general public, and the courts have a sharpened awareness of the danger of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of such witnesses. The experience of the courts has shown also that the reasons which may lead one suspect witness to give untruthful evidence are not necessarily the same as the reasons why another suspect witness may do so: see  
         R v Weston 
          [1924] VLR 166, at pp 171-172;  
         McNee v Kay 
          [1953] VLR 520, at pp 524-526………… 
          
          
         The rules of practice requiring the giving of a warning owe their existence, as Lord Hailsham acknowledges in  
         Spencer 
          [1986] AC 128, at p.135 “partly to the inherent dangers involved, and partly to the fact that the danger is not necessarily obvious to a lay mind”: See also per Lord Ackner at p.141 and per Lord Diplock in  
         Hester  
         [1973] AC 296, at p.325. If the danger is equally obvious to the lay mind, a failure to warn of its existence is much less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice and thus much less likely to provide a ground for quashing a conviction than if the court has a special knowledge of the danger. If the danger is so obvious that the jury are fully alive to it without a warning, no warning need be given. As Barwick C.J. said in  
         Kelleher 
         , at p.543: 
          
          
           
           ‘The rule of practice as to the warning to be given to the jury is related to the reasons which have prompted it. In my opinion, it does not require a warning where those reasons have no play’.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     76    As to the content of a warning in the case then before the Court, Brennan J stated (at 325): 
      
       
        
         
         “Perhaps no more can be said than this: when the danger in acting upon the evidence is real and substantial and when the conduct of the trial and evidence as to the witness’s mental disorder are such that the jury may not have fully perceived or the jury’s attention may have been diverted from the danger, a warning should be given.” 
         
        
       
     77    In Carr v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 314 a majority of the justices of the High Court were not willing to find that there was a rule of practice which required that a warning be given to a jury that it was dangerous to convict on the evidence of a disputed oral confession made to a police officer. This was because, in their Honours’ view, judicial experience had not identified this class of evidence as being so unreliable that such a warning should invariably be given, see Wilson and Dawson JJ at 318-319, Brennan J at 326. 
      
       
     78    During the course of his judgment, Brennan J returned to a consideration of when a warning was required to be given and stated (at 325): 
      
       
        
         
         “…………A warning is needed when there is a factor legitimately capable of affecting the assessment of evidence of which the judge has special knowledge, experience or awareness and there is a perceptible risk that, unless a warning about that factor is given, the jury will attribute to an important piece of evidence a significance or weight which they might not attribute to it if the warning were given. It is not possible to define a priori the circumstances in which a warning is necessary: the circumstances which show whether a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice exists in relation to the assessment of evidence include the charge, the evidence and the conduct and atmosphere of the trial.” 
         
        
       
     79    His Honour considered that, in accordance with Bromley, a warning was required in the circumstances of the case under consideration to alert the jury to the fact that a comparison of the demeanour of the police officers and the accused in giving evidence before them was not necessarily a sound guide to comparative veracity and that the jury had to bear in mind that the police entertained a belief as to the accused’s guilt before any confession was made. It is apparent that the warning favoured by Brennan J in that case informed the jury of two matters relevant to their consideration of the confessional material, one was of a general nature and the other arose specifically from the evidence at the trial. 
      
       
     80    However, at common law a warning might be required even though the evidence was not of a kind that might be unreliable. The trial judge was to caution the jury whenever there was, to use the words of Brennan J in Carr quoted above, “a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice”. As Deane J said in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 (at 95-96): 
      
       
        
         
         “[The] responsibility [of a trial judge] includes the giving of an appropriate caution or warning in circumstances where there are potential dangers in acting upon particular evidence which may not, without such a caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury.” 
         
        
       
     81    Such a potential danger could arise because the Crown’s case was based upon the evidence of a single witness unsupported by any other evidence: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, or because the accused’s ability to defend himself had been affected by the long delay before prosecution: Longman at 90-91, Crampton v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133 or to counter the disadvantage occasioned to an accused person interviewed in custody without facilities for recording the interview: McKinney and Judge v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 474. 
      
       
     82    In Crampton, above, the High Court stressed, as the joint judgment in Longman had done, that there was an important difference between, on the one hand, a comment by the trial judge on an aspect of the evidence which was relevant to an assessment of its reliability and, on the other hand, a warning to the jury about the approach that must be taken to the evidence in an assessment of it: Crampton at 140C, 156D. A comment relates to a matter, about which the jury will generally have sufficient knowledge and understanding to appreciate its significance, but which the jury may have forgotten or overlooked had the judge not reminded them of it. It will normally be sufficient if the judge draws the jury’s attention to the matter either directly or by reference to counsel’s address. 
      
       
     83    However, a warning reflects the special experience of the law with a matter of which the jury may have little knowledge or understanding: Crampton per Kirby J at 156E. So in a warning it is not sufficient for the trial judge merely to refer to a submission about the matter made by counsel in addressing the jury. The authority of the trial judge must be used to impress the significance of the matter on the collective mind of the jury. 
      
       
        
       Warnings under the Evidence Act 
        
       
     84    It is against this background that the provisions of the Evidence Act dealing with warnings by a trial judge should be considered. By s 164(1) the requirement that some classes or categories of evidence be corroborated was abolished. Further, s 164(3) states: 
      
       
        
         
         (3) Despite any rule, whether of law or practice, to the contrary, but subject to the other provisions of this Act, if there is a jury, it is not necessary that the Judge: 
          
           
           (a) warn the jury that it is dangerous to act on uncorroborated evidence or give a warning to the same or similar effect; or 
            
           (b) give a direction relating to the absence of corroboration. 
           
          
         
        
       
     85    Section 164(3) does not prohibit the trial judge from giving a warning that would have been required at common law in relation to the three categories of witnesses referred to earlier, one of which was accomplices. Although such a warning is no longer mandatory, it is open for the trial judge to give a warning as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness and in some cases such a warning may be required, although it is unnecessary to use terms such as “dangerous” or “corroboration”: R v Lewis (NSWCCA, 8 September 1998) at 9. 
      
       
     86    As has been noted already, s 165(5) preserves the power of a judge to give a warning or to inform the jury about a matter arising from the evidence, whether or not a warning is requested under s 165(2). Thus the Act maintains the common law requirement that a warning be given “whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case”: Longman at 86. Such a warning must be given even where no party requests it. It will not necessarily depend upon the potential unreliability of a particular kind of evidence. A warning may be required in order to redress any unfairness to the accused that may have arisen from the nature of the evidence before the court or the manner in which the offence was investigated or prosecuted: R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507. A warning may be given whenever judicial experience indicates that special attention or care is required in making an assessment of the evidence and the weight to be attributed to it: R v Kirby [2000] NSWCCA 330 at [58]. 
      
       
     87    The content of the warning will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case including any aspect of the trial, such as cross-examination and counsel’s addresses: R v Johnson (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 369. In Bromley Brennan J said (at 325): 
      
       
        
         
         “The possibility of a miscarriage of justice is both the occasion for the giving of a warning and the determinant of its content.” 
         
        
       
     88    However, s 165 is concerned only with those occasions where the possibility of a miscarriage arises because there is evidence before the jury “of a kind that may be unreliable”. Because any evidence given in a court may be unreliable, it is necessary to consider the scope of the section in order to determine, not only when a warning should be given, but also what its content should be. 
      
       
     89    When formulating its proposal upon which s 165 is based, the Australian Law Reform Commission noted that the traditional rationale at common law for requiring a warning to be given in respect of certain categories of witnesses, was the experience of the courts that there was a real risk that the evidence of a witness falling within those categories may be more unreliable than the evidence of a witness who did not fall within a designated category. In its Interim Report, ALRC No 26 Vol 1, the Commission explained its proposal in this way (at para 1017): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is proposed that there be an obligation to give a warning, unless there is good reason not to, where it appears to the judge that evidence coming within one of several broadly described categories may be unreliable, or its probative value may be over-estimated….The warning is to be directed to the weaknesses of the evidence and the need for care in deciding whether to accept it. In deciding whether there are reasonable grounds for not giving a warning, the judge could consider matters such as the other evidence before the court and the importance of the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     90    The Commission’s proposed provision listed most of the categories of evidence now found in s 165(1) and relied upon the residue power retained by s 165(5) to provide for warnings in categories of evidence which may later be identified by the courts. The draftsman of s 165 obviously addressed the Commission’s concern about future categories or classes of unreliable evidence by ensuring that the provision was not limited to the designated classes of evidence. Hence s 165 applies generally to “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable” including most of the kinds of evidence identified by the Commission. 
      
       
     91    The Commission recognised that evidence falling within one of the designated categories may actually be reliable and, therefore, there was not the same risk that the jury might misestimate the weight of the evidence. In such a case the warning might detract from the real value of the evidence to the cost of the party relying upon it. To meet this eventuality, it was proposed that the trial judge should consider the evidence in question to determine whether a warning needed to be given in a particular case even though it had been requested by a party. The Commission stated (ibid at para 1019-1020): 
      
       
        
         
         “…it is not enough to demonstrate that evidence comes within one or more of the categories. Before the judge must consider giving a warning, it must be shown that the evidence may be unreliable or open to misestimation…Cases will vary so much that a guided discretionary approach is required.” 
         
        
        
       The “guided discretionary approach” is achieved, initially, by a discretionary determination as to whether the evidence falls within the scope of the section, either generally or because it falls within one of the designated categories, and, thereafter, by the discretion to refuse to comply with the section if the judge considers that there are good reasons to do so: s 165(3). 
        
       
     92    The categories of evidence designated in the section include, generally speaking, those kinds of evidence where the common law (as affected by legislative intervention in the case of sexual assault complainants) had required that a warning be given. They are the kinds of evidence about which, at the time when the provision was proposed by the Commission, the courts had already acquired a special knowledge of the potential unreliability of the evidence or in respect of which the courts had perceived that there was a danger of the jury overestimating the weight to be given to the evidence. It was the nature of the evidence that made it suspect or that gave rise to concern that the jury might give it undue significance. A warning was generally required unless the circumstances of the charge, the issues at the trial, or the manner in which the trial had been conducted indicated that a warning was not warranted. 
      
       
     93    It should be noted that in relation to the evidence of oral admissions made to police officers, s 165(1)(f), the section does not replicate the circumstances in which a warning was required to be given at common law in accordance with the decision in McKinney and Judge. That is because s 165 is concerned, not to redress the disadvantage of an accused person who is in police custody, but to alert the jury to the unreliability of oral confessions made to police officers: Lowe (1997) 98 A Crim R 300 at 311. The focus of the warning necessary to avoid the possibility of a miscarriage of justice in respect of confessional material was altered significantly as a result of the enactment of s 424A of the Crimes Act (now s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act). That section, which was incorporated into the Crimes Act by legislation cognate to the Evidence Act, provided generally that an admission could not be received into evidence unless it had been electronically recorded. It was recognised by the majority in McKinney and Judge that the purpose and content of the warning to be given in respect of unrecorded confessions might need to change in the future. Their Honours said (at 474): 
      
       
        
         
         “A rule of practice will operate to counter the relative disadvantage accruing to an accused person who is interviewed while in police custody at a place lacking recording facilities. And as the means of recording become generally available, the absence of a recording will tend to bring the reliability of a confessional statement into issue, thus raising the question whether, in line with what was said in  
         Bromley v The Queen 
         , and quite apart from anything said in  
         Carr 
         , a warning should be given.” 
         
        
        
       However, the legislature appears to have determined for the courts what the majority of the High Court in  
       Carr 
        was not prepared to find: that evidence of a confession given orally by a police officer is evidence of a kind that may be unreliable. 
        
       
     94    Where there is evidence that falls within the scope of s 165 but no request is made by a party for a warning, the trial judge may still give a warning relying upon the power recognised in s 165(5). The combined effect of ss 164 and 165 is to provide the trial judge with the flexibility to give a warning appropriate to the case in light of the issues raised and the factors which might affect the reliability of the evidence. In R v Spedding (NSWCCA, 11 December 1997, unreported), this Court noted that the terms of ss 164 and 165 sought to express and give practical application to the common sense approach which had been adopted in other jurisdictions as exemplified in the following statement of Dickson J in Vetrovec v The Queen [1982] 67 CCC (2d) 1 (at 17): 
      
       
        
         
         “Because of the infinite range of circumstances which will arise in the criminal trial process it is not sensible to attempt to compress into a rule, a formula or a direction the concept of the need for prudent scrutiny of the testimony of any witness. What may be appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness. There is no magic in the word corroboration, or indeed in any other comparable expression such as confirmation and support.” 
         
        
       
     95    Whether the evidence in respect of which a request for a warning is made comes within one of the designated categories will be a matter for the trial judge to determine. It is a discretionary judgment which will generally involve a question of fact: R v Flood [1999] NSWCCA 198 at [14]; R v Taranto [1999] NSWCCA 396 at [2], [38]. The section is concerned with the possibility of unreliability: Flood at [3]. But as the Commission recognised in the second of the quotes from the Interim Report above, a warning does not have to be given just because the evidence comes within a specified category or might otherwise fall within the scope of the section. For example, there is no requirement that a warning always be given where the complainant in the trial of a child sexual assault offence is of a young age: R v AGJ (NSWCCA, 30 October 1997); Lane v R (1996) 66 FCR 144 at 149, or where a witness is suffering from a mental or physical disability: Flood, above. A warning is only required where there is a real possibility that the matter, which causes the evidence to fall into one of the designated categories, actually affects the reliability of the evidence before the court. The trial judge is entitled to come to the view that the reliability of the evidence is not affected by a matter which would otherwise bring the evidence within the section: Flood at [10]. 
      
       
     96    The application of s 165 to the evidence before a jury is clearly not restricted to evidence falling within the categories specified in s 165(1): Williams (1999) 104 A Crim R 260 at 268; Covill (2000) 114 A Crim R 111 at 121. However, the scope of the section in respect of evidence not coming within the designated categories is somewhat problematic. Any evidence adduced before a jury may be unreliable, yet it could not have been intended that the section should require a trial judge to determine whether there are good reasons for refusing a request to give a warning simply because a party points to some aspect of the evidence which suggests it may be unreliable. That was certainly not the intention of the Commission. 
      
       
     97    In R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298 Kirby J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ agreed) stated (at [62]): 
      
       
        
         
         “In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may over-estimate the probative value of certain evidence (see ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 1017)…..” 
         
        
        
       His Honour then went on to quote passages extracted from the judgment of Brennan J in  
       Bromley 
        at 325 that I have quoted more fully above. 
        
       
     98    Where a matter which might adversely affect the reliability of evidence in the trial would readily be understood and appreciated by a jury because it falls within their general experience and understanding and where the court has no special knowledge about the matter or no reason to doubt that the jury will appropriately assess its weight, then the evidence is not “of a kind that may be unreliable” and the section does not apply. Consistently with the common law, the Commission’s proposals, and the decision in Baartman, matters of a general nature that might affect the reliability of any kind of evidence adduced in a trial do not of themselves bring the evidence within the scope of the section. 
      
       
     99    In my opinion, matters which would not generally attract a warning under s 165 include: prior inconsistent statements made by a witness; inconsistencies within the evidence of a witness; inconsistencies between the evidence of a witness and other evidence in the trial; an allegation of bias made against a witness; or the fact that it has been suggested that the witness had a motive to lie. Evidence which is tainted by any of these types of matters is not for that reason alone “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”. However, as I will indicate later, these types of matters might be made the subject of comment by a trial judge, and, in the case of a crucial Crown witness, a summing up may be defective if no reference is made by the trial judge to such matters when reviewing the case against the accused. 
      
       
     100    In Lane v The Queen (1996) 66 FCR 144 one of the issues considered by the Court was whether a warning had to be given under s 165 in respect of the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant. The Court (Gallop, Davies and Kiefel JJ) said (at 146E): 
      
       
        
         
         “It may be observed that although subs (1) of s 165 is couched in terms which would not exclude other kinds of evidence qualifying as unreliable, there is no mention of ‘evidence of the victims of sexual offences’.  
         And it ought also be borne in mind that the section speaks only of evidence of a ‘kind’, which is to say a class, and this would require a generalised assessment and not one based upon a particular witness’s account in proceedings. 
         ”(my underlining) 
         
        
        
       The Court held that the section did not apply to victims of sexual assault offences as a category of unreliable evidence. 
        
       
     101    The approach taken by the Full Federal Court to s 165 is consistent with that taken by this Court in Baartman. Accordingly, when a request is made for a warning under the section, the trial judge must first determine whether the evidence, if it does not fall within one of the designated categories, is of the class, or type, of evidence about which a jury might be misled in making an assessment of whether to accept it or in evaluating its worth. The section will apply to the evidence if the trial judge considers that the court has some special knowledge or experience about that kind of evidence which the jury may not possess and which may affect its reliability, or because it is the kind of evidence to which a jury may attribute more weight than it really deserves. The risk of the jury giving too much weight to that kind of evidence may arise because of the nature of the evidence itself or because of the significance which may be attached to it by the jury having regard to the evidence in the context of the trial as a whole. If the evidence does not intrinsically have the potential to mislead the jury or if there is nothing about the trial which would suggest the jury may be deflected or misled in evaluating the evidence, then it is not within the scope of the section and a warning under s 165 is not necessary. 
      
       
     102    In R v PLV [2001] NSWCCA 282 at [51-54], it was held that a warning was not required to be given in respect of the fact that evidence was given by the complainant and her brother of matters occurring 25 years earlier when they were both young children. Although in that case s 165 did not apply because no request for a warning was made, it was held that a warning was not required although it was open to the trial judge to comment on the matter. The Chief Justice with whom the other members of the Court agreed remarked that the potential unreliability of such evidence would have been known to the average juror and it was not a matter which had become known to the courts by any special experience. It was not a case where the danger of the evidence may not have been appreciated by the jury without a caution or warning. 
      
       
     103    An example of the operation of s 165 to evidence of the kind where the jury might be mislead as to its reliability is R v Barnes (NSWCCA, 1 December 1998). This Court considered that a warning under s 165 should have been given in respect of the evidence of the behaviour of a tracker dog. This was because of the risk that the jury might place too much weight on the untested and untestable ability of a dog to track scent. Therefore, the jury were to be warned that they should bear in mind that the dog was not cross-examined and that they should be careful to avoid overestimating the reliability of the operation of the dog’s senses so as to avoid arriving too readily at the conclusion contended for by the Crown from the evidence of what the dog did. See also Benecke (1999) 106 A Crim R 282. 
      
       
     104    Another example is Lowe, above, at 317 where it was held that a warning should be given in relation to the identification of an object associated with the accused, even though such evidence is not a distinct category mentioned in s 165(1). A warning under the section was required because such evidence may be unreliable in the same kind of way as “identification evidence” referred to in s 165(1)(b) may be unreliable. It is evidence “of a kind that might be unreliable” because the court has special knowledge of the unreliability of identification evidence generally and there is the risk that the jury may place too much weight on the evidence unless they are warned of its dangers. It should be noted that the term “identification evidence” which appears in s 165(1)(b) has a particular meaning when used in the Evidence Act and is defined in the Dictionary of the Act so that the term is only used to refer to evidence identifying an accused person. 
      
       
     105    There are decisions of this Court which appear to suggest that the section has a wider scope than that which is identified in Baartman. In Lewis Beazley JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreed) stated (at 14); 
      
       
        
         
         “Section 165 is directed at evidence ‘which may be unreliable’ and specifies, by inclusion, a list of such evidence. The fact that the list is inclusive and not exhaustive means that by the express terms of the section, there is evidence not included in paragraphs (a) to (g) which ‘may be unreliable’ for the purposes of the section. Put simply, s 165(1)(a)-(g) is not an exclusive code of the unreliable evidence to which the section applies.  
         Evidence afflicted by bias, or evidence of an event given by a witness affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the event may be unreliable and thus fall within the section 
         .” (my underlining) 
          
         
        
       If this passage of the judgment is to be read as requiring that a warning under the section be given when requested in every case of a witness who is affected by bias or was at the time of the event intoxicated, I, with respect, do not believe that it should be followed. It is inconsistent with the view of the section taken in  
       Baartman 
        and, in my view, the purpose of the section. This may be because the passage indicates that s 165 relates to “evidence which may be unreliable” rather than the words “evidence of a kind which may be unreliable” used in the section. 
        
       
     106    In my opinion, the same can be said of this Court’s decision in V (1998) 100 A Crim R 488. In that case it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge had failed to adequately warn the jury of the evidence of the complainant where the Crown case relied solely upon her evidence. In particular, it was argued that there were specific features of the case which meant that the complainant’s evidence may be unreliable and thus a warning was required under s 165(2). Those features were: the significant delay in complaint, the personal animosity of the complainant and her mother to the accused and the fact that the complaint was made shortly after what Smart J, who gave the leading judgment, described as “ugly confrontations between the appellant and the complainant and her mother”. Smart J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Dowd J agreed, held that a warning should have been given under s 165(2) in respect of the evidence of the complainant. In reaching that conclusion, Smart J referred to s 165 as applying “where evidence may be unreliable”. 
      
       
     107    With respect, I do not believe that the evidence came within the scope of s 165. Unless evidence of a complainant is of a kind that may be unreliable (and that was not suggested in the judgment), there was no aspect of it which called for a warning under the section. There was nothing to indicate that the jury may have failed to understand the significance of the circumstances surrounding the making of the complaint nor did the court have any special knowledge about the matter that it could impart to the jury. 
      
       
     108    However, it does not follow that the decision to allow the appeal was erroneous or that a warning about the complainant’s evidence was not required. Smart J also held that s 164 did not dispense with the need to give a warning of the type referred to by Lee J in Murray and that such a warning should have been given because the Crown case relied exclusively upon the complainant’s evidence. That finding is, with respect, obviously correct. But in my opinion all that was required was a warning of this nature with appropriate comments about the matters that were relevant for the jury to bear in mind in their careful scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     109    Further, in my respectful opinion R v Mayberry [2000] NSWCCA 531 should not be followed to the extent that it may be taken to have held that inconsistent statements made by a complainant in a sexual assault case required that a warning be given under s 165. That decision was primarily concerned with the requirement for a Longman warning and it appears that the absence of such a warning, or, at least an adequate one, was the principal basis upon which the summing up was found to be defective and the appeal allowed. However, Beazley JA (with whom Greg James and Kirby JJ agreed) said (at [62]):  
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel at trial did not seek a direction under s165. However, the inconsistencies in NRD's evidence, particularly in relation to complaint, were such as required the judge to give a warning which encompassed the type of matters specified in s165(2). In particular, he should have warned the jury that NRD's evidence may be unreliable, pointed out for them the matters which might cause the evidence to be unreliable and given a warning to the jury of the need for caution in assessing whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.” 
         
        
        
       I do not, with respect, believe, for the reasons I have already given, that the fact that a complainant has made inconsistent statements is a matter which by itself necessarily requires a warning under the section or otherwise. At least, that is so where evidence of complaint has been admitted only as relevant to the credibility of the complainant, for example, to rebut a suggestion of fabrication under s 108(3) of the Act. 
        
       
     110    In Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 Gibbs J said (at 536): 
      
       
        
         
         “………the whole purpose of contradicting the witness by proof of the inconsistent statement is to show that the witness is unreliable. In some cases the circumstances might be such that it would be highly desirable, if not necessary, for the judge to warn the jury against accepting the evidence of the witness. From the point of view of the accused this warning would be particularly necessary when the testimony of the witness was more damaging to the accused than the previous statement. In some cases the unreliability of the witness might be so obvious as to make a warning on the subject almost superfluous. It is possible to conceive other cases in which the evidence given by a witness might be regarded as reliable notwithstanding that he had made an earlier statement inconsistent with his testimony. For these reasons I cannot accept that it is always necessary or even appropriate to direct a jury that the evidence of a witness who has made a previous inconsistent statement should be treated as unreliable”. 
         
        
        
       Much of this statement was quoted with approval in  
       Morris v The Queen 
        (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 469-467. 
        
       
     111    However, the situation may be different where the evidence of complaint has been admitted as evidence of the truth of what is stated and, therefore, is being used for a hearsay purpose. In R v TJF [2001] NSWCCA 127 the jury were told that the evidence of complaint could be used as evidence of “the allegation made in the complaint” as well as evidence of consistent conduct on the part of the complainant. In other words, the complaint was admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said in the complaint under s 66 of the Act. Studdert J, with whom Beazley JA agreed, held that a warning was required under s 165(2) with respect to the evidence of complaint, it being hearsay evidence and, therefore, falling within s 165(1)(a). As a request to give a warning was refused and there was no good reason for the refusal, it was held that there had been a miscarriage of justice. However, Studdert J specifically referred to, and applied, Mayberry and determined that one factor requiring a warning under s 165 was that there were different versions of the complaint. 
      
       
     112    The third member of the Court in TJF, Sperling J, while agreeing generally with the reasons of Studdert J and that a warning should have been given, noted one exception to his concurrence with what his Honour had said. Sperling J stated (at paras 74-80): 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The exception is this. His Honour is of the opinion that the warning pursuant to s165 ought to have extended to alerting the jury to the different versions of the complaint (as counsel for the appellant submitted it should have done).  
          
          
         I respectfully disagree. Section 165 applies - as specified in subs (1) - to ‘evidence of a kind that may be unreliable’. If a party so requests, the judge is to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable and inform them of the matters that may cause it to be unreliable. 
          
          
         When one looks at the kinds of evidence in subs (1) which are listed as examples of the kinds of evidence to which the section relates, it is apparent that the purpose of the section is to provide the jury with the benefit of the accumulated experience of the judiciary concerning the potential for unreliability associated with some kinds of evidence. 
          
          
         The reasons why one kind of evidence may be unreliable are different from the reasons why another kind of evidence may be unreliable. For example, the reasons why hearsay evidence may be unreliable are different from the reasons why identification evidence may be unreliable, and different again from why evidence from a prison informer may be unreliable. The section is directed to ways in which evidence of various kinds may be unreliable for reasons associated with a particular kind of evidence. 
          
          
         Inconsistency between versions of events is as much a reason why direct evidence of events may be unreliable as it is a reason why hearsay evidence of events may be unreliable. The inconsistency between versions of complaint in the present case was a reason why the evidence of complaint might be unreliable, but it was not a reason associated with the hearsay character of the evidence.  
          
          
         A trial judge should, of course, relate his or her observations to the evidence when giving a warning concerning hearsay evidence pursuant to section 165, specifying how it is that the evidence in question may be unreliable in ways associated with its hearsay character. But the section does not extend to a feature of the evidence which may make the evidence unreliable for other reasons.  
          
          
         In the present case, the trial judge was at liberty to warn the jury that the evidence of complaint might be unreliable in view of the inconsistency between versions, but s165 did not require that to be done.” 
         
        
       
     113    Whether or not inconsistency in hearsay statements is a matter relevant to the reliability of the statement as hearsay evidence need not be resolved here. But I respectfully agree with Sperling J that, simply because evidence falls within the scope of s 165, it does not follow that the trial judge must inform the jury of every matter which may affect the reliability of the evidence. I agree with his Honour’s view that the trial judge must only inform the jury of those matters which bring the evidence within one or more of the stated categories of evidence or which otherwise cause the evidence to be of a “kind that may be unreliable” in the sense in which that term is used in Baartman. The use of the words “inform the jury” in s 165(2)(b) implies, to my mind, that the jury will be told something about which they might otherwise have been unaware. 
      
       
     114    For completeness I should indicate that I do not believe that a warning under s 165 is required simply because the evidence is given by a witness who is a self-admitted corrupt and dishonest police officer who is prepared to lie. Insofar as the decision of this Court R v Lonie and Groom [1999] NSWCCA 19 is authority for that proposition generally, with respect I do not believe it should be followed. However, there were a number of errors that this Court determined were made by the trial judge in relation to his comments about police officers. Such a warning may have been necessary in light of what the judge said otherwise. 
      
       
     115    I am not to be taken as suggesting in any way that a trial judge should not comment on matters of a general nature which might affect the reliability of the evidence, even if the matters may be obvious to the jury. It may be necessary, particularly in a long or complicated case, to remind the jury of such matters when they are assessing the evidence. In some cases, such as where the testimony of the witness is vital to the Crown case, comments by the trial judge on matters going to the heart of the reliability of the witness will be required whether or not a warning is necessary: see Crampton at [39]. 
      
       
     116    But, as was said by the majority in Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 (at 561): 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. Consequently, the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on or discuss the evidence. Discussion or comment which is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way.” 
         
        
       
     117    In Longman, Crampton, and most recently in Azzopardi and Davis v The Queen [2001] 75 ALJR 931, the High Court has been at pains to distinguish between the different purposes served by comments, directions and warnings made or given by a trial judge to the jury during the course of the summing up. As the object to be achieved by the use of these distinct types of judicial statements is different, so will be their content. These differences can be important when the fairness or adequacy of a summing up is being considered on appeal. The failure to make an appropriate comment on the evidence will not necessarily result in an inadequate or unfair summing up or suggest that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in the context of the summing up as a whole and the manner in which the trial was conducted. But the failure to give a warning required by the Evidence Act or the common law will normally result in the quashing of the conviction. 
      
       
     118    A significant difference between a warning and a comment is what the trial judge needs to say in order to bring to the jury’s attention the matter or matters that may affect the reliability of the evidence. When making a comment, it may be sufficient for the trial judge simply to remind the jury of what counsel said in his or her address about the matter or matters. But in giving a warning required by the common law or s 165, especially when informing the jury of the matters that may cause the evidence to be unreliable under s 165(2)(b), the trial judge must bring his or her judicial authority to bear because the purpose of the warning is to share with the jury a special knowledge or appreciation of the evidence which the jury does not have. 
      
       
     119    In my opinion, if, in accordance with Baartman, s 165 is not generally confined to evidence of a kind where a warning would be required at common law, there is a significant risk that the impact on a jury of a warning on the reliability of evidence will be diminished. This is particularly so in a case where the warning relates to a raft of matters, most of which would be obvious to the jury, but where one or more may in fact be the kind of matter in respect of which the jury actually needs the assistance of the court. Further, it seems to me that there is a real possibility that unwarranted or trite warnings about matters which would be obvious to the jury will devalue any other warning given by the trial judge. 
      
       
     120    I do not believe that it was the intention of Parliament, that matters which might have been the subject of comment at common law, because they were within the jury’s general experience and understanding, are now to be the subject of a warning under the Evidence Act. This is particularly so where there remains a considerable overlap between the common law and the provisions of the Act in this regard, as s 165(5) acknowledges. Yet it appears to me that there are statements in judgments of this Court that suggest this is the effect of s 165. Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law 3rd Ed, at p 421 states that, at least arguably, this is one of the differences between a warning under the Act and a warning at common law. There is no reason why that should be so. The criticism made by the Commission was that the warnings at common law were too rigid, technical and complex: they were required in cases where they were not necessary and avoided where needed; Ibid at p1015. Yet as Brennan J said in Bromley in the passage quoted earlier: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the danger is so obvious that the jury are fully alive to it without a warning, no warning need be given”. 
         
        
       
     121    I have earlier indicated my view that a warning under subs 165(2) need not include a reference to every matter that may call into doubt the reliability of the evidence. However, that is not so with evidence identifying the accused as the offender. But insofar as an adequate warning about the danger of evidence identifying the accused should refer to each matter which may significantly affect the reliability of the evidence, such a warning is special. It was considered to be so at common law: Domican at 561. It is also treated specially under the Act. Although there is a reference to “identification evidence” in s 165(1)(b) and, therefore, s 165(2) applies to it, there is an additional element to a warning in respect of this type of evidence. Section 116(1) requires that the judge inform the jury of the “special need for caution” in relation to evidence identifying the accused and the reasons for that need for caution “both generally and in the circumstances of the case”: see Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414. The content of a warning with respect to evidence of identification of an object or a person other than the accused, may not need to have the same stringency as a warning required by s 116: Lowe, above at 317. 
      
       
     122    Both the requirement to give a warning and the general content of the warning to be given in respect of evidence falling within s 165 are found in s 165(2). However, the trial judge is not required to comply with that subsection “if there are good reasons for doing so”: s 165(3). In my view s 165(3) refers not just to the general requirement to give a warning when requested but also applies to the content of the warning and, in particular, to the requirement to inform the jury of all matters that may adversely affect the reliability of the evidence. In other words, a trial judge may determine, if there appear to him or her good reason for doing so, not to comply fully with the requirement under s 165(2)(b) to inform the jury of a matter affecting the reliability of the evidence. This may be because of the manner in which the trial has been conducted, the issues before the jury, or the irrelevancy of the matter in the particular circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     123    It is not essential in all cases that the trial judge give reasons for not complying with subs 165(2) and the section itself does not require that reasons be given. Not infrequently the reasons may be apparent from exchanges between the bench and counsel or may be found elsewhere in statements made by the trial judge other than at the time when the warning is refused: R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66. Good reasons may be found in the judge’s indication that he or she intends to direct the jury during the summing up in a particular way: Flood at [16]. 
      
       
     124    But in most cases the trial judge should state what he or she considers to be the reasons for not complying with the section: R v Beattie (1996) 40 NSWLR 155 at 160; R v Stanton (NSWCCA, 24 July 1998, unreported). The reasons need not be elaborate but sufficient should be said so that “an independent fair-minded observer would accept that the accused had a fair trial according to law”: Taranto at [15]. So if the trial judge determines that there are good reasons not to comply with subs 165(2)(b), reasons should generally be given for that determination. 
      
       
        
       Warnings as to the evidence of accomplices 
        
       
     125    The term “accomplice” is not used in s 165(1). Subsection 165(1)(d) refers to a witness “who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”. Whether the witness falls into that category is initially a matter of fact to be determined by the trial judge, although a finding that there is no evidence that the witness falls into that category is a question of law: Taranto at [7] and [38]. 
      
       
     126    It may be preferable that a trial judge avoids using the word “accomplice” during his or her warnings to the jury. The use of that word may convey, inadvertently, that the trial judge believes that the witness is an accomplice of the accused and, therefore, that the trial judge has formed the view that the accused is guilty of the charge before the jury. 
      
       
     127    In respect of accomplices or persons otherwise implicated in the offence before the jury, the matters which were considered by the common law as rendering their evidence suspect and which gave rise to the need for a warning were two-fold: firstly, they may have a reason to implicate another person even to the extent of implicating a person who is in fact innocent of the crime and, secondly, they may tend to exaggerate the role of another while minimising their own involvement and fabricate evidence to achieve this end: R v McLachlan [1999] 2 VR 553 at 562; R v Kendrick [1997] 2 VR 699 at 705; Downey (1997) 97 A Crim R 41 at 44; Ware (1994) 73 A Crim R 17 at 28. 
      
       
     128    As the trial judge in the present case told the jury, these are the matters within the special experience of the courts. Therefore, they are matters which should be drawn to the attention of the jury whenever a warning under the section is given in respect of evidence of a witness falling within this category. These are the matters about which the trial judge is required to inform the jury under s 165(2)(b) unless there is good reason not to do so. In Wood v R [2001] NSWCCA 228 it was argued on behalf of the applicant that the trial judge should have informed the jury that “persons involved in the commission of an offence may make false claims as to the involvement of others out of motives of revenge or antipathy”. This Court held that there was no requirement for the trial judge to inform the jury of such a matter because it would have been obvious to them. However, it should be noted that at the trial no request had been made for a warning under s 165(2). 
      
       
     129    At common law, it was necessary to inform a jury that it was dangerous to convict on the evidence of an accomplice unless his or her evidence was corroborated. Such a direction was probably required whether or not there was in fact evidence capable of amounting to corroboration: Kelleher v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 534 at 555, 560, 568. However, such a direction is no longer required by reason of s 164 and there is no particular terminology that needs to be used when giving the warning required by s 165(2) in respect of the evidence of an accomplice: R v Spedding (NSWCCA, 11 December 1997); R v Paek [1999] NSWCCA 184. 
      
       
     130    In a case where a warning is required under s 165(2), the content of the warning will necessarily depend upon the particular facts before the jury. The content of the warning or the information to be conveyed to the jury by the trial judge about the evidence of a witness falling within s 165(1)(d) will vary from case to case depending upon the circumstances in which the accomplice came to give evidence against the accused. For example, where the witness has been granted an immunity, the warning may need to bring this matter to the attention of the jury and to inform them why this circumstance may cause the evidence to be unreliable: Checconi (1988) 34 A Crim R 160 at 170-171 and R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 at 176 where Badgery-Parker J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is undoubtedly the case that where circumstances revealed by the evidence go beyond merely the fact that the witness was an accomplice, the duty of a trial judge to direct the jury in respect of their approach to that evidence will not be discharged by some mere perfunctory recitation of standard formulae. It is necessary for the judge to bring home to the jury the reasons why the warning is given and to lay out for them the particular circumstances of the instant case which warrant their giving special scrutiny to the evidence of the accomplice witness.” 
         
        
        
       Although his Honour made these comments about a warning under the common law, they are equally applicable to a warning under s 165(2). 
        
        
       The directions and warnings given in the appellant’s trial 
        
       
     131    In having regard to the directions, comments or warnings given by Judge Garling in relation to the reliability of Braddick’s evidence, it should be noted that the trial was a short one and that the summing up followed immediately after the addresses of counsel. The summing up takes only twenty pages of transcript and six of those pages are concerned with the evidence of Braddick. 
      
       
     132    After the trial judge told the jury that the real issue before them was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was one of the two persons who committed the offence, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now the Crown's case relies upon Mr Braddick. There is very little else. Mr Braddick gave you, at least in this court, gave you two different versions. Mr Braddick, you were told, pleaded guilty to being involved in this home invasion I will call it. He came to this Court. He said that the accused was with him, he had told the police about that and he would give evidence in the trial of the accused. All this came out in evidence. He was sentenced and as part of his sentence, it was taken into account, as the law requires, he was going to give evidence in this trial. He was sent to gaol and then he came here, obviously, you could tell from gaol, no secret about that, he is still serving the sentence and he gave evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
     133    His Honour then reminded the jury of the initial part of Braddick’s evidence when the witness said that he was too intoxicated to remember what happened and that, the voice, which he heard during the commission of the offence, was not that of the accused. The trial judge then told the jury that, after various applications that did not concern them, Braddick decided he would give evidence implicating the accused. After his Honour had summarised Braddick’s evidence-in-chief for the jury, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You recall he was cross-examined. He said to you that what he first told you in the witness box was a pack of lies. He lied under oath. You have got to remember that. He lied under oath. He told you that he had had a fair bit to drink that day. There were three of them drinking. They had consumed, beer, vodka and port. He said his memory was about seventy-five per cent good for what happened. He said he used to drink a fair bit, but he put himself into rehab. He was half drunk. I think he said he was half drunk at the time he spoke to the police and he was a bit worse than that earlier on. 
          
          
         You will then recall, a number of questions and answers were put to him, from the record of interview and he conceded that he had not fully told the truth. But in addition to that he conceded that, when he was first caught by the police, he had said that he was the only one involved. There was no one else. And he had given a record of interview. Quite clearly in the record of interview, he had said in part of it, that this accused was in the house with him. But there are other parts of the record of interview, where he was clearly inconsistent and you remember one classic example was, he did not have himself belting on the door, in the record of interview, he had the accused belting on the door. But, by the time he had come to be sentenced, he had admitted that it was him that was belting on the door and as I just read out to you, he said it in this Court yesterday.  
          
          
         It was put to him that what he had said about the accused being involved was a pack of lies. He replied and this is my note I have got to tell you, it differs slightly from what the Crown told you. It does not matter much. ""If he was innocent, I would not bring him into it."" He then told you that before giving the statement to the police, the record of interview, that there had been several things said to him by the police, by a policeman and they included that ""They had spoken to the accused and he had put Braddick in."" and ""I would get a name of a dog or an informer."" And that Mal had dobbed him in and thought if he had not dobbed him in, he would be known as a dog. I did not quite follow that. But I think you can follow the gist of what he was saying. I should say that the police, as you heard, have denied any such conversation. Those police that were called here, anyway, have denied any such conversation.  
          
          
         Now you saw him give evidence, you have got to assess him. You remember I said to you, right at the start, that that is one of the duties you would have. You have got to decide, whether you are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that that part of his evidence relating to the accused being there, whether you can accept it. You must remember these things and weigh them all up. He lied to you under oath. He was not truthful to the police at times. You must think about how he looked, what impression you, got.  
          
          
         There are a number of other things to do with that, which you are going to have to think about. The Crown said to you, “You have also got to think about the fact, he has been in gaol. That he has come here to give evidence against an old mate. He might be very reluctant to do that."" And that may cause some of his problems. It is not traditional to dob in someone. That could be causing a problem. On the other hand, he may be a straight-out liar. 
          
         
        
       
     134    To this point in the summing up, his Honour had been making comments about the evidence of Braddick which were relevant to the jury’s assessment of his reliability. But he was not informing them of matters under s 165(2) because none of the matters, which his Honour had so far brought to the jury’s attention, would have justified a warning under s 165. Putting aside the fact that Braddick was an accomplice, his evidence was not “of a kind which may be unreliable” within the terms of the section. This is notwithstanding that clearly his evidence may have been unreliable by reason of the matters referred to by his Honour in the portion of the summing up I have just quoted. 
      
       
     135    His Honour then went on: 
      
       
        
         
         “What you have got to remember and this is a matter of law, when you are assessing his evidence is that he is known as an accomplice. Now this is a direction of law, which I have to give to you. This is a direction which I must give you concerning the evidence of Mr Braddick. It is a direction which is given in every case in which the Crown relies upon the evidence of an accomplice, in order to establish the guilt of the accused. It is not given in this case because of any view which I may have formed, concerning the evidence of Mr Braddick. Such a direction must be given in every case, in which the Crown relies upon the evidence of a person, who himself participated in some way, in the very crime or crimes with which the accused has been charged. 
          
          
         The need to give such a direction arises because the courts have, over the years, accumulated a great deal of experience concerning the reliability of evidence given by accomplices and that experience would not readily be known to general members of the public, such as yourselves. That experience has shown, that the evidence given by accomplices, is often unreliable. I do not intend to suggest that their evidence is always unreliable.  
          
          
         My purpose in giving you this direction is only to warn you, that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable and for that reason alone, you must approach that evidence with considerable caution in the way which I will outline shortly.  
          
          
         There are no doubt, many reasons why the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable. It is only natural, you may think, that an accomplice may want to shift the blame, from himself, onto others and to justify his own conduct. In the process the accomplice may construct untruthful stories, which tend to play down his own part in the crime and to play up the part of others in their crime. Even to blame quite innocent people. Experience has shown that once having given that version to the police, the accomplice may feel that he is locked into that version and that he is bound to relate the same version when giving evidence and when assessing him, you must remember, that warning I have given to you, remember it is given in every such case.” 
         
        
       
     136    This part of the summing up contained the warning under s 165(2). What his Honour said to the jury in that regard has to be considered in the light of the direction that counsel agreed his Honour should give and what warning and information was required to be given to the jury in compliance with s 165(2) because Braddick was “ a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings”. 
      
       
     137    The direction that the counsel agreed Judge Garling should give was, what his Honour referred to as, a “direction on accomplices”. Accordingly his Honour gave the warning which had traditionally been given in relation to accomplices at common law as modified by s 164(3)(a) of the Act. That subsection relieved his Honour of the necessity of warning the jury that it was dangerous to convict on Braddick’s evidence in the absence of corroboration. The warning given by the trial judge, however, complied generally with s 165(2): it indicated that the evidence of Braddick might be unreliable because he was involved in the commission of the offence with which the appellant was charged; it informed the jury in general terms why the evidence of an accomplice might be unreliable; it warned the jury of the need for caution in accepting the evidence. The warning was given with the authority of the judge and the court’s special knowledge of the unreliability of that kind of evidence was conveyed to the jury. 
      
       
        
       Were the directions inadequate or erroneous? 
        
       
     138    The first complaint now made about the directions is that the warning given to the jury was “cursory and amounted to little more than recitation of formula”. In my opinion, that criticism is unfounded. What his Honour said by way of informing the jury of matters that may make the evidence of an accomplice unreliable were adequate, generally speaking, to alert the jury to the potential unreliability of Braddick’s evidence and to explain why they should exercise caution in acting upon it. There was nothing that his Honour said that was inappropriate to an assessment of the evidence of Braddick. Nor was what his Honour said ineffective in bringing home to the jury the danger generally arising from the evidence of an accomplice. 
      
       
     139    The next complaint made is that his Honour diluted the warning by telling the jury on three occasions that such a direction was given in every case where an accomplice gives evidence. As Badgery-Parker J pointed out in R v Chai at 178, the trial judge should in fairness to the Crown make it clear that, in giving the warning, he or she is not expressing a personal opinion about the evidence but rather that the warning is given because of the nature of the evidence which is before the jury. However, in R v Roddom [2001] NSWCCA 168, I cautioned against a trial judge repeatedly indicating to the jury that the particular warning was always given where evidence of that nature was before the court. It seemed to me that such a repetition runs a risk that the jury will treat the warning as a matter of routine. 
      
       
     140    I do not retreat from that view, but it is the particular summing up under scrutiny that has to be considered when determining whether the warning given was effective in bringing home to the jury the caution with which they were required to approach the evidence. In this particular case I do not accept that the repetition of the statement that such a warning is given in every case of evidence given by an accomplice had the effect for which the appellant contends. Quite the contrary, in my view, the repetition enforced the general distrust that the court attaches to such evidence. Two of the occasions when the statement was made occurred immediately after one another and were followed by an explanation as to why such a direction is always given: that is because of the special experience of courts concerning the unreliability of such evidence. The third time his Honour made the statement occurred at the end of the directions on accomplices immediately after the jury were told that they must remember the warning when assessing the evidence of Braddick. 
      
       
     141    The appellant’s major complaint is that his Honour failed adequately, or at all, to refer to two matters which were significant in the jury’s assessment of the evidence of Braddick. These matters were, firstly, that he had been given a discount of his sentence as a result of his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant and, secondly, that, if he failed to fulfil that undertaking, he might be the subject of a Crown appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
     142    As I have already indicated, neither of these matters formed the basis of an accomplice warning at common law. That may be because discounts, undertakings and Crown appeals based upon the failure to comply with undertakings are relatively modern forensic weapons. But as part of an accomplice warning the judge was required to inform the jury that the witness might have a reason to implicate another person even to the extent of fabricating evidence against an innocent person. It was necessary that the jury be informed of this matter because it explained to the jury why the evidence of an accomplice might be unreliable in the absence of any evidence to suggest that the accomplice was to obtain any benefit as a result of giving evidence against the accused. 
      
       
     143    The fact that a discount of a sentence has been given to a witness as a result of an undertaking to give evidence against another person, is not a matter which is intrinsic to a witness who falls within s 165(1)(d), nor is it a matter which is exclusive to such a witness. There will be cases where a witness has been given, or will receive, a benefit as a result of undertaking to give evidence about events in which the person was not in any way concerned, criminally or otherwise. A paid police informer is an obvious example. Nor is it unusual for an allegation to be made to a witness that his or her evidence has been fabricated so that the witness can pursue a claim for compensation under victims compensation legislation, or to obtain custody of a child of the marriage, or for some other benefit personal to the witness and which the jury are asked to take into account as a possible reason for the witness to fabricate evidence against the accused. 
      
       
     144    I do not believe that the fact that a witness might obtain a benefit as a result of giving evidence against the accused necessarily brings the evidence within the scope of s 165. It is frequently the case that defence counsel puts to a witness that he or she has something to gain from implicating the accused in the criminal conduct giving rise to the charge before the jury. Yet I am not aware that it has ever been suggested, at least prior to the introduction of the Evidence Act, that a warning was required about the possible unreliability of such evidence. In my view there is no difference between an allegation that the witness is to obtain a benefit from giving evidence against an accused and an allegation that the witness has some other motive, such as bias, for giving the disputed evidence. Neither of these types of allegations, even if accepted by the witness as true, necessarily results in the evidence being of a kind that might be unreliable for the purposes of s 165. 
      
       
     145    In my opinion, the fact that there is evidence in the trial that the witness has actually received a benefit for giving evidence against the accused diminishes the necessity for the judge to bring that matter to the attention of the jury and to warn them of its possible affect on the reliability of the witness. A warning is required where the jury might not be able to ascertain that there is any benefit to be gained by the witness in giving evidence. There is, in such a case, a danger that the jury may give the evidence significant weight simply because they cannot perceive a motive for the witness to fabricate evidence implicating the accused in the offence before them. As I have already indicated, part of the rationale for the accomplice warning at common law was to alert the jury to the fact that the accomplice may have reason to implicate the accused even though the reason may not have been obvious. 
      
       
     146    Prison informers are viewed by the courts as potentially unreliable witnesses and, therefore, are specifically referred to in s 165(1)(e). One of the reasons why a warning was normally required in respect of the evidence of such a witness at common law was because the jury might not be able to divine any possible benefit to be gained by a prisoner who was serving a sentence at the time of giving evidence. In Pollitt v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 558, when discussing the various factors which made the evidence of prison informers potentially unreliable, Deane J said (at 586): 
      
       
        
         
         “Another [reason] is the likelihood that a prison informer may be motivated to fabricate such evidence either by a perception that he will derive some benefit in terms of sentence, treatment or release on parole or by reason of any of a variety of pressures of a type which may easily arise in a prison environment and  
         which may not be apparent to a jury 
         ”. (my underlining) 
         
        
       
     147    I acknowledge that it is generally desirable for a trial judge to specifically raise with a jury the fact, if it be the case, that a witness coming within subs 165(1)(d) had been given a discount of his or her sentence on the basis of an undertaking to give evidence against the accused and the effect of a failure to comply with that undertaking; see Conway v R [2000] 98 FCR 204 at [207]. But these are matters that, in my view, fall into the category of comment on the evidence and there is no requirement that the jury be informed that they are matters that may cause the evidence to be unreliable under subs 165(2)(b). The question of whether the failure to refer to those matters has brought about a miscarriage of justice will depend upon a consideration of the evidence at the trial, the addresses and the effect of the summing up considered as a whole and not simply because there was a failure to comply with s 165(2). 
      
       
     148    At the end of the day what is required is that the jury be placed in a position where they can properly, fairly and effectively assess the evidence before them. If there is a matter that may adversely affect the reliability of the evidence or some part of it, what is required to adequately deal with that matter in the summing up will depend upon the nature of the matter, the issues before the jury and the conduct of the trial. What may be sufficient in a short trial with a single issue may not be adequate in a complex trial where the summing up occurs some considerable time after the particular piece of evidence has been given. What is required, where s 165 applies and a request for warning is made under s 165(2), may not be required where the evidence does not come within the section or no warning under the section is requested. If there is a risk that the jury might not have fully appreciated the significance of a matter that has the potential to affect the reliability of the evidence or may have been misled as to its significance, then the trial judge should warn the jury about the matter in order to avoid a risk of a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     149    This is why it is necessary that a trial judge should inform a jury of the relevance of a grant of immunity to an accomplice. Without the judge bringing that matter to the attention of the jury and informing them how that matter may cause the evidence of the accomplice to be unreliable, there is a risk that the jury may not have been in a position to properly evaluate the accomplice’s evidence. 
      
       
     150    But, in my opinion, the same concern does not attend the fact that an accomplice has received a discount of his sentence upon giving an undertaking to give evidence against an accused. I do not believe that there is anything peculiar or special about that matter that would justify a warning or require that the judge inform the jury of its relevance in the assessment of the evidence of the accomplice. Generally speaking, there can be no real basis to fear that the significance of the matter may be lost on the jury. Nor can it be said to be a matter about which the court has some special knowledge that it should share with the jury. Although, the jury may have no general experience or understanding of a situation in which an offender has received a sentencing discount on the basis of giving evidence against another person, they would readily appreciate that a witness may fabricate evidence in order to gain a significant benefit for himself, whatever the nature of that benefit might be. I cannot accept that a jury would have any difficulty at all in fully appreciating the significance and relevance of the fact that a criminal might falsely implicate another in order to spend less time in gaol. 
      
       
     151    I do not believe that the jury had to be informed of such a matter under s 165(2). But if I were wrong in that view, it would have been well open to the trial judge to determine that there was a good reason, in the context of the trial and counsel’s addresses, not to inform the jury of that aspect of Braddick’s evidence because it would have been obvious to the jury and they would fully have appreciated its impact upon Braddick’s reliability. As Wood CJ at CL stated in R v JGW [1999] NSWCCA 116: 
      
       
        
         
         “Moreover, it remains the fact that where a danger, such as unreliability is obvious to the lay mind, the lack of any specific reference to it is diminished in its significance:  
         Bromley 
          (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 325.” 
         
        
       
     152    In any event, the trial judge in the present case did not fail to refer to the benefit received by Braddick during the summing up, even if he did so somewhat obliquely. As can be seen from the first passage that I have quoted from the summing up, at the very commencement of his discussion with the jury about the evidence of Braddick, Judge Garling referred to the circumstances in which the witness came to give evidence against the appellant. Although the trial judge did not mention the words “discount of sentence” or explicitly refer to the sentence of Braddick being reduced by reason of his undertaking, the jury must have understood that his Honour was referring to the discount given to Braddick by reason of his undertaking to give evidence against the appellant when the trial judge said:  
      
       
        
         
         “He was sentenced and as part of his sentence, it was taken into account as the law requires, he was going to give evidence in this trial.” 
         
        
       
     153    It was appropriate that his Honour remind the jury of the matter, but having made a reference to it there was really nothing more to be said in order that the jury would fully understood and appreciate its significance to the single issue in the trial. The fact that defence counsel at the trial did not raise the matter with the trial judge, indicates that he was satisfied that the jury appreciated the point. 
      
       
     154    It was submitted on the hearing of the appeal that the trial judge should have mentioned this matter when informing the jury as part of the accomplice warning. I do not believe there is any merit in the complaint. Normally it is preferable that a trial judge give the warning and the information under s 165(2) at the one place in the summing up: R v Richards (NSWCCA, 3 April 1998) at 7. But, as I have already indicated, the fact that Braddick received a discount was a separate consideration from the fact that his evidence might have been unreliable because he was an accomplice. In my view there was no error in this regard, particularly having regard to the brevity of the summing up. 
      
       
     155    For the same reasons that it was not necessary, in my view, that his Honour specifically refer to the sentencing discount, there was no possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising by his Honour’s failure to refer to the right of the Crown to appeal if Braddick had reneged on his undertaking. In the circumstances of this trial, that was not a matter about which his Honour was required to inform the jury when giving them the warning under s 165(2). 
      
       
     156    The following question and answer were given during cross-examination of Braddick: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Is it the case that someone has indicated to you today that if you did not come back into this Court and stick to what you told the police that you would be required to go back to court? 
          
         
        
        
         
         A. No I knew that before I came here today.” 
         
        
       
     157    It can be assumed that defence counsel addressed the jury on the consequences for Braddick if he had failed to give evidence implicating the accused as he had undertaken to do. There has been nothing placed before this Court to suggest that he did not address on this matter as would be expected in light of the question he asked. The single issue before the jury was whether they could accept the evidence of Braddick beyond reasonable doubt. I find it difficult to believe, without evidence being placed before this Court to the contrary, that a central platform in defence counsel’s address would not have been that Braddick had received a benefit for giving evidence implicating the appellant in the offence and that Braddick knew that, if he did not do so, he risked further punishment. I have little doubt that defence counsel would have placed great significance on the change in the nature of Braddick’s evidence after he was cross-examined by the Crown on the inconsistency between his initial evidence and the contents of the ERISP. 
      
       
     158    Provided that the consequences for the witness in failing to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking has been sufficiently placed before the jury so that they would understand the significance of the fact that a witness is still at risk of further punishment when giving evidence in the trial, I do not believe that the trial judge is always required to raise this matter with the jury and inform them of its relevance in order to ensure that a miscarriage of justice did not arise. Whether or not the failure to refer to the matter in the summing up gives rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice will depend upon the circumstances of the particular trial. In this case the summing up followed immediately after defence counsel’s address and there was a single issue before the jury: Braddick’s reliability when implicating the appellant in the offence. 
      
       
     159    I acknowledge that it is important that the jury understands that a witness, who has been given a sentence discount or some other benefit for giving evidence implicating an accused, has at the time of giving evidence before the jury an obligation to give such evidence on pain of further punishment. The jury should not be left to assume that the witness has no reason to give false evidence implicating the accused at the time of the trial. They should be made aware that the fact that the witness has been sentenced for his part in the offence did not necessarily diminish the likelihood that his evidence might be unreliable: Conway at [207]. 
      
       
     160    There was some discussion during the hearing of the appeal as to whether the jury would have inferred from the question and answer that I have quoted above that Braddick was at risk of some sort of penalty if he failed to fulfil his undertaking. I accept that a jury could not be expected to know of the mechanism by which Braddick might be further punished if he did not fulfil the undertaking that he gave, unless they had been told of the right of the Crown to appeal during the course of the trial. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I would assume that at least one counsel, if not both, referred to the matter during his address. 
      
       
     161    In any event, the jury were made aware that Braddick risked having to return to court if he did not “stick to what he told the police”. The jury must have understood this to be a reference by defence counsel to Braddick’s undertaking to give evidence for the Crown in accordance with the ERISP. The jury knew that he had received a discount of his sentence because of the undertaking. In my opinion, they must have appreciated that, if Braddick were required to go back to court for failing to stick to what he told police, it was because he was going to be punished in some way for not fulfilling that undertaking. 
      
       
     162    In the present case the trial judge told the jury that an accomplice might feel committed to maintain the version that he gave to police implicating the accused. His Honour informed the jury that one of the matters which gave rise to the potential unreliability of an accomplice was that he may feel locked into the account he had given to police. I do not believe that it was essential that he go on to tell the jury why Braddick may feel locked into that account, if the jury were aware, as I believe they would have been, of the consequences for him if he did not give that account in evidence before them. 
      
       
     163    The comments made by his Honour about the evidence of Braddick were less than ideal, but that is not the test to be applied by this Court when determining whether a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. In my view there was no breach of the requirements of s 165(2)(b). Insofar as the trial judge may have failed to comment on matters relating to the reliability of the evidence of Braddick, no complaint was raised at the trial and rule 4 applies. Defence counsel must have understood the significance of the discount and the consequences of the failure of Braddick to fulfil his undertaking, yet he apparently accepted that, in the context of the evidence and his address, the summing up was fair to the appellant and the jury were sufficiently warned in relation to the evidence against him. 
      
       
     164    There was one matter concerning the warning given by his Honour which was not raised as a ground of complaint or in the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant but which arose during the hearing of the appeal. Subsection 165(2)(c) requires the trial judge to “warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it”. During that part of his summing up dealing with Braddick as an accomplice his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “My purpose in giving you this direction is only to warn you, that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable and for that reason alone, you must approach that evidence with considerable caution in the way which I will outline shortly.” 
         
        
        
       Thereafter his Honour went on to inform the jury of the reasons why the evidence of an accomplice might be unreliable. His Honour never did outline to the jury the way in which they were to approach the evidence with considerable caution. 
        
       
     165    At common law it was traditional to give a warning in terms that the jury was to “scrutinise the evidence with care”. This is the terms in which the directions in Murray, and Longman are framed. It was the warning given by the trial judge in Bromley. There appears to be three components to a warning to be given under the common law: the need for caution, the reason why caution is required and the way in which the caution is to be applied by the jury when assessing the suspect evidence. To borrow an analogy from Lord Devlin’s report on identification evidence, the warning is like a road sign that reads, “caution, slippery road, slow down”. It was presumably this third element of the warning to which his Honour was referring when he told the jury that he would outline the way in which they must approach the evidence with considerable caution. 
      
       
     166    However, s 165(4) states that no particular form of words is necessary when giving a warning under the section. Further, apart from requiring the jury to be made aware of the need for caution in assessing the evidence, s 165(2)(c) does not require that the judge tell them how to apply the warning. It seems to me that a warning to be given under the section is like a road sign that reads, “Caution, slippery road, be careful”. The warning does not tell the driver what specific action to take to meet the danger warned against. In my view, it is not necessary for a trial judge to say any more than his Honour did in order to comply with the section and to give a sufficient warning in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     167    Considering the summing up as a whole, I am unpersuaded that the jury did not adequately have brought to their attention those matters that were relevant to an assessment of Braddick’s reliability. In addition to the comments and warning that the trial judge gave because of Braddick’s status as an accomplice, his Honour reminded the jury of the following matters: that Braddick had lied on his oath in court (two references); that he had not fully told the truth to police (two references); that he had given inconsistent versions in his ERISP and in his evidence, that he was drunk on the evening; that he made accusations against the police that were denied by them in evidence before the jury; and that the jury should consider his demeanour and determine whether he was reluctant to “dob in a mate” as the Crown suggested or whether on the other hand he may be a “straight-out liar”. 
      
       
     168    I am not persuaded that the absence of a specific reference to the matter of the discount or his Honour’s omission to refer to the consequences for Braddick if he failed to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking resulted in a miscarriage of justice in the present case, having regard to the length and nature of the trial and the fact that the summing up followed directly after defence counsel’s address. The applicant should not be allowed to rely upon these matters in the absence of any complaint by counsel about the terms of the summing up or a request for any further directions at the trial. The other criticisms of the summing up have no foundation. 
      
       
     169    In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Sentence 
        
       
     170    In relation to the application for leave against sentence I am of the view that the application should be refused. The complaint is effectively that having regard to the sentence imposed upon the appellant his Honour must have taken an overly serious view of the objective circumstances of the offence. There is no merit in that argument. This Court has frequently warned that it expects a strong stand to be taken in relation to home invasion offences: R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [31]. 
      
       
     171    Although this was not the most serious offence of its type by any measure, the appellant and his co-offender armed themselves with weapons capable of inflicting serious harm on any person in the house who might resist their attempts to obtain money or other valuables. They could only have armed themselves on the basis that they realised some person might be at home and they were prepared to threaten violence if necessary. There was little mitigation from the fact, if it be so, that it was the appellant who reassured Aaron that he would not be hurt after he was threatened by Braddick: R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105 at [24]-[25]. As the Crown pointed out in its submissions, this statement by the applicant could simply have been a ruse to lure the boy out of the locked bathroom and assist them to find money or valuables. 
      
       
     172    In my view there is nothing in his Honour’s remarks on sentence to indicate that he fell into error and, notwithstanding the appellant’s age and circumstances, the sentence was not manifestly excessive. It was in the correct proportion to the sentence imposed upon his co-offender having regard to Braddick’s plea, his assistance to the authorities in giving evidence against the appellant and the appellant’s more serious criminal record. 
      
       
     173    I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

      FRIDAY 3 AUGUST 2001 
      
      REGINA v. GARRY JAMES HOGAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GILES, JA: The reasons of Greg James, J., which I have had the advantage of reading in draft, describe in detail the material aspects of the course of the trial. 
     2   It is clear that in giving the prosecution leave to question Rachel Golby as though it were cross-examining, the trial judge did not have regard to the matters which, by s.192(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, he was to take into account. Nor did his Honour give attention to what Rachel Golby should be permitted to be questioned about, either by regard to the three categories of questioning in s.38(1)(a), (b) and (c) or by regard to the further category of questioning about matters relevant only to credibility in s.38(3). It is appropriate to say that neither the prosecution nor the defence appears to have reminded his Honour of the need to take into account the matters in s.192(2) and to consider the extent and nature of the permitted questioning. 
     3   As what thereafter occurred demonstrates, some of the matters in s.192(2) were relevant to the exercise of the discretions under s.38(1) and (3). Although concerned with cross-examination on character rather than cross-examination of a party's own witness, on what was said in Stanoevski v. The Queen [2001] HCA 4 the trial judge's exercise of discretion miscarried for failure to have regard to the s.192(2) matters. Material passages from the judgments in that case are set out in the judgment of Greg James, J. The exercise of discretion also miscarried, in my view, for the associated (perhaps consequential) failure to give attention to what Rachel Golby should be permitted to be questioned about, and again what thereafter occurred demonstrates the need for such attention. In a critical respect the appellant's trial was therefore contrary to law. 
     4   It cannot realistically be doubted that, had there been regard to the s.192(2) matters, leave would have been given to question Rachel Golby as if cross-examining. But the leave would by no means have permitted the unfettered and wide-ranging questioning which was undertaken, apparently because all of the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the appellant considered that there were no restrictions on what Rachel Golby could be questioned about and in particular that her credit could be attacked. The extent of questioning led or contributed in turn to the calling of evidence from Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis, Mrs. Kim Robertson and Detective Senior Constable Robinson about what Rachel Golby had been doing on the afternoon of 21 June 1998, what she had said to them, her drug habit, and Rebecca Jones' relationship with the complainant. 
     5   The result was to convert the focus of the trial from whether the appellant maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on the complainant to whether Rachel Golby was lying to protect the appellant - a proposition put to her on more than one occasion in the course of her questioning by the prosecution. The risk of prejudice to the appellant was high, particularly when the jury might have held Rachel Golby's lying against the appellant. There was nothing to suggest that she was lying to protect him at his instigation. 
     6   Proper exercise of the discretions should have controlled this uninhibited excess. A stark example of the excess is the question put to Rachel Golby, that she had said that the appellant had threatened to kill the complainant, his mother and his sister if the complainant ""dobs on me"". She denied saying this, and there was no other evidence of it. It was highly prejudicial to the appellant. 
     7   It is not easy to see how directions to the jury could overcome the risk of prejudice to the appellant. The directions given, however, did not do so. The material passages have been set out in the reasons of Greg James, J. They exacerbated the problem, rather than alleviated it, by the emphasis given to whether Rachel Golby was lying and a rather confusing direction which included that, through the evidence of Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis, Mrs. Robertson and Detective Senior Constable Hayes, what Rachel Golby said out of court could be taken as evidence of an eye witness account of the incident. 
     8   What I have said applies in general to the leave given to the prosecution to question Mrs. Kathleen Golby. In my opinion there was a miscarriage of justice, and the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     9   GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     10   At a trial in the District Court of New South Wales at which he had pleaded not guilty, the appellant was found guilty of a charge of having, on 21 June 1998 at Umina, maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Matthew Gray. That offence, under s.35(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, is punishable by a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
     11   On 24 March 2000, he was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and six months, commencing on that day and expiring on 29 September 2005. A non-parole period was imposed of four years, one month and two weeks. The appellant had been on bail for approximately 21 months prior to sentence. 
     12   A first trial had commenced on 13 March 2000. In that trial, the entire Crown case had concluded and the appellant had given evidence in chief when, during an interruption of his cross-examination, the question of whether the complainant's evidence might be undermined by what appeared to be a mistake as to a relevant day and whether it might be open to a juror to accept the account of the complainant and hold that the accused was a liar, in consequence of that mistake, was raised. 
     13   The trial judge, of his own motion, indicated that he was prepared to discharge the jury. After he indicated this and that the mistake might be adverse to a proper consideration of the appellant's evidence, counsel sought the jury be discharged. Following that discharge, a second trial was commenced with a fresh jury. It is from that trial that the appeal is brought. 
     14   A number of objections had been taken and rulings on evidence had been made during the first trial. The second trial proceeded substantially on the basis of those rulings without further detailed objection, argument or the giving of detailed reasons by the trial judge, apparently on the basis that the parties' rights were preserved. 
     15   Certain of the grounds of appeal challenge some of such rulings, particularly those by which his Honour granted leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine certain witnesses called in the Crown case and permitted the calling of evidence in the Crown case of statements asserted to be inconsistent with aspects of those witness' accounts. Those grounds were:- 
      
       
        
        ""(1) His Honour erred in granting leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine Rachel Golby. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (6) His Honour erred by admitting the evidence of Rebecca Jones. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) His Honour erred by admitting the evidence of Kerry Francis. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) His Honour erred by admitting the evidence of Kim Robertson. 
        
       
       
        
        (9) His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Hayes as to the out of court representations of Rachel Golby. 
        
       
       
        
        (10) His Honour erred by granting leave to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine Kathleen Golby."" 
        
       
     16   It will be convenient to consider those grounds initially and to consider them together, as they raise a common question, but I should here note that in addition, there were other grounds (apart from the asserted severity of the sentence) referring to the asserted inadequacy of his Honour's directions in the summing-up and the mode of questioning of the witnesses. None of the other grounds asserted would, if successful, warrant other than a new trial. For the moment, I put the other grounds to one side. 
     17    In the context, although the legal point is common to his evidence also, it is not necessary particularly to consider the grant of leave to cross-examine Daniel Bjedov, which was the subject of a separate ground of appeal, for the reasons which later appear in this judgment. 
     18   To consider how it came about that grants of the leave complained of were given and the challenged evidence called, it is necessary to set out a short summary of the Crown case. 
     19   Shortly, it was contended for the Crown that Matthew Gray, the complainant, while visiting his girlfriend, Rachel Golby, at her home in Umina, was assaulted by the appellant in the backyard of that home. The complainant asserted that he was struck with a post, and hit three to four times on the arm and the leg, occasioning him severe injuries; he recognised his assailant; he called for Rachel as he was being assaulted; he saw Rachel's mother, father and brother in the backyard and recalled them telling the appellant to leave; he was screaming to Rachel's brother for assistance; he was carried to Rachel's mother's car and driven by Rachel and her mother to Gosford Hospital. He complained to his mother the next morning at the hospital and asked her to ring the police. He informed the police on their attendance that he had been bashed by the appellant. 
     20   The appellant gave evidence denying the complainant's account. Some reference to the circumstances as given in evidence surrounding that account is helpful. 
     21   On the morning prior to the attack, the complainant and Rachel Golby had been lying alongside each other in her bedroom when the appellant had entered the room and there was some conversation between the appellant and Rachel. The appellant had made remarks to the complainant, refusing to shake his hand and indicating that the appellant knew what he looked like. After the appellant left, Rachel had told her mother in the complainant's presence that the appellant had come over and she reiterated to her mother what the appellant had said to the complainant. The complainant said in evidence that Mrs. Golby, Rachel's mother, told him to be careful of the appellant. 
     22   He left the Golby home but returned for dinner. After dinner, he and Rachel retired to her downstairs bedroom. After watching television with her for about half an hour, he left the room to visit the outside toilet on the other side of the backyard. When leaving the toilet he was detained by the appellant who asked him to go to the appellant's car. He refused and started to call out for Rachel. The appellant struck him to the side of the face, causing him to fall to the ground and then struck him three or four times with the post. 
     23   Some of the evidence of the complainant, in particular of conversations with or statements made by other persons, including his mother, Kim Robertson, seems to have been admitted as a consequence of rulings made in the prior trial and, in particular, on the basis that unfavourable evidence was expected to be given by Rachel Golby. 
     24   Rachel Golby's evidence in chief plainly diverged substantially and in many respects from an original statement she had given to police. It was clearly open to the trial judge to consider that her evidence was, in a number of those respects, at least, to be unfavourable as well as inconsistent with her prior accounts. 
     25   In her evidence in chief, before leave to cross-examine was given, she referred to the appellant as someone she had had a previous relationship with, some two and a half to three years ago; he was a good family friend. She referred to the appellant coming to her room on the morning of 21 June but gave a version of the conversation that ensued which was materially different from that given by the complainant. Her evidence did not include the appellant saying anything to the complainant other than, ""How are you going, mate"". Similarly, her evidence was inconsistent with that of the complainant as to the conversation between herself, her mother and the complainant. She contended she had rung the complainant to ask him to purchase drugs for her and that he had returned to the house with a cap of heroin which she shot up. 
     26   At 6.00 pm, she called the complainant to come to dinner, since he was some 15 minutes late. On her account, after dinner they returned to her room where she fell asleep. She said the next thing she heard was a loud scream coming from outside. She got up and ran into the door which was locked. She opened the door and found the complainant alongside the garden bed. At that point she called her parents. Her parents went to the complainant and put him in the car and took him to hospital. 
     27   She did not know what had happened to the complainant and told her mother that on the way to the hospital. At the complainant's suggestion, her mother contacted his mother. 
     28   During a conversation at the hospital, the complainant, she said, said to her, ""Gary Hogan did it"" and ""let's just say Garry Hogan did it, because he [the complainant] would get a whole heap of money out of it and that he would give me a quarter of it"". She asked him how he could say that when the appellant didn't even know the complainant. At about this time the complainant's mother arrived. 
     29   She asserted she did not tell the complainant's mother what had happened, because she did not want to tell any lies. She just said that he got bashed. She said she was not present at any substantial conversation between the complainant and his mother. She claimed that on 22 June, when she visited the complainant in hospital, he wanted to know if she could go along with him in blaming Garry Hogan for the assault, as he wanted to ""go for a claim"" (presumably seeking victims compensation). He told Rachel Golby that he would give her a quarter of any money that he received. She agreed because she was on drugs at the time. 
     30   During this conversation, she said, the complainant's mother was present. Whilst at the hospital, she saw Rebecca Jones and said to her that she did not know what had happened to the complainant, only that he had just got bashed. 
     31   At this point of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor made what is referred to as ""an application under s.38 of the Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine the witness"". Defence counsel is recorded as opposing the application. The following appears in the transcript:- 
      
       
        
        ""As I held last week, I consider that s.38 is applicable and I propose to let the Crown Prosecutor cross-examine this witness as I did last week. Mr. Cruickshank you might be right about one thing, about us getting another story next week if there was another trial, but that doesn't mean s.38 doesn't apply."" 
        
       
     32   At the commencement of the previous trial, the Crown Prosecutor had foreshadowed applications were to be made under s.38 ""re unfavourable Crown witnesses"" and there was some consideration of whether the Crown should be permitted to open representations made to police by Rachel Golby. 
     33   The Crown had declined to call her father as an unreliable witness and had succeeded on an application to issue a bench warrant for the arrest of her mother as she had not attended on subpoena. 
     34   At p.43 of the transcript on 13 March 2000 in first trial appears the following:- 
      
       
        
        ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: You Honour I have an application to make in the absence of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. Members of the jury you'll be taken to the jury room while I hear what the Crown Prosecutor wants to say to me. 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: You Honour could the witness be asked to wait outside whilst I make my application? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, would you wait outside. The Crown Prosecutor wants to say something to me. He won't be very long, so don't go too far away. 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS STOOD DOWN 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour I seek the leave of the court to be allowed to cross-examine this witness under the three heads outlined under s.38(1) of the Evidence Act, that the witness is unfavourable to the Crown, that the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge about which it appears to the court the witness is not in examination in chief making a genuine attempt to give evidence and (c) that the witness had made prior inconsistent statements to the evidence she is now giving. The prior inconsistent statements your Honour are detailed in her statement to the police dated 23 June 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Have you got a copy of it? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        MFI 1 - STATEMENT OF RACHEL GOLBY DATED 23 JUNE 1998 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You said statements, are there others? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: There are your Honour. I'll have my solicitor hand you a full copy of the brief with the different statements marked. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I only want the three statements that you say she's made. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. Just pull out then the statement of the witness dated 23 June 1998, the statement of Kim Robertson, the mother of Matthew Gray, paragraphs 32 and 33. The statement of Senior Constable Wallace Bicket, paragraph 5, the statement of Kerry Francis, paragraph 13 and 14 and the statement of Rebecca Jones, paragraph 10 and paragraph 13. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I've got one statement only of the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: There's a record of interview taken on 24 June 1998 that I hand up to your Honour now and the statement of Senior Constable Wallace Bicket. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I though you said there were three statements of the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour, three statements to, I beg your pardon your Honour. There is a third note from the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So I've got a statement and a record of interview. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And a fax was sent by the witness on 13 March. I give that to your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right. Let me have a look at these to start with. She's clearly given evidence inconsistent with paragraph 8 of the statement of 23 June 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now I'll have to look at the record of interview. Is there any particular part of it to which I should look? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. The record of interview contains basically the retraction along the lines of the evidence given in court today. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I am only skim reading the record of interview but there appears to be nothing in that suggesting that she'd used drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's correct your Honour. There's a reference to drinking alcohol on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, Tropicana, whatever that is. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You've given me the statement of Kim Marie Robertson who is the mother of the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's correct your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What paragraph is relevant in that? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Paragraph 32 and 33. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That tends to confirm her initial statement to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's correct. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You've given me a statement of Rebecca Susan Jones. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, paragraph 10 and paragraph 13 your Honour are the relevant paragraphs. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Paragraph 10 of this statement seems to confirm her initial statement to the police and her statement to the complainant's mother. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour and paragraph 13 in so far as when asked what she told the police on 23 June 1998 she said 'I told the truth'. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now the statement of Kerry Francis. She confirms what Rebecca Jones says generally speaking. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's correct at paragraphs 13 and 14. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes and paragraph 5 of Constable Bicket's statement confirms what she told police and what she told the others. Well Mr. Cruickshank. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Your Honour did ask about drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: In the record of interview. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: There's no reference in the record of interview your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No but there is in the document sent by facsimile. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: In that document also your Honour and in the statement made by Stephen Vaughan Robinson, a police officer. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don't have that statement. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: My friend might have a copy of it. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes I hand that up. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: His statement's dated 21 July 1998 your Honour. He was one of the investigating officers. In paragraph 23 he said that on Monday 29 June, which is approximately a week later, he went to the Golby's house. He spoke to Mr. Golby, Mr. Frank Golby. Rachel Golby was unable to speak, she was dribbling from the mouth and she appeared to be affected by drugs or alcohol and she was just incoherent apparently your Honour. That's a few days after. I'd submit that a drug habit is not something that descends on a person overnight. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Whether that be right or wrong, she didn't mention on 24 June having used drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Your Honour she's talking to police officers and of course using drugs is a criminal offence. Drinking alcohol to excess is not. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: There are in the statements made to the girls at least there is reference -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Look I'm not here assessing the witness. I'm considering whether or not the Crown falls within s.38 of the Evidence Act. Clearly the evidence given by the witness so far is unfavourable to the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Clearly it is evidence by reference to what she's told others, where she may reasonably supposed to have knowledge and clearly it is inconsistent with her statement. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Well it's clearly inconsistent with her statement your Honour and I don't about B, I wouldn't say that it's clearly -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well in view of her statements to other witnesses, her two girlfriends, the complainant's mother and a policeman, I can conclude that she may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge of that which he is speaking about. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Well your Honour she says that she made those statements at the behest of the victim, that's as I understood her evidence here your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well not quite -- 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: She said that that was to get money, well to get money is mentioned by the two girls, for Matt to get money out of it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well that doesn't mean that she's not giving evidence contrary to s.38 of the Evidence Act. Seems to me frankly to be without argument that she is in breach of s.38 and I propose to let the Crown cross-examine her. On this application the statements that I have been given will be marked for identification and will remain with the papers.

        HIS HONOUR: Those documents are marked for identification in relation to this application under s.38 and those documents will remain with the court file. 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: Your Honour I think when this matter was canvassed at the outset I did put the proposition that it was inappropriate for the Crown to call the witness because she was of so little credit. I concede that it is a matter for the Crown, but I would just like that noted on the record your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes will -- 
        
       
       
        
        CRUICKSHANK: -- it's clearly the function of the Crown your Honour, but the court has little control over the manner in which the Crown conducts its case, but I would just like it noted your Honour that she appears to be of so little credit that it was inappropriate that she be called. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I think Mr. Cruickshank in view of the fact that the complainant had said that she was present at the door when things occurred and that thereafter she did things, it would have been unwise for the Crown to have called her, not to call her and suffered the request from you for a Jones v. Dunkell [sic] or Regina v. Buckman inference. As you say it is for the Crown to make the decisions and he has decided to call her."" 
        
       
     35   It is notable that his Honour gave no further reasons for his ruling nor did he identify the factors to which he had regard when granting leave. There was no analysis of which factors pursuant to s.38(1)(a), (b) or (c) were the bases or basis of leave. 
     36   In evidence at the second trial, Rachel Golby confirmed that she had made the three page statement of 23 June 1998, the contents of which were put to her by the questioner at a time at which she had the document before her. After the grant of leave, the cross-examiner put the content to her in detail although the statement itself was not admitted into evidence. There was objection to some small portion of that content, but in the main the witness admitted making the asserted statements to the police, although denying their truth. 
     37   Detective Hayes had interviewed Rachel Golby who, he said, had said she had witnessed the assault. He interviewed her at Gosford Police Station where he obtained the signed statement. It appears from the questions put to Miss Golby that the contents of that statement were, except as to the important matter of the presence of Rachel Golby in the backyard, almost directly and precisely corroborative of the account given by the complainant. Whilst the complainant's evidence did not clearly show that she had seen the attack, her accounts asserted variously that she had and that she had not. His evidence did not directly show she had. 
      
       
     38   In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, Rachel Golby denied that she had spent the afternoon with Rebecca Jones and Kerry Francis on 21 June 1998, listening to music and drinking. She denied telephoning Kerry and Rebecca, asking they come to the hospital to keep her company and had denied taking any heroin on 21 June 1998. She denied saying to Kerry Francis, ""it wasn't supposed to have been, supposed to be Matt, it should have been me"". She denied saying that Matt was just a warning and Garry was going to get her. She denied telling Kerry Francis they were mucking around in her room when Matt went to the toilet and that Garry Hogan had been responsible for the bashing. She also denied telling Kerry Francis that she had walked out and jumped on Garry's back and bit him on the ear and with all her strength pulled him off. She said that her father did not come out, hit Garry and tell Garry to leave. Nor did her brother come out and carry the complainant into the house and later into the car. She denied giving a similar account to Rebecca Jones and that Rebecca Jones stayed with her on the night of 22 June. She asserted she did not remember telling the complainant's mother that the complainant had been assaulted at the beach and denied telling her that, ""my ex-boyfriend attacked Matthew"". She asserted she did not see the appellant strike the complainant with the post. She denied hearing the appellant say, ""If Matt dobs on me, I'll kill his mother, sister and him"". 
     39   Defence counsel cross-examined her principally as to the circumstances of the making of her various statements to police, her drug taking and her memory. 
     40   Thereafter, the Crown Prosecutor embarked on a further cross-examination, not limited to the topics canvassed by defence counsel but including whether she had lied when she had asserted she had caught the appellant sleeping with Rebecca Jones three weeks earlier and the circumstances of her mentioning that observation. She was further cross-examined about her ""retraction interview"" and her drug taking. The lack of objection seemed to suggest that the opportunity to further cross-examine and the ambit of that cross-examination were thought to have been within the trial judge's earlier rulings. 
     41   Immediately following the conclusion of Rachel Golby's evidence, Rebecca Jones was called by the Crown and gave evidence that she had never seen Rachel Golby or Matthew Gray affected by or take drugs. She gave an account of her conversations and activities with Rachel Golby which had been foreshadowed by the questioning of Rachel Golby. In that account she also said that she had never seen Matthew Gray supply drugs to any person and that Rachel Golby did not appear affected by drugs when she saw her on 21 June 1998. 
     42   Similarly, Kerry Francis gave evidence that she had never seen Rachel Golby use drugs or be affected by them and otherwise corroborated Rebecca Jones' account of the events of 21 June 1998 and 22 June 1998. 
     43   Kathleen Golby, Rachel's mother, was then called and gave evidence that at a time after dinner Rachel Golby came in screaming that Matthew had been hurt. Her husband went out to see what happened. She saw the complainant on the ground but could not see anyone else after searching for them. She collected the keys to the car and her husband put the complainant in the car. She and Rachel drove the complainant to the hospital. There was no discussion in the car about what happened to the complainant, and at the hospital she telephoned the complainant's mother, at his request. She did not tell the complainant's mother what had happened and did not discuss the assault with her daughter, as her daughter was affected by drugs. 
     44   On 22 June 1998, she visited the complainant in hospital with her son. The complainant's mother was also at the hospital. She did not recall talking to the complainant's mother. On the way home she tried to ask her daughter what happened but she was ""so co-inherent [sic] it wasn't funny"". She was ""on drugs"". Later she said that she did speak to her daughter about it while driving home but her daughter said she didn't know what was going on, she was inside. She said her daughter had also been on drugs at home at dinner before the incident. She was asked about Rebecca Jones and Kerry Francis being at the hospital and at her house. 
     45   Later in the week, her daughter told her the complainant was blaming the appellant so that he could get compensation and that the appellant had not been there. She said Rachel told her she had made a statement ""against Garry"". 
     46   She had a discussion with her daughter about telephoning Detective Hayes and having her statement ""squashed"". She took her daughter to the police station on 24 June to retract that statement. She later became aware the statement had not been ""squashed or retracted"". At that point, the transcript records the following:- 
      
       
        
        ""(Application by the Crown under s.28 seeking leave to cross-examine the witness. Cruickshank opposes application. Leave granted. Cruickshank seeks basis of application.) 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS STOOD DOWN 
        
       
       
        
        (Crown submits that subsection (1) and subsections (a), (b) and (c) are applicable. Cruickshank further opposes application. Crown Prosecutor allowed to cross-examine.)"" 
         
        
       
     47   In consequence of that permission, the Crown cross-examined Mrs. Golby about her evidence at the previous trial and concerning what had happened in the backyard. An account was put to her of a conversation it was asserted she had with the complainant's mother incriminating the appellant. She denied it. She denied telling the complainant's mother that the complainant had been assaulted on the beach. She denied that the complainant's mother asked Rachel if she had been able to recognise the men who assaulted her son. She denied telling the complainant's mother on 22 June that she had lied the night before and that it was her daughter's ex-boyfriend that had assaulted the complainant. She denied telling the complainant's mother that the appellant was hiding in the backyard, that Rachel was out the back screaming and her husband pulled Garry off Matt. Mrs. Golby said she had no idea what happened until she spoke to her daughter a couple of days after the assault. 
     48   Defence counsel cross-examined her principally about her daughter's drug taking. The Crown Prosecutor again was permitted further cross-examination about what she could see in the backyard and her evidence at the earlier trial. By leave, the defence counsel was permitted further questions about what the witness had formerly said about her daughter being affected by drugs. 
     49   The complainant's mother, Mrs. Kim Robertson, was then called and gave evidence that on her arrival at the hospital at about 9.45 pm on 21 June 1998, both Rachel and her mother started telling her what happened. They told her that Matthew and Rachel had gone for a walk along the beach; Rachel had gone to the toilet, but heard Matthew start screaming. Rachel ran out and found two men attacking him. They told the complainant's mother that the complainant was carried back to Rachel's house from whence she and Mrs. Golby had brought him to the hospital. She said that Mrs. Golby had told her on 22 June 1998 that she had lied about what had happened the night before and had given to her an account of Rachel and Matthew being at her place when Matthew went outside to go to the toilet and was attacked by the complainant who hit him with a piece of wood. She said that Mrs. Golby told her not to let Matthew go to the police, and that the appellant was a very jealous person and had attacked the complainant after seeing him together with Rachel. 
     50   Her evidence was that Mrs. Golby also told her that Rachel had been screaming out the back and her husband had gone outside and called the appellant off the complainant. In that conversation, according to the complainant's mother, Rachel had referred to the appellant as being her ex-boyfriend who was very jealous and who she had seen hitting the complainant after he had gone out to go to the toilet. She said she had jumped on his back and bit his ear and screamed out to his mother and father. 
     51   Detective Senior Constable Robinson gave evidence that he had spoken to Rachel Golby on 24 June 1998 and found her coherent and able to converse quite readily with police. He saw no sign, it appears, of drug disorientation. 
     52   On 29 June 1998 when he spoke to her, he found her affected by drugs or alcohol . She was unable to keep her eyes open; she was dribbling from the mouth and slurred when attempting speech. 
     53   Detective Senior Constable Christopher Hayes had attended Gosford District Hospital on 23 June 1998 and obtained a signed statement from the complainant. It was witnessed by the complainant's mother. It identified the assailant as Garry Hogan. 
     54   It was submitted that the trial judge had erred in permitting the cross-examinations I have referred to in failing to have regard to various sections of the Evidence Act 1995, including s.192 (matters to be considered on the question of leave), ss.135 and 137 (rejection in discretion of prejudicial evidence), ss.102 and 103 (inadmissibility of credit evidence) and s.60 (hearsay evidence). Further, that his Honour failed to have regard to s.38(6) and to restrict cross-examination to those areas to which s.38 refers. 
     55   When one examines his Honours' reasons, there was no advertence to those matters and particularly those which s.192 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides nor was there any limitation such as is suggested by s.38 on the ambit of cross-examination expressed by his Honour or observed by the Crown Prosecutor. Indeed, the matters which may be taken into account under s.38(6) were not adverted to. 
     56   The cross-examination of necessity raised questions as to whether or not Rachel Golby might have committed such criminal offences as were involved in attempting to mislead the police. But no reference was made to the prospect of having to inform her of her right to object under s.132 and her rights in respect of possible self-incrimination under s.128. 
     57   Section 38 provides as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 
        
       
       
        
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purpose of this Act (other than s.39). 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness's credibility. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person; and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the party is a witness in the proceeding."" 
        
       
     58   Section 192 provides as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 
        
       
       
        
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 
        
       
       
        
         (d) the nature of the proceedings; and 
        
       
       
        
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."" 
        
       
     59   The statutory framework for the application under s.38 includes s.37(1) which provides that:- 
      
       
        
        ""a leading question must not be put to a witness in examination in chief or in re-examination unless:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the court gives leave or …"" 
        
       
     60   Cross-examination is defined in Clause 2 of Part 2 of the dictionary to the Act:- 
      
       
        
        ""(2) A reference in this Act to cross-examination of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by a party other than the party who called the witness to give evidence."" 
        
       
     61   Questioning a witness called by a party ""as though the party were cross-examining the witness"" (s.38(1)) would presumably include the technique of using leading questions. Division 5 of Part 2.1 deals with cross-examination. Section 42 permits the use of leading questions unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it. 
     62   In considering the matters the court may take into account on those questions, the court is directed by s.42(2) to take into account:- 
      
       
        
        ""42(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness; and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner; and 
        
       
       
        
         (c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter; and 
        
       
       
        
         (d) the witness's age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness's answers. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if the court is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used."" 
        
       
     63   What may be done in cross-examination about a prior inconsistent statement is provided for by s.43. Section 44, except as provided by that section, does not permit questioning of a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by another, unless evidence of the representation has been admitted or will be admitted. The procedure for cross-examination on another's document is provided for by s.44(3). 
     64   In Stanoevski v. The Queen [2001] HCA 4 (8 February 2001), the High Court considered the application of s.192 as an expression of matters to be considered on the grant of leave in relation to a cross-examination on character. It held that s.192 applied to such applications for leave to cross-examine. It referred to the mandatory requirement that the matters referred to in s.192 be taken into account. The approach taken there is, in my view, validly applied to the analogous situation of considering a grant of leave under s.38, notwithstanding under that section further particular matters are to be considered. Section 192 applies generally to applications for leave. 
     65   In the judgment of Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan, JJ., the following appears: 
      
       
        
        ""Section 192 applies to this case, and in particular to the exercise by the trial judge of his or her discretion under s.112 of the Act. It should be noted that the leave required under s.112 is not leave to adduce evidence, but to cross-examine about the character of a defendant. In addition to matters which may be relevant in a particular case, in all cases the court must take into account the matters prescribed by s.192(2). It is clear here that the trial judge (probably because his attention does not seem to have been drawn to it) did not take into account all of those matters, some of which would inevitably have been relevant to the way in which his discretion ought to be exercised had he adverted to them."" 
        
       
     66   Those words are of direct applicability in my view to this case. Their Honours continued at paragraph 43:- 
      
       
        
        ""The cross-examination on the report raised a very grave possibility of unfairness to the appellant within the meaning of s.192(2)(b). By giving permission for that cross-examination to take place the trial judge was allowing the undertaking of an extensive collateral inquiry by the prosecutor."" 
        
       
     67   Their Honours continued at paragraph 47:- 
      
       
        
        ""It follows that matters of the kind which s.192(2) provides should be considered were of relevance to this case and to the trial judge's decision to permit the prosecutor to cross-examine as he did. In not taking properly these, and matters of weight and relevance into account, and in not therefore exercising his discretion in accordance with s.192 of the Act, the trial judge fell into error."" 
        
       
     68   It was held that the trial had miscarried to the extent that it was not possible to say no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. 
     69   McHugh, J. considered that the appeal must be allowed. He referred to the grant of leave as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""By reason of s.112 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) ('the Act'), the prosecution needed the leave of the trial judge to cross-examine the appellant on matters in the report which suggested that she was not of good character. In the course of the Crown case, the learned judge gave a preliminary ruling on the issue of leave. He said that, if the appellant adduced evidence of good character, he would grant leave to the prosecution to cross-examine the appellant on matters in the report 'unless some other matter arises that would cause me to hold a different view'. Later, after the appellant had given evidence of good character, the judge gave the prosecution leave to cross-examine her on the matters in the report. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 192 of the Act directed the judge to have regard to certain matters in determining whether leave to cross-examine should be granted. However, his Honour, over the objection of the appellant's counsel, gave leave without considering these matters - indeed without being referred to them. Because that is so, the appellant was cross-examined in breach of the Act. Her trial was flawed by a 'wrong decision of any question of law' within the meaning of s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Her conviction cannot stand unless the prosecution can establish that her conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice."" 
        
       
     70   Hayne, J. agreed with Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan, JJ. in the result, referring to collateral issues such as are thrown up by cross-examination of witnesses on credit (including witnesses cross-examined by those calling them) as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""Practical necessity requires that there be some limits to the range of matters which can be investigated at a trial. Pursuit of every collateral issue would unreasonably prolong trials with little or no countervailing advantage. The common law sought to chart a course between two competing considerations: first, avoiding juries 'being beguiled by the evidence of witnesses who could be shown to be, through defect of character, wholly unworthy of belief' and second, seeking 'to prevent the trial of a case becoming clogged with a number of side issues'. As a result, '[m]any controversies which might … obliquely throw some light on the issues must in practice be discarded because there is not an infinity of time, money and mental comprehension available to make use of them'."" (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
     71   He said of the exercise of the trial judge's discretion to allow cross-examination on character:- 
      
       
        
        ""It is enough to say that, in the course of argument at trial, attention was not directed to the operation of s.192 of the Act. The trial judge did not consider the several matters which that section required to be taken into account in exercising, as he did, the discretion under s.112 to give leave to the prosecutor to cross-examine the appellant about matters arising out of evidence given about her character. That discretion was, therefore, exercised without taking account of relevant considerations and the discretion miscarried. It cannot be said that the cross-examination which was allowed would inevitably have been permitted had the various matters referred to in s.192 been taken into account. It follows that it cannot be said that the appellant did not, as a result, lose a real chance of acquittal and, thus, this is not a case in which the proviso applies."" (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
     72   It is clear that the cross-examinations were of great significance in the conduct of the present case. Rachel Golby's evidence was of great importance. It was not clear independently of Rachel Golby whether it could properly be asserted that she did see the incident. Neither her brother nor her father was called, and her mother's credit was similarly assailed. An assumption seems to have been made that her initial account had to be a true one. That account did not entirely accord with the account of the complainant in that his account did not make clear that she saw the incident. 
     73   It can be accepted that the account Rachel Golby gave at trial was ""unfavourable"" to the Crown case in a number of respects. It can be accepted that that account contained important inconsistencies with the initial prior account she gave to the police. The account given by her mother was also, but to a lesser extent, unfavourable. But the course taken by the trial judge in granting leave does not seem to have included examination of those matters required to be considered by s.38(6) and those under s.192 the High Court held should be considered, nor did his Honour have regard to the discretions referred to in Regina v. Lozano (CCA, unreported 10 June 1997) per Hunt, CJ. at CL., Sperling and Barr, JJ. at 7 or those adverted to in Regina v. GAC (CCA, unreported 1 April 1997) at 15-16. In each of those decisions both s.192 and the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 relating to discretionary rejection were referred to as appropriate to be examined on the consideration of the grant of leave. 
     74   The criteria under s.38 and the discretionary considerations, as well as the matters required to be considered under s.192, are adverted to in Regina v. Fowler [2000] NSWCCA 142. 
     75   It is to be noted that defence counsel had submitted that the witness should not be called due to her lack of credit. The cross-examination ranged widely and evidence was called from Miss Francis and Miss Jones so that the effect, in my view, was to shift the focus of the trial from the witness' testimony as to what had occurred to matters collateral to the issue at trial, although plainly of great significance to the witness' credit. 
     76   The cross-examination was general in nature. It included cross-examination about what the witness had had to drink, whether or not she had taken heroin, whether she was on drugs and what drugs, including heroin, speed and ""pills"" such as Serapax and Valium and marijuana she had taken. It developed into a wholesale attack on credit as well as dealing with those matters in relation to issues that were at least peripherally relevant at the trial or might have been relevant to the witness' opportunities and capacity to observe what had occurred. She was specifically cross-examined on a number of occasions by the proposition being put to her that she was lying to protect the accused. The questioning asserted the content of prior inconsistent statements whether relevant to issues or on credit. Much of the cross-examination was prejudicial to the appellant. 
     77   There was cross-examination which ranged so widely as to question her about whether the complainant and Rebecca Jones had been sleeping together which had caused a rift in her friendship with Rebecca Jones. There were questions put as to whether she had caught the two sleeping together and as to the nature of the house in which this had occurred. This was entirely collateral and far from the issue. 
     78   The cross-examination of Kathleen Golby raised matters as to the credit of Rachel Golby, hearsay as to the events in the backyard and assertions of her having denigrated the character and disposition of the appellant. Some of it was highly prejudicial to the appellant and of limited relevance. 
     79   The evidence that was led from Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis and Mrs. Robertson of prior inconsistent accounts included matters that, at best, might have been relevant only as to credit on collateral or peripheral questions. There appears to have been no separate consideration of whether that evidence or any of it should have been permitted to be led. Much, it seems to me, should have been excluded. 
     80   The important matter is not whether such cross-examination might have elicited, amongst other evidence, evidence which might properly have been used in the trial. The issue, rather, concerns whether or not the questions as to such matters as were explored should have been permitted to be asked. It is necessary, when giving consideration to the grant of leave, to have regard to the effect on the trial of the ambit of questioning and of the matters that might be raised. It is essential when considering the grant of leave to consider how far, at least initially, cross-examination might be permitted to extend, having regard to the bounds set by s.38, to the matters to which regard must be had when granting leave in s.38(6) and s.192 and to whether prejudicial matters to which ss.135 and 137 might apply might be raised. 
     81   Leave might be further extended as a consequence of a further application, but lest the cross-examination should divert the focus of the trial as, in my view, it did here, it is necessary for a trial judge to take considerable caution in considering the matters the legislation and says the High Court has held he or she must consider and to give consideration to those matters by confining, at least initially, leave to that then seen as necessary, reconsidering the ambit in accordance with the criteria, if further leave is sought. 
     82   Regrettably what happened in this trial did not meet the statutory criteria. I conclude that the trial judge fell into error and each of the grounds of appeal I have referred to is made out. Leave should not have been granted as it was to cross-examine Daniel Bjedov for the same general reasons. 
     83   I consider that the trial miscarried when his Honour granted leave, as he did, notwithstanding there was a basis on which in each case leave might have properly been granted. 
     84   Even if leave would almost certainly have been granted, it could not be successfully argued that would necessarily have permitted as wide an ambit of cross-examination as occurred. I conclude there was a miscarriage. 
     85   There is, in this case, because the necessary matters were not taken into account, no need to examine the appropriateness of the Crown having called the witnesses, notwithstanding they were known to be unfavourable. The decision of this court in upholding the Crown's right to do so (Regina v. Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267) has been the subject of an appeal to the High Court, at present undetermined. It is not, in my view, necessary to turn, other than as shortly as I have, to the burgeoning jurisprudence concerning s.38 which has developed since the coming into effect of the Evidence Act 1995. Nor is it necessary to consider in detail how individual aspects of the evidence might have been used had there been some detailed analysis of their utility and the effect of their reception on the trial in the light of those passages of the summing up to which I shall turn. 
     86   Unless his Honour's directions to the jury were such as to show that what occurred as a result of the grants of leave permitting such wide and diverse attacks would not have been of substantial effect, the appeal must be allowed. 
     87   In the summing-up, his Honour gave directions to the jury as to how they might regard Rachel Golby's evidence in the light of the cross-examination and the evidence of Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis and Mrs. Robertson. He said:- 
      
       
        
        ""She is an admitted liar. She told you that she is an admitted liar. She told you she lied to the hospital staff that the complainant, Mr. Gray, suffered his injury at the beach. She told you that she had lied to Senior Constable Hayes when she gave him her first statement. She lied to the hospital staff, and she admits that she did, and there is not any other conclusion that can be drawn other than that she lied to the hospital staff about where the complainant suffered his injury. Either she lied to Constable Hayes about what she said she saw or she has lied to you about what she has said she saw. … She may have told Senior Constable Hayes the truth. She may have told you the truth. She could not have told both you and Senior Constable Hayes the truth. The Crown Prosecutor asked that when you consider all of the evidentiary material, you will accept the evidence of Miss Rebecca Jones, Miss Kerry Francis and Mrs. Kim Robertson that the version given to them by Miss Rachel Golby was the truth."" 
        
       
     88   His Honour continued to say that the witness had given a consistent version that she jumped on the back of the accused and bit his ear. He said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Now unless those three people have put their heads together and lied about what they were told, then it would be, you might think, and it is for you to decide, remarkable that each of them says that she was told by Miss Rachel Golby that she jumped on the back of the accused and bit his ear."" 
        
       
     89   He reminded the jury that when they were considering whether that was a truthful version, that was a matter for them to decide, because they were the judges of the facts and said:- 
      
       
        
        ""The Crown Prosecutor asked you to accept that Miss Rachel Golby gave a truthful version when she spoke with Miss Rebecca Jones, Miss Kerry Francis, Mrs. Kim Robertson (the complainant's mother) and Senior Constable Hayes and that version, the one that the Crown Prosecutor asked you to accept, is similar, not in every respect, but in most respects with the version given to police by the complainant, Mr. Gray."" 
        
       
     90   He directed the jury that the evidence of Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis and Mrs. Robertson does not go to prove an eyewitness account of the attack on the complainant, merely a version of that incident given by Rachel Golby and her mother. He directed the jury:- 
      
       
        
        ""If it should be that you say to yourselves that Miss Rachel Golby's evidence is valueless and you put it aside and you say Mrs. Kathleen Golby's evidence is valueless and you put it aside, then obviously you would put aside the evidence of Miss Rebecca Jones, Miss Kerry Francis, Mrs. Kim Robertson and Senior Constable Hayes insofar as it relates to the first version given to him by Miss Rachel Golby, because their evidence does not go to prove an account of the incident involving the assault upon Mr. Matthew Gray. 
        
       
       
        
        But if you accept the evidence of those people, then you may accept the version of the assault upon the complainant given to them by Miss Rachel Golby as being an eyewitness account of the incident involving the complainant, Mr. Gray, and the accused, Mr. Hogan."" 
        
       
     91   His Honour thus directed the jury that the asserted out of court statements by Rachel Golby which she denied in evidence were before them for the truth of their content unless her testimony were to be entirely disregarded. 
     92   After referring to the evidence of Rachel Golby's mother and her version of the events, his Honour referred to the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that the prior inconsistent account asserted by Mrs. Robertson, the complainant's mother, to have been given to her by Mrs. Golby, Rachel Golby's mother, should be accepted as another eyewitness version of part of the incident involving the appellant in the backyard at the time of the incident involving the complainant. 
     93   His Honour had already directed the jury:- 
      
       
        
        ""There cannot be any issue in this trial, members of the jury, that at some time between the time that the complainant, Mr. Gray, and Miss Rachel Golby walked out of the back door of the house at 105 Mount Ettalong Road, Umina to go to Rachel's granny flat or cabin, as it was called, and the time when Mrs. Kathleen Golby heard a scream, and whether it was on the television or from the back courtyard, Mr. Matthew Gray, the complainant, was attacked by somebody and beaten with something which was sufficiently strong to break his left arm at the elbow and the lesser bone in his left lower leg, below the knee. Something happened to him in the backyard at that time. It did not happen anywhere else."" 
        
       
     94   Again, his Honour directed as he had with Rachel Golby, that if you put aside Kathleen Golby's evidence you would also put aside the complainant's mother's evidence of the version given to her by Mrs. Golby, otherwise the prior account could be accepted as truthful. I do not consider these directions remedied the situation. 
     95   At the conclusion of the cross-examination, it was put to the witness, Rachel Golby, that she had said:- 
      
       
        
        ""As he [the appellant] left, he said to me, 'If Matt dobs on me, I'll kill his mother, sister and him'."" 
        
       
     96   She denied it was said. The question contained an asserted statement which reflected badly on the appellant. In the context, the jury might have considered they could use it to his detriment. That statement only exemplifies the prejudice occasioned by the course the trial took. In particular, in my view, the summing up was not such as to have removed the effect of a question so couched. 
     97   I do not see that the directions in the summing-up were such as to cure the effect of the cross-examinations in the context of the leave having been granted as it was. 
     98   In my view, there should be a new trial. 
     99   The remaining grounds, if successful, would only go to a new trial and hence need not be further considered. 
     100   I am of the view that on the grounds I have referred to, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered and I propose orders to that effect.  
     101   BADGERY-PARKER, AJ: I agree with the judgments and the orders proposed.

      MONDAY 4TH JUNE 2001 
       
      
      
      REGINA v Lloyd Anthony MURRELL 
     The appellant was convicted of murder. A conversation by the appellant was captured by a listening device and was of critical importance to the Crown case of murder. The recording was of poor quality and the contents and transcript of the conversation were disputed at trial. The appellant now appeals against the conviction on the grounds that (1) evidence in the form of opinions expressed about the words used and transcripts of what witnesses believed they heard should not have been admitted; (2) the trial Judge should have withdrawn evidence from the jury once it became clear there was significant issue and doubt as to what had been said by the appellant on the tape; (3) the trial Judge failed to give a warning to the jury on the unreliability of the transcripts; (4) the trial Judge failed to give sufficient warning as to the onus of proof of the contents of the recording; (5) the case should have been withdrawn from the jury on the basis that the Crown case was inherently weak; (6) fresh evidence now available would establish that crucial words attributed to the appellant were not uttered by him; (7) the verdict could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Held: (Allowing the appeal):Ground 1: miscarriage of justice occasioned by admission of the transcript into evidence 1. The Crown conceded, in light of new expert opinion on the contents of the tape, that the words attributed to the appellant were less inculpatory than those which it had contended at trial had been uttered by him, and that the appellant had lost a real chance of acquittal. In the light of that evidence and the concession it was necessary to allow the appeal and to quash the conviction below. Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259 applied. Ground 2: Whether a new trial should be directed and if so, in what terms the order should be made 2. The Court has a wide discretion whether or not to grant a new trial. In deciding whether to direct a verdict of acquittal or to order a new trial the Court is to have regard to the view which a reasonable jury must have reached and not the view of the court itself. In determining whether to grant a new trial it is proper to take into account among other considerations, the public interest in the proper administration of justice as well as the interests of the individual accused.Pedrana (2001) NSWCCA 66; Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 184 CLR 627; Honeysett (1987) 10 NSWLR 639 applied.  3. On the evidence available in the present case, a properly instructed jury would have to entertain a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt of murder. However, the words spoken by the appellant and his actions provided sufficient evidence for a charge of manslaughter based upon a common enterprise to shoot up the premises, or of accessory after the fact to murder. 4. The question then is whether a verdict of acquittal of murder should be entered and an order made directing a new trial for a lesser offence; or whether there should simply be a quashing of the conviction and an order for a new trial generally. The power of the Court to order a new trial on a lesser count is supported by the words in s 8 (1) Criminal Appeal Act, ‘the Court may…order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit’ and has some support in prior authority.Kelly (1923) 32 CLR 509; Miller (9157) ALR 749; Hanias (1976) 14 SASR 137; Callaghan (1952) 87 CLR 145 considered. 5. In circumstances where the original jury had not needed to consider the lesser offence of manslaughter and where the Court still considered that offence to be available it would be inappropriate to enter a verdict that operated as a general acquittal. In order to avoid any residual question of autrefois acquit arising, in the event of the appellant being reindicted for manslaughter or accessory after the fact to murder, the proper course is to order a new trial generally, leaving it to the Director of Public Prosecutions to prefer a count or counts which the available evidence would support. ORDERS PROPOSED:(1) Appeal allowed, conviction and sentence quashed.(3) New trial ordered.

       Regina v Lloyd Anthony MURRELL 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted after trial of the murder of Ahmed Homsi, on the night of 9 November 1997. He now appeals against that conviction upon grounds which essentially turn upon the admission into evidence of a conversation in which he participated, and which was captured by a listening device. 
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
     2   The Crown case, in summary, was that the appellant and another man, “Norm”, participated in a joint criminal enterprise to fire a shotgun at the home of the victim. It was the Crown case that Norm was responsible for the shot, which was fired through the closed front door of the home, and which struck the victim while he was standing in the hallway. Another shot had been fired through the front window of the house into the lounge room before the fatal shot, without striking anyone. 
     3   Upon the Crown case, the victim walked into the hallway after the first shot, when he was called out to face the shooter “eye to eye”. 
     4   The shooting, it was alleged, followed an argument four days earlier over a car accident, outside the victim’s home, in which a friend of the appellant, Stacey Stephens, had crashed into the parked car of one Said Beyroutieh. That man had been an employee of the victim. The ensuing argument involved a significant number of associates of Beyroutieh, including the victim, and it was one in which the appellant had participated, after being called to the scene by Ms Stephens. It was described as an intimidating scene, and it was alleged that the appellant had been stopped when he endeavoured to start Ms Stephens’ car, and that he had challenged Beyroutieh to a fight. 
     5   Following the shooting, police installed a listening device in the home of the appellant, under authority of a warrant granted on 2 June 1998, in relation to suspicion of his involvement in armed robberies. It is in relation to the product of a recording made of a conversation on 16 June 1998, between the appellant and Lisa Simpson, that this appeal turns.  
     6   The Crown alleged that the recording of this conversation, which was significantly affected by background noise, but which had been transcribed by Detective Maree (Ex J), revealed that: 
      
       
      a) Simpson asked the Appellant if he had seen a programme on Channel 7 “Australia’s Most Wanted” (on 6 April 1998), which had featured a re-enactment of the shooting; 
       
       
      b) the appellant replied that he had, and gave a description of the events leading to the shooting, in which he allegedly said that: 
       
       
       (i) Norm had asked him to go with him to the victim’s house; 
       
       
       (ii) Although he was reluctant to go, because Norm had been drinking, he agreed to the request; 
       
       
       (iii) He and Norm stole a car near the victim’s house; 
       
       
       (iv) “Norm went bang through the window”; 
       
       
       (v) he said to Norm, “Norm,  
      through the door 
      ” and that he “could see the bloke someone walkin’ down towards the door, the hall light was on I could see the shadow”; 
       
       
      (vi) Norm then fired the shotgun through the door; 
       
       
        
        (vii) he said, “Cause what happened the first shot went in through the window, they heard it they come out to have a look and I saw this cunt. I could see a shadow underneath the door and I said Norm  
        fuck the front door 
        ”. 
        
       
       
     7   The Crown also relied on a second listening device intercept, of a conversation on the evening of 27 June 1998. This was the night before the date on which the appellant had arranged to speak to police. That conversation, which took place between him and two other people, the Crown alleged, revealed that he had said that: 
      
       
      a) he would not tell them what Norm had done but, in response to a question about whether he had bashed somebody or something, he said “it’s worse than that”; 
       
       
      b) he was going to tell the police in the morning that he went to a car accident and that he did not know anything about what happened after that; 
       
       
      c) he would trust Stacy as much as Norm and that “she won’t say fuckin’ nothing”. 
       
     8   On the following day the appellant was interviewed by police in relation to the car accident, in the course of which he admitted to having had words with one of the persons present. He did not make any admissions as to his complicity in the shooting. 
     9   The recording of 16 June 1998, was enhanced by an audio engineer Lachlan Mitchell, in an attempt to remove background noise. His transcript of the conversation (Ex N), following enhancement, differed to some extent from Detective Maree’s transcript, in that he noted the appellant as saying: 
      
       
        
        a) “… we went over there fuck it, stole a car, went round there [indistinct] bang! ‘did you hear that?’ I said ‘ 
        not through the door 
        , I can see him’”; 
         
         
         b) “ ’cause what happened, the first shot went in through the window, they heard it. They come out to have a look, I seen the cunt walk through, I could see the shadow underneath the door. I said ‘Norm,  
        mind the front door’ 
         …” . 
        
       
       
       
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
     10   It was the appellant’s case that he had not gone to the victim’s home for the purpose of discharging a firearm or of occasioning anyone harm. Rather, it was his account that somewhat reluctantly, he had given in to pressure from Norm and had been taken with him by Stacey Stephens, to the home of the victim, in order to steal the motor vehicle which had been involved in the accident. As it was not there, they stole another car some blocks away, and drove back to the victim's home, to see whether the vehicle for which they had originally been looking, had returned. 
     11   Once there, he said that Norm got out of the vehicle, and went berserk, yelling out at the people in the house, before going over to the victim’s house with a bag in his hand. From his position in the car he heard a big bang and saw a flame. He realised that Norm was shooting at the house and he went over in an attempt to stop him. On his account, he said to Norm “No no” and then, when he saw a shadow under the door, he said ‘No no, not the front door”. Norm, however, fired another shot which went through the front door. 
     12   Having listened to Detective Maree’s transcript, the appellant suggested that there should be some correction to pages 15 and 16 of it, based upon what he recalled of the conversation with Miss Simpson, and upon what he could hear of it, as follows: 
      
       
        
        a) “I said  
        not 
         through the door, I could see the bloke, someone walkin down towards the door, the hall light was on and I could see the shadow … I said  
        no 
         Norm … he goes fuckin bang”; 
         
         
        b) instead of “Yeah it was a bit gory” I said “ 
        it wasn’t meant”. 
         
         
        c) “We didn’t really go there to do that  
        yeah we didn’t …”. 
         
         
        d) 
          
        “I could see a shadow underneath the door I said Norm 
        , no 
         the front door.” (Ex 3) 
        
       
     13   In his case, three witnesses with audio engineering experience were called, and there were tendered transcripts of further enhancements of the recording of 16 June 1998. A transcript of an enhancement made by Mr Young (Ex4) revealed the following relevant passage of conversation attributed to the appellant: 
      
       
        
        (i) “I said, ‘Norm,  
        not through the door 
         … ‘ I could see the bloke, someone walking down towards the door, the hall light was on and I could see the shadow … I said ‘ 
        no Norm 
         I told you someone’s there”; 
         
         
        (ii) “It wasn’t meant ..” instead of “Yeah it was a bit gory …”: 
         
         
        (iii) “We didn’t really go there to do … yeah we did …” 
         
         
        (iv) “Cause what happened, the first shot went in through the window, they heard it, they come out to have a look and I saw this cunt. I could see a shadow underneath the door. I said ‘ 
        Norm not in the front door’ 
        ”;  
        
       
     14   Gregory Edgword, a former radio operator also produced an enhanced disc and a transcript (Ex 6) which recorded the relevant passages as “not through the door” and “… they came out to have a look, I said ‘let’s fuck off’ Cos I could see a shadow underneath the door, I said ‘Norm not in the front door’”. 
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
     15   The Crown relied on the Maree version tendered in its case to establish a joint enterprise to shoot the victim. The versions advanced in the defence case were, however, relied upon to rebut the theory of joint enterprise, or in the alternative, to demonstrate withdrawal from it The version enhanced by Lachlan Mitchell was relied upon for the same purpose. In substance, it was the defence contention that it was only Detective Maree’s version which supported the prosecution case, and that this version was contradicted by the evidence of the other witnesses. 
     16   It is common ground that the recording of the conversation of 16 June was of critical importance for the Crown case of murder, particularly in so far as the prosecution version suggested that the appellant had encouraged Norm to fire at the shadow which he could see at the front door. It was also critical for the defence case so far as the appellant asserted that it supported his evidence of warning Norm not to shoot at or through the door. That it was critical, was pointed out several times by Studdert J, in the course of the summing up. 
     17   A number of grounds of appeal have been advanced, all of which turn upon the tender of evidence of the conversation. They are as follows: 
      
       
      a) evidence should not have been admitted in the prosecution case, in the form of the opinions expressed about the words used, and the transcripts of what the witnesses believed they had heard - having regard to its poor quality and to the risk of impermissible prejudice outweighing its probative value; 
       
       
      b) his Honour should have withdrawn the evidence from the jury once it became clear, as the trial progressed, that there was a significant issue and doubt as to what had been said by the appellant; 
       
       
      c) his Honour failed to give sufficient warning to the jury concerning the possible unreliability of the transcripts; 
       
       
      d) his Honour failed to sufficiently direct the jury concerning the onus of proof as to the contents of the recording; 
       
       
      e) at the close of the Crown case the case should have been withdrawn from the jury upon the basis that the evidence relied upon by the Crown was inherently weak, vague and inconsistent with the other evidence;  
       
       
      f) the fresh evidence now available arising out of the report of Dr. Joanne Tibbitts, a specialist in forensic sound and video analysis, would establish that: 
       
       
      (i) the crucial words attributed in Detective Maree’s version to the appellant had not been uttered by him, but that conversely the words uttered were largely as he had contended; 
       
       
      (ii) the tape from which the enhanced recording had been made had either been tampered with, or that the tape provided by the DPP to the appellant’s legal advisers as the original recording, was not in fact the original recording; and 
       
       
      g) the verdict was not one that can be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
       
     18   The Crown has conceded, in the light of Dr. Tibbitts’ report, which it accepts to be admissible as fresh evidence, and in the light of further examination of the tape by its own expert, Dr. Helen Fraser, that the conversation attributed to the appellant was less inculpatory than that of which Detective Maree gave evidence.  
     19   In this regard, there appears to be agreement between them, with some minor differences, that the appellant had spoken words to the following effect: 
      
       
        
        “… Norm went bang through the window … and I (said or told him)  
        not through the door 
         … (cos or see) I could see … someone walking down towards the door. … the hall light was on and I could see the shadow .. he went fucking bang … I said (says)  
        no Norm 
         .. I’m tellin you there’s someone behind the front door.” 
        
       
       
      And later: 
       
       
        
        “The first shot went in through the window. They hear it. They come out to have a look and I seen the cunt walking through … I could see the shadow underneath the door. I said Norm ( 
        mind or not in 
        ) 
         the front door 
        .” 
        
       
     20   During the course of argument on appeal, Counsel accepted that it was now likely that there would be substantial consensus as to the terms of the recorded conversation, if the matter were to be sent for retrial. Some minor differences may remain but the critical passages would substantially be agreed to. 
     21   In those circumstances, the Crown accepted that the appellant had lost a real chance of acquittal for the offence of murder. Put another way, it accepts that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant of the offence had the present evidence been before it. The test enunciated in Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259 for the setting aside of the verdict upon the basis of fresh evidence, is accordingly met. This clearly was a proper concession by the Crown which leaves this Court in a position where it must allow the appeal and quash the conviction below. 
     22   The sole question which remains is whether a new trial should be directed and if so, in what terms the order should be made. The power to grant a new trial arises under S 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “8(1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
        
       
     23   The Court has a wide discretion whether or not to grant a new trial: Gerakiteys (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 321. As Murphy J observed in King (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 426 to 427: 
      
       
        
        “Under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) a new trial should only be ordered where it would more adequately remedy the miscarriage of justice than any other order the court is empowered to make. 
        
       
       
        
        A new trial is not the inevitable result of a successful appeal against conviction. The onus rests squarely with the prosecution to show the court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy. In  
        Cheatley v The Queen 
         (1981) Tas SR 123, at pp.137-138, the correct approach is clearly spelled out by Everett J: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘My conclusion is that there is no presumption in favour of a second trial being ordered when an appeal succeeds, and that the discretion of the court must be exercised on a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances. The accused should be accorded neither more nor less personal consideration than the overall justice of the case requires in recognition of the public interest in the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice. I do not accept the counter argument on behalf of the prosecution that ‘the ordinary course should apply.’ I do not consider for the reasons I have expressed, that there should be any ‘ordinary’ course. Each case is individual and should be determined on the basis of the facts and all relevant considerations which apply to it - not to a different case. It is a negation of the wide discretion vested by statute in the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal to suppose that a common mould exists and that all cases should be judged within its framework.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Section 404(1) of the Criminal Code (Tas) is in substantially similar terms to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW)). 
        
       
       
        
        Where there was insufficient evidence at the original trial to warrant a conviction or if the evidence that will be available at any new trial is insufficient then it would be contrary to the interests of justice to order a new trial. The appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right:  
        Reid v The Queen 
         (1980) AC 343 at 349-350;  
         R v Wilkes 
         (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518,  
        Andrews v The Queen 
         (1968) 126 CLR 198 at 211,  
        Gerakiteys v The Queen 
         (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 321, 322, 331;  
        Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler 
         (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630 and  
        Cheatley (1981) Tas SR at 138. 
        
       
     24   As Ipp AJA said in Pedrana (2001) NSWCCA 66, (at para 10-11) in deciding whether to direct a verdict of acquittal or to order a new trial, the Court is to have regard to the view which a reasonable jury must have reached, and not the view of the court itself. Where it concludes that, as a result of fresh evidence, it would have a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right. 
     25   The distinction between those cases where the appellant is entitled to an acquittal of right, and those where a new trial is to be ordered, needs to be carefully borne in mind, as Pedrana emphasised. 
     26   In determining whether to grant a new trial it is proper to take into account, among other considerations, the public interest in the proper administration of justice as well as the interests of the individual accused: Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 184 CLR 627, where the Court said (at 630): 
      
       
        
        “The power to grant a new trial is a discretionary one and in deciding whether to exercise it the court which has quashed the conviction must decide whether the interests of justice require a new trial to be had. In so deciding, the court should first consider whether the admissible evidence given at the original trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction, for if it was not it would be wrong by making an order for a new trial to give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement a defective case. In the present case, the admissible evidence given at the trial satisfies this test. Then the court must take into account any circumstances that might render it unjust to the accused to make him stand trial again, remembering however, that the public interest in the proper administration of justice must be considered as well as the interests of the individual accused.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Honeysett 
       (1987) 10 NSWLR 638 at 646 per Hunt J and  
      Spies 
       (2000) 74 ALJR 1263 at 1283 in relation to the discretion, the exercise of which depends upon the interests of justice. 
       
     27   In seeking an exercise of the discretion in favour of an order for a new trial, in this case the Crown submits that a jury supplied with an enhanced tape, and with a suitably amended transcript to reflect the necessary changes, and paying regard to the remaining circumstantial evidence, could properly return a verdict of murder, or at least one of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
     28   It accepts that it would have to abandon a case of joint enterprise murder depending upon specific intent, that being the first way in which it had originally put its case. However, it submits that there is still a proper case of murder to go to the jury based on the doctrine of common purpose: Johns (1980) 143 CLR 108. This alternative would involve a scenario in which the appellant went to the premises with Norm as part of a joint enterprise to fire shots at it, and contemplated that, as a possible incident of that enterprise, Norm would use the weapon to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to somebody inside the house. 
     29   The jury was directed, in this regard, in relation to murder but whether it returned its verdict on the first or second of the two bases left is obviously not apparent from the verdict itself. An express direction was also given in relation to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, in the course of a joint enterprise to shoot up the house. It may be assumed, however, that because of the verdict which was returned, the jury did not find it necessary to consider this alternative. 
     30   The additional circumstances identified by the Crown, beyond those which would be revealed by the 16 June admissions as to the appellant’s presence at the scene of the shooting relate to: 
      
       
      a) the motive which he had arising out of his anger, in relation to the confrontation following the motor vehicle accident; 
       
       
      b) the continuing anger which he held in that regard, evident in the strong and offensive terms in which he spoke, in the intercepted conversations, of those who had been involved in the incident; 
       
       
      c) the fact that he knew Norm to be drunk and to be a person who was very violent and very abusive when in that state (a matter with which he expressly agreed in his evidence); 
       
       
      d) the absence of any mention, in the recorded conversation, of the visit having been for the purpose of stealing the damaged vehicle; 
       
       
      e) the absence of any apparent motive in Norm to attend the victim’s premises, either to steal the motor vehicle which had been involved in the accident and which was damaged, or to exact revenge upon the victim; 
       
       
      f) the suggestion that, in the ERISP, the appellant had significantly played down the earlier incident, and in particular the extent of his role in it; 
       
       
      g) the flavour of the conversation of 16 June, which, it was put, suggested even upon the most favourable basis for the appellant, that there had been a plan to shoot up the house, rather than a plan to go there simply to steal a motor vehicle. 
       
       
      h) the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Daboussi, who saw the shooting, and who said that he had seen only one man at the front of the house when the shots were fired, and who then noticed the vehicle, to which the gunman had returned, leave the scene very quickly after he reached it. This evidence, it was suggested was capable of supporting the proposition that the appellant had remained in the vehicle as the driver, in order to effect a quick escape, and also opened up the possibility that the intercepted conversation did not accurately record the events at the door, but rather was of a self serving nature to minimise the appellant’s culpability. 
       
     31   In addition to these points, the Crown identified what it suggested to be inherent improbabilities or inconsistencies in the evidence given by the appellant at trial. These related to: 
      
       
      a) the suggested inherent lack of credibility in the appellant’s account that: 
       
       
      (i) he had been reluctantly dragged down to the victim’s home; 
       
       
      (ii) Stacey had simply dropped them off, without any vehicle in which they could return home, and without checking first whether the target vehicle was there and could be started; 
       
       
      (iii) a decision had been made to steal a vehicle to drive home only after they had found the “target vehicle” to be missing; 
       
       
      (iv) he was unaware that Norm had a shotgun with him; 
       
       
      (v) the existence of any cause for belief that Mr. Beyroutieh’s vehicle would still be parked outside the victim’s home; 
       
       
      (vi) the proposition that the car was to be stolen so as to avoid paying for its repair; 
       
       
      (vii) the absence of a more determined attempt by him to stop Norm firing the second shot, for example by pushing the barrel away from the door; 
       
       
      b) the clear contradictions in the appellant’s evidence as to whether he had believed that Mr. Beyroutieh lived at the premises, and as to who had driven the car away from the scene of the shooting. 
       
     32   These further submissions in relation to suggested weakness in the evidence of the appellant, assume that in a new trial, his evidence at the first trial could be placed before the jury, either because he would give the same evidence in chief or in cross examination if called, or that otherwise the transcript could be tendered by the Crown.  
     33   Upon my assessment of the evidence which may be assumed to be available, a properly instructed jury would have to entertain a reasonable doubt about common purpose murder. It is one thing to go to premises with a loaded firearm contemplating its possible use to shoot someone, and quite another thing to go to those premises contemplating its use to shoot the premises up. Upon the available evidence, the Crown case could not in my view rise above one of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, based upon a common enterprise to call at the victim’s premises to shoot them up, or to employ the language used by the Crown Prosecutor, in the cross examination of the appellant, “to put the wind up people inside the house”. Moreover, it appears to me that even assuming the recorded conversation to have been in the terms most favourable to the appellant, the words spoken and the limited intervention offered would not constitute a withdrawal from the form of joint enterprise which is alleged in this latter respect. I am accordingly persuaded that there is a sufficiency of evidence to support that offence, so that a new trial should be ordered. 
     34   The question which was then debated upon appeal was whether a verdict of acquittal of murder should be entered and an order made directing a new trial for manslaughter alone; or whether there should simply be a quashing of the conviction and an order for a new trial generally.  
     35   Both the Crown and Counsel for the appellant questioned whether the court could direct a verdict of acquittal for murder and make an order for a new trial confined to the lesser offence of manslaughter. That a power to order a new trial on a lesser count exists, in appropriate cases, is suggested by the presence, in s8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, of the words “the Court may … order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit”.  
     36   Although Counsel were unable through their research to find any instance where this had occurred, there is in fact precedent for it in Kelly (1923) 32 CLR 509, a decision that has been followed in Miller (1951) ALR 749; Hanias (1976) 14 SASR 137 and Callaghan (1952) 87 CLR 115. Kelly was a case where the accused had been convicted at trial, on an indictment for murder, only of manslaughter; Miller is, however, more directly in point, since the jury had there convicted of murder, but on appeal that conviction was quashed. A new trial was directed for manslaughter alone. The Court did not in that case direct an acquittal for murder. 
     37   There is also support for the proposition that where, on an indictment for murder, there has been no general acquittal, and the record shows that, while the jury acquitted the prisoner of murder, they were discharged without giving a verdict on manslaughter, because of their inability to agree on such a verdict, the issue between the Crown and the accused of a felonious killing, falling short of murder, may properly be taken as not having been concluded; and on that basis does not give rise to a defence of autrefois acquit: Quinn (1952) 53 SR (NSW) 21. That a decision would suggest, however, that the contrary position would arise where there was a general acquittal. 
     38   Applying the reasoning in that case, it would follow that, if the verdict now entered in this Court was one of general acquittal, then it would also operate as a discharge upon the original indictment of the appellant on the charge of manslaughter. However, in circumstances where the original jury had not needed to consider the lesser offence of manslaughter and where the Court considered that offence to still be available, it would, in my view, be inappropriate for this Court to enter a verdict that operated as a general acquittal on the indictment. 
     39   The difficulty which arises in this regard is that, as a matter of law, a plea of not guilty to an indictment charging murder is a “plea of the general issue to every allegation of fact necessary to make the killing a felony” whether it be that of murder or manslaughter (per Owen J in Quinn at 24). As Herron J put it in Quinn at 27, “an indictment operates so as to charge the accused, not only with the major charge specified in it but with any lesser offence for which on such charge he becomes liable to conviction”. 
     40   Earlier, at 25-26, his Honour noted that the plea of autrefois acquit: 
      
       
        
        “… is based on the doctrine of  
        res judicata 
        . It may best be re-stated by citing the oft-quoted passage from Lord Reading’s judgment in  
        R v Barron 
         (1914) 2 KB 570 at 574: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The principle on which this plea depends has often been stated. It is this, that the law does not permit a man to be twice in peril of being convicted of the same offence. If, therefore, he has been acquitted, ie found to be not guilty of the offence, by a court competent to try him, such acquittal is a bar to a second indictment for the same offence.  
          This rule applies not only to the offence actually charged in the indictment, but to any offence of which he could have been properly convicted on the trial of the first indictment. Thus an acquittal on a charge of murder is a bar to a subsequent indictment for manslaughter, as the jury could have convicted of manslaughter”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        For the plea to be well founded there must, on the former charge, have been a legal verdict returned. This means that a verdict of not guilty or guilty of the crime charged must have been found for or against the accused. It is sufficient to support the plea to show that a verdict of guilty has been returned by a jury which is  
        subsequently set aside on appeal 
        , eg on the ground of wrongful admission of evidence and  
        where the Court of Appeal discharges the prisoner 
        . If an accused person is again put on his trial under circumstances of that sort, it is quite clear that he could plead a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court to try him again:  
        Reg v O’Keefe 
         (1893) 15 NSWLR 1. Perhaps in such a case the plea of  
        autrefois acquit 
         may not be quite apt, but there is a res  
        judicata 
        . The principle is that a man is not to be prosecuted and stand in jeopardy twice for the same offence. 
        
       
       
        
        But there must be a legal verdict. If no legal verdict is returned at the first trial, the prisoner is not to be regarded as being in jeopardy, and he might be tried again. There must be a true  
        judicata 
         and not merely proof of the  
        res 
        .” 
        
       
     41   The common law position, noted in this decision, is confirmed in S 125 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which provides: 
      
       
        
        “125. If under any Act a person who is tried for a serious indictable offence may be acquitted of the offence but found guilty of some other offence, the person is not liable to further prosecution on the same facts for that other offence.” 
        
       
       
      Although s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 does not expressly provide that a person charged with murder may be convicted of manslaughter, that is implicit both in the Section and at common law. 
       
     42   It would be prudent to avoid any residual question of autrefois acquit arising, in this case, it being one in which the original jury obviously did not consider manslaughter, and being one in which I am of the view that the Crown should be permitted, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, to re-indict the appellant for that offence, or for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder (an option that is open to it both as a matter of law: Nicholas (1989) 45 A Crim R 299, and upon the available evidence).  
     43   The proper course, I consider, is not to enter a verdict of acquittal, or to order a new trial on manslaughter alone. Rather, the preferable course is to quash the conviction and to order a new trial generally, thereby precluding any argument that, by the Court’s order, the Director of Public Prosecutions could not present an indictment charging either as a single count or as a back up charge, the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, which may turn out in fact to be the more appropriate charge. 
     44   Any concern which the appellant may have that the Crown could use the opportunity so given, to bolster a case of murder by gathering new evidence to support such a charge, is lacking in foundation. The inappropriateness of ordering a new trial to allow that to occur was noted in Wilkes (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518 per Dixon J, by the Court in DPP (Nauru) v Fowler in the passage cited earlier, and by this court in Ward (1989) 42 A Crim R 56. There is no suggestion that this is what is proposed in the present case. 
     45   The decision whether a second trial should proceed for manslaughter, or for accessory after the fact to murder, can in my view be safely left to the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a discretion which it may be assumed will be exercised responsibly, having regard to these remarks, before framing an indictment which the evidence is capable of supporting. 
     46   I would accordingly propose that the appeal be allowed, that the conviction and sentence below be quashed. I would order a new trial.

      MONDAY 4 JUNE 2001 
      
      REGINA v. SAW 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD, J: The court is in a position to give judgment in this matter. Greg James, J. will give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: The appellant appeals against his conviction and sentence following a trial in the District Court of New South Wales on one count, that he had sexual intercourse with AME, who was then aged 15 years and under his authority, an offence under s.66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by imprisonment for 10 years. 
     3   He was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years and three months. At trial he had been charged with seven counts of sexual offences against the same complainant. He had been acquitted of five counts by the verdicts of the jury. 
     4   On count six, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, an acquittal was directed. That count together with counts five and seven involved asserted illegal sexual interference with that same person at the same place and during the same range of dates. All three of those counts are said to have related to the period between 27 September 1996 and 3 October 1996. 
     5   The events to which counts one and two were said to relate allegedly occurred on the night of a dinner at the complainant's school at a time at which she was said to be 12 years old. She testified that her father had, during a trip home heading north, digitally penetrated her with his finger whilst continuing to drive. She also asserted an act of cunnilingus during the journey when the car had stopped. 
     6   There was some independent evidence at the trial tending to contradict her assertion that her father had been with her on the journey and going to the place at which she asserted they had been going that night. Her father asserted from his recollection that he had driven her back to school and then had driven to a different place where he stayed with his girlfriend. 
     7   Counts three and four were asserted to have occurred also at the same place as counts five, six and seven but at a different time. It was asserted by the complainant that while she was sleeping on a sofa bed in the lounge room the appellant digitally penetrated her and engaged in cunnilingus; that she was seen to be with the appellant on the sofa bed by her grandfather and that at that time the appellant covered them up with the sheet as though he were sleeping; she referred to some short conversation occurring with the grandfather. 
     8   There was in that evidence some degree of confusion which the Crown has submitted today showed that she might have been confusing that occasion with the occasions to which counts five, six and seven referred. 
     9   In addition there was evidence, some of which was elicited in re-examination, of other events to which she referred other than those specifically charged in the indictment. 
     10   Counts five, six and seven were said to have involved the appellant and the complainant in a double bed watching a James Bond movie. There was some evidence that a James Bond movie had been screened at a time during this range of dates to which the charge of criminal activity was said to relate. 
     11   However, the complainant apparently made some diary reference to the Bond movie but ascribed it to a different day other than that on which the evidence disclosed it was screened.  
     12   She asserted that after the movie she woke to discover the appellant engaged in penile vaginal penetration and that he made reference to there being ""a gate and it had to be broken"". He did not manage fully to penetrate her. She asserted that he then later engaged in full anal penetration, that matter gave rise to count seven, which was amended at trial to reflect the complainant's evidence of full penetration rather than an attempted penetration, as had been reflected in the original form of the count. 
     13   In relation to count six it had been asserted that he had taken her into the bathroom and made her masturbate him. She, however, gave no evidence in relation to count six at the trial thus leading to the acquittal by direction to which I have already referred. 
     14   As to all of the charges laid in the indictment, the appellant denied the commission of any of the sexual behaviour alleged and further denied any involvement in the additional sexual activity that was also led in evidence. 
     15   It can be seen from that short recital of the subject matter of the trial that the evidence of the complainant was entirely crucial to all counts. 
     16   There was no early complaint in any specific terms tending to show a sound basis of credibility in respect of any of the particular offences charged. There was no corroboration in respect of count five in the sense referred to in the old law as referred to by the court in Regina v. Baskerville [1916] 2 KB 698. 
     17   There was, the Crown asserts, some supporting material. That material included the reference to the James Bond movie being supported by the evidence that such a move was shown and in addition it included medical evidence that the complainant, on examination, was seen to have what the Crown has here referred to as a damaged hymen. 
     18   There was evidence from Dr. Jean Edwards that upon her examination of the complainant approximately four months after the events alleged to support this group of counts, she observed healed partial transections of the hymen which went three-quarters of the way through it. Although she could not say when those transections occurred, she was of the opinion that the transections were caused by some form of penetration and that in her view, although that penetration could have been occasioned by fingers, it was more likely that those transections should be attributed to penetration by a penis. 
     19   Her evidence, however, in this latter regard proceeded on her acceptance of or the assumption of the truth of the history given by the complainant. In any event, that evidence, given the totality of the complainant's assertions, was not capable of being attributed to the particular events to which the complainant referred in count five, although it is plainly consistent with the account she gave. 
     20   Two grounds of appeal are asserted. The first ground of appeal asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury regarding how they should proceed if not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth in relation to one or more counts in the indictment. The second ground of appeal simply asserts that the guilty verdict on count five was unreasonable. 
     21   In relation to that second ground the basis on which it is said that the court should intervene is that asserted in the judgment of the majority in the High Court in Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 dealing with the earlier decision of the High Court in M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and in particular as referred to in Jones (supra) at 450 to 452. 
     22   Applying the test in M (supra), the High Court in Jones (supra) in the judgments of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow, JJ. referred to the passages in M (supra) at 493:- 
      
       
        
        ""In answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
        
       
     23   Also, the since often cited passage from M (supra) at 494:- 
      
       
        
        ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" 
        
       
     24   The court in Jones (supra) then turned to apply what had been said in M (supra) to the circumstance where there had been acquittals on some counts and convictions on others in the passage in Jones (supra) at 455. In the individual case they concluded that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the counts of which the appellant had been convicted. 
     25   That examination was conducted in the context of ascertaining whether, there being evidence in the form of the complainant's evidence against the appellant's evidence, it could be said that the evidence of the complainant had sufficient credibility for the jury to convict, where, as here, the jury had acquitted where there was other evidence contrary to that of the complainant. Their Honour's remarked:- 
      
       
        
        ""For it meant that, when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof."" 
        
       
     26   They concluded that such evidence affected the complainant's general credibility and thus credibility on all counts. Such a conclusion does not amount to a finding or opinion that a complainant lied. It does amount to a conclusion that the evidence of the complainant, on one count having been tested and found wanting as to a sufficiency to support beyond reasonable doubt a conviction, does not thereby remain sufficient on another count. 
     27   In that case, as in my view in this case, where there was evidence to the contrary in addition to the evidence of the accused denying the offence, the complainant's account was found wanting so far as to support beyond reasonable doubt a conclusion of the appellant's guilt. That inability to support a conclusion of guilty in those circumstances cannot be confined to counts on which there is other contrary evidence. 
     28   This is not a case which, in my view, calls for an over-sophisticated analysis or, on the other hand, a broad brush contention that the complainant lied. It is a case in which what we are concerned with is whether the jury's verdict is subject to the doubt the High Court referred to in M (supra) given the other evidence and the acquittals. 
     29   The complainant did not give evidence to support count six. The jury rejected the Crown's case on court seven. The Crown's case on count five could only have succeeded if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the credit of the complainant in relation to her accounts of what was said to have occurred during this very range of dates at this very same place. 
     30   When one has regard to the defence as having been a in-globo defence, that no such thing happened, I am left with a doubt on count five which is not explained for me by the evidence or the verdicts on the other counts, such as would enable me to conclude that the jury's advantage would lead to that doubt being dispelled. 
     31   I am of the view in those circumstances that in this case the appeal should succeed on ground two. It would follow that the appropriate order that should be made, were that ground to be upheld, that an acquittal should be entered rather than an order for a new trial. 
     32   In those circumstances I do not consider it necessary to say more about ground 1, except that directions were given, obviously to the intent of safe guarding the position of the accused, that were the jury of the view that the accused was guilty on one count, it should not allow that to influence them in their consideration of the other counts. No direction was given, although directions were given for separate consideration, as to the effect of the complainant's credibility were the jury to be of the view that they could not accept her credibility on some other of the counts. 
     33   I have had regard to that matter when reaching the view that I have taken in relation to count two. 
     34   I would propose that the appeal be allowed and an acquittal entered. 
     35   DOWD, J: I agree. 
     36   NEWMAN, AJ: I also agree. 
     37   DOWD, J: The orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

Gonzague E. Hetu
(Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

The Dixville Butter
and Cheese Association (Defendants) Respondents

1908: March 2; 1908: March 23.

Present: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF
QUEBEC.

Malicious prosecution—Reasonable and
probable cause—Bonà fide belief in
guilt—Burden of proof—Right of action for damages-Art. 1053 (7.(7.—Pleading and
practice.

An action for damages for malicious
prosecution will not lie where it appears that the circumstances under which
the information was laid were such that the party prosecuting entertained a
reasonable bona fide belief, based upon full conviction founded upon
reasonable grounds, that the accused was guilty of the offence charged. Abrath
v. North Eastern Railway Go. (11 App. Cas. 247) and Cox v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank ((1905)
A.C. 168) referred to.

Semble, that in
such cases, the rule as to the burden of proof in the Province of Quebec is the
same as that under the law of England, and the plaintiff is obliged to allege
and prove that the prosecutor acted with malicious intentions or, at least, with
indiscretion or reprehensible want of consideration. Sharpe v. Willis
(Q.R. 29 S.C. 14; 11 Rev. de Jur.
538) and Durocher v. Bradford (13 R.L. (N.S.) 73) disapproved.

Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 16 K.B. 333)
affirmed.

Appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side(1),
affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Hutchinson J., by which the
plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.

[Page 129]

The material circumstances of the case are
stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice now reported.

L. C. Bélanger K.C. and Hector Verret for
the appellant.

Shurtleff K.C. for the respondents.

L. C. Bélanger K.C. and Hector Verret for the appellant. As we have shewn such
absence of reasonable cause for arrest that the plaintiff was honourably
acquitted by the magistrate, there is no necessity of going further and making
affirmative proof of malice; Sharpe v. Willis[1]; Painchaud v. Bell[2]; Gowan v. Holland[3]. The evidence of having
taken the advice of counsel was irregularly admitted and was objected to at the
trial. In any event, taking such advice is not an answer to the action; the
defendants were obliged to shew the existence of probable cause for laying the
information; Tanguay v. Gaudry[4];
61 Am. & Eng. Eneyc, p. 899; Rielle v. Benning[5]; Charlehois v. Bourassa[6]; 19 Am. & Eng.
Encyc, p. 687. We also rely upon the decisions in Burrows v. Ransom[7]; Brizard v. Sylvestre[8]; Denard v. Gay[9]; and Charlehois v.
Surveyer[10].

Shurtleff K.C. for
the respondents. The facts justifying the prosecution have all been found in
our favour by the trial judge. The plaintiff utterly failed to prove malice, or
even any indiscretion or carelessness on the part of the respondents. These
facts were found sufficient by the justice of the peace, by the trial judge and
by the court below, as

[Page 130]

well as by the legal adviser to whom the
respondents stated their case with full faith in the suspicious circumstances
on which they founded a bonà fide belief in the guilt of the
plaintiff. See Hilliard on Torts, p. 49; Cooley on Torts, p. 123; Bowes v.
Ramsay[11].
It was the duty of the private prosecutor to lay the information and bring the
guilty person to punishment; Grothév. Saunders[12]; Pinsonneault v. Sébastien[13]; Lefuntun v. Bolduc[14].
In addition to the authorities cited in the judgments in the court below, we
refer to Moloney v. Chase[15];
Francœur v. Boulay[16]; Le-mire v. Duclos[17]; Renaud v. Guenette[18]; and Giguère v. Jacob[19].

The judgment of the court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The action out of which this appeal arises was
brought for the purpose of recovering damages for what is usually called
malicious prosecution.

The plaintiff, now appellant, was the owner of a
creamery at a place called Dixville in the Eastern Townships. After this
creamery had been in operation about six years the defendants, now respondents,
started a rival factory with the result that most of the business of the
neighbourhood was attracted to their establishment.

During the night of July 27th, 1905, when the
new creamery was completed and ready for business, an

[Page 131]

attempt was made to set fire to the building,
and, for reasons which are stated at great length in the evidence, suspicion
was directed towards the appellant as the guilty party. The local magistrate
was consulted by one of the officials of the respondent company and on his
suggestion further inquiries were made, the results of which were laid before
counsel who advised that the appellant should be prosecuted. Thereupon the
appellant was arrested and, after the preliminary examination, he was committed
for trial. Subsequently the district magistrate before whom the case was tried
under the ""Speedy Trials Act"" discharged him. Two of complainant's
witnesses were absent from the country at the time of the trial, and there may
have been sufficient evidence to shew a probable cause for prosecuting, but not
such plain proof of guilt as would justify a conviction. After his acquittal by
District Magistrate Mulvena, the appellant brought this action for $5,000
damages, alleging the arrest and subsequent discharge and that the respondents
acted maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. The respondents
pleaded that they used proper care to inform themselves of the facts, that the
act was done without malice and that they honestly believed the case which they
laid before the magistrate. On these issues the parties went to trial. The
judge of the Superior Court, who saw the witnesses and had full opportunity of
judging by their demeanour whether they were witnesses of truth, came to the conclusion
that the respondents had taken care to inform themselves of the facts of the
case; that no malice had been proved and that there was abundant evidence of
reasonable and probable cause, and dismissed the action. In this conclusion the
judges in

[Page 132]

appeal concur and I can see no reason on the
evidence why we should reverse.

In appeal an issue was raised as to the burden of
proof and this question has been recently much discussed in the Quebec Courts; Sharpe
v. Willis[20],
and Durocher v. Bradford[21]. At page 80 of the last report many
cases are cited and much learning is displayed to prove that there is a
difference between the English and French rule of law on this point; but,
expressing a personal opinion, I agree with Mr. Justice Blanchet that there is
no such difference. Under the English system, in an action for malicious
prosecution

the plaintiff has the burden throughout of
establishing that the circumstances of the prosecution were such that a judge
can see no reasonable nor probable cause for instituting it:

Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co.[22]; Cox v. English, Scotch and Australian
Bank[23], at p.
170;

and the principles applicable in cases arising
in Quebec will be found laid
down in article 1053 of the Code:

Every person capable of discerning right
from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another,
whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.

To make the party prosecuting responsible, it is
necessary that the damage should be caused by his fault; and to lay an
information, when in possession of facts sufficient to establish a bonà fide belief of
guilt, is not a fault, but the exercise of an undoubted right. In Quebec, as in English courts, it must be
alleged and proved that there was fault, that is to say, that

[Page 133]

the prosecutor acted, to use the words of the Cour de Cassation

dans le dessein coupable de nuire ou, du
moins, avec une indiscrétion et.""une légèreté répréhensibles"" (Fuzier-Hermann, vo. ""Dénonciation
calomnieuse, No. 231; Sourdat,
Responsabilité, Vol. 1, No. 633; Receuil Philly, sommaires Mars 1908 No. 1930;

and the plaintiff in his declaration thought it
necessary to allege in conformity with this view of the law that the
prosecution was started maliciously to injure him and without reasonable and
probable cause.

It is not necessary, however, for the purposes
of this case to determine that point; the evidence given is sufficient to prove
that the party prosecuting entertained a reasonable bonà fide belief based
upon full conviction founded upon reasonable grounds that the appellant was
guilty of the offence which had undoubtedly been committed.

I would like to say, speaking again for myself,
that in my opinion a private prosecutor is a useful person in a community where
we have nothing in the nature of a public prosecutor and those who, having
taken the reasonable care to ascertain the facts, prosecute duly in the public
interest should be protected. It would be encouraging useless appeals for this
court to hold that an uneducated layman was in fault in assuming that he had
reasonable and probable cause for a prosecution in a case in which the trial
judge and five judges in appeal agree with him.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

     The claimant sought declarations that the opponent was not a person of good fame and character, and not a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll of Legal Practitioners. The claimant also sought orders that the opponent be removed from the Roll, and be required to pay the claimant’s costs. In 1998 the opponent had been convicted on two drug supply charges. The opponent had been admitted as a barrister in Queensland before being mutually admitted in New South Wales in November 1999. In June 2000 the Queensland Court of Appeal ordered that the opponent’s name be struck from the Queensland Roll of Barristers. Held:  (per Sheller JA, Powell JA and Hodgson CJ in Eq agreeing): 1. By failing to acknowledge these criminal proceedings on his application for a practicing certificate in New South Wales, the opponent demonstrated at best a lack of awareness of professional standards; at worst a willingness to make a deliberately false statement in a statutory declaration.2. This Court was entirely in agreement with the Queensland Court of Appeal. The evidence presented as to the opponent’s conduct clearly demonstrated that the opponent was neither a fit and proper person, nor of good fame and character.

      THE PROTHONOTARY SUPREME COURT OF NSW v DARVENIZA 
      
      
      REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
       
     1    SHELLER JA: By summons filed on 22 August 2000 the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales claimed declarations that the opponent, Paul Matthew Darveniza, “is not a person of good fame and character” and that the opponent “is not a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll of Legal Practitioners for the State of New South Wales”. Orders were sought that the name of the opponent be removed from the Roll of Legal Practitioners of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and that the opponent pay the claimant’s costs. When the summons was called on for hearing on 17 April 2001 there was no appearance for the opponent. Service of the summons pursuant to the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth) was proved by the affidavit of Barry Frank Lyon sworn on 30 August 2000 and filed in Court on the morning of the hearing. 
      
       
     2    The claimant’s application was supported by his own affidavit sworn on 22 August 2000, the affidavits of Alice Coolican Paul, a solicitor in the employ of the Crown Solicitor, sworn on 6 and 31 October 2000 and 11 April 2001 respectively and the affidavit of Helen Barrett, the Professional Affairs Director of the New South Wales Bar Association, sworn on 30 October 2000. From conversations with the opponent deposed to by Ms Paul it was apparent that the opponent had no intention of appearing before the Court to oppose the making of the declarations and orders sought. The last of these conversations took place on 10 April 2001. 
      
       
     3    After hearing submissions from Mr Craddock of Counsel who appeared for the claimant, the Court made the declarations and orders sought and said reasons would be given later. 
      
       
     4    The opponent is 40 years of age. He was a member of the Queensland Police Force from 1979 to 1993 and served with distinction. In 1994 he graduated in law from Bond University and on 10 April 1995 was admitted to practice as a barrister in Queensland. On 12 October 1999 he served the New South Wales Bar Association, the Legal Practitioners’ Admission Board and the Law Society of New South Wales with an amended notice under the Mutual Recognition Act 1992 (Cth). On 19 October 1999 the opponent was admitted as a legal practitioner of the Supreme Court of New South Wales pursuant to the Mutual Recognition Act. 
      
       
     5    In November 1999 the opponent applied to the New South Wales Bar Association for the issue of a practising certificate under the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). The application consisted of a form and statutory declaration in which the opponent on 10 November 1999 solemnly and sincerely declared that the information and particulars set forth in the application for a practising certificate were true in substance and in fact and made “this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act 1900 (NSW)”. Included in the application form was the following question: 
      
       
        
         
         “Are you aware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to a complaint or disciplinary proceedings against you or which might influence or affect your good fame and character or your fitness to remain a legal practitioner?” 
         
        
        
       To this question the opponent answered “No”. 
        
       
     6    The opponent furnished to the New South Wales Bar Association a letter dated 1 November 1999 from the Chief Executive of the Bar Association of Queensland confirming that according to the Association’s records no complaint had been made to the Association about the opponent and no order had been made directing his suspension from practice in Queensland nor any proceedings been instituted to strike his name off the Roll of Barristers. The letter went on to say that the Association knew of no facts concerning the opponent which should be disclosed to the Bar Association or to the Court on the hearing of his application for admission in New South Wales. 
      
       
     7    On 17 November 1999 the Executive Director of the New South Wales Bar Association issued a practising certificate in accordance with s32 of the Legal Profession Act entitling the opponent to practise as a barrister until 30 June 2000.  
      
       
     8    On 30 July 1998 and 8 and 9 September 1998 Dowse SM in the Magistrates’ Court at Southport conducted a summary trial of two charges laid against the opponent which the opponent defended. The first charge was that on 26 January 1997 at the Gold Coast, he supplied a dangerous drug, namely methyl dioxide methylamphetamine to one Jeffrey Spencer. The second was that on 27 December 1996 he supplied a dangerous drug, namely methylamphetamine, to Jeffrey Spencer. On 7 October 1998 the magistrate found the opponent guilty on each charge. On each the opponent was “convicted” and fined $1,000. However, the magistrate determined not to record convictions against the opponent. The magistrate said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The decision as to whether or not to record a conviction is actually the one with which I am having most difficulty. I regard this offence, as I have said, as a very serious offence. The fact that you are prepared to involve yourself in the supply of a dangerous schedule 2 drug. However, I think I have been persuaded by Mr Kimmins [who appeared for the opponent], that in the circumstances in which you have found yourself the - no previous convictions, as a concession for the service that you have already performed for the people of Queensland, the fact that it was a minor amount involved. 
         
        
        
         
         I am persuaded not record a conviction against you today.” 
         
        
        
       
     9    The opponent’s appeal against conviction and sentence and a cross appeal against the adequacy of the sentence were both dismissed by Judge Healy QC on 26 March 1999. 
      
       
     10    The nature and outcome of these criminal proceedings made the opponent’s answer to the question in the application form to the New South Wales Bar Association, which I have quoted, insupportable and almost certainly false. As the claimant submitted, no legal practitioner, acting reasonably, could fail to regard the proceedings as germane to the determination of his good fame and character and his fitness to remain a legal practitioner. 
      
       
     11    The Queensland Police Service notified the Barristers’ Board of Queensland that the opponent had been found guilty of the two offences charged. The Barristers’ Board began proceedings to have the opponent’s name struck from the Queensland Roll of Barristers. In the course of that proceeding and in response to evidence concerning the commission of the offences the opponent swore a supplementary affidavit dated 6 June 2000 in which he deposed: 
      
       
        
         
         “4. At my trial in the Southport Magistrates Court on 30 July and 8 September, 1998 I gave evidence to the effect that I did not use illegal drugs including the dangerous drug amphetamine. Dowse SM rejected this evidence in her findings. I still maintain my denial that I have ever used illegal drugs of any kind. 
         
        
        
         
         5. My main area of practice has been in the area of Liquor Licensing and I had found after my admission to practice in 1995 that attending at nightclubs, restaurants and other licensed premises was helpful to me in the development of this aspect of my practice. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The second offence occurred on 26 January, 1997. In early March, 1997 I travelled to Melbourne for the purposes of assisting a friend in the starting of his business in Melbourne. I remained mainly in Melbourne until the early part of August, 1997. I was arrested in September, 1997. After I had returned from Melbourne I did not continue with my previous practice of attending at nightclubs and accordingly I no longer involved myself socially with people who attended at such places. 
         
        
        
         
         7. The reason for my ceasing contact with the three persons alleged to have been involved in the offences was that I had decided that I no longer needed to involve myself in going to nightclubs or to socialising with people who frequented such places. 
         
        
        
         
         8. Bradley Lund, Daniel Johns and even the undercover police officer Jeffrey Alan Spencer all became known to me through my attendance at licensed premises. I had no contact with these people subsequent to March, 1997.  
         
        
        
         
         9. I am not a user of dangerous drugs and have never been. 
         
        
        
         
         10. I accept that involvement in illegal actions such as the possession of or use of dangerous drugs would inevitably be harmful to myself and to others. I also clearly understand that any such involvement could call into question my fitness to practice [sic] as a barrister. The process of being charged found guilty and now being subject to an application to this Honourable Court to have my name removed from the roll of barristers has even further emphasised to me the seriousness which the profession and the Court regard involvement in any illegal and socially harmful practice. It has been a matter of great and continuing regret to me that the publicity surrounding my being charged and dealt with by the Courts may have brought the profession into some degree of disrepute. 
         
        
        
         
         11. I wish to assure the Court that I will not involve myself with drugs or with any activity which would call into question the practice of my profession. I still practice [sic] on the Gold Coast and am aware that any activity of mine will be the subject of close scrutiny by fellow legal practitioners. 
         
        
        
         
         12. All the facts and circumstances herein deposed to are within my own knowledge and belief save such as are deposed to from information only and my means of knowledge and sources of information appear on the face of this my Affidavit.” 
         
        
       
     12    The Barristers’ Board’s application came before the Queensland Court of Appeal comprising McMurdo P, Thomas JA and White J in June 2000. Thomas JA gave the principal judgment with which the other members of the Court agreed. After quoting in part from the passage in the opponent’s affidavit of 6 June 2000 which I have quoted, Thomas JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[6] In reply the Bar Association filed an affidavit by Spencer (the undercover police officer) refuting those allegations. With tapes to support his evidence he said that his association with the respondent continued until 17 July 1997, giving particularised accounts of eight meetings with the respondent over that period in circumstances highly discreditable to the respondent. During that time Spencer posed as and was plainly taken by the respondent to be a drug dealer. In the course of their meetings the respondent offered money-laundering services to Spencer. He also attempted to promote sales of ephedrine (a controlled substance) to Spencer and actually sold Spencer 300 tablets for $1,250. His conversations with Spencer will be mentioned in more detail later. 
         
        
        
         
         [7] When the matter was called on again counsel for the respondent did not seek to cross-examine Spencer or to challenge the material in his affidavit. 
         
        
        
         
         [8] It would seem then that in addition to the particulars upon which the case was originally brought, the respondent has been shown to have lied to the Court in endeavouring to present himself as a reformed character from very soon after the second conviction, and that serious reflections on his character flow from the nature of his dealings and attempted dealings with Mr Spencer whom he believed to be a drug dealer. The worst sting would seem to lie in the tail of this case.” 
         
        
       
     13    Thomas JA set out the facts in the Barristers’ Board’s proceedings in the Court of Appeal under four heads “Two Drug Offences”, “Conduct in Obtaining Practice Certificate in New South Wales”, “Untruthful Affidavit”, of which his Honour said “his affidavit [of 6 June 2000] cannot be explained as a mere error in relation to dates. It was a deliberate attempt to present an untrue picture to the Court” and “Conduct with Spencer February to July 1997”. After reviewing the principles applicable in striking off applications his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Level of seriousness of respondent’s conduct 
         
        
        
         
         [39] The four principal areas of misconduct will now be considered. 
         
        
        
         
         [40] The misconduct revealed by the respondent’s convictions has really been overtaken by the more serious conduct and attitude revealed in the course of his continued association with Spencer. His conduct on the particular occasions in relation to which charges were laid must be seen as part of a wider opportunistic involvement in the drug culture. However, even standing alone, the conviction of a barrister on such offences is a matter for some concern by the court. 
         
        
        
         
         [41] The drugs which the respondent was prepared to assist others to obtain are the origin of much suffering in the community. Participation in the furtherance of usage of such drugs is seriously regarded, even if the offence is toward the lower level of seriousness for such offences. An affidavit of Mr Brown, an expert pharmacologist, demonstrates the nature and effect of the drugs in question. These include their high rating for dependence liability, and a range of toxic results from their abuse, ranging from hyperactive reflexes to psychotic effects. Among other undesirable effects are those upon the drivers of motor vehicles. Experience in the criminal courts all too frequently reveals methylamphetamine or ‘speed’ as a potent factor in serious crimes including homicide and armed robbery. I mention these matters to emphasise that the use of such drugs is generally seen by responsible persons in the community as a serious problem and particularly by persons interested in the maintenance of law and order. 
         
        
        
         
         [42] On the respondent’s behalf it was submitted that the relevant acts happened in private, and that such acts do not scandalise the public unless and until there is conviction. That submission is far from convincing. The same comment might be made of any crime (including murder) committed in private. What is relevant are the acts committed by the respondent and the extent to which they reflect upon his character as a barrister who is expected to play an important role in the administration of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         [43] The conduct in question plainly revealed irresponsible and antisocial behaviour. But this pales into insignificance in the light of his subsequent conduct. 
         
        
        
         
         [44] His conduct in denying awareness of any circumstances that might influence or affect his good fame and character when seeking admission in New South Wales reveals at best a lack of awareness of the standards of the profession. At worst it was a deliberate false statement in a statutory declaration. Of course a question of opinion is involved in the answer and there may be marginal cases where it is difficult for a practitioner or aspiring practitioner to know whether a conviction of a minor offence needs to be mentioned. I cannot think however that recent convictions by a practising barrister for supply of methylamphetamines could fairly be regarded as something that could not influence or affect his good fame and character. Standing alone this conduct might be regarded as an error or as attracting no more than a mild disciplinary response. But in the context of his other misconduct it is just another untoward demonstration of opportunism. 
         
        
        
         
         [45] The swearing of the respondent’s supplementary affidavit was a deliberate attempt to present an untrue picture to the court. Quite apart from any question of perjury, ‘a barrister does not lie to a judge who relies on him for information’. ( 
         Clyne v New South Wales Bar Association 
          (1960) 104 CLR 186, 200 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar, Menzies and Windeyer JJ). Such a rule is fundamental. His deception in the context of the present application is no less serious than deceptions in the course of practice that are condemned in the above statement. 
         
        
        
         
         [46] The respondent’s conduct in June 1997 really speaks for itself. It shows a person who was willing to promote crime including money-laundering, and who was willing to fraternise with a known drug dealer with a view to profit. It shows persistence in attempting to sell unlawful money-laundering, the sale of the controlled substance ephedrine, and even some aggression in his attempt to obtain further sales. It shows a picture, far more tellingly than the limited convictions reveal, of an easy familiarity with the drug scene and of his willingness to make money from it. It shows a person with no respect for the law. 
         
        
        
         
         Conclusion 
         
        
        
         
         [47] The respondent who is 39 years old has practised, mainly from the Gold Coast since his admission in April 1995. He has continued to practise after his arrest in September 1997 and after his conviction in October 1998. He had no obligation to cease practice unless restrained, and no proceedings were brought to restrict his activity until the present application was filed last March. He was formerly a member of the police force (1979-1993) where he served with distinction. He has deposed that he is a respected member of the legal community on the Gold Coast and is regularly sought by ‘professionals’ seeking advice in respect to matters pertaining to liquor licensing and gaming law, and that he employs three persons at his chambers to assist in his workload. Three Gold Coast solicitors who brief him have filed affidavits expressing their confidence and belief in his knowledge of the law, professionalism and ability as an advocate. No testimonial was filed on behalf of any member of the Bar. 
         
        
        
         
         [48] The conduct revealed in this case by the respondent is inconsistent with the high standards expected of barristers. The misconduct shows utter disrespect for the law and is serious enough to demonstrate that the respondent’s character is unsuitable for legal practice. In addition, it might be thought that his misconduct (including offers to perform money-laundering) would readily transpose into his professional activities. Deprivation of the right to practise is a serious matter, but in the circumstances the only appropriate order that can be made is one of disbarment.” 
         
        
        
       The Court of Appeal ordered that the respondent’s name be removed from the Roll of Barristers. 
        
       
     14    In his reasons for judgment, Thomas JA referred to the fundamental rule that a barrister does not lie to a judge who relies on that barrister for information. The opponent’s conduct in 1997 in seeking to promote crime including money-laundering and in fraternising with a known drug dealer with a view to profit, the sale of the controlled substance ephedrine and some aggression in his attempt to obtain further sales, showed a person with no respect for the law. At best his negative answer to the New South Wales Bar Association on his application for a practising certificate revealed a lack of awareness of professional standards and at worst a deliberate false statement in a statutory declaration. 
      
       
     15    On 6 July 2000 the New South Wales Bar Association sought from the opponent an explanation for this negative answer. On 17 July 2000 the opponent replied as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can state that it was my honest and reasonable belief that the circumstances surrounding the finding of guilt by Dowse SM did not and would not have given rise to a question concerning my fitness to practise. I hope to be able to substantiate this belief by outlining the facts of the matter for the information of the Council. 
         
        
        
         
         From the day I was charged in September 1997 to the date my appeal was determined in the District Court in March of 1999, I kept the executive of the Bar Association of Queensland fully informed by letters in writing, on no less than 3 occasions. The last letter to the Qld Bar Assn. was on the 29th of March 1999 (a copy is attached), which clearly indicated the result of the court action and the comments of the Appeal Judge in that instance. I was informed by my Lawyers and it was also my understanding that owing to the order of the court that no conviction be recorded against me in the matters, I would not face disciplinary proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         Some  
         7 months 
          later, I had received no advice from either the Supreme Court or the Qld Bar Assn. that a complaint had been lodged or they were considering and [sic] further action. My belief was further confirmed by the very fact that no complaint had been lodged against me at the Supreme Court, Brisbane when I applied for a certificate of fitness, which was issued on the 15th September 1999 (copy attached). The ultimate confirmation was the letter issued by the Qld Bar Assn. on the 1st of November 1999 which clearly stated that they believed that ‘no facts or circumstances which should be disclosed’ (copy attached). 
         
        
        
         
         I ask that the Council take into consideration the facts as stated above and understand that my decision not to disclose was not an attempt to deceive the Council, but a genuine belief that circumstances I found myself in, would lead a reasonable person, to come to the same conclusion.” 
         
        
       
     16    The claimant submitted that this could be contrasted with paragraphs [9] and [10] in the opponent’s affidavit of 6 June 2000 in the Queensland Court of Appeal which I have already set out. 
      
       
     17    For my part, I would not accept the opponent’s statement that he had an honest and reasonable belief that the circumstances surrounding the finding of guilt by Dowse SM did not and would not have given rise to a question concerning his fitness to practise. If this was his belief it demonstrated a basic failure to appreciate the standards of behaviour required of a legal practitioner. 
      
       
     18    I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment in the Queensland Court of Appeal. I agree with them entirely. The evidence presented in this Court showed that the claimant was entitled to the declarations and orders sought which the Court has made. 
      
       
     19    POWELL JA: I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     20    HODGSON CJ in EQ: I agree with the judgment of Sheller JA.

      WEDNESDAY 2 MAY 2001 
        
      
      
      REGINA v. HAKIJA SINANOVIC 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   GREG JAMES, J: Application for bail has been made by Hakija Sinanovic who has made application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal comprising Wood, CJ. at CL., Hulme, J. and myself sitting on appeal from the conviction at his trial before His Honour Judge Maguire in the District Court of New South Wales. 
     2   The conviction was in respect of his dishonestly obtaining by deception a ring from a jeweller, Stephen Carturi. Mr. Sinanovic has been involved in a number of matters which went to the Court of Criminal Appeal and which were determined at about the same time. This matter, so I am informed, is the only matter in which he is still serving a non-parole period of a sentence passed upon him. It has been accepted that if the sentence were to be overturned no impediment to his release on parole would exist. It is also accepted that were an order to be made for his release on bail it would be open to him to be paroled to enjoy liberty in accordance with that order.  
     3   There is, however, another trial of Mr. Sinanovic on another offence, which is a re-trial in consequence of the Court of Criminal Appeal, similarly constituted, upholding an appeal at about the same time as it reached its decision to which I have referred on appeal from Maguire, DCJ. That matter is listed for re-trial on 14 May, about a fortnight away, but I am assured by the Crown that in the event that bail should be granted for the present matter there would be no objection to bail being granted to the appellant on that matter in consequence of my decision. 
     4   The special leave application, although filed, is not yet listed for hearing. That hearing is expected to take place in September or October. 
     5   Before me there is evidence from the applicant in particular of his belief as to the circumstances surrounding his conviction and in particular his belief concerning whether or not the ring said to have been obtained by him from the jeweller, was the same as a ring asserted to have been shown to have been pawned by him at the Aceben pawn shop. 
     6   Further, there is evidence before me that the applicant's counsel sought to obtain access to the ring the Crown contended was the relevant ring, for the purposes particularly of identification of that ring with the description given by the jeweller and the description noted on the pawn ticket and in the pawn records. There is some evidence concerning the correspondence of those descriptions and the prospect that they might be mistaken, but referring to the same ring, such as to exclude that possibility. 
     7   There is also before me the draft notice of appeal, the amended application for special leave to appeal, the summary of arguments for the special leave application, the trial judge's summing-up, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, certain of the exhibits and transcript at trial, particularly as relate to these questions, and a statement of the pawnbroker. 
     8   Written submissions have been filed on the bail application on behalf of the applicant and also by the Crown. I have heard short oral submissions from both counsel. It is contended on the applicant's part that the grounds of appeal which, in summary, include that the summing-up was not adequate, omitting entirely, or at least as being insufficient on, the question of putting before the jury the relevant evidence concerning which ring was which, with the consequence that the applicant's defence was not adequately put; and also included that the summing-up failed adequately to direct the jury on the elements of the offence and, in particular, on the necessity that the obtaining by dishonest deception.  
     9   It is submitted that the first matter would be likely to attract the attention of the High Court since the applicant was not professionally represented on the appeal and, so it is said, the Court of Criminal Appeal undertook to look for and find any errors at the trial and yet in their judgment made no mention of undertaking the task the applicant had been assured would be undertaken. It is said that an analysis of what was said in the summing-up on those matters of fact, therefore, is such as is more likely to attract the High Court because of what is asserted to be the lapse on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     10   As to the legal matters concerning the directions on the offence, it is put this matter is highly likely to attract the attention of the High Court since there has been famously a longstanding controversy as to the proper definition of the term ""dishonesty"" and the term ""deception"" as are applicable under the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900. Further, it is said that the verdict is unreasonable or unable to be supported by the evidence so that it could not be said that these points are merely hypothetical, and it is submitted in this regard, this is a proper vehicle for the High Court to determine the matters. 
     11   On the other hand it has been submitted on behalf of the Crown that an examination of the evidence at the trial and the summing-up shows that the trial judge dealt entirely adequately with all such matters as were raised, and that the question was fairly and squarely before the jury on the evidence as to whether the accused, at the time of obtaining the ring, was making a promise then known to him to be a promise he never intended to comply with, so that a finding that the ring was obtained dishonestly by deception was inevitable, given the evidence of which the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 
     12   It is submitted that in that context there is simply no room for the proposition that this is a matter that is likely to attract special leave or that the arguments put are more than barely arguable. 
     13   The Crown further drew my attention to the recent decision of McHugh, J. in Caratti v. The Queen (Vol. 22) 1 The Legal Reporter for 12 February 2001 in which, after reviewing such decisions as that of Dawson, J. in Peters v. The Queen (1996) 71 ALJR 309 and Hayne, J. in Parsons v. The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1325 his Honour held that a strong case needed to be made before the court could grant bail before special leave to appeal has been granted, on the basis that such a grant would interfere with the administration of the criminal justice in the States, which would require that a convicted person serve a sentence, unless that sentence might be set aside by a successful appeal. 
     14   In that case his Honour had observed that that applicant's grounds could not be regarded as hopeless and were certainly arguable, but that his Honour did not feel confident that special leave would inevitably be granted. McHugh, J's view is to be contrasted with the view of Dawson, J. in Peters (supra) to which McHugh, J. referred. In Peters (supra), as is apparent from the transcript provided to me by counsel for the applicant, his Honour was of the view that it would not have been at all surprising were special leave to be granted and the appeal upheld. It was on that basis that his Honour granted bail. 
     15   Particularly underlying both decisions was that in the first McHugh, J. was not satisfied that the sentence, or at least the custodial portion of it would be wholly or so substantially served that the grant of bail would not amount to an unwarranted interference, but Dawson, J. was of the view that so much of the sentence would be served if bail were not granted that the grant of special leave in its practical application by removing the necessity for the accused to serve the sentence, would be futile. 
     16   The criteria, however, in this State for an application made in this court, rather than an application made in the High Court, has been settled by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen v. Valevski [2000] NSWCCA 445 where the judgment of the court was delivered by Barr, J. Section 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 is applicable and that section requires that there be special or exceptional circumstances, such as would warrant the grant of bail. His Honour in Valevski (supra) referred to the numerous different statements of the content of that test in various cases in the court. 
     17   His Honour concluded that the s.30AA test did not differ from the common law test applied by the High Court in considering applications to that court for the grant of bail. It may be that the High Court might be, as has been suggested on occasion by Brennan, J. in the grant of bail in its inherent jurisdiction, limited to granting bail as a necessary incident to its entertaining of applications for special leave so as to ensure that they are not futile. 
     18   Nonetheless, in the application of the test the High Court adopts to achieve the object of avoiding applications for special leave being futile, it applies criteria which the Court of Criminal Appeal has accepted correspond with the criteria that have been applied in this court. Barr, J. in the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that there was no practical difference. The necessary test is one concerned with the existence of special or exceptional circumstances. 
     19   Those words permit many matters to be considered in an individual case. What is special or exceptional will, of course, by the very nature of the concept involved in those words, vary from case to case. But it is convenient to look to the criteria adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Valevski (supra) and derived from the approach of Callinan, J. in Marotta v. The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 265 at 267. 
     20   There, Callinan, J. identified 13 factors which he considered as applicable to that case as likely to disclose whether, in combination or individually, there were special or exceptional circumstances. In this matter the Crown has, in its written submissions and in oral argument, sought to apply those same criteria to this case. 
     21   In my view that is to over-sophisticate the circumstances in this case. Those that are contended for by Mr. Papayanni as being special or exceptional and as warranting the grant of bail, even though the question of special leave has not yet been considered by the High Court, are that there were the errors of law to which I have referred and that the grounds of appeal are so strongly arguable that his client would be unjustly deprived of his liberty were the application for bail to be refused. 
     22   I am not at all persuaded of those matters; indeed, I am of the view, having read the summing-up, the transcript and the matters to which Mr. Papayanni has taken me, that the points he seeks to make are not such as are highly likely or indeed even likely to result in a successful appeal. 
     23   There are no other special or exceptional circumstances which might bear upon the necessity for an immediate release of the applicant serving the sentence which stands good until or unless set aside by a competent Court of Appeal. Therefore, it is necessary for me to dismiss the application and I do.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1    FITZGERALD JA: On 17 June 1994, the applicant was arraigned on two counts of dishonestly obtaining money for himself by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. Pursuant to s 32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, he elected to be tried by a judge sitting without a jury. His trial took place before Karpin DCJ from 28 November to 1 December 1995. Her Honour convicted the appellant on both counts, which were stated in the following terms in the indictment: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) For that he on or about 18 August 1993 at Campsie, in the State of New South Wales, dishonestly obtained for himself $10,000 by deception, namely, by falsely representing to Denis Xenos that the said $10,000 would be invested in foreign currency and would be repaid in drachma to Denis Xenos within 3 to 4 days at the rate of about 210 drachmas for each Australian dollar when, to the knowledge of the said Hakija Sinonovic, it would not. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Further, for that he on or about 19 August 1993 at Campsie, in the State of New South Wales, dishonestly obtained for himself $53,200 by deception, namely, by falsely representing to Denis Zenos that the said $53,200 would be invested in foreign currency and would be repaid in drachma to Denis Xenos within 3 to 4 days at the rate of about 210 drachmas for each Australian dollar when, to the knowledge of the said Hakija Sinonovic, it would not.” 
        
       
      
    2    On 11 April 1996, the applicant was sentenced on the first count to imprisonment for 12 months to commence on 29 January 1996 and expire on 28 January 1997 and on the second count to imprisonment to commence on 29 January 1996 and expire on 28 March 1997. The additional term of imprisonment set by her Honour was 16 months to commence on 29 March 1997 and expire on 28 July 1998. The applicant has served the sentences imposed but is now in prison for other offences. 
     
      
    3    The applicant was represented before Karpin DCJ by different counsel at his trial and on his sentencing. He was not legally represented in this Court.  
     
      
    4    The applicant did not appeal against his conviction within the time prescribed by s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. At the hearing of these proceedings, an attempt was made to blame some unidentified and unidentifiable registry officer who it was said told the applicant’s wife to wait to appeal against his conviction until after he was sentenced. Although it was claimed that she acted on that advice, the applicant’s wife did not wait until after he was sentenced but lodged an application for an extension of time to appeal against conviction on 14 March 1996, about 2 ½ months out of time. His application for leave to appeal against sentence was lodged after he was sentenced on 11 April 1996. 
     
      
    5    These proceedings were listed for hearing on 12 December 1997, but the applicant was not ready to proceed. The prosecution submissions were filed about a fortnight prior to that date. The hearing in this Court took place on 8 September 2000. Lengthy written submissions were received from the applicant’s wife by facsimile on the previous day. Another submission was received from the applicant’s wife, also by facsimile, on the morning of the hearing.

    8    The documents sent by facsimile on 7 and 8 September contained extensive legal submissions on a variety of issues, with references to numerous cases. In addition, the “Authorities for the Appellant” were nominated as follows:

    9    When the proceedings came on for hearing in this Court on 8 September 2000, the applicant asked to be represented by his wife, who appeared in court a little later. The applicant’s wife said that she wished to represent him. When asked the reason, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, the appellant is unrepresented. I have been preparing this appeal, I have full knowledge of this appeal and it would be in the interests of justice, bearing in mind that the appellant cannot read or write in English and requires assistance. He has asked that I appear on his behalf to raise any matters in submissions for this appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        One other thing further. I have been granted leave by other courts and represented Mr Sinanovic in respect of his legal matters. The first leave was granted by the High Court, Brennan CJ, and from that moment on I’ve sought to grant leave of the courts and they have subsequently granted that leave. I do have full knowledge of all of Mr Sinanovic’s matters and I also have in my possession all the documentation in respect of this appeal at the moment. Thank you, your Honour.” 
        
       
       
      
    10    Over the prosecution’s objection, the Court granted the applicant’s wife leave to represent him subject to the withdrawal of that leave if the Court considered it appropriate to do so. In the course of the hearing, the applicant’s wife referred to him for instructions, which involved delays as they conversed in a foreign language. It was obvious that the applicant understood the submissions which his wife had been making and her discussions with members of the Court. Part-way through the hearing, with the applicant’s consent, his wife withdrew to let him “deal with it”. He did so without difficulty. Subsequently, after the applicant had concluded his submissions, his wife again addressed the Court, although perhaps not as comprehensively as she would have done if permitted to continue indefinitely. 
     
      
    11    Throughout the hearing in this Court, attempts were made to elicit details of the applicant’s generalised assertions in order to ascertain whether there was any substance in his appeal which, in summary, contends that there has been a miscarriage of justice because he was unfairly tried and wrongly convicted. 
     
      
    12    The prosecution case was that the complainant, Denis Zenos, was told by a Mr Smalios that the applicant had said that he could obtain Greek drachma at a highly favourable rate in exchange for Australian dollars. On 18 August 1993, in the course of a discussion at premises occupied by the applicant, he represented to the complainant that he could supply 210 Greek drachma per Australian dollar within a few days. The exchange rate at the time was approximately 162 drachma to the dollar. On the basis of the applicant’s representation, the complainant gave the applicant $10,000 in cash that day and a further sum of $53,200 in cash on the following day. 
     
      
    13    Between then and October 1993, when he complained to police, the complainant only obtained $12,800 drachma (equivalent to about $700) from the applicant. In the meantime, the applicant had given the complainant some Peruvian currency (which could not be converted into Australian currency in Australia) which the complainant returned to the applicant the following day, and, subsequently, some documents purporting to be cheques drawn on the Dirina Bank (Ex D), which the complainant also returned to the applicant on the following day. Correspondence exchanged between solicitors for the complainant and the applicant and statements made by the applicant to Detective Long in October 1993 contained unfulfilled assurances by the applicant that the complainant’s claim would be met. 
     
      
    14    The applicant gave evidence at his trial. According to that evidence and his assertions in this Court, he was told by the complainant that he had $70,000 to $90,000 to invest and he told the complainant that he believed that a profit could be made by investment in Peruvian currency. He did not receive any money from the complainant on the day when they first met or until after a series of meetings over a period of about 10 days. He and the complainant signed a contract relating to investment in Peruvian currency, written in the Italian language, at or after a meeting in a solicitor’s office. His wife then wrote the contract out in English and he and the complainant signed it. He gave the complainant Peruvian currency (as their contract recorded). The complainant owed the applicant “some $72,000” in addition to the money which he gave to the applicant - “over and above the $63,000 he paid [the applicant]”. The complainant’s son took the Peruvian currency illegally from Australia and banked it in the Philippines; and the Peruvian currency, or other currency into which it was converted, was used in the purchase of property for the complainant in Greece. 
     
      
    15    The applicant also said that he gave the complainant drachma, a ring and Canal Bank notes on the basis that they would be returned and that a ring which was tendered in evidence by the prosecution was not the ring which he had given to the complainant. He said that the prosecution evidence that there were discussions between him and the complainant about renting a property were incorrect - the discussions related to a purchase of the property. Further, when Detective Long spoke to him he threatened him and offered not to proceed with charges if the applicant paid him $100,000. 
     
      
    16    In this Court, the applicant’s complaints were to the following effect: 
     
      
       
      (a) The Director of Public Prosecutions had no power to prosecute the applicant and the District Court had no jurisdiction to try or convict him because the offences of which he was convicted involved “foreign currency”. 
       
       
      (b) The applicant could have been sued “civilly” and should not have been prosecuted. 
       
       
      (c) Bail conditions had restricted the applicant “from going overseas to obtain funds and evidence foreign required for his trial bearing in mind that the charges were foreign related not Australian”. 
       
       
      (d) Despite the applicant’s request, there was no Italian interpreter present at his trial; 
       
       
      (e) Amendments were made at the commencement of the trial to delete a reference to “investment” in the counts on which the applicant had been arraigned on 17 June 1994. 
       
       
      (f) The trial was not adjourned to enable the applicant to have earlier charges involving “foreign currency” (of which the prosecution was aware) determined first or to allow him to investigate, obtain and produce or subpoena additional evidence in answer to the present charges. The additional evidence which the applicant wished to produce related to (i) his transactions with the complainant, including their contract written in the Italian language; (ii) evidence and documentation relating to discussions at a solicitor’s office between the complainant and the applicant concerning their transactions; (iii) “activities that the Crown witnesses were involved in”; (iv) the complainant’s dealings with his relatives, from whom it was said that the complainant obtained all or part of the money which was the subject of the complainant’s second payment to the applicant; (v) the removal of foreign currency from Australia to the Philippines by the complainant’s son; (vi) the purchase of property in Greece by or on behalf of the complainant; and (vii) unspecified instructions which the appellant had given to four solicitors who, at different times, had written to the complainant on his behalf, each of whom he said had disobeyed his instructions. The applicant said that some of this additional evidence had been in the applicant’s possession at the time of his trial, namely a videotape of events within his study and “all the paperwork, … from the Direna Bank, Central Bank of Middle East and … other currency issue”. He had not used the evidence in answer to the present charges because, on counsel’s advice, he wished to use it first to defend other charges. He intended to use the evidence later to set aside his convictions on the present charges but, a few days after he was convicted, a “key witness” against him, apparently one “Terks”, stole the evidence from his car. Additional evidence which the applicant said he wished to obtain by subpoena included bank records of the complainant and his son, including records from the “Central Bank” of the Philippines.  
       
       
      (g) The prosecution adduced evidence, which had not been produced at the material committal hearing or notified to the applicant prior to his trial, which was prejudicial to the applicant in that it supported the prosecution case; namely: 
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) There were differences in detail between the complainant’s evidence at the trial and his evidence in a statement which he had earlier made (or perhaps at committal), and in particular his evidence at trial did not use the word “investment”. Further, Exhibit D was not the subject of the complainant’s evidence at the committal hearing a notice to the applicant prior to the trial. He had no opportunity to instruct his counsel in relation to those documents. A copy of Exhibit D, not the original, was admitted into evidence; the prosecution did not call an expert witness to prove that the applicant’s handwriting (or signature) was on Ex D. The applicant’s evidence at his trial was that he never gave Ex D to the complainant and it was “more than likely this evidence was fabricated or stolen or someone else had made up that evidence...”. A seemingly associated complaint was the “[t]hey said that I handed it to them and I said that they stole it from my study”. 
           
           
          (ii) Mr Smalios gave evidence of his relationship and dealings with the applicant, some of which was said to be irrelevant in that it did not “go to the elements of the charges” or “advance the Crown case”.  
          
         
        
       
       
      (h) Despite the applicant’s requests, the prosecution failed to prove, or to call expert evidence to prove the following matters which were essential to its case and/or which would have been helpful to the applicant’s case and were essential to a fair trial, namely: 
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the contract in the Italian language between the complainant and the applicant; 
           
           
          (ii) the source of the money which the complainant gave to the applicant and whether it was “from good clean origin”; 
           
           
          (iii) the bank records of the complainant and others whose bank records the applicant wished to have in evidence;  
           
           
          (iv) whether Peruvian currency (and perhaps Greek drachma) were “valid” currencies; 
           
           
          (v) the controls on the removal of foreign currency from Australia; 
           
           
          (vi) the documentation necessary to take foreign currency from Australia to the Philippines or that permission for the removal of the Peruvian currency had been given by the applicant as its owner;  
           
           
          (vii) that the complainant (and/or his son) took Peruvian currency to the Philippines (contrary to the controls on the removal of foreign currency from Australia); 
           
           
           
          (viii) that the complainant (and or his son) had used the money obtained in the Philippines with the foreign currency taken from Australia to buy property in Greece; 
           
           
          (ix) whether the Direna Bank and the “Central Bank of Middle East” existed. 
           
           
          (At times, some or all of these complaints related to “200,000 or 300,000 Peruvian currency” and at times to “gold coins $50 million worth”. Later, in another context, the applicant referred to other charges against him involving “6 million and $92 million”. It is possible that the large amounts referred to were merely exaggerated examples.) 
           
           
          (x) whether the complainant would have received 210 drachma per dollar “if not maybe more” if the Peruvian currency handed by the applicant to the complainant and returned to the applicant had been converted into Greek drachma (presumably outside Australia). An associated complaint appeared to be that a Reserve Bank official who gave evidence (i) lacked necessary expertise and/or (ii) did not give all the evidence which he should have given. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      (i) A statement by the arresting police officer, Detective Long, which had not been made and recorded as soon as it should have been, was read out in evidence.  
       
       
      (j) The prosecution failed to call the second police officer who was present when the applicant was arrested to corroborate the evidence of Detective Long.  
       
       
      (k) The prosecution failed to call evidence to explain its failure to produce items which had been tendered or referred to at the committal hearing, which were described as “a ring, gold coins, Greek bank notes and mobile telephones.” An associated allegation was that the prosecution had destroyed all or some of these items.  
       
       
      (l) “.. the Crown and defence counsel did not concentrate on the elements of the charges in question.” “The Crown’s questioning of the appellant was not of one to establish facts to support a finding so as to arrive at the truth but to engage in an improper manner of questioning, a fishing expedition, so forcing the appellant to say a wrong word and use it against him.” The example given by the applicant was that he was asked questions concerning statements which he had made at the committal hearing. 
       
       
      (m) All lawyers who represented the appellant at his trial and on his sentencing disobeyed his instructions and were incompetent. His trial counsel omitted to put to the complainant or other prosecution witnesses matters of which the applicant proposed, but was not permitted, to give evidence. A perusal of the three pages in the appeal record to which the Court’s attention was directed indicates that the objections were not formally ruled on but were otherwise resolved. 
       Another question recorded on one of the three pages was properly disallowed on another ground. 
       After submissions, the topic the subject of the first objection was proceeded with in the form of altered questions to the applicant. The topic the subject of the second objection had already been covered by the applicant’s evidence, which remained on the record. The third objection related to the tender of a document by the applicant. The tender was withdrawn, but the subject matter was covered by the applicant’s evidence. 
       
       
      (n) The trial judge was either biased or perceived to be biased. Her Honour had refused the applicant an adjournment on an another occasion, showed aggression at the trial, argued a lot with the applicant’s counsel, reprimanded him for “giggling” on one or two occasions during the complainant’s evidence, described him as “childish” although she later described him in her sentencing remarks as “experienced”, and “[f]rom the beginning didn’t want to believe [the applicant]”. In sentencing the applicant, her Honour described him or his behaviour as “bizarre”. The “best example” of the trial judge’s bias or perceived bias was “when she interrupt me to answer the full question”. 
       
      
    17    An additional complaint made by the applicant in relation to his sentences was that the trial judge had erroneously noted 13, not 14, months imprisonment on the warrant on the indictment and had subsequently amended the error in the absence of the applicant. 
     
      
    18    The trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence. It was plainly open to her Honour to do so and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that evidence that the applicant was guilty. 
     
      
    19    (a) The applicant was arraigned 17 months prior to the commencement of his trial and acknowledged that he had some months’ notice of the trial date. The amendment of the counts in the indictment at the beginning of the trial were not substantial and did not raise any new issue. The applicant had ample time in which to prepare, including to conduct investigations, obtain evidence and issue subpoenas. Although the conditions of his bail prevented him from leaving Australia, he was represented by a solicitor and barrister. 
     
      
       
      (b) No application was made to the trial judge for an interpreter or for the adjournment of the trial, or that her Honour decline to hear and determine the charges against the applicant. 
       
       
      (c) No objection was made to the prosecution evidence, which was opened early in the trial, to the prosecution’s omission to adduce other evidence, or to the cross-examination of the applicant. Further, some of the applicant’s complaints relate to steps taken by the prosecution which were the subject of agreement or concession. For example: 
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) No objection was taken to Mr Smalios’ evidence, which provided part of the context for the dealings between the complainant and the applicant. On the contrary, prior to Mr Smalios giving evidence, the prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel had agreed on what evidence from him was admissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) The applicant’s counsel stated at the trial that he had no objection to the corroborating police officer not being called. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) At the trial, the validity of the foreign currencies referred to was not disputed by the prosecution. 
          
         
        
       
      (d) None of the points raised by the applicant in this Court was raised at the trial. 
       
       
      (e) There is no basis for a suggestion that: 
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the applicant was hindered in his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses or the presentation of his defence; 
           
          (ii) the applicant’s trial was unfair in any respect; 
           
          (iii) the applicant was impermissibly deprived of a possibility of acquittal; 
           
          (iv) the applicant was incompetently defended; or 
           
          (v) the trial judge was biased or appeared to be biased. 
          
         
        
       
       
      (f) The amendment to the term of imprisonment noted on the warrant was a mechanical correction of a patent error to have the warrant coincide with the sentence imposed on the applicant according to the transcript. 
       
      
    20    Proceedings in which a variety of ridiculous assertions are combined with scandalous allegations against trial judges and unjustified criticism of legal representatives present special challenges. Time and resources are pointlessly wasted, and other cases delayed. Nonetheless, the Court must strive to discover whether there is any legitimate grievance buried in the morass.  
     
      
    21    I have undertaken that task, and am in no doubt that the applicant’s complaints are totally devoid of merit. It would be otiose to say more. 
     
      
    22    The applications for an extension of time to appeal against conviction and for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused. 
     
      
       
      
    23    NEWMAN J: This is an application for leave to appeal out of time against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    24    The applicant was tried before Karpin DCJ sitting alone on two counts of dishonestly obtaining money by deception pursuant to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum sentence prescribed by that subsection is five years imprisonment 
     
      
    25    An appropriate election for trial by judge alone pursuant to s 32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 had been completed by the applicant and the Crown. 
     
      
    26    In the event the applicant was convicted by her Honour and (while there was a dispute about the term) was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment on the first count and a head sentence of two years six months consisting of a minimum term of fourteen months and an additional term of sixteen months. The minimum term of fourteen months expired on 28 March 1997. Her Honour convicted the applicant on 1 December 1995. 
     
      
    27    Notice for application for extension of time was filed on 14 March 1996. Section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act requires notice of appeal to be filed within twenty-eight days of conviction - accordingly the need for the applicant to apply for leave to appeal out of time. In cases of extended delay this Court has held that to obtain leave an applicant must demonstrate that exceptional circumstances exist. See R v Lawrence (1981) NSWLR 122. 
     
      
    28    Where the delay is of a similar duration to that which existed here this Court, as a matter of practice, reviews the merits of the appeal in determining whether or not to grant leave. Should the applicant establish that the appeal is meritorious, that is, likely to succeed, then this Court, where the time delay factor is as here, will grant leave and allow the appeal. However, where the applicant is unable to demonstrate merit this Court will use its discretion to refuse leave. 
     
      
    29    I turn then to the Crown case. The Crown alleges that a Mr Xenos, a real estate agent, who had been told by a Mr. Smalios that the applicant could obtain Greek drachma at a highly favourable rate in exchange for Australian dollars, met the applicant at premises at Campsie occupied by the applicant and his family. In fact Mr Xenos had gone to those premises to collect a “To Let” sign which had been erected by him at a time when he was acting as agent for the owner of the premises. 
     
      
    30    In a discussion which ensued inside the premises the applicant claimed that he could obtain drachma at a rate of 210 to the Australian dollar for Mr Xenos. 
     
      
    31    Evidence was given by a senior foreign exchange executive of the Reserve Bank in the trial that at the relevant time, namely in August 1993, the exchange rate was 162.00 Greek drachma for an Australian dollar. 
     
      
    32    Xenos claimed that he gave the applicant $10,000 in cash on 18 August 1993 and on 19 August he gave the applicant a further sum of $53,200. Xenos stated that some days later the applicant gave him and his son a mobile telephone each, a ring and some Canal Bank notes. 
     
      
    33    Some days after that, at another meeting, the applicant gave Xenos Peruvian currency which he claimed was some 230,000 Peruvian currency units. 
     
      
    34    On the following day Xenos returned the Peruvian currency to the applicant who told him it was good he brought them back because they could not be exchanged in this country. 
     
      
    35    Thereafter Xenos sought to have his money returned which resulted in two further financial transactions occurring between the pair. The first involved the applicant in October 1993 giving Xenos documents which appeared to be cheques which were stamped Dirina Bank. Xenos returned these cheques to the applicant the next day. 
     
      
    36    In a further conversation the applicant in fact brought or gave Xenos 12,800 drachma which was equivalent to $A700. Thereafter Xenos engaged solicitors to recover his money and an exchange of letters occurred between Xenos’ solicitors and the applicant’s solicitors. 
     
      
    37    No return of either Xenos’ money in Australian dollars or in drachma occurred. 
     
      
    38    Again, in October 1993 following a complaint made by Xenos, a Det Long spoke to the applicant at his home. There the applicant agreed that Xenos had given him $63,200. A delay had occurred but Xenos would get his money within a couple of days. 
     
      
    39    The applicant in reply to the Crown case said that Xenos had told him when they met that he had between $70,000 and $90,000 Australian dollars to invest and that he, the applicant, had informed Xenos that he believed one could invest in Peruvian currency as a means of making a profit.  
     
      
    40    The applicant denied receiving money from Xenos on that day or the next day. He said that he had met with Xenos on a number of occasions over the next week and a half. In fact, his evidence was that those subsequent meetings were held in hotels, namely the Ritz Carlton or a hotel he described as the Park Gardens in Elizabeth Street. 
     
      
    41    Ultimately on 18 August 1993 the applicant claimed that a written agreement in Italian was signed by Xenos and the applicant which involved a transaction involving the exchange of Australian dollars into Peruvian currency. 
     
      
    42    He agreed that he had subsequently given Xenos drachma, a ring and the Canal Bank notes on the basis that they would be returned to the applicant. A ring which had been tendered in evidence by the Crown as being the subject ring was said by the applicant, in evidence, not to be that ring. He also denied stamping Dirina Bank on documents referred to earlier.  
     
      
    43    He claimed that when Det Long approached him he threatened him but said he would not proceed with charges if the applicant paid him $100,000. 
     
      
    44    Her Honour accepted the version given by Xenos and accordingly convicted the applicant. 
     
      
    45    At the appeal leave was granted to the applicant’s wife to appear. However, during the course of the hearing it became apparent to the court that she was dependent in making her submissions, on her husband for instructions. At that time the applicant himself took over the conduct of the appeal but later his wife was again given leave to make further submissions on his behalf. 
     
      
    46    The headings of grounds of appeal in written submissions prepared by his wife were these: 
     
      
       
       
      Denial of natural justice 
       
      Abuse of process 
       
      Unfair procedure 
       
      Denied a fair trial and committal proceedings 
       
      Prejudice and Discrimination 
       
      Miscarriage of justice 
       
      Unlawful arrest and procedures 
       
      Malicious prosecution with intent 
       
      Conspiracy and corruption 
       
      Abuse of human rights 
       
      Abuse of international laws 
       
      Ignorance of the laws, rules and regulations 
       
      Absence of factual evidence 
       
      Absence of expert evidence 
       
      No power to prosecute 
       
      No power from judge to listen 
       
      Crown conduct resulted in miscarriage of justice 
       
      Defence counsel conduct resulted in miscarriage of justice 
       
      Trial judge conduct resulted in miscarriage of justice 
       
      Perceived bias from trial judge towards appellant 
       
      Denied to exercise constitutional right to proceed with appeal before concluding sentence and parole 
       
      Wrongfully, illegally and unlawfully detained in custody 
       
       
      Despite diligent attempts by all members of the bench, it was extremely difficult to see how any of the matters sought to be put under each of these headings could relate to the trial. Such as could be in some way related showed no basis for concern. 
       
      
    47    I am of the view that no matter raised on behalf of the applicant is in any way meritorious. All submissions were, in my view, totally unarguable and I do not propose to deal with a myriad of unarguable propositions by dealing with them seriatim which would involve an otiose exercise in explaining the unarguable and dealing with such propositions with reference to law and logic. However, I believe it appropriate to demonstrate what I have just said by reference to two of the propositions advanced. 
     
      
    48    Let me say at once that these are not the most extreme examples of what I have described as unarguable propositions above. The first is an argument raised that this Court ought to admit into evidence a video recording which supports the evidence given by the applicant at the trial.  
     
      
    49    In written submissions dated 19 May 1997 signed by the applicant’s wife on his behalf the following statement occurs: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant had a ‘video’ of his study which showed all the ‘going-ons’. Before the trial the Crown was made aware of this video. The appellant was advised by counsel not to produce the video because of his other cases pending and that in the event he lost this case, this evidence would prove otherwise. The appellant lost the case.” 
        
       
      
    50    In later submissions dated 8 September 2000 that is the date of the hearing before this Court, a claim was made that the video recording and other papers had been stolen by a man named Terkes after conviction on 17 January 1996. Not only was the video stolen but other papers which were relevant to this appeal. 
     
      
    51    At a time when the applicant was conducting his own appeal he stated that the decision not to produce the video at the trial was his and not counsel and repeated that the material had been stolen after the trial was completed. 
     
      
    52    While, in these circumstances, the material could not in law, be considered as fresh evidence it should also be observed that the video was said to have been taken in the applicant’s study. 
     
      
    53    On the other hand in evidence at the trial the applicant deposed that the only meeting at his home between Xenos and himself was the first and the other meetings had occurred in hotels. 
     
      
    54    Additionally, of course, it was the applicant’s claim that the material had been stolen and thus could not be adduced as evidence before this Court in any event. 
     
      
    55    I should add that the applicant, when making submissions to this Court, appeared to be fluent in the English language and did not appear to have any difficulty in understanding matters raised with him by members of the court. 
     
      
    56    The second example involves a written submission made and taken up in oral argument by his wife that the letters written by certain of his solicitors in relation to the matter, were not written in accordance with his instructions. 
     
      
    57    The first of these letters dated 3 September 1993 challenged in a minor degree the amount claimed by Xenos and that the money would be returned to Xenos in approximately six to eight weeks. Reference was also made to a claim made by the applicant that he required the return of 124,000 Greek drachma, two mobile telephones and two sheets of uncut Canal Bank notes. 
     
      
    58    A second letter written by a different by a different firm of solicitors on 20 September 1993 adverts to the sum of $A63,200 being converted into Peruvian currency. 
     
      
    59    In a final letter written by the same firm who wrote on 20 September, a claim was made on the applicant’s behalf for the return of the property referred to in the letter written by the first solicitors, to which I have made reference, in exchange for a bank cheque. 
     
      
    60    The applicant, neither by way of oral or written submissions to this Court suggested what instructions he had in fact given. He placed no affidavit evidence before this Court or oral testimony to say what his instructions were. No oral or affidavit evidence was advanced by the applicant from the solicitors themselves - nor was there any suggestion that he had waived professional privilege in this regard. 
     
      
    61    As I have said these two examples are by no means the most extreme in terms of sustainability As I have indicated it would be an exercise in futility to deal with the others matters raised by the applicant or his wife.  
     
      
    62    I am thus of the view that as there is no merit in any matter raised the application for leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
    63    I turn then to the application for leave against sentence. No suggestion was raised on the applicant’s behalf that the sentence imposed was excessive. Having regard to the amount involved and the maximum penalty prescribed by s 178BA and the applicant’s prior record of false pretences this is hardly surprising. 
     
      
    64    What is raised is that on the warrant contained on the indictment the minimum term there recorded was thirteen months rather than the fourteen months which the applicant served.  
     
      
    65    There are two things which may be said about that submission. The first is that the transcript of her Honour’s remarks on sentence clearly indicate that she sentenced him to a minimum term of fourteen months in regard to the second count. The matter upon which the applicant relies involves a warrant contained on the indictment. The warrant contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “A minimum term of thirteen months to commence 29 January 1996 and to expire on 28 March 1997.” 
        
       
      
    66    That is a sentence of fourteen months. Plainly enough the written thirteen months is an error of transcription and the specified dates on the warrant indicate that her Honour did in fact, sentence the applicant to fourteen months. Thus there is no basis in the point raised on the applicant’s behalf. 
     
      
    67    Accordingly leave to appeal should also be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    68    GREG JAMES, J: The nature of the case at trial and the complaints made on appeal are explained in the judgments of Fitzgerald, JA. and Newman, J. which I have read in draft. 
     
      
    69    I gratefully adopt what their Honour's say in that respect. Although each adopts a slightly different approach to the substance of the appeal, they reach the same conclusions and for the same reasons, viz. that all grounds of appeal or complaint raised before us, or such as we, for ourselves, could find, were completely untenable and that therefore the applications for extension of time to appeal against conviction and for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused. I agree. 
     
      
    70    I also agree with the observations by Fitzgerald, JA. concerning the burden placed upon the court when an appeal is conducted in the way in which this has been. 
     
      
    71    I sympathise entirely with Newman, J.'s view that there were asserted ""a myriad of unarguable propositions"". 
     
      
    72    The applicability of s.18(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides that in the event of an unarguable or frivolous appeal the court may order that time in custody with special treatment should not count towards sentence, was not raised during the appeal. It is therefore inappropriate that consideration be given to it at this stage. However, this case does raise the prospect that in an appropriate case the court may need to give consideration to hearing argument on whether some such order as s.18(3) provides for should be made (see The Queen v. Costache (CCA, unreported 13 November 1990)).

      REGINA v Peter DERBIN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    MASON P: The appellant was indicted in the Supreme Court and tried before Ireland J and a jury. He was found guilty on charges of attempting to suffocate Maisie Derbin with intent to murder her and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Maisie Derbin with intent to do so. Maisie Derbin is the appellant’s mother. 
    2    There was little dispute as to the primary facts giving rise to the two related charges. The evidence of most witnesses was read from their statements. The only contested issue was the defence of mental illness. 
    3    The appellant lived with his mother and her father. At the time of the offences, 16 August 1997, the appellant was aged about 22 and his mother was 55. 
    4    The account of the facts given by Ireland J in his remarks on sentence was as follows: 
     
      
       
       At about 5.30pm on Saturday 16 August 1997 the victim, Maisie Derbin, who was then aged 55 years, returned from her regular employment in a retail department store at Warringah Mall, Brookvale, to her father’s home at 65 Gondola Road, Narrabeen, where she resided with her father and son the prisoner. 
       
      
      
       
       At about 6.30pm the prisoner arrived home from his employment as a storeman at a supermarket located at Warriewood Square, Mona Vale. The prisoner’s grandfather arrived home at about 7.30pm. The prisoner left the house and purchased fish and chips for the family’s evening meal. 
       
      
      
       
       At about 8.30pm the prisoner retired to his bedroom and began listening to taped music by the group known as “Metallica”. About 9.30pm the volume of the music was increased by the prisoner to the extent that his mother requested him to reduce it, as his grandfather was about to retire to bed. 
       
      
      
       
       Mrs Derbin tried to turn down the volume, but was restrained by the prisoner, who pushed her away. She fell onto the prisoner’s bed and was slapped a number of times by the prisoner with an open hand. Mrs Derbin also slapped the prisoner a couple of times before returning to her bedroom. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner’s grandfather twice requested the prisoner to turn down the music, which was playing at very high volume, which the prisoner finally did. The prisoner’s mother returned to her bedroom. Some ten to fifteen minutes later, the prisoner entered his mother’s bedroom where she was lying on her bed watching television. She described the events which followed in this way: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Peter rushed me from the doorway. The first thing I felt was Peter’s fist punching me in the face. He punched me a number of times. Peter stuck his fingers down my throat and tried to choke me. Peter was swearing at me through the entire attack. He said things like “you bitch, you whore” and so on. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I must have fallen off my bed. I remember hitting the floor. I tried to get away from Peter but he continued attacking me and punching me around the head. I remember calling out for help and calling for my father. He obviously couldn’t hear me. I was saying to Peter “I’m your mother, please don’t hurt me. Stop hitting me. Don’t kill me.”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Peter had his fingers in my eyes, he was pulling at them, he was gouging at them whilst I was trying to crawl away on the floor. He was sticking his fingers right in behind my eyes. Everything was black. I remember feeling extreme pain in my eyes whilst he was gouging at them. I was pleading with him to stop and not to kill me. I kept repeating that over and over again. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The next thing I remember is still being on the floor. I felt what seemed to be a pillow over my face. It was soft. Peter was pushing down on the pillow over my face. I don’t recall hearing Peter say anything. I couldn’t breathe. The pillow was suffocating me. That’s when I passed out. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         During the entire attack I was petrified. I have no doubt Peter was trying to kill me. I thought he was going to kill me. I was pleading with Peter to stop. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In the course of the assault one of the victim’s eyeballs was completely removed, and the other was displaced from the eye socket to the extent that it was no longer viable and required surgical removal. The force employed in the attempted suffocation of the victim was such that a number of her natural teeth were knocked out and her denture was broken. 
       
      
      
       
       In his video taped record of interview with investigating police officers the prisoner frankly admitted the offences and gave a version of the offences not dissimilar to that given by his mother. … 
       
      
      
       
       In his record of interview, the prisoner described the music he had been listening to as either a recording known as “No Remorse” or alternatively “Seek and Destroy”. He described being influenced by reading a comic-style magazine called “Heavy Metal” in which is depicted the gouging out of one individual’s eyes by another. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner in his record of interview mentioned on a number of occasions hearing “voices” in the sense of being from time to time influenced by them in his conduct, however, he did not describe his conduct on the night of the offences to any hallucinatory commands. He describes his relationship with his mother as “normal, pretty close” (A/A 132) and said that he had formed the intention to kill her “… about five minutes before, if that, two or three minutes”. 
       
      
      
       
       Prior to August 1997, the prisoner had received psychiatric treatment at Manly Hospital. The prescription drug “Anatensol” had been prescribed and used by the prisoner prior to the offences being committed, but he had not taken the medication in the recent past prior to the events of 16 August. 
       
      
      
       
       Following the assaults upon the victim, the prisoner gave an account of going to the refrigerator, obtaining orange juice which he drank and then of getting the keys of the car and silently, lest his grandfather should hear him, opening the door of the car. He decided that he would more easily be found by authorities if he were in a car, so he threw the keys into the bush. He also considered use of the car for the disposal of the body of the victim, whom he thought, at that time, to be dead. 
       
      
      
       
       After spending sometime sitting in a nearby park, the prisoner walked from Narrabeen to St Ives, caught a taxi to Chatswood and went by train to Central Railway Station. After spending two days in the vicinity of Central Railway, the prisoner caught the train intending to go to Brisbane. He left the train at Gosford and returned to Sydney and thereafter travelled to the Newcastle area where he was arrested on 10 September 1997. He described his movements as “… game of cat and mouse” played by him with police. 
       
      
      
       
      
    5    Leaving aside some relatively formal evidence given by two police officers, the only witnesses to give evidence before the jury were two consultant psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen called in the defence case and Dr Yvonne Skinner called in reply for the Crown. The two doctors had examined the appellant after his arrest. They had access to documents relating to his prior psychiatric history and had read the transcript of the appellant’s electronically recorded interview (ERISP) conducted on 10 September 1997. Dr Skinner had also viewed the video tape of that interview. 
    6    The two doctors were agreed that the appellant had suffered schizophrenia since about 1995. They accepted that the assault on the appellant’s mother was a consequence of that mental illness, albeit triggered on the night in question by a lethal cocktail of alcohol, cannabis and butane fume ingestion. Based upon the ERISP, the doctors were agreed that the appellant knew the nature and quality of what he was doing when he carried out the terrible assault upon his mother. However, each expert was also of the view that the appellant did not at the time know that what he was doing was wrong. Each doctor said in terms that he/she was of the opinion that the defence of mental illness according to the M’Naghten rules was made out. 
    7    The jury nevertheless rejected the defence of mental illness and convicted the appellant. 
    8    The notice of appeal raised two grounds of appeal: 
     
     1. The verdict is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. 
      
      
     2. The Crown failed to disclose a change of opinion by its psychiatrist until after the defence case had closed, thereby prejudicing the accused’s fair trial. 
      
    9    Issue was joined on these matters in the written submissions exchanged before the hearing. 
    10    Suffice it to say that the Crown submissions show that ground 2 had real difficulties in light of the way the trial was conducted. 
    11    Shortly prior to the hearing the Court, through the Registrar, drew the attention of counsel to s7(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Section 7 as a whole deals with the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal “in special cases” one of which is addressed in subs (4) as follows: 
     
      
       
       If, on any appeal, it appears to the court that, although the appellant committed the act or made the omission charged against the appellant, the appellant was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for the appellant’s action at the time when the act was done or omission made, the court may quash the conviction and sentence passed at the trial and order that the appellant be detained in strict custody in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law. 
       
      
      
       
      
    12    The leading authority in this State relating to the scope of s7(4) is R v Jenkins (1963) 64 SR(NSW) 20. The Court of Criminal Appeal comprised Herron CJ, Walsh J and Ferguson J. Each member of the Court delivered a separate judgment covering inter alia the scope of s7(4). Since however the Chief Justice and Ferguson J agreed with Walsh J as to the relevant principles, it is sufficient for present purposes to set out the key portion of the judgment of Walsh J (at 29): 
     
      
       
       In its terms, the provision appears to me to confer a power to examine the evidence and to act upon this Court’s view of that evidence in appropriate cases. It is not merely a provision which can be applied in cases in which the Court, if no such provision existed, would think it proper to order a new trial under the provisions of ss6 and 8. Although it is applicable in such cases, I think it can be applied also in cases in which the Court is not prepared to hold that, in accordance with the principles relating to the granting of new trials, the jury’s verdict was so perverse and unreasonable as to require it to be set aside. The jury’s verdict might not be unreasonable in that sense and yet the Court might consider that the evidence was so strong in favour of the view that the accused was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible according to law, that it ought to make the special order under s7(4). The condition of the exercise of the power, as expressed in the subsection, is that it appears to the Court that the accused was mentally ill. 
       
      
      
       
       But such cases as I have just described, as falling within the power conferred, will necessarily be of rare occurrence. For if the evidence, although strong in favour of the accused’s case, is yet such that a jury, acting reasonably, could fail to be satisfied that it was established, it will rarely happen than an appellate court, acting merely upon a transcript of evidence, will feel satisfied that a different view will be taken. The Court has not the benefit which the jury has of hearing the evidence as it is given and of seeing the witnesses and seeing the accused man himself. 
       
      
      
       
      
    13    See also Mizzi v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 659, R v Fleeton (1964) 64 SR(NSW) 72, R v Weise [1969] VR 953. 
    14    At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant based his case upon s7(4) and it was common ground that the Court should apply the principles stated by Walsh J in Jenkins. 
    15    It is therefore appropriate to look at the evidence that was before the jury in the trial on the issue of mental illness. 
    16    The appellant saw a doctor (Dr Martin) on 1 September 1997, some two weeks after the assault. He was prescribed Anatensol and Cogentin which would have helped somewhat to restore his mental balance by the time the ERISP was conducted on 10 September 1997. For that reason, both psychiatrists qualified the conclusions that they were prepared to draw from the ERISP material standing alone. 
    17    As indicated, an ERISP was conducted with the appellant on 10 September 1997, ie a little over three weeks after the assault. Some of the answers in the record of interview have a bearing upon the issue of mental illness. For example, in the answer to Q107 the appellant said:  
     
      
       
       OK. Well, I get a little paranoid sometimes from drugs and I, I seem to think that, you know, there’s voices around me, people trying to stop me doing what I’m doing and, you know, not so far as drug taking but I dunno. I’m like, I’m very paranoid about meself, well, the wellbeing of myself, and, you know, I, sometimes I just get a little, little sort of, I dunno, something sets me off. Like, you know, the door will be open during the night and I’ll wake up in bed and I’ll go, Oh, shit, shit, shit. If I don’t shut the door these guys are gunna, you know, just wreck me life or something, just to damage to me. So, you know, I shut the door and then I, and then I think, Oh, I shouldn’t have shut the door, you know, ‘cause they didn’t want the door shut. It’s really stupid. It’s, I dunno, I got to get help for it anyway, put it that way. I am on Anatensol. That makes it better. I don’t get the, I don’t get the impure thoughts that I get and, but, you know, I haven’t taken the Anatensol for a while. So that’s what got to me and I think it’s, when I was a baby I, my nan used to smoke a lot, really strong cigarettes, like the 16s and that. And I inhaled some of the smoke that, you know, was just naturally floating around the room and that’s how you can hear that wheezing in me throat. I dunno, must’ve, it must’ve clogged up a air vent or something in me lungs and it’s just, it mainly goes up through the throat. There’s like an air pocket there or something. 
       
      
      
    18    In the course of an answer in which the appellant said that he had actually killed his mother (A110) he said:  
     
      
       
       I think I got influenced by this magazine in me room. It’s called Heavy Metal. If you’ve ever seen that, there’s a guy in that pulls this guy’s eyes out in gaol. That’s when, that’s where the scene sets. He pulls this big guy’s eyes out with his hands. You know, if, I don’t think I would’ve read that magazine I probably wouldn’t have intention to kill. 
       
      
      
     Later he said (A118-119):  
      
       
       I just smacked her in the face a few times lightly. I sort of said, you know, You know what I’m doing here, don’t ya, and she sort of said, Huh? She freaked out. And then I said, Look, you always treat me like a prick, don’t ya? And she said, Huh? She, she couldn’t understand what I was trying to say to her. Like, it was my, it was me trying to say anything to me own, own reflection in the mirror. 
       
      
      
       
       Right. 
       
      
      
       
       Sort of like, you know, and I dunno, I just got the willies and sort of freaked out a bit and then that’s when I started choking her. 
       
      
      
     At A133 he referred to hearing voices which he thought may have been drug-induced, although he tried to keep them away while  
     “sort of doing drugs” 
     . 
      
    19    The appellant volunteered that he supposed that he had the intention to kill his mother (A134). He talked about what would happen if the door were left open and the voices were telling him to close the door. He had periods on and off medication. He had been in a mental hospital before, receiving treatment for paranoia. 
    20    Asked why he attacked his mother, he answered (A170): 
     
      
       
       Just, I dunno, sheer stupidity and paranoia I suppose. 
       
      
      
       
      
    21    Evidence from a psychiatric registrar of the East Wing of Manly District Hospital which was read to the jury established that the appellant had been an inpatient there on several occasions, including for a couple of weeks about one year before the assault on his mother. He had been admitted for a drug-induced delirium due to butane gas abuse. On that occasion he had cut the back of his wrist with a razor blade in response to hearing voices. He was given medication because of a history of schizophrenia and placed subject to a Community Treatment Order. It was a condition of that Order that the accused take specified medication. However, he told Dr Nielssen that he had stopped taking the medication when the order expired, with the result that he had not received antipsychotic medication for a year prior to the assault upon his mother. The psychotic symptoms had developed over six months before the assault and were particularly noticeable after he smoked marijuana or took other drugs. 
    22    Dr Nielssen examined the appellant after his arrest and after his admission to the Metropolitan Medical Transit Centre at Long Bay. He interviewed the appellant in custody on five occasions between October 1997 and April 1998. He took a history of the circumstances surrounding the assault that was consistent with the facts established at trial, but which included additional material as to the ingestion of cannabis, alcohol and inhaled butane in the period immediately preceding the assault. According to that history, the matters ingested “really set off the voices”. The extended history was recounted in Dr Nielssen’s evidence and was capable of being accepted as truth of the facts, although adduced through the medical witness (see R v Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364). It was not objected to when given nor challenged in cross-examination. The history was supplemented by the doctor’s examination of the appellant’s prior medical records. 
    23    Dr Nielssen formed the opinion that the assault took place during an acute exacerbation of chronic mental illness which occurred because of non-compliance with anti-psychotic medication and drug abuse. The recurring symptoms of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusional beliefs became acute as a result of intoxication, with its combination of cannabis, alcohol and the effects of inhaling butane. The precipitating event was the argument over how loud the appellant played his music. The actual reason for assaulting his mother was the delusional belief that his mother was responsible for his mental illness. The appellant experienced auditory hallucinations telling him to hurt his mother. 
    24    Dr Nielssen’s opinion was that the appellant was mentally ill at the time of the assault, suffering from a disease of the mind (undifferentiated schizophrenia) stemming from at least 1995. He said that the defect of reason in the appellant’s case was a delusional belief that his mother had caused him to become mentally ill, and also that the voices came from a Mafia-like gang. They were delusional beliefs. The defect of reason affected, his capacity to reason logically and calmly. His ability to reason was impaired by being acutely mentally ill. 
    25    Dr Nielssen said that he believed that the appellant knew what he was doing to his mother but that he was not aware that his actions were wrong, as he did not realize that his mother had done him no harm, and he was being urged on by the hallucinatory voices. As he was acutely psychotic at the time of the offence, exacerbated by his ingestion of drugs and alcohol, he was unable to reason with a degree of calmness as to whether his actions were wrong. 
    26    In cross-examination, the doctor said that there was no relevant difference between the psychotic symptoms of a drug-induced psychosis and chronic schizophrenia. The intoxication exacerbated the symptoms of mental illness that were already present. However, the appellant was psychotic before and at the time of the attack. 
    27    Dr Nielssen accepted in cross-examination that it was relevant to look at the appellant’s actions after the attack on the issue of his awareness of the wrongness of the assault. 
    28    The doctor believed that the appellant was acutely mentally ill at the time of his admission to gaol and that there were indications of mental illness in his interview with the police. He agreed that the ERISP showed the appellant acting rather calmly. Nevertheless, he adhered to his opinion, referring to other cases where persons who had committed acts were thereby shocked into a subsequent state of awareness of wrongdoing (Tr 83). 
    29    One point of difference between the two psychiatrists was their opinion as to the causal weight of the intoxication (from the three sources of alcohol, cannabis and butane) as a triggering factor in the psychotic episode of the attack. Dr Skinner’s evidence will be recounted below. Dr Nielssen agreed that the intoxicants had a triggering effect, but he attributed less causal potency than Dr Skinner. He gave as a reason the appellant’s clear memory of the assault and his capacity to give a fairly sequential account of it (Tr p91. See also Tr p96). 
    30    At one stage in his evidence, Dr Nielssen referred to the appellant as having been “acting on the instructions of command hallucinations” (Tr p91). Dr Skinner was present throughout Dr Nielssen’s evidence and her own evidence was therefore, in part, responsive to that of Dr Nielssen, at least in matters of detail. It is therefore significant that she too adopted the expression “command hallucinations” (see below). 
    31    At one stage, when pressed by the cross-examiner to agree that a person who is delusional and hearing voices may still know that what he is doing is wrong, Dr Nielssen replied (Tr p92): 
     
      
       
       They can know it is against the law but it is not wrong in accordance with the understanding of the world brought about by their delusions. 
       
      
      
     See also Tr p94. 
      
    32    Dr Nielssen adhered to his opinion that the appellant’s reason for attacking his mother was his delusional state and a response to his imaginary voices, these being the product of his underlying mental illness as exacerbated by the intoxicants consumed not long before the attack. On several occasions Dr Nielssen explained and defended the reliability of the history he had obtained and upon which in part he based his conclusions (see eg Tr p113). 
    33    Dr Nielssen’s evidence on the critical issue is summed up in the following (Tr p106):  
     
      
       
       Q: Is it fair to say this: that the opinion that you hold that the accused did not know what he was doing was wrong when he attacked his mother is based upon the accused then suffering from acute schizophrenia aggravated by consumption of alcohol, smoking of marijuana and inhalation of butane? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes, it is fair to say that. 
       
      
      
     Later, he explained that the appellant’s failure to take the medication prescribed for his medical condition was a further contributing factor (Tr p113). 
      
    34    Dr Skinner examined the appellant at Long Bay Gaol on 16 July 1998. She took a history and examined the appellant’s medical records. She had access to some of the witness statements and the transcript of the ERISP. The history given by the appellant was recorded in a report dated 17 July 1998 from which she gave much of her evidence in chief. Dr Skinner appears to have accepted the accuracy of the information she was given and which she recorded. 
    35    The history included the admission to the psychiatric ward at Manly Hospital in about 1995 after the appellant had slashed his left wrist with a razor. On another occasion he was admitted after suffering severe burns after standing under a very hot shower. He told the doctor that he believed that he had been commanded by the voices to hold his head under the shower. 
    36    The history included references to auditory hallucinations and the experiencing of the psychotic phenomena of thought insertion, thought withdrawal and ideas of reference. However, the most distressing symptom was the command hallucinations. He said, “they took over, controlled me”. He said that he felt that he must carry out the commands as directed to relieve his distress. 
    37    There were several incidents involving auditory hallucinations and the receipt of commands from voices. Such incidents were interspersed with periods of relative normality. When he did not take his medication he felt that he was in a disturbed mental state. 
    38    The history of the assault given to Dr Skinner was generally consistent with the other evidence. The appellant told her that he was still experiencing auditory hallucinations, voices commanding him to attack his mother. He said “I lashed out - to stop the voices”. He told her that he was also affected by marijuana. 
    39    In the “Discussion” section of her report of 17 July 1998 which was used as the basis of her initial evidence in chief, Dr Skinner referred to a significant history of substance abuse with at least two hospital admissions for the treatment of drug-induced delirium. Dr Skinner acknowledged that continuous abuse or repeated episodes of abuse of alcohol or other substances can cause altered mental states, including persisting auditory hallucinations. 
    40    Section 7 of Dr Skinner’s report was read to the jury. Dr Skinner said: 
     
      
       
       7.0  
       Opinion 
       
      
      
       
       7.1 Peter Anthony Derbin has a history of alcohol and drug abuse. It is probable that he has an underlying mental illness, schizophrenia. It is also possible that symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were caused by alcohol and substance abuse. If he does suffer an underlying mental illness, the symptoms were aggravated by substance abuse. 
       
      
      
       
       7.2 When he assaulted his mother Mr Derbin was affected by drugs, as he admits to heavy use of marijuana prior to the alleged offences. 
       
      
      
       
       7.3 It is difficult to understand how Mr Derbin was able to organise himself to evade police after assaulting his mother and how he was able to organise accommodation for himself and apply for social security benefits, if he remained drug-affected and/or in a psychotic state after the alleged assault. It is also surprising that he did not contact family members to ask about his mother. It appears that he made an effort to evade police and when arrested, he initially denied knowledge of the assault. 
       
      
      
       
       7.4 Other information would be useful in making a retrospective assessment of Mr Derbin’s mental state after the assault on his mother. The ERISP videotape should give some indication of his presentation at the time of his arrest. Prison medical records would show whether Mr Derbin was assessed by a member of the medical staff as suffering from mental illness or the effects of drug use. 
       
      
      
       
       7.5 In summary, I consider that Mr Derbin has a major problem of substance abuse (alcohol - binge drinking and marijuana and inhaled substance abuse) and that he was affected by marijuana at the time of the assault on his mother. I think that he suffers from underlying mental illness, schizophrenia. The incidents of serious self harm such as cutting his wrist and scalding his head and face in response to command hallucinations are consistent with mental illness and are not likely to have been caused only by drug abuse. 
       
      
      
       
       7.6 I believe that he has a defence of mental illness at the time of the assault on his mother, that he was responding to command hallucinations and was not fully aware of the implications of his actions. However, the effect of substance abuse (marijuana) was of primary importance in the commission of the offence. 
       
      
      
       
       7.7 He should continue with psychiatric treatment in the form of anti-psychotic medication. It is equally important that he should abstain from alcohol and drugs and that he receives drug counselling. I strongly recommend that any order made in future with respect to Mr Derbin should include a provision for drug and alcohol counselling and random drug/alcohol screens to ensure compliance. 
       
      
      
       
       7.8 Mr Derbin is fit to plead and to stand trial. 
       
      
      
    41    In her evidence in chief, Dr Skinner was then referred to additional material which she had taken into account after providing the report. She viewed the ERISP video and from watching it was able to determine that the appellant was calm and able to give a coherent account without stopping for long pauses or getting up to walk around. There were no signs of bizarre behaviour that might suggest that he had an acute psychotic illness (Tr p137). Referring to Dr Martin’s statement about the treatment he gave the appellant on 1 September 1997, Dr Skinner said that she would not expect an acute psychosis to settle as quickly as observed on the video on the medication prescribed by Dr Martin (Tr p137). 
    42    Dr Skinner also referred to prison records which she had subsequently examined, in particular the material recorded by the nurse who admitted the appellant to the prison hospital on the day of his arrest, 11 September 1997. At that stage it was recorded that there was “no evidence of psychotic phenomena occurring at present”. 
    43    From Dr Skinner’s examination of the Corrections Health Service records it appeared that the first report by the accused that he had been hearing voices in relation to the time of the attack was when he was interviewed by Dr Nielssen on 21 October 1997 (Dr Nielssen’s first consultation). 
    44    Dr Skinner was asked whether she took issue with any of the opinions expressed by Dr Nielssen. Her answer was (Tr p140): 
     
      
       
       A. Only - I think I am not sure about the actual reason for assaulting his mother, given by Dr Nielssen being a sudden realisation that his mother was responsible for causing his mental illness. I am not aware of him giving that history to any else, except Dr Nielssen, and it differs from the account he gave in the police interview.  
       
      
      
       
        Dr Nielssen said that Mr Derbin was acutely mentally ill at the time of his admission to gaol and there were indications that … he was mentally ill in his interview with the police. I don’t believe that there is any evidence for that statement, so I disagree because I don’t find any evidence for that. 
       
      
      
    45    Pressed to indicate whether there were any other matters, she said (ibid): 
     
      
       
       I suppose the difference is in the understanding of what might have brought on this terrible attack, which Dr Nielssen seems to believe was due to an acute relapse of chronic schizophrenia. Again, I am not - I don’t know of any evidence to really show that he was suffering from an acute episode of schizophrenia at that time and I believe, as I have set out in my report, there is much more evidence that the substance abuse was the significant problem. 
       
      
      
       
      
    46    In the course of developing this evidence, she expressed the view that the substance abuse was more important than the underlying mental condition which would have seemed, from the account she got of the appellant’s behaviour around that time, prior to and after the assault, to have been relatively stable (Tr 140). She thought that the more likely explanation for the terrible assault was that the appellant was affected by the substances he had taken that afternoon (Tr p141). The combination of those substances could lead to a psychotic episode causing auditory hallucinations. Immediately after making this point, the following evidence was given (Tr 142): 
     
      
       
       Q. So I understand clearly what you are saying, you accept, do you, on all the material available, that the accused does and has suffered from schizophrenia? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. May I, at this stage, take you back to your paragraph 7.6  
       [see par 40 above. The paragraph was read by the questioner.] 
        Doctor, in your opinion how significant in the commission of these offences was the consumption of alcohol, the smoking of marijuana and the inhalation of butane? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Well, I think it was of primary importance that it caused an acute psychosis, or certainly some kind of altered mental state, which accounts for this terrible assault. 
       
      
      
    47    In responding to ensuing questions, some of which elided legal and factual issues, Dr Skinner said in effect that, without the substances having been taken by the appellant, then the offence would probably not have occurred. For example, there was the following (Tr 143): 
     
      
       
       Q. Do you support the defence of mental illness if you have to put aside the effect of those substances on his mental processes at the time he committed the offences? 
       
      
      
       
       A. No. 
       
      
      
      
     It should be said at once that this was a highly irregular question both in its form and its substance. The proposition put implicitly to the doctor does not represent the law as I shall indicate below. 
      
    48    Dr Skinner then said that she believed that the Metallica song to which the appellant had been listening at the time (“Seek and Destroy”) and the cartoon he had looked at which showed someone ripping out another person’s eye lent: 
     
      
       
       more weight to the idea that the psychosis, or what ever mental state, might have been drug induced rather than caused by schizophrenia, … so, it seems to me that it is possible this has something to do with the mental state he was in at the time, affected by substances.  
       
      
      
    49    It may be observed that none of this evidence denied that the appellant was in a “mental state” such as psychosis at the time of the assault. Rather, the doctor was emphasising that the state was drug-induced. 
    50    This evidence was given towards the end of a day. At the beginning of the next day counsel for the accused sought the discharge of the jury. The submission and the responses to it occurred in the absence of the jury. His complaint was that the defence had been given only the written report of Dr Skinner. Counsel submitted that the witness had been led in the course of her examination in chief to a position where she reversed her opinion as to the availability of the defence of mental illness. The thrust of the complaint was the absence of prior disclosure of the doctor’s change of opinion. It was further submitted that the Crown ought to have put the substantial points of difference to Dr Nielssen in cross-examination. Counsel for the accused expressed the fear that Dr Skinner’s evidence, although it contained material to the accused’s advantage, supported “the Crown contention that this was a butane-induced assault, and nothing to do with a disease of the mind” (Tr p158). 
    51    Ireland J responded immediately by pointing out that the defence of mental illness would only be defeated if the Crown virtually eliminated schizophrenia and sheeted home the cause of the assault solely to the ingestion of the three elements. His Honour suggested that Dr Skinner had not yet had the opportunity to express her view on that matter (Tr pp158-9). Only if she did express such a view, would the complaint based on surprise have any substance. The Crown Prosecutor agreed that his Honour had identified the real issue in the case precisely and that there had been no change in the Crown position. He said (Tr pp159-60): 
     
      
       
       All that I have sought to do with each of the psychiatrists is to clarify the aspect of whether or not they are able to support the defence of mental illness if the law be, although I did not put it to them in this way as a matter of law, that the jury has to put aside the temporary effects of the three substances and has to look only at the schizophrenic state of mind. That is the matter upon which I seek clarification. 
       
      
      
    52    Counsel for the accused effectively withdrew the application for discharge of the jury. Dr Skinner and the jury returned to the Court. 
    53    The doctor was asked some questions about Dr Nielssen’s evidence to the effect that the appellant’s behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the assault was consistent with him having been acutely psychotic at the time of the assault. Dr Skinner distinguished between chronic schizophrenia and an acute psychotic state and she said that a person in the latter condition would be observed by most people to be functioning in an abnormal way. 
    54    After some further questioning in relation to matters raised by the jury, the Crown Prosecutor asked Dr Skinner to state her opinion in relation to certain conclusory matters (Tr pp165-6). Dr Skinner gave the opinion that at the time of the attack the accused was in an acute psychotic condition, the primary reason for which was the ingestion of drugs, particularly the butane gas. She said that in her opinion the appellant’s schizophrenia probably played a part in that psychotic condition. In other words that the psychotic condition was brought about by the combination of his schizophrenic state of mind and the effects of the substance abuse. 
    55    Dr Skinner was then asked to address the criteria that apply to the defence of mental illness. Examination in chief concluded as follows (Tr p166): 
     
      
       
       Q. I would like you to now address the criteria that applies to the defence of mental illness. At the time of the attack on his mother, was the accused labouring under a defect of reason? 
        
       A. Yes, I believe so. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Caused by disease of the mind? 
        
       A. Well, I believe that at the time of the assault on his mother the principal cause of his abnormal mental state was the drug ingestion; the effect of drugs. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But, in part, a disease of the mind? 
        
       A. In part a disease of the mind, schizophrenia. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. As not to know the nature and the quality of his act; in your opinion at the time of the attack, did the accused know the nature and quality of his act? 
        
       A. I think he was in quite abnormal state of mind, but was aware of what he was doing. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Or, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong, in the sense that ordinary people know right from wrong? 
        
       A. No, I don’t think he was able to reason that what he was doing was wrong. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Because, of the defect of reasoning caused, in part, by the disease of the mind? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Schizophrenia? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    56    In the cross-examination which followed Dr Skinner never resiled from this position, nor was she asked to do so. The cross-examination was essentially about matters of detail. 
    57    It may be observed that Dr Skinner repeated the history of “command hallucinations” (Tr pp167-8). She justified her conclusion about schizophrenia by reference to a number of matters, including the history given to her by the appellant, the Manly Hospital medical records and other matters. She said that the diagnosis of schizophrenia as an underlying mental illness was well founded, adding (Tr p169): 
     
      
       
       I tried to explain yesterday that substance abuse complicates the problem, because many of the symptoms and signs caused by substance abuse are also symptoms of schizophrenia. 
       
      
      
    58    Dr Skinner continued to debate with the cross-examiner the primacy of the substance abuse, in effect on the basis of assigning a priority in causal impact between the underlying mental illness and the substance abuse that triggered either the hospital admissions or the assault on the appellant’s mother (see eg Tr p170). But nowhere did she assert that substance abuse alone was the cause of the assault. She referred to the appellant’s “drug induced psychosis at the time of the attack” and described the drug as a “trigger” (Tr p174). 
    59    The cross-examination effectively concluded as follows (Tr p175): 
     
      
       
       Q. And in the light of all of those beliefs on your part, have you come to the opinion that he does have a defence of mental illness at the time of the assault on his mother? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes, I came to that view, however, considering that substances  
       (sic) 
        abuse was the primary cause. 
       
      
      
    60    Before addresses began, the Crown Prosecutor referred his Honour to the decision of Sholl J in  R v Meddings [1966] VR 306. The case was cited as authority for the proposition that a jury considering the issue of insanity or mental illness could have regard to the triggering effect of alcohol. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the gist of Dr Skinner’s evidence was that substance abuse was superimposed on top of the underlying schizophrenia, which induced the auditory hallucinations and that this led the accused to perpetrate the assault (Tr p180-1). His Honour remarked that, that being so, the chain of mental illness would appear to be established, leaving as always the factual question for the jury as to whether or not they believed that the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong. 
    61    In his summing up, Ireland J told the jury that the essential issue was the defence of mental illness and in particular the question whether the jury were satisfied by the accused that, at the time he assaulted his mother, he was disabled by disease and the mind from knowing what he was doing was wrong. The standard of proof was the balance of probabilities. 
    62    The jury were told that they were not bound to accept the evidence of the experts. This charge was repeated later in the summing up together with the admonition that the jury would not reject the evidence of the expert witnesses, particularly where they were in agreement, capriciously but for a reason (SU 31). 
    63    As required by s37 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, His Honour explained the legal and practical consequences of the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
    64    The evidence of the two psychiatrists was recounted at some length. The jury were reminded that Dr Nielssen had expressed the opinion that, in establishing the defence of mental illness, it was permissible to take into account the temporary effects of either alcohol, marijuana or butane in the underlying condition of schizophrenia. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       Now, members of the jury, that question is not really one for the doctor, it is a question for me to decide. As you have heard the Crown say, I have ruled that it is permissible to take into account the temporary effects of alcohol, marijuana and butane on the underlying condition of schizophrenia in considering the question of whether the accused, at the time of the assaults upon his mother, was suffering from a disease of the mind which adversely impacted upon his capacity of reasoning with a moderate degree of calmness as to whether his actions were wrong, but that is not to decide that question of whether he knew what he was doing was wrong, because that is a question for you and for your alone. 
       
      
      
       
       What I have ruled is merely that in considering that question, it is permissible to take into account the temporary effects of alcohol, marijuana and butane upon the mental disease of schizophrenia. 
       
      
      
       
       Your function, I repeat, is to decide whether, at the time he assaulted his mother, the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong. 
       
      
      
       
       Doctor Nielssen agreed, and I direct you as a matter of law, that if you were to find that the accused acted under the influence of alcohol, marijuana or butane, alone or in combination, uninfluenced by the underlying condition of schizophrenia, then the defence of mental illness is not available to him for the reason that it is common ground that the effect of those substances is a temporary effect which does not meet the test set out in the written directions I have given you. 
       
      
      
       
      
    65    In the course of referring to the evidence of Dr Skinner, the jury were reminded of Dr Skinner's view that if one were to set aside the effect of three substances, alcohol, cannabis and butane, the presence of the mental illness, schizophrenia, alone would not support a defence of mental illness. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       however, you will remember that I directed you that it is open to you to take into account the effect of those substances upon the underlying condition of schizophrenia. 
       
      
      
       
      
    66    The principal arguments of counsel were reiterated. 
    67    I pass over the arguments for the accused as recounted by his Honour. 
    68    As recorded, the Crown had emphasised that the critical issue was not a matter for the experts, but for the jury. The horrendous acts involved in the assault was said to be of such a nature that the accused must have known that he was doing wrong. The fact that he placed his hand over his mother's mouth to stop her scream and attracting the grandfather's attention was said to be an indication of sufficient realisation. Reliance was also placed upon the accused’s actions shortly after the assault: he went to the fridge and had an orange juice, he changed his mind about escaping by car and he played cat and mouse with the police in the days following the assault. The Crown relied upon the absence of agitated behaviour which would indicate an acute psychotic state as well as the good memory and precise recall of detail demonstrated in the ERISP. 
    69    The jury took considerable time to reach a verdict. There was a Black direction. Eventually, verdicts of guilty were returned on each count. 
    70    In R v Stones (1955) 56 SR(NSW) 25, the Court (Street CJ, Roper CJ in Eq and Herron J) said (at 29) that: 
     
      
       
       … insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged. The law takes no account of the cause of insanity. If actual insanity, permanent or temporary, in fact supervenes as the result of alcoholic excess, it furnishes as complete an answer to a criminal charge as insanity induced by any other cause. 
       
      
      
    71    Their Honours cited R v Davis (1881) 14 Cox CC 563 and Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard [1920] AC 479 at 500-1. 
    72    It does not matter to the criminal law whether the disease of the mind which produced a state of mind attracting the defence of mental illness is curable or incurable, temporary or permanent (The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 812 at 187-8, R v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399 at 407, R v Quick [1973] QB 910 at 918). 
    73    These principles are in no way inconsistent with authoritative statements such as that “disease in the M’Naghten formula is not used … with reference to a temporary inefficient working of the mind due only to such outside agencies as alcohol or drugs” (R v Carter [1959] VR 105 at 110 per Sholl J, emphasis added). In R v Meddings [1966] VR 306, Sholl J recognised that “mere transient causes such as alcohol alone … do not produce insanity within the meaning of the M’Naghton Rules” (emphasis added). But he held that, if a person has a disease of the mind predisposing to a particular condition, then for the purpose of the defence it did not matter whether the “trigger” was alcohol or a set of surrounding circumstances. 
    74    Applying the principles stated by Walsh J in Jenkins, I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that the appellant “was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for [his] action at the time when the act was done” (cf s7(4)). 
    75    This was the unchallenged joint opinion of the two psychiatrists. It was supported by the histories which they each obtained from the appellant and recounted in their evidence. While Dr Skinner remarked that “voices” were not mentioned in the ERISP, she (like Dr Nielssen) appeared to accept the truthfulness of the history of “command hallucinations”. The facts upon which the medical opinions were based were not disputed, in their essentials. The horrific nature of the assault also pointed in the same direction (cf R v Matheson [1958] 1 WLR 474). It is true that some of the appellant’s conduct during or following the assault showed deliberation, but “an abnormal mind is as capable of forming an intention and desire to kill as one that is normal” (id at 478). The critical issue was the extent to which the appellant’s illness affected his capacity “to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure” (Porter at 189-90). I am persuaded that such capacity was clouded to such a degree that the appellant would not know that what he was doing was wrong. 
    76    I recognise the need for caution in disregarding the verdict of the jury. Nevertheless, there are aspects of the trial which (taken with the matters recounted in the preceding paragraph) leave me comfortable in doing so: 
     
      
     (a) By their questions through the trial, some of which were put to the doctors, the jury appear to have shown an inordinate interest in the curability of the appellant’s schizophrenic condition (contrast  
     Porter 
      (1933) 35 CLR 182 at 187). 
      
     (b) The extended debate between the doctors as to whether the ERISP transcript and video evidenced mental illness 
       
     at the time of the arrest had the potential to mislead the jury away from the task of assessing mental illness at the time of the offence. The jury were reminded about this evidence in the summing up without a caution as to the limited relevance of that issue. 
      
     (c) The debate between the doctors as to the relative causal impact of the substances which triggered the psychotic attack was also potentially misleading in light of the relevant legal principles. True, the Crown emphatically agreed that Dr Skinner’s evidence on this matter did not challenge her conclusions about mental illness, but this occurred in the absence of the jury. The jury may have been left with the idea that Dr Skinner had reservations about whether there was or even should have been an available defence of mental illness. 
      
     (d) Some of the questions put to the psychiatrists, especially Dr Skinner, appeared to infer that there was an element of discretion involved in accepting or rejecting the defence of mental illness (see par 47 above). The jury may have got the same impression from the directions in the summing up that it was “permissible” to take into account the temporary effects of alcohol, marijuana and butane. They were (correctly) told that if the ingested substances  
     alone 
      caused the accused to act as he did, then the defence of mental illness was not available. But neither expert suggested this possibility. In light of the unfortunate digressions in Dr Skinner’s evidence, there should in my view have been a forceful direction along the lines of the principle stated in the passage from  
     Stones 
      set out at par 70 above. 
      
    77    For these reasons, I propose the following orders: 
     
     1. Quash the convictions and sentences passed at trial. 
      
      
     2. Order that the appellant be detained in strict custody in the manner required under s39 of the  
     Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      in a secure prison psychiatric facility until released by due process of law. 
      
    78    LEVINE J: I have read the learned President’s judgment in draft. I agree with the orders he proposes and his reasons therefor. 
    79    GREG JAMES J: I agree with the President.

      REGINA v Brett Francis PLUMMER 
      
      
    1   FITZGERALD JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    2   SMART AJ: Brett Francis Plummer appeals against his conviction and sentence on the charge of supplying heroin between 2 and 19 September 1996. He also seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences for escaping from lawful custody on 6 March 1997 and break, entering and stealing at a home unit at Lakemba on 23 December 1997. The applicant contends that the total sentence he received was too severe. 
    3   On the charge of supplying heroin the judge took into account 3 further offences, namely, on 29 August 1996 supplying heroin, on 23 December 1997 possessing housebreaking implements and on 23 December 1997 breaking, entering and stealing at another home unit at Lakemba. 
    4   It appears that the applicant was in custody from 6 January 1994 until 1 May 1996 and from 2 October 1996 until his escape on 6 March 1997. The Parole Board required the applicant to serve the balance of his period on parole because of a breach of parole. 
    5   Because of his escape and being at large for 293 days and the sentences for other lesser offences imposed on 18 August 1998 the judge, acting on the calculations provided by the Department of Corrective Services determined that the earliest date on which the applicant would have been released from prison in respect to other sentences was 17 October 1998. Accordingly, the judge chose 18 October 1998 as the starting date for further sentences. 
    6   On the escape lawful custody offence the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 18 October 1998 and expiring on 17 October 2000. As to each of the offences of supply prohibited drug and break, enter and steal, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of two and half years commencing on 18 October 2000 and expiring on 17 April 2003 with an additional term of three and a half years commencing on 18 April 2003. These sentences were imposed on 20 July 1999. 
    7   The grounds of appeal and the submissions in support of the appeal are extensive and discursive. In essence the appellant is seeking leave to withdraw his plea of guilty to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug, the quashing of that conviction and an order for a new trial. He also seeks to be resentenced in respect of other sentences imposed by the judge. 
    8   In his affidavit of 3 July 2000 the appellant has set out his account of the history of these charges since his arrest (and recapture) on 23 December 1997. In early January 1998 he instructed his solicitor to plead guilty to two charges of break, enter and steal, one charge of escape lawful custody and three lesser charges and not guilty to supplying a prohibited drug, namely, heroin. On 6 March 1998 pleas to this effect were entered at Burwood Local Court. After some seemingly unsatisfactory legal representation the appellant was committed for trial on the supply charge on 18 August 1998 with the arraignment to take place on 25 September 1998. On the matters of break, enter and steal and escape he was committed for sentence to the District court on 25 September 1998. The other lesser matters had been dealt with by the magistrate. 
    9   The District Court fixed a trial date of 8 February 1999 for the supply charge. Sentencing on the other matters for which he had been committed for sentence was adjourned until 8 February 1999. 
    10   It seems that there was a legal point requiring consideration as to the supply charge. The appellant had not in fact supplied any heroin but he had offered to supply heroin according to the Crown and there was supporting evidence to that effect. 
    11   According to the appellant, on 8 February 1999 he was introduced to a barrister who stated that he had been through the Crown brief, that the appellant would be found guilty and that it would be a waste of time pleading not guilty. There was no point of law on which he could rely successfully. The barrister stated that he would still represent the appellant if he continued with his plea of not guilty. The appellant replied that he wished to speak to his solicitor (then Mr Baird). A conference took place a little later that morning. 
    12   The appellant stated that Mr Baird returned and informed the appellant that he was going to talk to the prosecutor and see if something could be worked out. It is not necessary to recount in detail all that took place on 8 February 1999. It appears that discussions took place between the appellant’s legal representatives and the Crown representatives as to the charges to be preferred and the matters to be placed on a schedule to be taken into account and the length of sentence which would be appropriate. The appellant stated that on Mr Baird’s return from talking to the prosecutor Mr Baird said that he had made a deal with the prosecution and that if the appellant pleaded guilty he would not get any longer than three years in gaol with backdating to the date of his being back into custody. The appellant stated that Mr Baird told him that he (Baird) hoped to be able to secure a lesser sentence. 
    13   The appellant contended that he only agreed to plead guilty when he was told by Mr Baird that at the most he would receive a total sentence (period in gaol) of no more than 3 years with the sentence being back-dated to 23 December 1997 being the date on which the appellant was recaptured. He had confirmed with Mr Baird that nothing could go wrong. 
    14   Mr Baird stated that, after counsel had advised that there was no legal point available on which the appellant could succeed, the appellant agreed to plead guilty. Mr Baird insisted that it was after this decision was made that discussions took place as to the likely sentence. 
    15   Mr Baird stated that he and counsel thought and told the appellant that he should expect to serve about three years in gaol with the sentence being backdated to when he went back into custody on 23 December 1997 so he would have a further 18 months to serve. He asserted that all he did was to give the appellant his best opinion. He stated that he did tell the appellant that he had discussed the question of sentence with the Crown representatives and that they thought that the appropriate sentence would be about 3 years in gaol. No agreement was made with the Crown and he never told the appellant that an agreement had been made with the Crown. 
    16   Mr Baird asserted that at no stage was the question of length of sentence raised with the judge and that he did not suggest to the appellant that the judge was in agreement with the views of the representatives of the appellant and the Crown. 
    17   The appellant was indicted later on 8 February 1999 and entered the plea of guilty to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug. There was consternation on the part of the appellant’s family and the appellant that he had entered a plea of guilty to the supply charge. 
    18   Within a short period, namely, on 16 February 1999 the appellant completed a statutory declaration stating inter alia that he was supposed to go to trial on 8 February 1999, that he was told by his solicitor that it would be better to plead guilty and so receive a lesser sentence and that he had spoken to the prosecutor about this. He asserted that he wished to plead not guilty. The appellant did not bring the contents of the statutory declaration to the notice of the Crown, the court or his legal advisers prior to sentencing. 
    19   The matter was listed before the sentencing judge on a number of occasions before the substantive sentence hearing took place on 8 July 1999. On that date a fresh indictment was preferred there having been discussions between the legal representatives of the Crown and the appellant.  
    20   The judge explained the fresh indictment to the appellant and the changes which had taken place. The judge confirmed with the appellant that he was charged firstly with supplying a prohibited drug between 2 and 19 September 1996, the break, enter and stealing offence of 23 December 1997 and escaping from lawful custody on 6 March 1997. As to each charge, the judge specifically asked the appellant if he understood the charge. 
    21   The appellant replied that he did and confirmed that he was pleading guilty to each charge. The judge then specifically referred to each of the offences which the court was being asked to take into account and the appellant confirmed that he was guilty of each of those offences. The appellant said nothing to the judge about wishing to plead not guilty to the supply offence at any stage between 8 February 1999 and the imposition of the sentences on 20 July 1999. 
    22   The appellant explained that he did not say anything to the judge about not wishing to plead guilty to the supply charge because he assumed that the judge was aware of the accommodation arrived at between the party’s legal representatives and approved of it. 
    23   The version of events given by Mr Baird is much to be preferred. It is highly improbable that Mr Baird would have given the appellant any guarantee as to the maximum sentence he would receive. Mr Baird did, however, express his opinion as to what that sentence was likely to be. Mr Baird regarded the sentences imposed as excessive. The appellant has elevated Mr Baird’s expression of opinion into a guarantee that he would not receive, at the worst, more than 3 years in gaol probably with backdating to 23 December 1997. 
    24   Sometime after the entry of the plea the appellant again spoke with his barrister who spoke of years in gaol. The barrister seemed to know nothing of the accommodation between the parties’ legal representatives. 
    25   It is not a permissible ground of appeal to this court for an accused to seek to withdraw his plea of guilty on the basis that his legal representatives underestimated the length of sentence which the accused would receive. 
    26   This court only allows pleas of guilty to be withdrawn where there has been a miscarriage of justice. That miscarriage may take many forms. Some examples are to be found in R v Liberti, 1991, 55 A Crim R, 120 and R v Boag 1994, 73 A Crim R, 35. There was no miscarriage in the present case. 
    27   Leave should be refused to the appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty to the supply charge. It should be recorded that the appellant was unable to advise this court of a legitimate basis on which he could be acquitted of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. The Crown case appeared to be a strong one and the appellant had no valid defence. 
    28   It was the appellant’s case before the sentencing judge that he was never in a position to supply a large quantity of heroin to the police under cover operative. That appeared to be so. Indeed, he failed to supply the large quantity which he promised. The appellant was dealt with upon the basis of offering to supply heroin. The indictment did not refer to either a trafficable or commercial quantity of heroin and the appellant has to be dealt with on a lesser basis. Fortunately, all the property taken from the Lakemba unit has been recovered. 
    29   The appellant relied upon the lengthy periods he had been in gaol to date and those he would spend in gaol, namely: 
    30   (a) 6 January 1994 - 1 May 1996; 
    31   (b) 2 October 1996 - 6 March 1997; 
    32   (c) 23 December 1997 - 17 April 2003. 
    33   Thus if the present sentences stand he will spend some seven and half years out of nine years in gaol and some five and three quarter years out of six and a half years (2 October 1996 - 17 April 2003) in gaol. There is then the additional term of three and a half years. The appellant relied strongly on the principle of totality. 
    34   The offences involved were serious. It is not known how the appellant escaped but he did remain at large for 293 days and further offences were committed while he was at large. He was also on parole in September 1996. The appellant has a poor record extending back to 1981. He was born on 11 February 1966 and has spent a substantial part of his life in gaol. The judge recorded that the pleas of guilty had saved the expense of a trial but observed that the appellant had little or no alternative but to plead guilty. The judge emphasised the importance of deterrence. 
    35   The judge recorded that the appellant was on protection in prison and held that he would need appropriate supervision after his release from prison to establish himself and increased the additional term to three and half years. Mr A Ferrier, a consultant psychologist reported: 
     
      
       
       “Brett’s heavy long term use of heroin has not allowed him to gain adequate coping skills to help him deal with the stressors and demands of daily community life. He exhibits high levels of anxiety and shows many of the physiological and psychological components of an anxious personality. Brett will need to learn to develop other ways of managing his anxious feelings, rather than returning to heroin. 
       
      
      
       
       Brett now sees himself as being older than the general age of prisoners and he is no longer gaining peer acceptance and reverence for his criminal activities. He is keen to attempt a law abiding lifestyle again. 
       
      
      
       
       Brett is no longer receiving positive reinforcement such as being revered for criminal activities from his peers. Consequently, a large motivating force to engage in criminal activity has been taken away from him. Brett understands this and is subsequently motivated to address his chemical abusing and offending behaviour. Hence, whilst in prison Brett may benefit from contact with Drug and Alcohol services, as well as psychological services. Psychological services within corrections may be able to offer Brett coping strategies for managing his chronic anxiety. 
       
      
      
       
       When released into the community, he will need strict supervisory conditions imposed by Probation and Parole. Attendance at an anxiety management clinic such as the Bankstown Clinic for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress could be part of such conditions. Brett has said he is keen to attend such a clinic and develop the necessary coping skills that have thus far alluded him. 
       
      
      
       
       Brett also needs continuing supervision and management regarding his heroin abuse.” 
        
       
      
    36   Given the appellant’s past behaviour, a cautious attitude must be taken to the prospects of rehabilitation. The judge was right to hold that the appellant would need extended supervision and that there were special circumstances. 
    37   Taking into account the appellant’s pleas of guilty and allowing a discount therefor and applying the principles of totality to the lengthy periods which the applicant has to spend in gaol I am of the opinion that the sentences imposed were excessive and that in the light of that principle they require modification. The new sentences should be imposed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
    38   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
     (a) Leave to withdraw the plea of guilty to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug refused; 
      
      
     (b) Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
      
      
     (c) Leave to appeal against sentence granted; 
      
      
     (d) In lieu of the sentences imposed the appellant is sentenced thus: 
      
      
      
       
       (i) On the charge of escaping from lawful custody a fixed term of eighteen months starting on 18 October 1998 and ending on 17 April 2000. 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) On the charge of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) and taking into account three further offences (supplying heroin, possessing housebreaking implements and stealing) the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for five years starting on 18 April 2000 with a non parole period of 2 years starting that day and ending on 17 April 2002. 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) On the charge of break, entering and stealing the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months starting on 18 April 2000 to be served concurrently with the sentence for supplying a prohibited drug. 
       
      
      
     The fixed terms are imposed because of the several sentences. 
      
    39   IRELAND AJ: I agree with Smart AJ for the reasons given by his Honour.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     NEWMAN J: I will ask Sperling J to deliver the first judgment in this matter. 
      
       
      
     2     
     SPERLING J: On 10 December 1999, the applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for a period of one year and six months commencing on 10 December 1999, consisting of a minimum term of one year and an additional term of six months, on a charge of stealing from the person. The offence occurred on 12 October 1998.  
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant was as at 12 October 1998 eighteen years of age and he was on probation under the supervision of the Juvenile Justice Office, following three stealing matters dealt with in the Children’s Court.  
      
       
      
     4     
     The sentencing judge took into account two further offences which occurred between 12 October 1998 and 10 December 1999. On 2 March 1999, the applicant stole a wallet containing $25 and various cards. On 13 August 1999, he was living in a youth refuge and assaulted another person residing there occasioning actual bodily harm. The charge apparently arose out of an altercation in which the applicant was also injured.  
      
       
      
     5     
     In relation to the offence committed on 12 October 1998, the applicant was initially charged with robbery in company to which he pleaded not guilty. However, the Crown subsequently amended the indictment to steal from the person to which the applicant pleaded guilty.  
      
       
      
     6     
     Having been remanded on bail to appear for sentence on 2 September 1998 before a District Court judge, it transpired that the judge was part-heard in a trial that day and the applicant’s solicitor also wanted to explore the possibility of obtaining medical evidence. The sentence hearing was adjourned and a further condition was imposed on the applicant in relation to bail, namely, that he not only report to the Probation Service but that he obey the direction of the Service throughout the period of the adjournment.  
      
       
      
     7     
     During the discussion which took place on that occasion, there was mention of a Griffith remand but, as I read the transcript, this was not mentioned in the sense that, if the applicant complied with his bail conditions, a non-custodial sentence would be imposed. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In the course of discussion his Honour also said, “If he does not comply with those conditions” - referring to the bail conditions. This was not a promise that, if the applicant did comply with the bail conditions, he would not go to gaol. I take the judge to have said only that, if he did not comply with the bail conditions, he would go to gaol pending trial, which is no more than the usual consequence of breaching bail conditions. 
      
       
      
     9     
     There were three reports from the Probation and Parole Service, dated 28 July, 2 September and 10 December 1999. The first two of these were entirely negative and they suggested no alternative to a custodial sentence. The report of 10 December 1999, however, was in a very different tone. It was reported that the applicant had made substantial positive changes during the adjournment period. He had been residing with his mother and step-father, subject to spending a large amount of time with his girlfriend of some four years standing. At his own initiative, he had obtained employment in the building industry. He had taken part in a six week job training programme which would lead to an apprenticeship. He appeared to be committed to pursuing employment in the building industry and increasing his bricklaying skills. There had been substantial improvement in his reliability in relation to reporting. He had attended all his appointment and had maintained telephone contact with his parole officer. There had been positive and sustained changes in his behaviour and attitude and, in the opinion of the author of the report, the potentiality of employment had given him purpose. As to the sentencing options, the court was informed that the applicant could benefit from a period of supervised recognizance, and he was assessed as suitable for a community service order and, also, as suitable for a sentence of periodic detention.  
      
       
      
     10     
     Following the offence on 12 October 1998, there was a further offence of a similar kind, namely, on 2 March 1999. The offence of 13 August 1999 was of a different character and not of the same significance, particularly in the case of a young male. The applicant had not come to police attention during the period of the adjournment from 2 September 1999 to 10 December 1999.  
      
       
      
     11     
     The sentencing judge took a serious view of the offence committed on 12 October 1998, particularly since the applicant was on probation at the time and because of the recurrence of similar behaviour on 2 March 1999. A serious view was unavoidable. His Honour went on to say, “I need a little bit more than the faith of the Probation Officer to deter me in imposing full time custody.”  
      
       
      
     12     
     The principal ground of appeal advanced on behalf of the applicant is that the sentencing judge created in the applicant an expectation that, if he complied with his bail conditions during the adjournment between September and December 1999, a non-custodial sentence would be imposed, and that the applicant now has a justifiable sense of grievance, having received a custodial sentence notwithstanding compliance with his bail conditions. For the reasons I have given, I think this puts the point too high. If there was such an expectation created by what the sentencing judge said, it was not, in my view, a justified expectation. 
      
       
      
     13     
     However, there is a question as to whether, in the circumstances, the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
      
       
      
     14     
     In this regard, reference has been made to the alternative of summary dismissal of the charge which was made against the applicant. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in  
     Regina v. Crombie 
      (1999) NSWCCA 297.  
      which appears to lend some support to the approach that it is relevant to take into account the lower range of sentencing available in the Local Court in relation to an offence which could be tried summarily. I must say, for myself, that I have considerable doubt as to whether that is the correct approach and I note that that was the decision of a bench comprised of two judges of the court rather than three. However, it does not seem to me to be appropriate, on the present occasion, constituted again as the court is by two judges only, that there should be any review of a matter of principle such as that. Fortuitously, I think this is a case in which the question of a lower maximum penalty in the Local Court does not arise with any level of significance.  
      
       
      
     15     
     When one takes a broad view of the case, it seems to me that, giving appropriate weight to the offence charged and the offences taken into account, and having regard to subjective considerations, including the applicant's age and his change in behaviour, particularly during the period September to December 1999, the sentence imposed was too severe and manifestly so.  
      
       
      
     16     
     The sentence should, in my view, be set aside. In re-sentencing the applicant, regard is to be had to the affidavits of his mother and step-father which corroborate much of what is said in the last of the probation reports. They add to the impression that the applicant has turned over a new leaf.  
      
       
      
     17     
     I would regard the period served in custody to date as adequate punishment in the circumstances of the case. I would substitute a fixed term of penal servitude commencing on 10 December 1999 and expiring at 12 o’clock today. 
      
       
      
     18     
     NEWMAN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as pronounced by Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     19     
     That means you will be released in about three minutes but there are some formalities to go through; so you will have to go back to the cells with the officers, but you will not be there for very long.

     REGINA v HMB 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   MEAGHER JA: In this appeal the situation is that on 15 June 1999 the appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of robbery with violence. On the following day the jury found him guilty.2   On 24 August 1999 his Honour Judge Garling sentenced him to three and a half years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of eighteen months to commence on 16 June 1999 and to expire on 17 December 2000.3   The Crown case involved a robbery and assault which took place at the Mobil Service Station, East Nowra, at about 11.00 pm on 5 July 1998. On the Crown case there were allegedly three people involved - Mr B, another male and a female. The console operator at the service station, Mr Kenneth Ingliss, initially saw what he described as two Koori males talking outside number one petrol bowser. He could not hear what they said. He said he had a good opportunity to look at them because they were in a well-lit area. He looked away from them to check cigarette packs and when he looked back they were gone. He had them in view for about thirty seconds.4   He said the smaller one was wearing a beanie and track pants. About a minute or a minute and a half later the larger of the two males came through the door. He raised an axe above his head and said, ""Give me your fucking money."" Mr Ingliss said, ""No"" and swerved back and the larger man swung the axe at him. The man then swung the axe at the cigarette cabinet and swung it again at Mr Ingliss, who picked up a chair to defend himself.5   The girl came in through the door and Mr Ingliss pushed her away. He heard another voice from the door saying, ""Just give him the fucking money."" 6   He felt something hit him on his head and then the axe hit him on his arm and took off his watch. During this episode he pushed the panic alarm. He concluded the fellow at the door had thrown a knife at him. He said, ""Take it then,"" referring to the money.7   The girl took all the notes out of the till and then she and the smaller male left. The larger male slammed the axe down on the counter and said, ""Give me some smokes."" The smaller man then came back and said, ""Give us the rest of the till."" Mr Ingliss looked at him and said, ""No."" They then left.8   When Mr Ingliss was asked to describe the younger of the two men - that is the man in the beanie - he said he was about five foot six inches, five foot seven inches tall, about eighteen years of age, maybe a bit younger, and he thought he was aboriginal with a bit of Maori in him. He described him as being stocky and pretty well rugged up. The lighting in front of the bowser was quite good.9   The Crown case is that the younger of the two assailants was the appellant, Mr B. There was no doubt he was a stranger to Mr Ingliss.10   The taller of the two males and the female were apprehended by the police not far from the scene and not long after the robbery. There was no evidence linking the appellant, Mr B, with the other two co-accused.11   A surveillance video was played to the jury but was of insufficient quality to be able to identify any of the persons involved. The critical question in the trial, and the critical question before us, is the correct or otherwise identification of the smaller male person as Mr B.12   One thing about which everyone is in concurrence is that that is the situation. The prosecutor said that he relied on identification and only on identification. The defence dealt with the accused's case on the basis that he had nothing to answer, except the question of identification. His Honour in his charge to the jury told them that the only matter they had to decide was the question of identification.13   Before any other steps were taken, as I have said, Mr Ingliss gave a description which coincided in a number of respects with the accused. He said the smaller of the two men was of a certain height, and that seems to be an accurate description of the accused. He said he was either of aboriginal or part-aboriginal race. That would seem to fit the accused. He said he was about eighteen years of age, and that likewise seemed to fit the accused.14   Some sixteen weeks after the robbery, on 26 October 1998, he was shown a video containing eleven numbered photographs. These included one photo of the appellant, Mr B. That photo had been taken after he was arrested on 2 October 1998. Mr Ingliss, on being shown the video, immediately nominated No 6. That was the photo of Mr B and he said, ""That's him.""15   He watched the rest of the video and he asked for it to be played again. It was played again and when he got to No 6, he said, ""That's definitely him."" He said he had no shadow of doubt and he was 100% sure his identification was correct.16   This evidence about the identification from photographs obviously played a large part in the trial. Counsel for Mr B said then, and has again said before us, that his Honour was in error in admitting this evidence in the case. He should have on this basis either refused to admit it or else, having admitted it, ordered that it be withdrawn. 17   This is put in various ways. It is, of course, notorious that identification from photographs can be a tricky and unfair process. His Honour knew that and his Honour told the jury that. But in the present case, on balance, his Honour saw no reason why the admission of the photographs and the evidence concerning them was either tricky or unfair.18   It was submitted both below and before us that one reason why it was unfair was that there was such a long interval of time between the offence and the photographic identification. Certainly it was sixteen weeks, as everyone was aware, and equally certainly, I think, it would have been a happier circumstance if the time lapse were less than sixteen weeks. But the fact is that the time lapse did not renderd the identification other than definite. There is no reason to suspect that it rendered the identification unfair. In other cases like R v Maklouf [1999] NSWCCA 94 (23 June 1999, revised 12 August 1999) before this Court in 1999 a similar or greater time limit had expired.19   The other criticisms which have been made concern the three alleged opportunities for identification. From the evidence of Mr Ingliss he could have identified Mr B either when he saw two men at the petrol bowser - that is number one - and secondly, at a later period of time when Mr B came to the door and said, ""Just give him the fucking money."" The third time was when the shorter of the two men came and said, ""Give him the rest of the till,"" on which occasion Mr Ingliss looked at him and said, ""No.""20   Of the three opportunities, it is clear enough that Mr Ingliss bungled his account of the first of the two opportunities. But it does not, to my mind, follow that he did not see the shorter of the two men on the occasion of the first opportunity, but it certainly does mean that he did not see him in the well-lit area. Nevertheless, on any view Mr Ingliss' account of that incident is unsatisfactory and it may perhaps be best categorised as a mistake, as his Honour did. But I see no reason to reject the identification on the second and third occasions. Certainly the time limit in both the second and third occasions was severely limited. Mr Ingliss in his evidence made it fairly plain that his mind was sufficiently concentrated to note fairly clearly many of the salient features of what was happening. He said in his evidence that he was quite definite about certain features of the younger man, and he could not be shaken on those matters. It was open to the jury to believe him, as the jury obviously did.21   In this respect it may well be worth repeating that his Honour was impressed by Mr Ingliss' demeanour and particularly with the way that he gave answers adverse to his case as and when they were required. In my view, the attack on the admissibility of the evidence on both the second and third opportunities simply fails.22   Insofar as it has been suggested that his Honour's conduct of the case was wanting insofar as he did not give proper directions, that seems to me bound to fail. His Honour made it crystal clear to the jury what the difficulties were in admitting the identification evidence and what the risks were. There is no reason to think the jury did not understand what his Honour was saying.23   Another ground which was taken, not I think with much enthusiasm, was that his Honour erred in not re-directing the jury in relation to telling them that honest mistakes can be made.24   It is very difficult to understand exactly what ground is being taken. It is clear enough that the evidence initially given by Mr Ingliss as to the first opportunity of seeing Mr B was not 100% accurate. It was agreed by all parties at the trial that Mr Ingliss was a very honest witness. It must follow that insofar as his evidence about his opportunity was inaccurate, that inaccuracy was due to a mistake, not dishonesty. When his Honour said, ""It is an honest mistake, and mistakes can be made"", his Honour was doing no more than repeating what counsel on both sides had already in effect agreed. I am quite unable to see on what basis his Honour's conduct is attacked in that regard.25   I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.26   SPERLING J: I agree.27   ADAMS J: I also agree.28   MEAGHER JA: The order will be the appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Nield DCJ in the Gosford District Court. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant appeared for sentence on a mixture of matters totalling 15 counts in indictments for offences including breaking, entering and stealing, receiving, disposing of stolen goods and stealing from a dwelling. There was also a schedule with some nine offences on it taken into account pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The offences have been described in written submissions of counsel as unremarkable. They involved persistent and continuing offences of dishonesty. In the circumstances of this appeal it is not necessary to recite the ingredients of the various offences. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Mr Odgers of counsel for the appellant has contended that the statistical records of the Judicial Commission show that the sentences imposed, and by that I refer to the enveloping sentence, was at the top of the range. 
      
       
      
     5     
     Accepting that assertion it should be understood that the contention of the appellant is, that whilst the total sentence was not outside the range there is new material before the Court, to which I will refer shortly, which should lead this Court to reconsider for itself the appropriateness of sentences it imposed. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The sentences imposed in the District Court consisted of a variety of fixed terms of two and three years respectively enveloped by a sentence comprising a minimum term of four and a half years imprisonment with an additional term of two and a half years. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The division of the term so as to extend the additional term component beyond that mentioned in s 5(2) of the then in force Sentencing Act 1989, occurred as a result of a finding by his Honour there were special circumstances justifying this, particularly the age of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The applicant was born on 29 June 1977. He has what must be described as a considerable record, although a lot of his offences have been against the traffic laws. He first appeared before a Court on 11 October 1995 as an unlicensed driver. Indeed the first five appearances before Courts were for exactly that offence. More significantly, however, in my view as the years progressed he came before Courts for more serious matters including assaulting police, some seven counts, breaking entering and stealing, and of current continuing significance an offence of robbery with use of corporal violence. 
      
       
      
     9     
     For this he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and as a result of more recent events he has been ordered to serve the balance of parole. That parole will not expire until August this year. Nevertheless Nield DCJ when dealing with the applicant dated all the sentences, including the enveloping sentence to which I have referred, to commence on 14 May 1999. Accordingly, for approximately 15 months of the minimum term component of the present sentences the applicant would in any event be in custody serving the balance of parole. 
      
       
      
     10     
     I should turn, however, to the principal thrust of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant. It is based upon opinion expressed by Janet Devlin, a psychologist, whose report was by consent received as fresh evidence in this appeal.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Her report indicates a diagnosis of what is described as Tourette's Syndrome. This gives, so it is said, a propensity for compulsive behaviour or expressed in another way, a reduced capacity to control one's impulses. Included apparently are impulses for dishonest behaviour. 
      
       
      
     12     
     It has to be said that the existence of this syndrome was revealed to the sentencing judge as a result of evidence from the applicant's sister. She told the judge that her brother suffered from Tourette's Syndrome and further, that that led to a tic of the face and quite impulsive uncontrollable action. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Nevertheless, in his remarks on sentence his Honour mentioned that he had not been told that this illness caused or contributed to the commission of the criminal offences. The present challenge is based upon the evidence of Ms Devlin which suggests that there was some causative link between the criminal conduct of the applicant and the existence of the syndrome from which he suffered. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The contentions on behalf of the appellant/applicant suggest that he is in need of a program for assisting him in controlling this reduced capacity for resisting impulsive criminal behaviour and that this Court should reconsider the sentence that has been imposed, inter alia, to enable such a program to be entered upon. 
      
       
      
     15     
     In his remarks on sentence Nield DCJ indicated that he regarded the matter of general deterrence as a matter of considerable weight. It is contended that having regard to the diagnosed condition of the applicant, he was not a suitable vehicle for manifestation of a significant element of general deterrence. 
      
       
      
     16     
     It has to be said that the revelation of alleged causal nexus between the misconduct of the applicant and Tourette's Syndrome comes rather late in life bearing in mind his record and the evidence of the sister that it had been recognised from the applicant's very early years. 
      
       
      
     17     
     I have also mentioned the not inconsiderable number of times that the applicant has previously been before a Court. The issue for this Court in essence is whether, having regard to the concession with which as a matter of assessment I agree, that the sentences imposed were not outside the range, there is some sentence which is less severe which this Court ought to impose in substitution for that imposed below. That is the requirement of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
      
     18     
     As I have indicated the applicant was before the District Court on this occasion for a mixture of some 15 different crimes together with the additional matters mentioned on the schedule. It seems to me that no different sentences from those imposed by the judge below suggest themselves even giving full and due weight to the opinions expressed by Ms Devlin. 
      
       
      
     19     
     It was a subject of contention between the parties in argument as to whether or not some assistance can be derived from the remarks of the Chief Justice in  
     R v Engert 
      (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 where it was said that in a case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance might at the same time mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. 
      
       
      
     20     
     It was pointed out that that was a case where there was apparently evidence of the appellant's inability to control sexual urges, whereas in this case Tourette's Syndrome is said to give a reduced capacity to control impulses for criminal behaviour directed against property. 
      
       
      
     21     
     I would not regard  
     Engert 
      as directly in point, nevertheless I would regard it as proper in principle to take into account that there must be a balancing in any sentence between the need for protection of the public, whether it be their property or persons, against illnesses suffered by persons who have offended. 
      
       
      
     22     
     Taking all matters into account and on balance I have come to the conclusion that there should be substituted no sentence different from that imposed below. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Accordingly, I would grant the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
      
     24     
     NEWMAN J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     25     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
     1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon the appellant by Job DCJ in the Newcastle District Court. 
      
      
     2    On 16 March 1999 his Honour sentenced the appellant in respect of seven counts of aggravated armed robbery to concurrent terms of penal servitude comprising Minimum Terms of six years and Additional Terms of three years. 
      
      
     3    His Honour reached his conclusion, having applied a discount of 50 percent for reasons which he gave, to the sentence otherwise assessed. The discount was for assistance to authority in the arrest and prosecution of very serious major offenders and I do not need to elaborate the thorough and careful approach taken by his Honour to reach this conclusion which is manifest in his remarks. 
      
      
     4    It appears that the appellant became acquainted with what one could only describe as a gang of criminals, by reason of his friendship with a young girl. The appellant is now aged 27 years. As a result of that friendship he came under the influence of the girl's father who was, it appears, an active member of a gang involved in the conduct of serial armed robberies. The appellant was recruited to join them. 
      
      
     5    He was spoken to by police and made full confession of his participation and beyond that, gave police what appears to be all the information at his disposal. I do not need to emphasize the risks which that sort of cooperation poses for a person who is in custody. 
      
      
     6    When the appellant appeared for sentence the following matters were available for consideration by his Honour. They were tabulated in a helpful written submission by Mr Rosser Q.C. who appeared for the appellant. Those matters were: the absence of any prior criminal record; the disclosure by the appellant of his involvement in the offences in circumstances where the police were not in possession of relevant evidence, although he was a suspect; the early plea of guilty; the circumstances in which the appellant became involved which I have sketched; and the finding by his Honour which was compatible with the observations by the police officer, that the appellant was truly remorseful, not only for his own family's sake, but for his victims. 
      
      
     7    The evidence before his Honour was that a police officer spent many, many days with the appellant, as a result of which information contained in a 78-page statement became available to law enforcement authorities. As his Honour observed, the result of the appellant's apparent reformation is that he will remain whilst in custody on witness protection, and it was observed that on his release it may be that he will require re-location. 
      
      
     8    The circumstances of the offences were described by the learned sentencing judge in his remarks, and there is no need for me to repeat them. It must be observed however that the offences were serious in nature, involving as they did attacks upon business people with weapons and with other aggravating circumstances. 
      
      
     9    However, that said, it is plain, even from the brief remarks that I have made, that the proper application of legal principle would lead to a very considerable discount from any higher sentence, by reason of the assistance to the authorities which this appellant has given and is continuing to render. 
      
      
     10    Job DCJ assessed the discount at fifty percent and it has not been contended by the Crown that his Honour was in error in making that assessment. However, as Mr Rosser pointed out, that would mean that his Honour must have started with an assessment of the appellant's criminality by a sentence reflecting this in a total of some 18 years penal servitude prior to the discount, and the short submission he made is that, given the whole of the circumstances, that ought to be categorized as manifestly excessive. In my view the submission by the appellant is made out. 
      
      
     11    That is not to say however that the appellant's activity must not attract a severe sentence. There is no need for me to repeat all the matters that have been set out in his Honour's remarks on sentence. It is perhaps an indication of the appellant's sincerity that, when he offered the information to police, he sought no pact in relation to his own sentencing proceedings, but rather came forth with the information to which I have referred. 
      
      
     12    Nevertheless it seems to me that on re-sentence it is still necessary in order to properly reflect the circumstances objectively of these offences to postulate a sentence in the order of fifteen years. Like his Honour I would also apply a fifty percent discount and for the reasons given by his Honour I too would find that special circumstances should lead to a variation of the division of sentence under s5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
      
      
     13    Accordingly I propose the following orders: 
      
      
     14    That the application for leave to appeal be granted. 
      
      
     15    That the appeal be allowed and the sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed; 
      
      
     16    On each count, to be served concurrently, a total sentence of seven and a half years imprisonment, to be divided into Minimum Terms of five years commencing on 31 July 1998 and expiring on 30 July 2003, together with Additional Terms of two and a half years commencing on 31 July 2003. 
      
      
     17    The appellant would be eligible for parole from 1 July 2003. 
      
      
     18    GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
      
      
     19    GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will therefore be as I have proposed.

     REGINA v WAYNE ERNEST JOSEPH FREEMAN 
       
     
      
      JUDGMENT. 
      
     1   JAMES J: This is an application by Wayne Ernest Joseph Freeman for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 4 December 1998 by his Honour Judge Luland, after the applicant had pleaded guilty to one charge of armed robbery committed on 7 October 1997. In sentencing the applicant Judge Luland took into account an offence of breaking, entering and stealing also committed on 7 October 1997. Judge Luland imposed a sentence of 7 years penal servitude, consisting of a minimum term of 4 years commencing on 14 February 1998, the date on which the applicant was taken into custody, and an additional term of 3 years. The maximum penalty for the offence of armed robbery is penal servitude for 20 years. 
     
      
    2   The facts of the offence were stated by Judge Luland in his remarks on sentence in a way which has not been the subject of any complaint on the hearing of this application. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The facts are that at about 7.15pm on 7 October 1997 the prisoner, with two other men, went to the Shell service station at Tumut armed with knives and wearing balaclavas. One of the offenders grabbed hold of Mr Murphy, threatening him with a knife whilst another attempted to open the till. When he was unable to do so, the first offender pushed Mr Murphy towards the counter and ordered him to open the till which he did, whereupon the offenders took $270. They then took further money from the gas tin totalling in all $778.25. Mr Murphy was then ordered to lie on the floor and an offender placed a knife towards his face and he heard a voice say 'Don't kill him, get the smoke and let's go'. The offenders then left the service station."" 
        
       
      
    3    The other two men referred to were both named Williams, Dennis Williams and Donald Williams. It would appear that these two men were cousins. Judge Luland noted that of the co-offenders Donald Williams had pleaded not guilty and would be standing trial. Dennis Williams had been arrested by Police on 4 December 1997. After being arrested he had admitted committing the offence of armed robbery and he had named the co-offenders and undertaken to give evidence against them. 
     
      
    4   On 20 March 1998 Dennis Williams was sentenced by another District Court Judge, Judge Bellear, to a sentence of 6 and a half years, consisting of a minimum term of one year three months and an additional term of five years three months. It will be necessary later in this judgment to consider in more detail the sentence imposed on Dennis Williams. 
     
      
    5   In his remarks on sentence Judge Luland stated that Dennis Williams had a criminal record which was not as bad as the present offender's and that in the case of Dennis Williams there was no further offence to be taken into account in sentencing. 
     
      
    6   The applicant and Dennis Williams had given conflicting accounts of the role played by the applicant in the offence. Judge Luland concluded that he would sentence the applicant on the basis that he was no more culpable than Dennis Williams. 
     
      
    7   Judge Luland described the offence of breaking, entering and stealing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the early hours of the following morning the prisoner and his co-offenders broke into the Woolpack Hotel at Tumut and stole a quantity of liquor and cigarettes totalling $964. This is the matter on the Form 1."" 
        
       
      
    8   With regard to the subjective circumstances of the applicant, Judge Luland noted that the applicant was a 35 year old aboriginal man. He had had a deprived childhood. He was addicted to alcohol; he also used illicit drugs. He had a bad record, including prison sentences. In prison he had been placed in segregation for his own protection. His Honour took into account the applicant’s stated intention of endeavouring to rehabilitate himself and was prepared to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    9   No submission was put that the sentence imposed on the applicant, considered by itself, was appellably excessive. It was accepted that the present case was worse than the category of case which the Court of Criminal Appeal in its guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 34 NSWLR 346 said would generally warrant a full time sentence of 4 to 5 years. Apart from any other consideration, the applicant was not a young offender. He had a substantial criminal history, the offence was committed in company and the sentencing Judge had to take into account the quite serious offence of breaking, entering and stealing. 
     
      
    10   The argument which was advanced on behalf of the applicant was based on the alleged disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on Dennis Williams. 
     
      
    11   The Court has been provided with a copy of the remarks on sentence of Judge Bellear in sentencing Dennis Williams. It is apparent from these remarks on sentence that Judge Bellear took into account in favour of Williams that he had made early admissions of guilt, that he had made full admissions in an electronically recorded interview on 4 November 1997, that he was remorseful, that he had nominated the two co-offenders, one of whom was a cousin, and had undertaken to give evidence against them, that as a result of the assistance he had given and had undertaken to give he had been ostracized, both inside the prison system and outside the prison system, that by providing assistance he had lost his extended aboriginal family, that he had been on protection and that he had nowhere to hide, even while in protective custody. There is a passage near the conclusion of Judge Bellear’s remarks on sentence, which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…in all the circumstances I propose therefore to set an overall sentence of six and a half years penal servitude. 
        
       
       
        
        In setting the minimum term I propose to reduce the minimum term for his early plea of guilty and his showing of remorse and contrition, by twelve months. Next I propose to further reduce it, taking into consideration special circumstances which is giving him benefit for his assistance to authorities, which makes it two and a half years minimum term. I then have given this matter careful consideration and as earlier indicated, I propose to give 50 per cent for his assistance to authorities, which brings his minimum term to one year and three months."" 
        
       
       
      
    12   It must be said that some parts of this passage are lacking in clarity.13   It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that while the total sentences imposed on the applicant and co-offender were approximately the same, the disparity between the minimum term of 4 years imposed on the applicant and the minimum tern of 1 year 3 months imposed on the co-offender was such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. That being so, the sentence on the applicant should be reduced, notwithstanding that it was otherwise appropriate. 
     
      
    14   As was made plain in Postiglione v the Queen (1995-1996) 189 CLR 295 it is necessary to compare not merely the total sentences but also the minimum terms or non parole periods passed on a prisoner and a co-offender. See Postiglione v The Queen per Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 302. 
     
      
    15   I do not consider that the submissions made on behalf of the applicant should be upheld. A material difference between the case of the applicant and that of the co-offender was the assistance provided and to be provided by the co-offender. For this assistance Judge Bellear allowed a discount of 50 percent. This discount, although high, was within the permissible limits of the discount which may be allowed for assistance. A further important difference was that the further offence of breaking, entering and stealing had to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant but not in sentencing the co-offender. Other differences included that the applicant had committed the two offences only a few days after completing a sentence of imprisonment for breaking and entering with intent and whilst he was subject to a recognizance. While both of the applicant and the co-offender had pleaded guilty, the co-offender had pleaded guilty at an early stage, whereas the applicant pleaded guilty only after he had been incriminated by the co-offender. Judge Bellear allowed a large discount for the co-offender's early plea and contrition. 
     
      
    16   Taking into account the differences which existed between the cases of the applicant and the co-offender, I do not consider that the disparity between the minimum terms imposed on the applicant and co-offender is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but I would dismiss the appeal against sentence.  
     
      
      SPERLING J: I agree. 
       
       
      JAMES J: The orders of the court will be as proposed by me.

     REGINA v KEVIN JAMES KEMP.  
      
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1   JAMES J: Kevin James Kemp has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge McGuire on 11 December 1998, after he had pleaded guilty to: 
     
      
      (1) a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin, between 8 May 1996 and 25 June 1997. 
       
      (2) a charge of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, on 24 June 1997. 
      
    2   The maximum penalty for the first offence is imprisonment for fifteen years or a fine of $200,000 or both; the maximum penalty for the second offence is imprisonment for twenty years or a fine of $350,000 or both. 3   In sentencing the applicant for the offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, the sentencing judge took into account ten further offences, including three drug offences namely supplying a small quantity of cocaine, possessing a small quantity of cocaine and possession of cannabis. The other offences included three offences of failure to appear and three offences of fraudulent personation. 4   On the first charge the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of five years to date from 24 June 1997, the date on which the applicant was taken into custody; on the second count he was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years, consisting of a minimum term of six years nine months and an additional term of two years three months. 5   In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge set out verbatim the statement of facts which had been admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence. The statement of facts included that:-  
     
      
       
        
        ""On 9 May 1996 the applicant was stopped by police in Port Macquarie and found to be in possession of 7.1 grammes of heroin. The applicant was arrested and was later released on bail. He gave a false name to police when he was arrested and he subsequently failed to appear in Court in accordance with the bail undertaking."" 
        
       
      
     6   It was further stated in the statement of facts that the applicant was responsible for the distribution of large amounts of heroin in Port Macquarie and neighbouring areas. Payments for the distribution of heroin were made to the applicant by payment into one or other of three bank accounts which the applicant had opened in false names, using false or forged documents. The opening of those accounts gave rise to the charges of fraudulent personation. Large amounts were deposited to those accounts. The total deposits made to one account between April 1996 and June 1997 were in excess of $141,000; the total deposits made to another account between August 1996 and July 1997 were approximately $35,000; the total deposits made to the third account between August 1995 and October 1996 were in excess of $130,000. 7   From 16 June 1997 telephone calls on a telephone service operated by an accomplice of the applicant were legally intercepted and by those means telephone conversations between the applicant and the accomplice concerning the supply of heroin were intercepted. 8   On 24 June 1997 a conversation in which the applicant and the accomplice made arrangements for a meeting was intercepted. A car in which the applicant was travelling was stopped by police near the meeting place and the applicant was seen to drop on the roadway two packages containing 44 grammes of heroin. When the applicant was searched a small quantity of cocaine was found in one of his pockets and a small quantity of cocaine was also found on the floor of the car, near where the applicant had been sitting. 9   At the time of his arrest the applicant was in possession of a St George Bank freedom account card in the name of a person having an address at Werris Creek. The police attended those premises and found a suitcase owned by the applicant in a bedroom which had been occupied from time to time by the applicant. Inside the suitcase police found a bag containing 262 grammes of methylamphetamine and two packages containing a total of 28 grammes of heroin. 10   In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge made a number of findings with respect to the supplying of heroin. The sentencing judge found that the applicant had been supplying substantial amounts of heroin, including supplying dealers, over a prolonged period. The sentencing judge rejected evidence given by the applicant about what amounts of money he had been receiving and the sentencing judge also rejected the applicant's evidence that he himself had a drug habit costing about $1,000 a day.11   His Honour found that the applicant was ""no small time street corner dealer"" and that the applicant had a high position in the hierarchy of drug suppliers. His Honour found that the applicant had introduced substantial quantities of drugs into the Taree area and had organised the distribution of these drugs, including devising a clever method of payment. 12   With respect to methylamphetamine, his Honour noted that the applicant had declined to volunteer any information, either to the police or when he gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. However, notwithstanding the absence of evidence, his Honour proceeded to make a number of findings. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe he was playing a major role in dealing with that drug. Small time operators are not in possession of such a quantity. While there is no valuation before me as to the methylamphetamine, from my experience of over 16 years in dealing with matters such as this, I recognise that this was an extremely valuable quantity of drugs. After listening to the tragic accounts of many, many amphetamine addicts I consider that methylamphetamine is an even a more dangerous drug than heroin”. 
        
       
      
     13   His Honour noted that the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant had been committed while the applicant was on bail. He had abused the liberty he had been given on 8 March 1994 and 9 May 1996 by failing to appear at Court in accordance with the bail undertaking and by committing further offences whilst at liberty on bail. 14   The applicant has a substantial criminal history, including convictions for armed robberies and for the supply of drugs. His Honour observed ""his persistent misconduct in repeating drug dealing offences is a matter which looms large on sentence"", and ""thus far he has not been deterred..."". His Honour found that the applicant's motivation was ""simply greed"". 15   In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the following subjective matters. The applicant is of aboriginal descent and was 46 years old at the time of sentence. His parents had separated when he was a small child and he was clearly disadvantaged in his childhood. He had been in institutions or gaols for a substantial part of his life. 16   His Honour found the applicant had made a contribution to the community by the assistance he had given to the prison authorities as a delegate for Aboriginal prisoners at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre. His Honour noted that the applicant had made pleas of guilty at the first opportunity, ""albeit that the case against him was overwhelming"". He had attended an open learning course whilst in custody. The applicant suffers from hepatitis C. 17   A confidential document relating to assistance which had been provided by the applicant was placed before the sentencing judge and his Honour found that, by providing this assistance, the applicant had made a real, important contribution to the administration of justice, for which the applicant would receive a substantial discount in sentencing. 18   However, his Honour qualified what he had said about the assistance provided by the applicant by saying that he did not regard the providing of such assistance as demonstrating remorse on the applicant's part, as the applicant had continued to offend contemporaneously with, and subsequently to, providing the assistance. His Honour also said that the applicant had not offered to give any evidence as part of the assistance. His Honour added that the fact that the applicant had been prepared to assist was not known to those affected and that while he had been in custody the applicant had not been on protection. Accordingly, his Honour found that the discount the applicant should receive for assistance should not be as great as the discount allowed in cases such as Regina V Winowiecki, (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 October 1994). 19   His Honour considered the question whether there were special circumstances and said that he could find none. 
     
      
    20   Towards the end of his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The crimes he committed were separate and deserving of cumulative penalties. I will not however accumulate penalties and I will fix a sentence which reflects the overall criminality and a fixed term on the other count."" 
        
       
      
    21   In my opinion, it is quite clear that the crimes the sentencing judge was here referring to were the crimes of supplying heroin and supplying methylamphetamine, with which the applicant had been charged. 
     
      
    22   On the hearing of this application two principal submissions were put by senior counsel for the applicant. The first of these principal submissions was that the sentence for the offences of supplying methylamphetamine was manifestly excessive, having regard to: 
     
      
      (1) the range of sentences appropriate to the offence 
       
       
      (2) the plea of guilty 
       
      
     
     
      
      (3) the assistance which the applicant had provided 
       
      
     
     
      
      (4) the steps taken by the applicant to rehabilitate himself 
       
      
    23   Three findings made by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence with respect to methylamphetamine were challenged. The first finding challenged was that the applicant had played a major role in dealing in methylamphetamine. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, as the sentencing judge had himself acknowledged, there was no evidence before his Honour about the source of the drug or the course of dealings in the drug and therefore the sentencing judge must have made his finding as a result of an inference drawn merely from the quantity of the drug. It was pointed out that the quantity of the drug was 262 grammes, which was only 12 grammes above the upper limit of a merely trafficable quantity of the drug.24   A second finding challenged was that the quantity of methylamphetamine was ""extremely valuable"". The Court's attention was drawn to a number of reported cases in which particulars of sales of methylamphetamine are recorded. These cases included: R v Gudge and Brown, (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 April 1995); R v Langton, (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1996), and R v Davis, (unreported 21 May 1997). Particulars of sales recorded in the judgments in those cases include the sale of 450 grammes in March 1993 for $18,000 - (R v Gudge and Brown); the sale of 173 grammes on 19 April 1995 for $6,500 and the sale of 1 pound for $12,500 on 15 June 1995 (R v Langton); and the sale of 411.6 grammes on 27 April 1995 for $11,850 (R v Davis). 25   It was submitted that the evidence of the prices on the sales recorded in those decisions demonstrated the absence of any justification for the sentencing judge concluding in the present case that the quantity of methylamphetamine was ""extremely valuable"". 
     
      
    26   The next finding that was challenged was his Honour's view that methylamphetamine is a more dangerous drug than heroin. His Honour had reached this view on the basis that in the course of his judicial duties he had listened to the accounts of “many, many methylamphetamine addicts”. It was submitted that the sentencing judge was not entitled to form this view merely on the basis of his own experience as a judge. 27   In addition to the submission that his Honour should not have made these three findings, it was submitted that his Honour had not sufficiently allowed for the early pleas of guilty, the significant assistance that the applicant had given the authorities and the evidence of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    28   I will deal first with the submission that his Honour erred in making the findings he did with respect to methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    29   Finding 1: In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant was playing a major role in dealing in methylamphetamine. The quantity the applicant was in possession of was a quantity recognised by the legislature as being a commercial quantity. In my opinion, the evidence about the applicant's dealings in heroin rendered it likely that the applicant was playing a similar role in dealing in methylamphetamine. The inference that he was playing a major role could be drawn more confidently in the absence of any information being offered by the applicant. 30   Finding 2: His Honour was entitled to find, even in the absence of evidence of value, that, as the quantity of methylamphetamine was a quantity recognised by the legislature as being a commercial quantity, it was valuable. It may be that in the absence of evidence of value the sentencing judge was not entitled to find that the quantity of methylamphetamine was ""extremely"" valuable but I do not consider that his Honour's characterisation of the quantity as being ""extremely"" valuable played any material part in his Honour's reasoning process over and above the finding, which his Honour was entitled to make, that the quantity was valuable. 31   Finding 3: I would agree with the submission made by counsel for the applicant to this extent, that whatever the extent of his Honour's own previous experience as a judge in cases concerning persons addicted to methylamphetamine, his Honour was not entitled, in the absence of any evidence given by some qualified person or any indication in legislation or any authoritative statement of an appeal court, to form a view that methylamphetamine is a more dangerous drug than heroin. 
     
      
    32   There is some discussion in the cases about whether methylamphetamine is a mid-range drug or whether, on the other hand, it is a high range drug and, accordingly, comparable with heroin, which is undoubtedly regarded as being a high range drug. We were not referred to any authority which would support the view that methylamphetamine is to be regarded as a more dangerous drug than heroin. 
     
      
    33   However, this much having been said, I do not consider that this remark made by the sentencing judge, in the course of what were long remarks on sentence, entered in any material way into his Honour's reasoning process. His Honour was clearly entitled to regard methylamphetamine as being a dangerous drug. 
     
      
    34   I do not consider that the sentence imposed for the supply of methylamphetamine was manifestly excessive. We were referred to sentencing statistics for sentences imposed for the supply of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine. However, in the present case, it has to be recognised that the sentence which was imposed for the supply of methylamphetamine was clearly intended by his Honour to reflect the applicant's overall criminality, including the criminality in the first offence and the criminality in the ten further offences. 35   It may be that since the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen, the course taken by his Honour of seeking to reflect the total criminality of the applicant, including the criminality manifested in the first offence, in the sentence for the second offence is no longer permissible. However, neither party sought to argue this point and, in the absence of argument, I do not consider this Court should interfere in the way in which his Honour constructed the sentences he imposed. 36   The criminality manifested in the first offence of supplying heroin was considerable. The further offences to be taken into account were unrelated to the principal offences, were serious in themselves and justified his Honour's stricture that they demonstrated a complete disregard of the law by the applicant.37   The applicant had absconded whilst on bail and committed offences whilst on bail and these were serious aggravating circumstances. 
     
      
    38   On the hearing of this application the Court perused the letter giving details of the assistance the applicant had given, which had been provided to the sentencing judge. The assistance which the applicant had provided was considerable. However, the amount of the discount to be allowed for that assistance was very much within the discretion of the sentencing judge. Furthermore, his Honour, in my opinion, was correct in distinguishing the present case from R Winowiecki.  39   The second principal submission made by senior counsel for the applicant was his Honour erred in not finding special circumstances. I have already quoted what his Honour said in his remarks. Senior counsel referred to part of the judgment of Wood J in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. It was submitted that a number of the factors identified by Wood J in Moffitt were to be found in the present case. 
     
      
    40   I do not consider that the submissions based on section 5 (2) of the Sentencing Act should be upheld. In his remarks on sentence his Honour expressly considered section 5 (2) and his Honour's statement: ""I have considered the question of special circumstances and I can find none"" does not mean, in my view, that his Honour considered there were no circumstances capable of amounting to special circumstances, so that his Honour did not arrive at the point of exercising a discretion but that his Honour, having given consideration to the question, had decided that there were no special circumstances such as would warrant the setting of an additional term exceeding one third of the minimum term. His Honour expressly found that the additional term under the sentence he proposed would be sufficient and, indeed, ample for the purposes of rehabilitation. 41   In my opinion leave should be granted to appeal against sentence but I would dismiss the appeal against sentence. 42   SPERLING: I agree with the orders proposed and his Honour's reasons. 43   JAMES: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by me.

     Peter Robert COCHRANE & Anor  
      
     v Ronald Ian HANNAFORD 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    THE COURT: This is an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Common Law Division given on 11 April 1997. The proceedings were heard at Dubbo in September 1996 but the matter was not fully disposed of at those sittings. His Honour, the evidence being concluded, adjourned the proceedings to Sydney with a direction that written submissions should be provided by both parties. It appears that his Honour reached his decision after receipt of those submissions, without any further hearing taking place before him. His Honour entered judgment for the plaintiff against the defendants in the sum of $1,153,227.00 and ordered that the defendants pay the plaintiff s costs. The judgment sum was made up of several components to which reference will be made later in these reasons. As a result of steps taken earlier in the proceedings, before the hearing in Dubbo, the only issue in relation to liability was whether the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, an issue resolved in his favour. The appeal is brought against this finding and also in respect of the quantum of the damages awarded.  
    2    The action was brought by the plaintiff Ronald Ian Hannaford (""Mr Hannaford"") against the defendants Peter Robert Cochrane and Joy Anne Cochrane to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him in an accident which occurred on a property “Ulumbie” via Walgett on 12 September 1992. Mr Hannaford received severe personal injuries when he was crushed between a Caterpillar D7G bulldozer owned by him and a Caterpillar 12E grader owned by the defendants and driven by the first defendant Peter Cochrane. The defendants were sued jointly as owners of the grader and Peter Cochrane was sued separately as the driver. As already indicated, there was no issue before his Honour as to the liability of the defendants for the negligence of Peter Cochrane. Accordingly, both defendants were liable for that negligence. Although both are appellants in these proceedings, it will be convenient to refer to them as ""Mr Cochrane"". 
    3    We shall deal first with Mr Cochrane's claim that his Honour erred in finding that Mr Hannaford was not guilty of contributory negligence. 
     
      
     Contributory negligence 
      
    4    The evidence on this issue was given by Mr Hannaford and Mr Cochrane. There were some areas of conflict between the two versions. There was, however, no dispute as to the following facts. 
    5    On the day of the accident, Mr Hannaford had been engaged in various activities on the property. He said that he would have been involved in probably four or five things going on on the farm. One activity involved the use of the Caterpillar D7G bulldozer. That piece of equipment was being used to de-silt a portion of the bottom of the Namoi River where it flowed through the property. It appears that the presence of logs and sticks in the river, which at that point was only shallow, was causing an accumulation of silt which was interfering with the river's flow. The bulldozer was being used to push the collection of logs and sticks from the river onto the river bank in order to remove the impediment. Mr Hannaford was not driving the bulldozer on this occasion. It was being operated by an employee, Mark Perin. Towards 5:00 pm, in circumstances where dusk was beginning to fall, the bulldozer became seriously bogged in the river bottom. It was necessary that it be removed from this situation. There was some urgency attending its removal because of the need to use it in aid of a fairly tight timetable for the development of the property for cotton farming. Upon learning of the problem, Mr Hannaford went to the scene. At first, he organised an attempted extrication of the bulldozer by using two of the farm tractors, one operated by an employee named Dubner, and the other by himself. The combined effort of these two tractors was insufficient to budge the bulldozer. Consequently, further assistance was required.  
    6    During that day, Mr Cochrane had been operating a large grader on Mr Hannaford's property. He had been using this piece of machinery for the purpose of clearing irrigation ditches, associated with the development of the property for cotton growing. He was a self employed grader operator and the owner, with his wife, of the grader. He was working for Mr Hannaford, not as an employee but as an independent contractor. Although his operations were at some distance from the scene of the trouble, he heard of the problem over the two-way radio installation in his vehicle. It appears that he heard conversations between Mr Hannaford and his two employees, which were occurring whilst the rescue effort was being undertaken. Of his own volition, Mr Cochrane brought the grader to the scene. He offered his services over the radio and these were accepted by Mr Hannaford. He arrived at the scene and participated in the operation of attempting to extricate the bulldozer.  
    7    There is some conflict in the evidence as to the situation which obtained upon his arrival. Mr Cochrane testified that the two tractors were linked in tandem to the bulldozer, the first being joined by a chain to the second, and the second being linked by a similar chain to the draw bar on the bulldozer. Mr Hannaford's evidence was to the effect that, at all relevant times, the tractors were linked individually to the bulldozer. It was common ground, however, that Mr Hannaford asked Mr Cochrane to position the grader so that it could be linked by a chain, which it carried as part of its equipment, to the bulldozer and assist in pulling the bulldozer from the river bed on to the river bank. The river bank itself was fairly steep. Photographs that are in evidence indicate this fact. At the top of the river bank there was a relatively flat area over which the grader travelled before coming down the bank and positioning itself at approximately 8 metres from the bulldozer. Mr Cochrane's chain was attached to the draw bar of the bulldozer. He did not attach it himself. It was probably attached by Mr Hannaford. The three vehicles were then used in an attempt to drag the bulldozer on to the river bank. Mr Hannaford organised the operation and was in control of it, in that he issued instructions over the two-way radio system to the drivers of the vehicles. Clearly the chains from the vehicles needed to be adjusted, so that the vehicles pulled evenly and together. 
    8    According to Mr Cochrane the two tractors were pulling in tandem whilst his grader was independently attached to the draw bar of the bulldozer. Mr Hannaford, on the other hand, was quite clear in his evidence that the three vehicles were independently chained to the draw bar, with the result that the two tractors were not pulling in tandem. It seems clear that his Honour accepted Mr Hannaford's version on this aspect of the case. 
    9    A first attempt to remove the bulldozer was unsuccessful. A second attempt was made. In the course of this, one of the towing chains broke. There is conflict in the evidence as to which chain it was. On Mr Cochrane's version it was the chain linking the forward tractor to the rear one. On Mr Hannaford's version, it was the chain from a particular tractor known as an Acremaster, which chain was attached directly to the draw bar of the bulldozer. 
    10    The breaking of the chain brought the rescue operation to a halt whilst the chains were reorganised. Clearly, it was not simply a matter of reattaching the broken chain. The chains had to be adjusted in terms of their length so that when the adjustment was made, the vehicles would pull evenly and uniformly. 
    11    There is no dispute that Mr Hannaford undertook this task and that it was whilst he was busying himself in removing the chains from the draw bar of the bulldozer, so that they might be readjusted, that the accident happened. There is no dispute that whilst he was so engaged, Mr Cochrane left the controls of his grader and walked the short distance down the river bank towards where Mr Hannaford was working. He left the motor of the grader running and the gears in neutral. He applied the brake and took other steps to retain the grader in its position on the bank. These were insufficient. After a few minutes the grader slid down the bank and crushed Mr Hannaford against the bulldozer. A shouted warning to Mr Hannaford was not successful in removing him from the point of danger. Negligence on the part of Mr Cochrane having previously been found, it was unnecessary for his Honour to make any finding in this regard. However, he indicated what he regarded as being the negligence of Mr Cochrane because the area of negligent activity had a bearing upon the issue of contributory negligence. He found that, in the absence of any direction from Mr Hannaford, as being the man in control of the operation, that he should leave the grader and come down to assist, and his abandoning of control of the grader, in leaving it with its engine running and the gears in neutral, involved a foreseeable risk of harm to persons positioned behind it. His absence from the controls of the grader necessarily meant that if it should slip down the bank, that course could not be arrested by driving it forward. 
    12    It was common ground that he had received no direction to leave the controls of the grader; nor had he received any direction from Mr Hannaford that he should remain in control of the grader whilst steps were being taken to adjust and reattach the chains.  
    13    There are some significant areas of conflict in the evidence relating to the period after the breaking of the chain. First, Mr Cochrane testified that the chain which broke was the chain linking the forward tractor to the rear one. Mr Hannaford's evidence, as already indicated, was that the broken chain was one attaching the Acremaster tractor directly to the bulldozer. Although, unfortunately, his Honour makes no express finding, it seems quite clear that he was of the view that Mr Cochrane's evidence should be rejected in this regard. In any event, there is no conflict that after the breaking of the chain, Mr Hannaford was engaged in removing the chains from the draw bar of the bulldozer so that adjustments could be made to cope with the breakage. It is difficult to see why, if the breakage had occurred between the two tractors in tandem, Mr Hannaford should have been confining his efforts to the chains attached to the bulldozer. Mr Cochrane gives no evidence to explain this apparent difficulty in his testimony. 
    14    Another significant conflict in the evidence arises as follows. Mr Cochrane testified that when he left the controls of the grader and walked down the bank towards where Mr Hannaford was working on the chains, he was able to observe that the chain attaching his grader to the bulldozer was taut. Mr Hannaford's evidence is to the contrary. He said that, at all times, the chains attached to the bulldozer were slack and upon the ground. He says that if they had been taut, it would have been quite impossible to attempt to remove them from the draw bar of the bulldozer. His Honour accepted Mr Hannaford's evidence in this regard. It is an important finding because it negatives a theory propounded by Mr Cochrane and, to an extent, relied upon in argument before us that the movement of the grader was occasioned by a movement in the bulldozer. It was suggested that the bulldozer which had been moved very slightly by the previous pulling attempts had slid back and in doing so, because of the taut chain between it and the grader, had pulled the grader down the bank. 
    15    However, his Honour found that Mr Hannaford had been seeking to remove the pin from the draw bar in order to release the chains. The chains were slack while he was doing this. The grader moved at a time when the chains were slack. Moreover, the finding in favour of the slackness of the chains supports another part of Mr Hannaford's evidence. He says that when he addressed the problem occasioned by the breaking of the chain and saw the necessity of removing the chains from the draw bar he directed Mr Cochrane to reposition the grader. Clearly enough, this was to slacken the chain and enable Mr Hannaford to undertake its removal. Although his Honour makes no specific finding in this regard, it is our view that his finding as to the slackness of the chain, which was clearly correct, leads reasonably and necessarily to the acceptance of Mr Hannaford's evidence that, prior to working on the chain, he gave the direction referred to above, namely that Mr Cochrane should re-position his vehicle.  
    16    It should be mentioned that there is no dispute in the evidence that Mr Hannaford was unaware that Mr Cochrane had left the controls of the grader. Although Mr Cochrane had been in the area where the work was going on for some minutes, it is clear and undisputed that Mr Hannaford had his back to him and did not know of his presence or, more significantly, did not know that he had ceased to be in control of the grader after its repositioning. 
    17    We have spent some time in this discussion of the facts surrounding the accident and in expressing our views as to what the evidence establishes. This has been necessary because his Honour did not make express findings of fact in some areas and did not indicate any general preference for one version against the other. However, the findings of fact that he made, which have been referred to in these reasons, necessarily lead to the additional findings indicated. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to lengthen these reasons by setting out passages from his Honour's judgment in relation to the issue of contributory negligence. Counsel for the appellants has made a general complaint as to deficiencies in his Honour's judgment, in relation to the absence of findings of fact and, more particularly, in relation to a failure to deal with arguments of substance placed before him on behalf of Mr Cochrane. We shall have occasion to refer to these submissions later in these reasons. However, we are not persuaded that, in relation to the issue of contributory negligence, these deficiencies should result in there being any retrial of the issue. 
    18    It is clear that the main argument of the appellants in relation to this issue was put to his Honour as it has been put to the Court; namely that Mr Hannaford was in control of the whole operation of the removal of the bulldozer and that, being in that position, he should have taken care to see that Mr Cochrane remained in control of the grader at all relevant times. It was pointed out that there was a hazardous quality to the operation. The grader was positioned on a marked downslope, it was a significantly heavy vehicle, it was only a short distance from where the men including Mr Hannaford were working and that any downward movement on its part would put them in peril. It was submitted that in these circumstances Mr Hannaford owed to himself a duty analogous to that owed to his employees to establish and maintain a reasonably safe system of work. This would entail giving appropriate instructions to Mr Cochrane as to his remaining in control of the grader and as to ensuring that those instructions were carried out. Authorities such as Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16 and Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd (1994) 179 CLR 520 were relied upon to underpin a submission that Mr Hannaford was a victim of a failure on his own part to provide a safe system of work and that his duty in this regard was non-delegable. We do not think that these authorities are in point.  
    19    It has often been said that the question of contributory negligence should not be approached by way of an analysis of relevant duty and breach. The question is a simple one; namely, whether the plaintiff in all the circumstances had taken reasonable care for his own safety. (See for example the discussion in The Law of Torts, Fleming, 9th ed Ch 12 p302.) In our view the question of contributory negligence in this case must be approached realistically and practically. Whilst it is true that Mr Hannaford had overall control of the operation being conducted by his employees and, for the limited purpose of the extrication of the bulldozer, also had control over the activities of Mr Cochrane, these facts, which were acknowledged by his Honour in his judgment, are not determinative of the issue. What must be determined is whether Mr Hannaford acted unreasonably having regard to his own safety in the situation which obtained upon the breaking of the chain. This was an unexpected circumstance requiring urgent remedial action. He gave an instruction to Mr Cochrane to reposition the grader so that the chain could be slackened off preparatory to its removal from the bulldozer's draw bar. Thereafter, he immediately busied himself with the operations required for the removal of the draw bar pin and the adjustment of the chains. He would necessarily have had his attention concentrated on this operation. He had no reason to expect that Mr Cochrane, apparently an experienced grader operator in charge of his own grader, would not take all proper steps to remain in control of it during this re-adjustment. In particular, he was not aware that Mr Cochrane had left the controls of the vehicle nor did Mr Cochrane draw this to his attention. It was, in our view, perfectly reasonable, in these circumstances, for Mr Hannaford to assume, as he clearly did, that the grader would be maintained safely in position by Mr Cochrane, its operator and owner. 
    20    In our opinion, no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Mr Hannaford. 
    21    We turn, then, to the attack which has been made on his Honour's findings as to damages. 
     
      
     Damages 
      
    22    There is no dispute that Mr Hannaford suffered severe disabling injuries in the accident. His Honour dealt with these in his judgment in terms which have not been the subject of any criticism. Accordingly, we set them out here: 
     
      
       
       The plaintiff sustained a crush injury which resulted in a vertical sheer fracture of the pelvis causing right sacro-iliac (where the pelvis joins the spine) disruption and diastasis (separation) of the symphysis pubis (the pubic arch). He suffered a ruptured membranous urethra which went on to acute renal (kidney) failure, to (sic) due to the crush injury. He suffered a ""gross"" fracture of the left femur which was treated by open reduction and plating on 19 October, 1992 when the plaintiff had sufficiently recovered from renal failure. 
        
        
       The treating orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Paul Stalley, has described the plaintiffs injuries as ""… very major and significant disabilities which will be present with him on a permanent basis. He first of all has a major foot drop on the right side and weakness where he has had an injury to his lumbo-sacralplexus. "" 
        
        
       The plaintiff walks with a limp and has diffuse pain over the trochanteric region of his left hip which is intermittent. He is unable to climb under machinery, or up and down earthen banks and experiences great difficulty in entering crops over rough or muddy ground for crop inspection. Muddy conditions are a continuing feature of irrigated crops. 
        
        
       The plaintiff’s ability to move about is seriously hampered by his hip and leg weakness; his foot drop and diffuse numbness in the right foot. He is unable to carry out heavy machinery repairs and is also troubled by right later thigh pain. 
        
        
       Dr Stalley expressed the view that the grinding sensation felt by the plaintiff in the hip was established on x-ray to be gross myositis (inflammation of the muscles) around the hip joint. 
       
      
    23    The award for non-economic loss was agreed by the parties as being 55% of a most extreme case, the appropriate award, therefore, being $129,250. 
    24    His Honour's award of damages was summarised in the judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
       1 Out of pocket expenses $30,342 
        
       2 Non economic loss 129,250 
        
       3 Past economic loss 380,270 
        
       4 Future economic loss 400,959 
        
       5 Future medical expenses 55,000 
        
       6 Cost of modification of farm facilities 7,406 
        
       7 Loss of opportunity re: ""Runningbrook""  
        150,000 
        
        
        $1,153,227 
       
      
    25    The components which are the subject of this appeal are (3) past economic loss, (4) future economic loss, and (7) loss of opportunity re ""Runningbrook"". 
     
      
     In relation to these heads of loss 
     ,  
     the appellants make the following criticisms of his Honour's judgment: 
      
      
     (a) His Honour failed to give adequate reasons for his judgment; 
      
      
     (b) His Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the evidence; 
      
      
     (c) His Honour failed to have regard to the appellants' written submissions on damages, sufficiently or at all. 
      
    26    The case, as already indicated, was heard at the Dubbo Country Sittings. It occupied more than four hearing days and could not be concluded in the sittings. The evidence was taken but no final submissions were made. His Honour directed that full submissions be made in writing with appropriate references to the extensive transcript and documentary evidence. This was done. The complaint is made on behalf of the appellants that his Honour's judgment evinces no indication that he had regard to significant portions of the submissions that were made on behalf of the appellants as to those heads of loss. Nor, it is asserted, does the judgment provide any reasons why those submissions, if considered, were rejected. 
    27    As a corollary to these claims, it was asserted on behalf of the appellants that, had his Honour considered and given appropriate weight to the allegedly ignored submissions, he would, necessarily, have awarded damages in a substantially reduced sum. Accordingly, the appellants sought a new trial or, alternatively, if possible, a reassessment of the plaintiff s damages by this Court. 
    28    Before considering the submissions made in the appeal, it is necessary, briefly, to refer to the cases presented by Mr Hannaford and Mr Cochrane at the trial, the general course of the trial and the evidence adduced. 
    29    Mr Hannaford was born at Walgett on 20th September 1949. His father conducted a grazing enterprise upon the family property ""Barokaville"". After initial schooling at Walgett, he completed his secondary education in Sydney, obtaining the Higher School Certificate in 1968. Thereafter, he was employed as a clerk in the local Shire Council at Walgett for a period of some four years during which he saved sufficient money to commence wheat farming activities. These were conducted in the first instance at ""Barokaville"". Later he commenced share farming on other properties in the district. 
    30    In 1974, his father became ill and it became necessary for Mr Hannaford to assume management of ""Barokaville"". The property covered approximately 7,000 acres, and at that stage, carried 3,000 sheep. There were also 1,000 acres devoted to wheat farming. Mr Hannaford has continued to manage that property.  
    31    The evidence clearly indicated that he was an enterprising young man who wished to expand his farming activities. In 1982, he purchased a further property, ""Crossdale"". This was a 2,000 acre property situated on the Pilliga Road in the vicinity of ""Barokaville"". He initially used this property for wheat farming. A few years later, he purchased an additional property of 5,000 acres on the Coonamble Road. This property was called ""Wolsley"". It was also used for wheat farming.  
    32    Mr Hannaford devoted himself to wheat farming during the 1980s until 1989, when a drop in wheat prices caused him to turn his attention to cotton growing. This was a significantly different activity from the production of wheat. Mr Hannaford, however, had had experience in the operation of earth-moving equipment which was necessary for the preparation of land for the growing of cotton. The earthmoving machinery was a D7G Caterpillar bulldozer which he owned and in the operation of which he had acquired considerable experience.  
    33    At the time he turned his attention to cotton growing, there was only one other property upon which cotton was produced on the Namoi River in the Walgett area. Cotton was produced in adjoining areas where the operations were clearly profitable. 
    34    At first, his cotton growing activities were undertaken through a partnership named The Walgett Cotton Company. His partner was a man named Campbell. It appears that, in addition to the respondent's bulldozer, the partnership had available two large powered earth scrapers. The partnership used these items of equipment to build on-farm water storage, essential for cotton growing, at ""Crossdale"" and, also, undertook contract earthmoving work on three other properties as preparation for the share farming of cotton on those properties. The partnership continued for two years. Mr Hannaford undertook work involving a great deal of heavy physical labour, consisting of the repair and maintenance of the heavy machinery and its daily operation. Additionally, he engaged in heavy cotton farming work such as the pulling of syphons from place to place, so that they could be used for the introduction of water into the irrigation channels on the cotton farms and, also, ""chipping"" cotton and weeding. It was not disputed that this was very heavy work, in which he was engaged for some eighty hours per week. 
    35    At the time he commenced his cotton growing activities, the property ""Crossdale"" was totally undeveloped. The other three properties already referred to were approximately fifty percent developed. The property ""Wolsley"" was not suitable for cotton growing and was leased for wheat farming.  
    36    The nature and extent of the work undertaken by Mr Hannaford up to the time of his accident is summarised by his Honour in findings, which are undisputed, as follows: 
     
      
       
       The plaintiff gave unchallenged evidence that in developing these properties for cotton growing, about eighty percent of his time was occupied in driving machinery but 'there was also a fair slice of heavy duty mechanical repair type work that goes hand in hand with keeping that machinery running especially at Walgett where we are slightly isolated. It's very expensive to get experts to come in and fix your breakdowns, so that always fell in my lap.' 
       
      
      
       
       As to the size of the equipment he was called upon to work on, the plaintiff said 'The tractor weighted 20 tonnes, yeah, you know, anything from a bolt you could pick up in your fingers to something that needed a crane, it was pretty heavy duty work.' 
       
      
      
       
       In addition to the earth works associated with land planing, channelling and the construction of large (100 acres) on-farm water storage, the plaintiff carried out the physical work of building the infrastructure for the pumping stations, and the steel water control towers, some eleven metres in height, as well as the installation of 26 inch centrifugal pumps and associated equipment.  
       
      
    37    At the time of the accident on 12 September, 1992, the work of developing ""Crossdale"" for cotton was approximately 90% complete, with two of the three pumping sites completed.  
    38    Mr Hannaford suffered some financial difficulties. Borrowing was essential for the undertaking of his cotton growing activities and the acquisition of plant. It appears, however, that he was able to remain afloat financially and was assisted in this regard by the sale of the property ""Wolsley"". At the time of the accident, he regarded himself as ""comfortable"" financially. He was clearly carrying a load of debt but was not under dangerous pressure from his financiers. 
    39    As already indicated, there was no significant dispute as to the severe physical consequences of the accident. As shown in the passage cited from his Honour's judgment, Mr Hannaford was left with significant painful disabilities which affected his capacity to undertake the heavy work associated with the development of land for cotton growing and the production of cotton crops. The cotton crop for which the land at ""Crossdale"" had been prepared was, in fact, sown shortly after his accident by his employees. The sowing was successful and a good crop was later harvested in 1993. In relation to this crop, it is clear that he was unable to play any significant role as he was undergoing the immediate, severe after-effects of the accident and necessary periods of hospitalisation. Subsequent crops have been undertaken and have proved successful, with Mr Hannaford playing an increased, but still reduced, role in their production. It was not disputed, on the evidence, that his ability to undertake the role of a ""hands on” manager was significantly reduced, although he evinced courage and determination in pushing himself to his physical limits. His Honour made the following findings which, on the evidence, could not be challenged: 
     
      
       
       ... the plaintiff, by his entrepreneurial skills, combined with his physical capacity to work long hours operating, maintaining and repairing heavy machinery, has developed from scratch an enterprise capable of generating income from cotton production which, for the present crop, is valued in the order of two million dollars. Hence there is necessarily an asset base bearing a relationship to that income producing capacity which has been generated by the efforts and skills of the plaintiff. 
        
        
       Such a capability in a person in the position of the plaintiff is recognised by Mr Ivey as rare, and I accept this assessment. I also find that the plaintiff’s physical and emotional capacity to maintain his personal input was dramatically cut-off by his accident and that his ability to be the 'hands~on' linchpin of such an undertaking is permanently lost to him to a substantial degree. 
       
      
    40    These established facts provide the background for Mr Hannaford's claim for past and future economic loss and for lost opportunity for economic gain in relation to the property ""Runningbrook"". 
     
      
     Mr Hannaford's case for economic loss 
      
    41    Mr Hannaford's claim in the Court below is encapsulated in a statement made by him in his evidence. He said: 
     
      
       
       When I came back from hospital I was not able to do anywhere near the amount of work on the farm I did before I left. The productivity, the advancement, the development of the farm or the prospect of developing other farms went out of the window, simple as that. 
       
      
      
    42    There was obviously, a significant difficulty in quantifying economic loss resulting from these disabilities. Mr Hannaford's cotton growing enterprise was only just commencing at the time of the accident. Consequently, it was not possible to compare the results pre and post accident, as is not infrequently done in cases of impairment of earning capacity, where the injured plaintiff has been conducting the same pre accident and post accident enterprise. Moreover, as already indicated, there was no neighbouring cotton farm which could be used as a basis for comparison. Reference was made in the evidence to a type of measure described as ""the Namoi average"" which provided, apparently, some indication of production levels over a broad cotton growing area. Reliance was placed upon this measure by Mr Cochrane who sought to argue that, insofar as Mr Hannaford's cotton production in the years following the accident compared favourably with the Namoi average, no loss had been suffered.  
    43    Mr Hannaford's case on economic loss depended upon his own evidence and that of an expert, Mr Ivey. His testimony may broadly be described as developing, in detail, the statement which has already been quoted. Mr Hannaford's physical disabilities, he asserted, prevented him from performing a multitude of on-the-spot managerial operations in the field. Whilst he was capable of overall planning, he could not provide ""hands-on"" leadership in the performance of essential tasks relating to production and maintenance. As a result, crop yields were not as high as they otherwise could have been, there was delay in bringing land into production at ""Crossdale"" and, in 1996, an opportunity to acquire the property ""Runningbrook"" had to be foregone, as he lacked the physical ability and psychological drive to undertake its development. It was undisputed that this property was immediately adjacent to the property ""Barokaville"" and, consequently, could have been economically developed by Mr Hannaford through the utilisation of economies of scale.  
    44    Mr Hannaford was supported in these contentions by the evidence of Mr Ivey, an accounting and agricultural expert. He conferred with Mr Hannaford and made inspections of the properties. He produced a comprehensive report which was tendered in evidence, without objection. It was argued but faintly before us that findings in the report were inadequately supported by evidence, Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642 being relied upon in this regard. This assertion was not developed in argument. A reading of the whole of Mr Hannaford's evidence indicates that the opinions of Mr Ivey had a sufficient evidentiary basis.  
    45    Mr Ivey assessed Mr Hannaford's losses for the years 1993 and 1994 under a number of headings, having indicated that: 
     
      
       
       The assessment of past economic loss is based on the specific effects that the accident had on Mr Hannaford's business. Where possible the loss is calculated with reference to known financial figures. However, in many cases this is not possible, and estimates of the likely losses must be made. 
       
      
      
       
      
     The headings and associated comments appear in his report as follows, excluding those not ultimately relied upon: 
      
      
       
       (a) Delayed Development of Extra Irrigation Area 
       
      
      
       
       Mr Hannaford advises that it was planned to develop an extra 200 acres (80 ha) of irrigation land at 'Crossdale' in time for the 1993/94 cotton season. As a result of the accident this land has not been developed. 
       
      
      
       
       (b) Delayed Development of existing Irrigation Area 
       
      
      
       
       Mr Hannaford advised that plans to install a pumpsite and a water reticulation system for the existing irrigation area were cancelled as a result of the accident. This has lead (sic) to a loss of productivity in the irrigation area.  
       
      
      
       
       (c) Reduced Yield 
       
      
      
       
       Inadequate managerial input after the accident resulted in reduced cotton yields in 1993 and 1994. In particular, weeds were not controlled effectively, the fertiliser programme was sub optimal and the irrigation scheduling was unsatisfactory. It is estimated that the resultant loss of cotton yield was 2.5 bales per hectare in 1993 when actual yields averaged approximately 5 bales/ha. A yield of 7.5 bales/ha should have been easily obtained. In 1994 a loss of cotton yield of 0.5 bales/ha is estimated to have occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       (d) Higher Cotton Costs 
       
      
      
       
       Due to inadequate weed control, a greater amount of weed chipping had to be carried out in 1993 and 1994. This is estimated at an extra 30%, or around $13 per hectare. 
       
      
      
       
       (e) … 
       
      
      
       
       (f) Contract Farming and Earthmoving 
       
      
      
       
       The average contract income earnt (sic) by Barokaville Pastoral Company between 1989 and 1992 was $32,080 per year (Attachment 2. 1). In 1993 only $4,800 was earnt (sic). The difference between these amounts is used as the basis for the estimated loss. 
       
      
      
       
       (g) Extra Cost of employed Labour 
       
      
      
       
       Wage expenditure in 1993 declined somewhat from the 1992 levels (Attachment 2.1). However this was under the circumstance of smaller contracting, cropping and livestock enterprises. Therefore, even though wage costs fell in 1993 we believe that it does not discount the claim that replacement workers were employed in that year. 
       
      
      
       
       (h) … 
       
      
      
       
       (i) Payment to a Neighbour 
       
      
      
       
       A neighbour, Greg Webber, was employed to assist with the running of Mr Hannaford's properties. He was paid $15,000 to $20,000 for his work. The exact amount is not known at this stage.  
       
      
      
       
       (j) … 
       
      
    46    Mr Ivey then made calculations in an attachment to the report, in respect of each of these headings, with the acknowledgment that a degree of estimation was required because the enterprise had no previous years of operation with which a comparison could be made.  
    47    After making appropriate adjustments for the incidence of income tax, Mr Ivey produced an estimate for economic loss in the 1993 financial year of $194,644, and in the 1994 financial year of $104,954, a total of $299,598. 
    48    Mr Ivey's report was produced in 1994. It contained, in addition to the estimates of the past 1993 and 1994 financial year, an estimate of future economic loss. This was based upon the cost of a replacement manager, Mr Ivey expressing the view that ""Mr Hannaford's properties may possibly approach their former level of productivity if an energetic, capable replacement manager is employed"". Accordingly, he made a calculation based upon the present value of the salary payable to a person having the necessary level of expertise. This produced an after tax figure of $550,516. The calculation took into account a retiring age for Mr Hannaford of sixty-five years.  
    49    Mr Ivey's 1994 report did not take into account any compensation for the lost opportunity of purchasing and developing the ""Runningbrook"" property, as that opportunity did not arise until 1996. Mr Ivey provided a supplementary report dated 4 September 1996 in which he provided a calculated estimate of the returns that might have been achieved through the purchase and redevelopment of the property. A claim was made based upon the present value of future losses so calculated. His Honour did not accept this claim. Accordingly, there is no need to set it out in detail. His Honour, in fact, awarded a much smaller sum on the basis of ""lost opportunity"". 
     
      
     The appellants' case at the trial 
      
    50    On the issue of damages, the appellants called an agricultural expert, Ms Briget Jackson. She presented a report in opposition to that produced by Mr Ivey. She did not challenge his analysis of the relevant heads of damage but asserted that his calculations and estimates were incorrect for the reasons that she gave. She gave as her opinion that the amounts of loss for the 1993 and 1994 years should be very substantially reduced and that it was inappropriate to take the salary of a farm manager as the basis for the calculation of future loss. It was her view that the salary of a farm foreman was more appropriate for that purpose. 
    51    No other evidence was called, but both Mr Hannaford and Mr Ivey were extensively cross-examined in an attempt to obtain concessions that the post accident disabilities of Mr Hannaford had not affected his earnings, the theme being that Mr Hannaford by the exercise of his managerial skills, which were unaffected by the accident, had rearranged the activities of his existing work force with the result that there was no demonstrated need for the employment of additional labour in the past or in the future: furthermore, the results of the farming operation after the accident showed no compensable loss as the production was equivalent to or better than the Namoi average.  
    52    Other cross-examination was directed to the asserted lack of ability of Mr Hannaford to obtain the necessary finance to expand cotton farming on the existing properties or to acquire and develop a further property such as ""Runningbrook"". 
    53    These areas of attack may be seen as being distinct from attempts made to support, through the questioning of Mr Hannaford and Mr Ivey, the contentions made by Ms Jackson in opposition to those of Mr Ivey.  
     
      
     The judgment in the Court below 
      
    54    In relation to the losses of the financial years 1993 and 1994, his Honour accepted the approach of Mr Ivey, preferring his evidence to that of Ms Jackson. He did not deal in detail with the analysis provided by either witness of the particular heads of loss to which reference has been made. He gave a short reason for his general preference for Mr Ivey's evidence in these areas over that of Ms Jackson. That reason has not been attacked in this appeal. He accepted the total figure of $299,598, but took into account the ""adverse vicissitudes"" which may affect rural production. He considered that a further ten percent deduction would be appropriate to accommodate these vicissitudes. Accordingly he allowed, for these years, damages in the sum of $269,638. It is acknowledged by Mr Hannaford's counsel that a further reduction should have been made to take into account that this figure represented the losses of the ""Barokaville"" partnership of which Mr Hannaford was a member and not those of Mr Hannaford himself. This is a matter to which we shall return later in these reasons.  
    55    The primary judge favoured the view of Ms Jackson in relation to future losses. He considered that Mr Hannaford's residual disabilities were not of a sufficient order to require the employment of a farm manager. He accepted that, in accordance with the view of Ms Jackson, a full time working farm foreman would be adequate ""to undertake the bulk of the 'hands-on' work previously undertaken by the plaintiff”. In so doing, he inferentially rejected a later opinion given by Ms Jackson, in her oral evidence, to the effect that a part time foreman would suffice. There was evidence to indicate, in any event , that there were practical difficulties associated with the obtaining of the services of a part time foreman in the Walgett area. His Honour accepted therefore, on the basis of Ms Jackson's report, that damages for this aspect of Mr Hannaford's claim should be calculated on the basis of the cost of a full time working farm foreman at $47,000 per annum. This produced, to time of judgment, a figure of $130,155. 
    56    His Honour then took into account that Mr Hannaford was in partnership with his mother in relation to his farming activities. The partnership was an equal partnership. However, his Honour did not award damages on that basis. He dealt with the matter as follows:  
     
      
       
       It is well recognised in cases of this nature that due to the disproportionate input by one partner, a large share of compensatory damages may need to be allocated to that partner. See  
       Taraporewalla v Berkery 
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 28 and see also  
       Cole v Ellis 
        (1992) Aust Torts Reports 81-186 and  
       Zachopoulos v State Government Insurance Commission 
        (1986) Aust Torts Reports 80-023. 
       
      
      
       
       Taking into account the plaintiffs input to the partnership, and the fact that his mother resides away from the properties in Dubbo, and recognising also that the plaintiff is able to perform some physical work, an allowance of 85% of the amount of $130,155 is made ie $110,632 giving a total past economic loss figure of $380,270. 
       
      
    57    It is acknowledged by the respondents that his Honour erred in not applying the 15% reduction to the figure of $269,638.00 awarded for the years 1993 and 1994. This acknowledgment is obviously correct, and, in itself, is capable of being corrected under the ""slip rule"".  
    58    For the purpose of calculating future economic loss, the primary judge accepted as a basis the need for the assistance of a full time farm foreman until Mr Hannaford obtained the age of sixty-five. His Honour used the 5% discount tables and, allowing 15% for adverse vicissitudes, arrived at a figure of $471,717 which he further discounted to 85% of that figure ""due to the existence of the partnership and the plaintiffs residual capacity for manual work"", the final figure being $400,959. 
    59    In relation to the claim in respect of ""Runningbrook"" his Honour accepted that:  
     
      
       
       the development of 'Runningbrook' by the plaintiff was attractive to him, not only due to its convenient location, but also by virtue of the plaintiff having already available the necessary plant and equipment, as well as the expertise, to develop the property and also to achieve economies of scale. 
       
      
      
    60    Ms Jackson in her evidence had cast some doubt on the ability of Mr Hannaford to acquire ""Runningbrook"" through lack of available borrowings. His Honour dealt with this matter in his judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
       The defendants' expert, Ms Jackson, doubted the plaintiff’s capacity to borrow funds to finance the purchase based upon his banking history and the correspondence which passed between various lenders and the plaintiff. I have considered these opinions, however, when balanced against the plaintiffs achievements in financing his property purchases and effecting their development, I am satisfied that on the balance o)f probabilities, absent his injuries, the plaintiff would have been able to and probably would have purchased 'Runningbrook' and developed that property for cotton production. 
       
      
      
    61    The primary judge accepted that the purchase and development of ""Runningbrook"" was denied to Mr Hannaford because of his physical disabilities. He was not, however, prepared to accept a calculation of damages based upon an estimated loss of profits ""reduced to a weekly return (and) extrapolated in the matter customarily adopted to calculate an injured plaintiff’s future wage loss"". Instead, he approached the matter as follows: 
     
      
       
       The plaintiffs lost opportunity, although real and properly to be reflected in a lump sum of damages, does not, in the present case, permit of such precise calculation. The intrusion into the assessment of damages of a degree of guesswork is no novelty. In  
       Linsell  
       v  
       Robson  
       (1976) 1 NSWLR Mahoney JA (as he then was) said at p259: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I am conscious that, in the assessment of damages, there is necessarily involved something approaching guesswork, rather than estimation as to future events. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       And see also  
       Jones  
       v  
       Schiffmann  
       124 CLR 303 at 308 where Menzies J in considering damages recoverable by a widow in a Lord Campbell's Act claim said: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The assessment of damages, whether by a judge or a jury, does sometimes, of necessity, involve what is guesswork rather than estimation. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In the present case all the vagaries of rural endeavour must be given due weight, even though the plaintiff has, in my view, discharged the onus of establishing that on the probabilities he would have purchased and developed 'Runningbrook' and generated profit and capital gains from it. The amount of damages assessed as reflecting this lost opportunity is $150,000. 
       
      
      
      
     The appellant's submissions on appeal 
      
    62    The appellants' complaints, as indicated, relate to three areas of his Honour's judgment namely (a) past and future economic loss, (b) the ""Runningbrook"" award, and (c) the adequacy of the allowance in respect of the partnership. As well as a general claim that the damages awarded in these areas was excessive, an overriding claim is made that his Honour committed an error of law in either ignoring submissions made by the appellants in relation to these areas or in failing to give reasons for their rejection. It is difficult, of course, to countenance that his Honour, a most experienced trial judge, would have ignored the written submissions of the appellants. It was not seriously suggested that he had. Reliance was, rather, placed upon the absence of any indication in the judgment that they had been considered and rejected, there being no reasons given.  
    63    The main complaint made on behalf of the appellants is that his Honour failed to deal with a major submission that, notwithstanding that Mr Hannaford had demonstrated a loss of earning capacity, he had nevertheless failed to show that this had resulted in any financial loss (Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340; Medlin v State Government Insurance Commission (1994-95) 182 CLR 1). In the appellants' written submissions to his Honour, and also in this appeal, the point was made in various ways. It was said that ""the plaintiffs injuries have meant that he carries out his cotton farming business, in a modified way and with some difficulty, not necessarily resulting in quantifiable financial loss"".  It was submitted that ""it is clear that by organising the 'Barokaville' Partnership's affairs as he has and using the partnership's assets as he has, the plaintiff has commendably (in this context) overcome his disabilities"". It was put that all that Mr Hannaford should receive was lump sums for the loss of earning capacity awarded as a ""cushion"" rather than receiving damages ""calculated on a mathematical, week by week, month by month, or year by year basis"". It was said that ""to a large extent, the opinions of the experts called are not really of any great assistance"". It was further said that ""the expert evidence from both parties can only provide some guide to evaluating the success or otherwise of the Barokaville Partnership's business"". 
    64    In putting these arguments, the appellants were, to a considerable extent, abandoning the evidence that they had called through Ms Jackson; in particular, in relation to her calculations of future economic loss. It was a significant contention on the part of the appellants that Mr Hannaford had failed to demonstrate any financial loss arising from his impaired earning capacity, in that there was no evidence that he had in fact hired any substitute labour in the 1993 and 1994 years, or that he would be required to do so in the future. It was part of this submission that he had, with his existing labour force, managed to achieve production levels comparable to the ""Namoi average"". 
    65    In relation to the ""Runningbrook"" claim, arguments seem to have been put in the alternative. It was asserted in the first place that the ""Runningbrook"" acquisition was, in effect, a flight of fancy, because the partnership would not have been able to obtain finance to acquire the property or develop it. This had been Ms Jackson's original thesis, but, during the course of the trial, she changed her view and accepted that the finance might have become available because of the partnership's achievement of successful cotton farming results. Perhaps because of this, the alternative argument was put on behalf of the appellants that finance would reasonably have been available and, that being so, there was no demonstrated reason why Mr Hannaford should not have gone ahead with the ""Runningbrook"" acquisition, and consistently with his demonstrated ability to organise his workforce to overcome problems associated with his disabilities, should not also have undertaken the successful development of the property. Again, it was said, that no loss had been demonstrated as flowing from the impaired earning capacity. 
    66    As it was a major submission in the appeal that his Honour had erred by failing to give reasons for the rejection of the ""Graham v Baker"" submission, it is convenient, at this stage, to consider the law in relation to the requirement that a judge give reasons for his decision. 
    67    This topic received consideration in Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725. Samuels JA considered ""authorities which deal with the judicial obligation to give reasons"". His Honour said (at 728): 
     
      
       
       In  
       Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond  
       (1986) 159 CLR 656, the High Court (at 667) said that it was the right to describe the giving of reasons as 'an incident of the judicial process' although a normal but not a universal one. In  
       Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd  
       (1987) 10 NSWLR 274, McHugh JA (at 278) makes some comments upon that holding, and goes on to say (at 281) that the failure to explain the basis of a crucial finding of fact involves a breach of the principle that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. 
       
      
      
       
       Similarly, in my opinion, it is an incident of judicial duty for the judge to consider all the evidence in the case. It is plainly unnecessary for a judge to refer to all the evidence led in the proceedings or to indicate which of it is accepted or rejected. The extent of the duty to record the evidence given and the findings made depend, as the duty to give reasons does, upon the circumstances of the individual case. 
       
      
      
       
       Accordingly, a failure to refer to some of the evidence does not necessarily, whenever it occurs, indicate that the judge has failed to discharge the duty which rests upon him or her. However, for a judge to ignore evidence critical to an issue in a case and contract to an assertion of fact made by one party and accepted by the judge … may promote a sense of grievance in the adversary and create a litigant who is not only 'disappointed' but 'disturbed' - to use the words which appear in the New Zealand case of  
       Connell v Auckland City Council 
        [19771 NZLR 630 at 634. It tends to deny both the fact and the appearance of justice having been done. If it does … then it will have worked a miscarriage of justice and have produced a mis-trial and resulted in what I would take to be an error 
         
       of law which is reviewable on appeal. Whether it is an error of law or an error of fact, it seems to me a failure by the judge to do what the nature of the office requires. 
       
      
    68    This case was considered with approval in Kiama Constructions v Davey (1996) 40 NSWLR 639 where Meagher JA (at 647) emphasised that ""a .judge's duty to state his or her reasons for deciding does not exist in respect of every matter which is raised in proceedings"". 
    69    In Beale v Government Insurance Office (NSW) (1997) 25 MVR 373, the topic was visited in some detail by Meagher JA. It is convenient to refer to some portions only of his Honour's judgment. Thus, his Honour said (at 383): 
     
      
       
       A failure to provide sufficient reasons can and often does lead to a real sense of grievance that a party does not know or understand why the decision was made:  
       Re Poyser and Mills' Arbitration  
       [1964]2QB 467 at 478. This court has previously accepted the proposition that a judge is bound to expose his reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a losing party to understand why they lost:  
       Clutha Ltd v Risby  
       (NSW Court of Appeal, Clarke, Cole JJA and Hunter AJA, CA40460/94, 26 March 1996, unreported). 
       
      
      
    70    His Honour further said (at 384): 
     
      
       
       Just as the requirement to provide reasons depends on the particular matter, so too the content of the reasons depends on the particular circumstances of the matter being considered by the court. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       It follows, that reasons need not necessarily be lengthy or elaborate: 
        Ex parte Powter,.  
       Re  
       Powter  
       (1945) 46 SR(NSW) 1 at 5. The scope of the reasons to be given is, as Mahoney JA said in  
       Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar 
         
       Pastoral Co Pty Ltd  
       [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386, related 'to the function to be served by the giving of reasons'. Accordingly, the content of the obligation is not the same for every judicial decision. No mechanical formula can be given in determining what reasons are required. 
       
      
      
    71    His Honour then set out some matters which he regarded as fundamental elements of a statement of reasons but continued (at 385), saying: 
     
      
       
       While it is desirable to address these elements in giving reasons for decision, it is the purpose which the reasons serve which assumes primary importance in determining the content of the reasons. That purpose must be weighed against other considerations. It has been noted by this court that the content required of a statement of reasons is to be measured against the burden that the provision of reasons imposes on the judicial system:  
       Sinak v Tess 
        (NSW Court of Appeal, Mahoney, Meagher, Powell JJA, CA40734/91, 15 March 1995, unreported). .... In the end, the balancing act which needs to be undertaken in considering the sufficiency of a statement of reasons involves the adoption of, at the least, a minimum standard which places the parties in a position to understand why the decision was made sufficiently to allow them to exercise any right of appeal. 
       
      
      
    72    His Honour further said (at 386): 
     
      
       
       It does not automatically follow that because the reasons for decision are inadequate then an appealable error has occurred. Examination of nearly any statement of reasons with a fine tooth comb would throw up some inadequacies. Indeed, an appeal court will reserve any intervention to these situations in which it is left with no choice: where no reasons have been given in circumstances where there was an obligation to provide them and in circumstances where a statement of reasons is so inadequate as to constitute a miscarriage of justice. In other words, the statement of reasons must be looked at as a whole and the material inadequacies identified and considered. 
       
      
      
    73    Also of significance in the present case is the statement of Mahoney, JA in Housing Commission of NSW v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited (1983) 3 NSWLR 378 at 385-386 where his Honour said in relation to the judicial duty to state reasons: 
     
      
       
       However, such a duty does not exist in respect of every matter of fact or of law, which was or might have been raised in the proceedings. It is not the duty of the judge to decide every matter which is raised in argument. He may decide a case in a way which does not require the determination of a particular submission: in such a case he may put it aside or, as Lord Scarman said, merely salute it in passing:  
       R v Barnet London Borough Council 
       ,  
       Ex parte Nilish Shah 
        (1983) 2 AC 309 at 350. 
       
      
      
    74    In our opinion, it is quite clear that the obligation to provide reasons and also the extent of those reasons when provided, must depend very much upon the circumstances of the particular case and the reasoning process displayed by the judge in deciding the case. Statements made in other cases, appropriate to a failure to supply adequate reasons in those cases, should not be transposed and applied mechanically to other cases. A review of the evidence given in, and the general course of, a trial will, for the most part, indicate to an appellate court whether the trial judge's failure to make specific findings of fact or to record a submission, set out the judge's deliberations upon it and pronounce his or her conclusion, has had a vitiating effect upon the ultimate decision. If it can legitimately be said that a losing party would necessarily fail to understand from the judge's reasons why the litigant lost, or can properly harbour a feeling of injustice stemming from an apparent failure on the part of the judge to consider a critical submission, then it may be appropriate for an appellate court to intervene. Needless to say, it does not follow that because a judge has failed to refer to particular evidence or particular submissions, that they have not been taken into account. Other express findings may by their very nature indicate that arguments to the contrary of that finding have been rejected, or that evidence in support of that finding has necessarily been preferred to evidence to the contrary. Whether relevant injustice should be found to have occurred must very much depend upon the impression formed by a consideration of the content and course of the trial itself. 
    75    In the present case, it is correct that his Honour has not expressly dealt with the appellants' Graham v Baker point. But has it been shown that the appellants have been prejudiced thereby to the extent that this Court should set aside the judge's decision? Has relevant injustice been demonstrated? 
    76    In the first place, it is manifest that his Honour's omission has not prejudiced any right of appeal. The evidence exists. The detail of the submission exists because, pursuant to the judge's direction, it was presented in writing. Indeed, it is part of the submissions in this appeal that, alternatively to ordering a retrial, this Court should reassess the damages taking into account this very submission. 
    77    Could the appellants be in any real doubt that the judge considered the submission and supporting evidence? A consideration of the whole of the case satisfies us that the submission was necessarily considered, even if not dealt with expressly in the judgment. The assertion that Mr Hannaford had suffered no financial loss because he had been able to re-organise his existing workforce, using his residual managerial skills, so that no addition to the workforce was required and the cotton growing activities did not suffer was a constant refrain in the cross-examination of both him and Mr Ivey. It was frequently asserted, it was regularly denied. The whole thrust of Mr Ivey's evidence was to the effect that, had the plaintiff not suffered from residual physical disability, he could have developed the extra irrigation area on “Crossdale” in time for the 1993-94 cotton season, and thereby increased the profits for that season. It was nothing to the point that the crop was profitable, even more profitable than the “Namoi average”. Had the plaintiff not been impaired, it would have been more profitable still. The same may be said of Mr Ivey's opinion that the cotton yield in 1993 and 1994, reasonable though it was, could have been significantly improved if Mr Hannaford had been in a position to exercise his proven “hands-on” managerial skills. As already indicated, we are satisfied that Mr Ivey's expert views in this regard and in respect of other areas of the case were adequately underpinned by the medical evidence and the evidence of Mr Hannaford himself. 
    78    The fact that Mr Ivey's opinions were accepted indicates sufficiently, in the circumstances of this case, that the appellants' submission to the contrary was rejected. It would undoubtedly have been helpful if his Honour had recorded the submission and his reasons for rejecting it. It would have saved this Court the not inconsiderable labour of reading and considering the evidence relating to it. His failure to do so, however, does not amount to appellable error. The fact that Mr Hannaford, in his impaired state, was able to push the productivity of his farm to the level it reached in the relevant years proves only that he took commendable steps to mitigate his loss; it certainly does not establish that no loss occurred. His Honour's acceptance of Mr Ivey's analysis indicates that the appellants’ “Graham v Baker” argument was rejected. This is so obvious that there was no need for his Honour even to “salute it in passing”. This ground of appeal must fail. 
    79    No reason has been demonstrated as to why his Honour should not have accepted Mr Ivey's analysis of the plaintiff’s losses as against the countervailing analysis of Ms Jackson. This was very much a matter for his Honour's decision and was one in which his consideration of the reliability of the witnesses may have played a part. There is no basis for interfering with his findings based upon Mr Ivey's assessment of loss, other than a further deduction for the calculation because it was partnership loss and not the individual loss of Mr Hannaford. 
    80    Moreover, there appears no reason in principle why his Honour's choice of the cost of providing the wages of a full-time foreman as an appropriate measure of Mr Hannaford's loss of earning capacity should not be accepted. It was so accepted by the appellants' expert witness. It is manifestly not to the point that no such employment had taken place. Clearly the earning capacity of Mr Hannaford had been impaired in ways amply demonstrated in the evidence. To seek to restore it. by adding to his residual capacity, the efforts of a full-time foreman, who could undertake significant aspects of Mr Hannaford's previous work which were now denied him, is neither unreasonable nor illogical. The cost of its provision provides an appropriate approach to the quantification of Mr Hannaford's damage occasioned by the impairment of his earning capacity. This submission of the appellants must also fail. 
    81    We come, then, to the appeal in respect of his Honour's award relating to the property “Runningbrook”. It has already been mentioned that the appellants' case in this regard appears to be based upon two mutually exclusive alternative approaches, the first being that, having regard to past difficulties, Mr Hannaford would not have been able to raise the necessary finance to purchase the property. It was manifestly unnecessary for his Honour to refer to all the pieces of evidence which bore on this contention. The opinion originally expressed by Ms Jackson to the effect that the plaintiff would not have sufficient equity to found the necessary borrowing was departed from in the course of her evidence. His Honour has made an express finding that there would be no financial impediment. There can be no reason to disturb this finding either on the ground of absence of reasons or on the ground that it is, for some other reason, insupportable. Indeed, in submissions before us, the finding was embraced on behalf of the appellants who then went on to make a similar submission to that made in respect of the other aspects of economic loss, namely that the plaintiff had sufficient residual capacity and ability to organise his labour force to enable him to have consummated the purchase and entered upon the successful development of the property. His Honour made a clear finding that the plaintiff did not have the physical capacity to undertake this work. In so doing, he accepted the evidence of Mr Hannaford in this regard. Mr Hannaford's evidence and the supporting medical evidence produced a clear picture of a man who had striven to overcome his problems but had reached a point where it would not have been physically or psychologically possible for him to undertake the development of a fresh property. There is no ground demonstrated for disturbing his Honour's finding. His Honour had, therefore, the task of evaluating a lost opportunity. It is clear that he approached this task in a quite conservative way, refusing to accept submissions made on behalf of Mr Hannaford which would have produced a far larger award than his Honour in fact made. There is no reason why his Honour's award should be disturbed. 
    82    The final area of complaint made by the appellants relates to the primary judge's finding that, because of the existence of the partnership “Barokaville”, Mr Hannaford, in regard to all aspects of his economic loss, should receive 85% of the calculated losses. It has already been accepted that his Honour made a slip in not applying this percentage to the calculated losses for 1993 and 1994. The appellants' submission is, however, twofold, namely that his Honour provided no reasons for selecting 85% as the appropriate percentage and that, in any event, that percentage was overgenerous to Mr Hannaford. 
    83    At the relevant time, Mr Hannaford was in an equal partnership with his mother in the “Barokaville” Pastoral Company which conducted the relevant fanning operations. It was the appellants' contention that Mr Hannaford was entitled, by way of damages, to no more than 50% of the partnership losses. It may be noted that Mr Hannaford had submitted to his Honour that, having regard to the role he played in producing the partnership earnings, he should receive 100% of the amount. His Honour's reasons for making the award as he did have been set out earlier. They make no reference to the capital structure of the partnership. It was not contested that the property “Barokaville” was owned by the mother and that “Crossdale” and the property “Wolsley”, before it was sold, belonged to Hannaford. Also, the purchase moneys for “Crossdale” had been provided by Hannaford's bank on the security of a mortgage over his mother's house in Dubbo and the “Barokaville” property. Again, it is a matter for regret that these facts, which are relevant to a determination of the appropriate percentage, were not set out in his Honour's judgment; however, it would be quite unreasonable to assume that they were not taken into account. They are clearly referred to in the parties' submissions. The failure of his Honour to refer to them does not, in our opinion, vitiate his judgment. It also appears that an amount of $200,000 was paid to Mrs. Hannaford Snr. as “partnership salary” in the financial year 1993. The basis for this payment does not appear. The question is whether these facts, which have not been referred to specifically by his Honour, should result in some further deduction being made from the figure of 85% reached by his Honour. 
    84    His Honour gave consideration to the recognised authorities which are set out in his judgment. In Taroporewalla v Berkery [1983] 3 NSWLR 28, each member of the Court of Appeal (Hutley, Glass and Mahoney JJA) expressed the view that “the principles upon which an assessment should be made of the financial loss of a plaintiff who is disabled from working as a partner in a business have not been finally determined in this court” (per Glass JA at 29). 
    85    In Taroporewalla, the relevant partnership was one between husband and wife, it having been brought into existence for reasons relating to the reduction of tax on the business income. Mahoney JA, in whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, said (at 35): 
     
      
       
       There is, in my opinion, no single rule which determines the quantification of damages for a plaintiff in such a case. The damages to be awarded will depend on, inter alia, the nature of the partnership and the plaintiffs relationship to the income which would have been derived from it. 
        
        
       There are, of course, two principles which are fundamental: first, that the plaintiff is to be compensated only for the loss which he has actually suffered, in the past or prospectively; and, second, that that for which the plaintiff is to be compensated, in this regard, is loss of his capacity to derive reward from his efforts. 
       
      
      
    86    In the circumstances of the case, Mahoney JA had regard to the fact that the business had been the plaintiff’s and that the partnership had been formed as a matter of commercial convenience. He said (at 37): 
     
      
       
       He could have rearranged the terns of the partnership. And, in a practical sense, he could, I think, have appropriated to himself such portion of the partnership profits as he saw fit. Therefore I do not think that regard should be had only to 50 per cent of the potential partnership profits; his access to the rest of the partnership should be taken into account. 
       
      
      
     Mahoney JA, in these circumstances, held that the plaintiff should not be restricted to the 50% entitlement under the partnership and was prepared to award him 80% of the amount of the partnership losses. In  
     Zachopoulos v 
       
     State Government Insurance Commission  
     (1986) Aust Torts Reports, 80-023, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia considered how a plaintiff partner should be compensated for economic loss sustained through the partnership by his injuries. Bollen J, 
       
     in whose judgment the other members of the Court concurred, considered  
     Taroporewalla  
     in the following passage (at 76,733): 
      
       
       It is always the loss to the plaintiff which is to be considered. It is he who is to be compensated for his loss, the loss produced by his incapacity. The injured partner's loss will be determined as a starting point by the reduced income which he receives if no replacement is engaged and less work is done or by his share of the cost of replacement labour if it is engaged. There may be (usually there will be) other loss to the partnership. But the claim before the Court is the plaintiff’s claim. The Court must assess his loss. When it assesses that plaintiff’s loss for pre-trial loss of capacity to earn, the Court should, in my opinion, commence to assess the loss caused to the plaintiff by the expense of replacement labour in deciding what proportion of that expense is or was borne by that plaintiff. As we have seen from  
       Taroporewalla v Berkery 
        (supra) that proportion may not be the same as the plaintiff’s percentage of profits as expressed in the partnership agreement. But that 'percentage' and the work and effort which the plaintiff put into the business are relevant. The partner who does all the work will no doubt be entitled to have the full cost of replacement labour taken as the starting point. 
        
        
       I think that in general the starting point should be the proportion of the loss, ie the loss by reference to the plaintiff’s share in the expense of substitute labour or in the loss sustained. But share does not encompass only 'share of income'. It is the loss to the plaintiff himself not the whole loss to the partnership which must be ascertained as a starting point. Sometimes the two will be the same, or nearly the same. In  
       Taroporewalla v Berkery 
        the plaintiff’s contribution to the partnership was held in fact to be 80% despite his entitlement in the books of a partnership to 50% of the profits. If a man has an inactive partner who does no more than lend his name for tax purposes to the partnership then the active partner may well be entitled to the whole cost of replacement labour engaged during his incapacity. It may be, too, that on some occasions it can be shown that not only is a loss occasioned by the cost of engaging replacement labour but that there is some diminution of profit because the substitute labour works less vigorously or less skilfully or for a lesser time than did the injured partner. That can be taken into account. 
       
      
      
     (See al-so  
     Cole v Ellis 
       
     (1992) Aust. Torts Reports, 81-186;  
     Future Look

     (8 July 1998, NSW Court of Appeal unreported);  
     Ward v Newalls Insulation Co Ltd  
     [  
     1 9981 1 WLR 1722.) 
      
    87    Authority in Queensland had favoured the position that the assessment of damages payable to an injured partner must reflect his or her entitlement to partnership profits at the time of the accident. (Seymour v Gough [1996] 1 QdR 89; Hoskins v Hoskins (21 August 1998, Qld Court of Appeal unreported).) Since we reserved our decision in this case, however, Seymour has been considered by the High Court in Husher v Husher [1999] HCA 47. In the majority decision (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) it is said that ""if the decision in Seymour v Gough was intended to establish some principle that a plaintiff, who at the time of the accident was a partner in a business, can never recover more for loss of future earning capacity than a sum calculated by reference to the plaintiff’s past share of partnership profits, it is wrong and should be over-ruled"". Their Honours emphasised that each case will turn on its own facts. In this regard, they said as follows: 
     
      
       
       Deciding what value is to be ascribed to the loss of future earning capacity of an injured plaintiff requires close attention to the facts of each case. The task is not one to be undertaken by seeking to classify cases as concerning 'sole traders' or ‘partnerships’ or ‘wage-earners’ or 
        ‘ 
       trading trusts’, and then attempting to deduce some rule of general application to all cases falling within the classification thus devised. Rather the inquiry is about what could the plaintiff have done in the workforce but for the accident and what sum of money would the plaintiff have had at his or her disposal. Only when those inquiries are pursued can a judgment be made about what capital sum to allow as damages for the impairment of the plaintiff's earning capacity. In doing so, regard must be had, of course, to all those contingencies of life that might reasonably be expected to affect the course of events in the future. 
       
      
      
    88    It is clear in the present case that the plaintiff’s elderly mother made no contribution whatever to the work of the partnership, which was terminable at will. She had in fact retired some time before to a cottage in Dubbo. The work and planning involved in producing the cotton growing enterprise on “Barokaville”, which had previously been devoted to dry farming only, and all the other cotton production undertaken by the partnership was solely the work of Mr Hannaford himself. Had the contribution of Mrs. Hannaford Snr been no more than the lending of her name, there would have been a strong case for the allowance to Mr Hannaford of 100% of the losses occasioned by his injuries. In fact, Mrs Hannaford Snr did more than lend her name. Part of the cotton growing enterprise was conducted on land at “Barokaville”. Also, she provided mortgage security to enable the enterprise to be financed. There can be no doubt, however, that the whole of the development of the business and its earning capacity was attributable to the very significant input of managerial skills and rural expertise of Mr Hannaford himself. In our view, the case is one where it would be reasonable to depart from the percentages fixed by what was obviously a loose partnership arrangement. The selection of an appropriate percentage is obviously one upon which different minds would reach different results. We are not persuaded that his Honour's selection of 85% was, in all the circumstances, incorrect. We decline to interfere with it. 
    89    In the result, the only alteration to his Honour's judgment should be the re-calculation of the amount of $269,638.00 awarded for economic loss for the years ending 30th June 1993 and 30th June 1994 to $229,192.00 to take account of the fact that the 15% reduction should also have been applied to that figure. 
    90    Mr Hannaford's damages may therefore be summarised as follows: 
     
       
     1 Out-of-pocket expenses $30,342 
      
       
     2 Non economic loss 129,250 
      
      3 Past economic loss 339,824 
      
      4 Future economic loss 400,959 
      
      5 Future medical expenses 55,000

     Cross-appeal 
      
    91    By cross-appeal the respondent Mr Hannaford challenges the trial judge's decision not to allow interest with reference to past economic loss and the cost of modification of farm facilities. 
    92    Section 73(1) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 provides that a plaintiff has only such right to interest on damages payable in relation to a motor accident as is conferred by the section. For present purposes it is sufficient to observe that s73(4) provides that interest is not payable on relevant heads of damages unless the requirements set out in s73(4)(a) are met. These requirements include s73(4)(a)(iv). If the defendant has made an offer of settlement, the amount of all damages of any kind awarded by the court (without the addition of any interest) must be more than 20 per cent higher than the highest amount offered by the defendant and the highest amount must be unreasonable, having regard to the information available to the defendant when the offer was made. Section 73(4)(b) provides that the highest amount offered by the defendant is not unreasonable if, when the offer was made, the defendant was not able to make a reasonable assessment of the plaintiff’s full entitlement to all damages of any kind. 
    93    Ireland J declined to order interest even though the highest offer made by the defendants was an offer made during the trial (on 4 September 1996) of $500,000 plus costs inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses agreed at $30,342. This fell well short of the 20 per cent differential stipulated in s73(4)(a)(1v). His Honour concluded that the defendants were not able to make a reasonable assessment of the plaintiffs full entitlement to all damages and, applying s73(4)(b), held that the defendants' settlement offer was not unreasonable. 
    94    This Court was informed that counsel for the plaintiff had offered to settle for the sum of $670,000 on 4 September 1996. That offer was rejected later that day by the defendants' counsel who made a counter offer of $500,000 inclusive of agreed out-of-pocket expenses of $30,342 plus costs. The plaintiff’s counsel rejected this offer while confirming preparedness to accept $670,000. It is not entirely clear whether the plaintiff’s offers were plus costs or inclusive of costs, but nothing turns upon this. 
    95    Ireland J said that he regarded as relevant the position adopted by the plaintiff when faced with the defendants’ offer. He acknowledged that the plaintiff’s counter offer did not fall within the description of “the information available to the defendant” when the defendants’ offer was made but, nevertheless considered it of some assistance in assessing the reasonableness of the defendants' offer. 
    96    We are doubtful about this proposition, although it is not critical to our decision. Nor could we accept that the matter would be any different had his Honour been intending to refer to the reasonableness of the defendants’ position in the light of the plaintiff s earlier offer. We do not see how the reasonableness of a defendant’s bargaining position can be affected by a figure put and rejected on the very day in which the defendant makes an offer which falls dramatically short of the ultimate verdict. The purpose of this part of s73 is to encourage settlement and to sanction a defendant which does not act realistically, excepting cases where the inability to have made a realistic offer was hampered by the absence of relevant available information. The figure at which a plaintiff may be prepared to settle is not itself of that nature. Were it otherwise, a plaintiff desperate to settle for personal reasons whose own best offer came very close to that of the defendant would be unable to recover interest on items of economic loss even if the verdict revealed the defendant's best offer as grossly inadequate. Accordingly, we think his Honour probably had regard to an irrelevant factor. 
    97    But this was not the only or the principal factor taken into account. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       The aspect of the claim which weighs heavily upon my mind, so far as interest is concerned, is that the true nature of the claim in this case did not, it seems to me, really emerge until the evidence had been concluded, that is to say, the evidence called on behalf of the defendant as well as that called on behalf of the plaintiff. To make a reasonable assessment in view of what were the diametrically opposed views of the experts called to give evidence on the economic material was a very difficult task indeed. ... 
        
       
      
    98    To our mind there is a factual and a philosophical difficulty with this approach. The factual difficulty is that the plaintiff had amended his particulars much earlier - at callover - to allege the new head of future economic loss based on future loss of opportunity. His expert's report set forth the basis upon which that claim was based. The only thing that happened at trial in this regard was that Mr Ivey (the expert) revised downwards his figures in the light of the evidence and what was put to him in cross-examination. The defendants had the plaintiff’s particulars and his expert’s report well before trial. They obtained their own expert’s report. Armed with all of this material, they made their own settlement offer. 
    99    The philosophical difficulty relates to the function of a provision such as s73(4). Clearly it is aimed at encouraging litigants to give serious consideration to the settlement of proceedings. The function of such provisions is discussed in Morgan v Johnson (1998) 44 NSWLR 578 at 581-2. Mason P was there speaking of familiar provisions found in the Supreme Court Rules and District Court Rules which indicate that the usual order for costs is generally to be departed from if a party does not accept what turns out in the light of the judgment to have been a reasonable settlement offer. Section 73(4) works a little differently, but the rationale is the same. For s73(4) (as for the provisions under the rules) it is true to say (in the words of Mason P in Morgan at 582): 
     
      
       
       Lying behind [the section] is the common knowledge that litigation is inescapably chancy…. For this reason, the ordinary provision is expected to apply in the ordinary case. ... 
       
      
      
    100    The fact that the experts called by each party may have expressed “diametrically opposed views” is therefore a matter of little relevance in itself. Just as a plaintiff may rely to his or her cost upon the advice of a solicitor or barrister in deciding whether to reject a settlement offer made by a defendant, so too a defendant who seeks to draw comfort from the fact that his or her expert may have encouraged the settlement offer to be pitched too low should not, in itself, make reasonable a defendant's offer falling below the s73(4)(a)(iv) threshold. 
    101    In our view his Honour erred in concluding that the defendants’ offer was ""not unreasonable"".  His Honour took into account irrelevant considerations. Excluding those considerations and having regard to (a) the information in the defendants' grasp when they made their offer, and (b) the extent of the gap between the defendants’ best offer and the ultimate verdict, this was a proper case to order interest with respect to economic loss. 
    102    We would therefore uphold the cross-appeal. It will be necessary for the parties to calculate the appropriate sum. 
    103    The orders of the Court are: 
     
     1. The appeal in relation to economic loss for the years ending 30 June 1993 and 30 June 1994 is upheld but otherwise the appeal is dismissed with costs. 
      
     2. Cross-appeal upheld with costs. 
      
     3. The parties to bring in short minutes of order within fourteen days to give effect to the Court's reasons.

     REGINA v Robert Lloyd NELSON 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    2    SPERLING J: On 16 October 1998, the appellant was convicted of the following offences in a trial before Grogan DCJ and a jury: first, that on 24 June 1996 at Holsworthy he stole motor vehicle registration no. TXM 901; secondly, that on 29 June 1996 at Birrong, being armed, he assaulted Lynne Williams with intent to rob her; thirdly, that on 29 June 1996 at Birrong, being armed, he robbed John Waterson; and, fourthly, that on 29 June 1996, being armed, he robbed Marie Nicolaou.  
     
      
       
      
    3    So far as concerns the events of 29 June 1996, the Crown case was as follows. The accused entered the Tuckerbag Supermarket at Birrong. He held a sawn-off shotgun against Ms Williams, an employee, demanding money from a cash register. She noticed a green coloured tattoo on the back of one of the appellant’s hands. The cash register failed to open.  
     
      
       
      
    4    Another employee, Mr Waterson, was then accosted by the appellant. Money was again demanded and was given to the appellant from one of the cash registers. 
     
      
       
      
    5    Another employee, Ms Nicolaou handed over further money on demand. She also noticed a green coloured tattoo on the back of one of the offender’s hands. The appellant had tattoos on his hands similar to those described by the witnesses. 
     
      
       
      
    6    On 30 June 1996, Mr Waterson made a picture identification of the appellant from eleven photographs shown to him by the police.  
     
      
       
      
    7    Many months later, Ms Williams, Ms Nicolaou and another employee who was in the store at the time, Ms Pignat, each, separately, failed to make a positive identification from a video of still photographs, although Ms Nicolaou selected two of the pictures as being similar to the robber, one of which was a picture of the appellant taken on 7 August 1996 after his arrest. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The appellant has appealed against the convictions relating to the offences alleged to have occurred on 29 June 1996. The grounds of appeal are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
       (1) That the trial judge wrongly admitted evidence of identification by photograph. 
        
        
       (2) That the convictions on all counts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
      
    9    Before the jury was empanelled, counsel for the appellant sought a ruling that the evidence of picture identification by Mr Waterson should be excluded. His Honour refused the application and gave reasons in a judgment published on 12 February 1999. Several grounds for exclusion of the evidence were advanced of which the only one now relied upon is that the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to the exercise of his Honour’s discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The evidence tendered on the voir dire included statements by a number of Crown witnesses, a substantial portion of the transcript of evidence on the voir dire given at a previous trial, a series of still photographs shown by the police to Mr Waterson and part of a police note book. This evidence was, materially, to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
       (a) Mr Waterson had the offender under observation for three to four minutes. 
        
        
       (b) He gave an oral description of the offender to the police (including approximate, age, height, build, hair colour and hair length) which included no unusual features. The offender was wearing sun glasses. 
        
        
       (c) At the time of the offence, the appellant was at large, having escaped from lawful custody the previous month. He was not recaptured until some weeks later. 
        
        
       (d) At the time of the offence the police had a photograph of the appellant taken at an earlier time. On 30 June 1996, Mr Waterson was shown a series of colour photographs which included the photograph of the appellant and photographs of other males of a similar age to that of the appellant. The photographs were all of the same style: face on, head and shoulders. 
        
        
       (e) Immediately before Mr Waterson looked through the photographs, the police officer said to him “John, if you saw a photograph of the man that held you up yesterday do you think you’d recognise him?” to which Mr Waterson replied that he would. The officer continued, “I have a number of pieces of paper here, each with pictures of males on them. Have a look at them and tell me if you see any person you recognise.” 
        
        
       (f) Mr Waterson selected the appellant’s photograph from the series and put it to one side. He then placed a further two photographs beside it and continued to look through the rest. He came to the end and said, “No, that is definitely him. Put the glasses on (meaning the sun glasses the offender was wearing) and that’s him. I’d rather not look at him actually, it gives me the creeps.” 
        
       
      
    11    It was submitted on appeal that the evidence was of very low probative value. 
     
      
       
      
    12    I recognise the limitations of the evidence. There are the inherent risks of error in picture identification generally. Mr Waterson was distressed at the time of the offence, when he had the offender under observation. There was no special facial or other feature in the offender’s appearance. The offender was wearing sun glasses which would have obscured his eyes and the adjacent area of the face.  
     
      
       
      
    13    It was also submitted that the probative value of the evidence was reduced by the words used by the police when Mr Waterson was asked to look at the pictures. I agree that the words used carried the implication that the police believed the photographs included a photograph of a person suspected of being the offender. That would have engendered in the mind of the witness an expectation that a photograph of the offender was likely to be there. There was then the risk that the witness would be influenced to select the photograph in the series which most resembled the offender rather than a photograph, if any, which strongly corresponded with the witness’ recollection of the offender’s appearance. I take these considerations into account. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Notwithstanding these considerations, the only finding reasonably open to the trial judge was, in my view, that the evidence had substantial probative value. That was particularly so when it was known that Mr Waterson’s evidence would be supported to some extent by other evidence, namely:  
     
      
       
        
       (a) Ms Williams and Ms Nicolaou observed a green tattoo on the back of the offender’s hand. The offender had a green tattoo on the back of each hand. 
        
        
       (b) Ms Nicolaou, some months later, selected two photographs from a series as depicting persons who resembled the offender. One of the two photographs was a photograph of the appellant. 
        
       
      
    15    As to unfair prejudice, the submissions on appeal were as follows. There would be evidence that the appellant had not yet been apprehended when a photograph of the appellant was shown to Mr Waterson by the police on 30 June 1996. The jury would, accordingly, infer that the appellant was known to the police at the time of the offence, and that he was adversely known to the police for this type of offence because the police would have included photographs only of likely suspects. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The second limb of this submission is a non sequitur and can be disregarded. I am prepared to accept for the purposes of the argument that it was to be anticipated that the jury would infer that the appellant was or was likely to have been adversely known to the police. That would be prejudicial to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    17    I am inclined to think that a jury to have reason to believe that the accused was or was likely to have been adversely known to the police prior to the offence is always unfairly prejudicial because of the risk that the jury might misuse that information as tendency evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    18    It might not be material that the police had no alternative but to proceed as they did, as was the case here. (The police had no way of knowing when the appellant would be apprehended. Meanwhile, using an existing photograph of the appellant for identification purposes was the only way for the police to find out if the appellant was the person to be charged with these offences.) I put that consideration aside. 
     
      
       
      
    19    For a jury to know that the accused has a prior criminal record or is adversely known to the police does not necessarily render the trial unfair. Take the ordinary case of a crime committed in prison. See also Cook (1998) 126 NTR 17 and Richards (CCA (NSW), 27 November 1995, unreported). 
     
      
       
      
    20    Where the prejudice arises from the use of a police photograph taken before arrest for the subject offence, s 115(7) operates. The jury is to be warned that they must not assume that the accused has a criminal record or has previously been charged with an offence. The section carries the expectation of the legislature that use of such a photograph will not necessarily render the evidence inadmissible. The second point to be made about the section is that the direction mitigates the prejudice, if it does not eradicate it. The direction was to be given in this case. 
     
      
       
      
    21    This was, in my view, a clear case. The trial judge could not reasonably have exercised his discretion otherwise than to hold that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 
     
      
       
      
    22    Without intending any disrespect for Mr Doris’ careful argument, it is unnecessary, in these circumstances, to examine his Honour’s reasons for allowing the evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    23    Ground 1 fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
        
       
      
    24    The relevant test for miscarriage of justice in this case is whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439; Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106. 
     
      
       
      
    25    The argument was commendably limited in its scope. It was that the picture identification by Mr Waterson was insufficient to satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the offender. 
     
      
       
      
    26    The points made in support of this ground are substantially the same as those made to impugn the probative value of Mr Waterson’s evidence under the first ground. 
     
      
       
      
    27    Mr Waterson’s evidence came out much as was anticipated when his Honour ruled on its admissibility. If anything, Mr Waterson pitched the level of confidence with which he had made the identification somewhat higher than appeared from the police record of the identification process. The tattoo evidence came out as anticipated. So too the resemblance evidence to which I have referred. There was no significant inconsistency in the descriptions of the offender given by the witnesses to the occurrence. 
     
      
       
      
    28    In the circumstances, Ground 2 is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
       Appeal against sentence 
        
       
      
    29    The application for leave to appeal against sentence arises only in the event of the appellant being successful in his appeal against conviction for the offences committed on 29 June 1996. That appeal having failed, the appeal against sentence does not arise for consideration. 
     
      
       
        
        
       Result 
        
       
      
    30    The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
       (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       (2) Application for leave to appeal against sentence dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONCONSTRUCTION LISTFOSTER AJFRIDAY 30 JULY 1999 55032/91 AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PTY LTD v ALLCO STEEL CORPORATION PTY LTD & ANOR REASONS FOR JUDGMENT1    In these proceedings, the plaintiff, Australian Development Corporation Pty Ltd (ADC), claims damages against the first defendant, Allco Steel Corporation Pty Ltd (Allco), for conversion by Allco of two separate tonnages of steel consisting partly of lengths of raw steel and also of portions of steel upon which fabrication work had been performed by Allco. The steel had been purchased by Allco for the performance of a contract with White Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (White) for the fabrication and erection of steel work in a large building project in Canberra known as the Quadrant project. White had entered into a construction contract, as builder, with ADC, as owner/developer of the project.  
    2    In the proceedings, the two lots of steel were referred to respectively as the “October steel” and the “November steel”. These descriptions arose from the fact that the October steel, totalling 503.27 tonnes, was the subject of a progress payment claim made by Allco in that month of 1987 and the November steel, totalling 398.57 tonnes, was the subject of a similar claim in November.  
    3    Both lots of steel were retained by Allco at its premises at Tomago near Newcastle, prior to their being used in the construction work in Canberra. After the happening of events which do not require description in these reasons, the contract between ADC and White was terminated in August 1988 and the steel, the subject of these proceedings, was sold by Allco in February and March of 1989. The sale was without the consent of ADC which claimed to be the owner of the steel. 
    4    An order was made in these proceedings by Rolfe J that the issue of liability be determined separately from the issue of damages. In the liability proceedings, Allco disputed that ADC had title to the steel. As a result of decisions made by Rolfe J and by the Court of Appeal, it has been held that ADC was the owner of both lots of steel and that Allco converted each lot by the above referred to sales.  
    5    Accordingly, the only issue for my determination is the quantum of damages to be awarded to ADC against Allco as compensation for these torts. 
    6    It has been agreed during the hearing of the proceedings before me that the amount of fabricated steel converted was in fact 510 tonnes and the amount of raw steel was 391.84 tonnes. It has also been agreed that if I find damages for ADC on the basis that it was entitled to the reasonable cost of replacement of the steel, both raw and fabricated, then damages should be assessed in the sum of $1,020,155, this being the lesser of two calculations of damages, on a replacement basis, provided by ADC. 
    7    If I do not find damages on the “replacement” basis, then the contest between the parties is as to whether I should award damages based upon the price obtained by Allco when it sold the steel in 1989 or whether I should find a higher figure related to calculations introduced into the case by ADC by way of expert testimony.  
    8    It appears that work on the Quadrant project effectively came to an end in 1987 about 17 months before the sale of the steel by Allco in 1989. As already indicated, the head contract was terminated in August 1988. The steel in question remained at Tomago throughout this period. It was stored in the open at Allco’s premises. It was exposed to the elements which occasioned some deterioration through rust. There was a dispute before me as to the extent of that deterioration and its effect upon the utility of the steel for the Quadrant project or for any other building project. Part of the steel had been dealt with for the purpose of producing beams and columns and other structural members in conformity with the structural steel plans for the Quadrant project. The raw steel which had been purchased by Allco for use in the project had, therefore, been modified by its being cut into required lengths and having affixed thereto base plates, cleats, and bracing of various kinds. Also, holes were drilled in portions of it in conformity with the plans. The remaining raw steel consisted of beams, columns and sheets of structural steel in certain lengths and thicknesses which had not been subjected to fabrication. 
    9    There was some brief and imprecise evidence that certain types of beams and columns amongst the raw material were of a kind commonly used in construction work. However this does not detract from the fact that the raw steel was specially purchased and appropriated for use in the Quadrant project. It was specially identified and specially stored in Allco’s premises for removal to the Quadrant site when required. 
    10    It was the contention of Allco that by the time the steel was sold, it was, by and large, in such a deteriorated condition as to be unsuitable for use in any major building project. This deterioration had been caused by severe rusting. It was the contention of ADC that such rusting as had occurred was not such as to prevent it being used in the Quadrant project or any similar project. The rust could be removed by normal procedures in Allco’s fabrication works and the steel readily brought back to suitable condition. I do not propose to review the whole of the evidence given on this particular topic. On Allco’s part, evidence was given by Mr Rowland, who was the project manager for Allco at the time. This was supported by Mr Faulkner, who had purchased the steel on behalf of Balcomb Recyclers Pty Ltd (Balcomb). I was not particularly impressed with the evidence of these witnesses. Mr Faulkner had to concede that the description of the steel given in his first evidentiary statement was quite incorrect. Mr Rowland, while steadfastly maintaining the opinion he expressed as to the deteriorated condition of the steel, was, nevertheless, forced to concede that, had a proposition, made in late 1988, that the project should go ahead with Allco dealing directly with ADC, resulted in agreement, then the allegedly deteriorated steel would have been used in the building work. He would not have taken steps to prevent this occurring, despite his views as to the deteriorated condition of the steel. He also gave evidence that certain rust flakes tendered in the case, were typical of the condition of the surface of the steel. I found this evidence to be quite unacceptable. I do not accept the evidence of these witnesses as to the condition of the steel. However I accept that some deterioration had occurred. 
    11    I am satisfied that the steel, fabricated and unfabricated, was not in a significantly deteriorated condition. I am fortified in this view by evidence called on behalf of ADC to the effect that the steel was observed to be carefully and properly stored in Allco’s yard by Mr Hardie, who had the responsibility of inspecting it on behalf of ADC, to ensure that it had been purchased by Allco and allocated to the contract, so that claims for progress payments could be processed. Also, compelling evidence was given by expert witnesses called by ADC as to the fairly minor degree of deterioration that might have been expected, having regard to the period and nature of its exposure to the elements.  
    12    As indicated, it was ADC’s main contention that its damages should be assessed in a sum sufficient to cover the cost of replacement of the steel in its fabricated and raw form. It also submitted that, in so far as it might receive, by such an award, an amount based upon the provision of new, undeteriorated, steel, then it was entitled to such an award because Allco, as tortfeasor, had put it in the position where steel would have to be re-purchased and re-fabricated in order that it could be restored, so far as possible, to the position which it would have occupied had the tort not been committed. This approach was contested by Allco. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider, briefly, the law relating to the measure of damages in conversion. 
    13    In this regard, I have been assisted by the submissions of counsel during which I was taken to a number of decided cases and textbook references. I need not refer to them in detail. 
    14    It is clear that the normal measure of damages for conversion is the “value” of the goods converted. The word “value” is, of course, quite ambiguous. As is said in Ogus - The Law of Damages 1973 (at 122):  
     
      
       
       “… “value” as a legal concept has no single ascertainable meaning. It is one of those abstract legal words which varies in its import according to its context and its purpose within that context. By itself it offers no guidance as to how the “valuation” should be accomplished. To state, as courts frequently do in damages cases, that the plaintiff is entitled to “the value of his property” is not to conclude the inquiry as to the assessment of compensation but to commence it.” 
       
      
    15    It is also clear that there is no hard and fast rule that, in all cases where a plaintiff’s goods have been converted so that they cannot be returned to him, he is entitled to damages from the defendant based upon the cost of replacement of the goods. This is demonstrated quite clearly in the decision of the High Court in Butler v Egg and Egg Pulp Marketing Board (1966) 114 CLR 185, where the Court refused to award to the Board the total cost of eggs to which it was statutorily entitled, but which had been converted by their sale by the producer to a third party. It was said by Taylor and Owen JJ (at 191) that the “principle is that the injured party should receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do so, will put him in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed or the tort had not been committed … And this principle is as much applicable to actions of conversion as it is to the case of other actionable wrongs. In most cases of conversion it is, of course, obvious that its application will result in the injured plaintiff recovering the full value of the property converted since that will usually represent the loss that he has sustained by the defendant’s wrongful act. Hence the statement which appears so often in the books that the general rule is that the plaintiff in an action of conversion is entitled to recover the full value of the goods converted, but this statement should not be allowed to obscure the broad principle that damages are awarded by way of compensation.” 
    16    In the same case, Menzies J said (at 192): 
     
      
       
        “There is no hard and fast rule that the value of the goods at the time of a conversion is always the measure of the damages to be assessed for the conversion. Often the application of such a rule would produce an obviously unjust result - for example, if goods converted by a defendant had since been recovered by the plaintiff-owner. The true rule is, I think, that stated by Bramwell B. in  
       Chinery v. Viall 
       , viz. that the plaintiff is entitled to recover no more than the real damage he has sustained.” 
       
      
    17    I should also make reference to two earlier cases which are relied upon by ADC to support the proposition that the appropriate award of damages in the present case is one that will provide “replacement” value to the plaintiff, it being submitted that such an award is necessary to provide it with restitutio in integrum.  
    18    The first case is The Mediana [1900] AC 113. This did not involve an action in conversion. However, the speeches contain statements which have had a bearing upon awards of damages for that tort. A lightship belonging to a harbour board was damaged by the negligence of the appellant. The board substituted another lightship for the damaged lightship during the period that repairs were being effected. The substitute lightship was regularly maintained and kept in reserve to meet such an emergency. The cost of maintaining it would have been required whether or not it was used for that purpose. The question was whether a head of damage for “hire of the services” of the substitute lightship could be recovered. The following passage appears in the speech of the Earl of Halsbury LC (at 117): 
     
      
       
       “Now, in the particular case before us, apart from a circumstance which I will refer to immediately, the broad proposition seems to me to be that by a wrongful act of the defendants the plaintiffs were deprived of their vessel. When I say deprived of their vessel, I will not use the phrase “the use of the vessel.” What right has a wrongdoer to consider what use you are going to make of your vessel? More than one case has been put to illustrate this: for example, the owner of a horse, or of a chair. Supposing a person took away a chair out of my room and kept it for twelve months, could anybody say you had a right to diminish the damages by shewing that I did not usually sit in that chair, or that there were plenty of other chairs in the room? The proposition so nakedly stated appears to me to be absurd; but a jury have very often a very difficult task to perform in ascertaining what should be the amount of damages of that sort. I know very well that as a matter of common sense what an arbitrator or a jury very often do is to take a perfectly artificial hypothesis and say, “Well, if you wanted to hire a chair, what would you have to give for it for the period”; and in that way they come to a rough sort of conclusion as to what damages ought to be paid for the unjust and unlawful withdrawal of it from the owner. Here, as I say, the broad principle seems to me to be quite independent of the particular use the plaintiffs were going to make of the thing that was taken, except - and this I think has been the fallacy running through the arguments at the bar - when you are endeavouring to establish the specific loss of profit, or of something that you otherwise would have got which the law recognises as special damage.” 
       
      
    19    These remarks of Lord Halsbury were considered by Lord Roche in Caxton Publishing Co Ltd v Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd [1939] AC 178 at 192 where he said of the measure of damages in conversion: 
     
      
       
       “There is no dispute but that the measure of damages is the value of the thing converted at the time of the conversion. It is true enough to say that the value is the value to the owner; but it is wrong to say this if you mean what the owner will make out of the thing in money if it is not taken away from him. This latter idea was repelled by this House in a series of cases dealing with such trespasses to goods as deprived the owner of them temporarily. They were cases where the owner either did not use the things at all or not for money gain, for example, spare lightships and dredgers.  
       The Mediana 
        is an instance. It was said in the judgment of Lord Halsbury L.C. in that case that, if the owner of a chair was deprived of it, it was no ground for giving nominal damages that he did not want to sit upon it: and that it might be necessary in such cases to resort to a variety of tests of value during the time of deprivation … So with permanent deprivation or wrongful appropriation of a chattel one of a variety of tests may be the best available test of value according to circumstances.” 
       
      
    20    The case of J & E Hall Ltd v Barclay [1937] 3 All ER 620 is, perhaps, the most closely analogous to the present one. It is heavily relied upon by ADC. In it the respondent company had worked for the appellant in the erection and testing of experimental davits of which the appellant was the inventor. After experiments had been conducted, the davits were dismantled. They were kept by the respondent company for a number of years. It then sold them as scrap. The appellant claimed damages for conversion and, at first instance, was awarded their scrap value as damages. It was held on appeal, however, that the appropriate measure of damages was the cost of replacement. Greer LJ (at 623), having said that the proper measure of damages was the value of the converted article, then said: “Then the question is, what is the meaning of “the value of that article”?” Having indicated that “a man whose rights have been interfered with is never entitled to more than what he would have to pay to buy a similar article in the market”, his Lordship then turned to consider what the appropriate measure should be in circumstances where there was no available market. He said (at 624): 
     
      
       
        “Now, if there had been a market for the davits, to which the appellant could have gone on the day after he was wrongfully deprived of his davits, and bought them at an agreed price, however much lower that might be or however much higher it might be than what he had originally paid for them, he would have been entitled to the cost of replacement by getting them in the market. But, if he cannot get them in the market, what is his position? He must do that which is analogous to getting them in the market, namely, he must go to the only people from whom he can get goods to put him into the same position as he would have been in if his davits had never been taken away from him, that is to say, he must go to the manufacturer and see for what price the manufacturer will supply him with similar goods … [The plaintiff was] entitled as of right … to say, “I want my goods. If you do not give me back my goods, then you must pay me what I would have to pay in order to put myself into the same position as I would have been in if you had complied with my demand for the goods. I want them for the purposes of further experiments, in order that I may satisfy myself that the design of these davits, and possibly the design of improved davits, may be improved upon.” 
       
      
    21    The plaintiff was, accordingly, entitled to receive as damages the cost of the re-manufacture of the davits. 
    22    It is to be noted that the passage quoted refers specifically to the fact that the plaintiff wanted to use the davits for further experiments. In such circumstances, it was inappropriate to regard them as scrap metal. 
    23    This case has been the subject of comment in leading texts. Thus in McGregor on Damages, 15th Ed., at 808, the learned author says that in Hall v Barclay, the plaintiff was not limited to the scrap value of the davits “but could recover the cost of obtaining replacements in the absence of a market in which such goods could be bought ready made. There was evidence that the plaintiff would want to use such replacements so that he could not be said to be claiming on the basis of replacement value just in order that the defendant should pay him damages.” 
    24    In Ogus (op cit) at 145, the learned author cites the case for this proposition: “Failing this, (ie being able to acquire a substitute in the market) the plaintiff may recover the cost of manufacturing a suitable substitute. But for this method to be applicable, the plaintiff must show that he intended actually to use and benefit from the article which is to be reproduced - otherwise the reproduction cost will not be a true measure of his loss.” 
    25    In my view, these statements should be accepted as correct. They put a necessary gloss upon the wide statement of principle, if that is what it was intended to be, in the passage from Lord Halsbury’s speech in The Mediana. In my opinion, if goods have been specially manufactured or specially acquired to be used by a person in a particular way, and they are converted by a tortfeasor then, if, at the time of conversion, the person required those goods for their original purpose, it follows that he can be restored to his original position only by an award of damages that would cover the replacement cost of those goods. If, however, prior to the conversion he had ceased to have that special need for those goods, then to award him damages based upon the cost of re-manufacturing or re-acquiring those goods would be to compensate him on a false basis. At the time of the conversion the goods would not have been of their original use to him; they would have had some other use which might be radically different from the original one. In my opinion, conformably with the general principles applicable to awards of compensatory damages, proper regard must be paid to such a pre-conversion change of use in order to arrive at the correct “value” of converted goods. 
    26    I am aware that Hall v Barclay  was concerned only with goods specially manufactured for a particular purpose and not with goods specially acquired for that purpose. However, it would, I believe, be inconsistent with the underlying compensatory principle for damages in tort, and unnecessarily artificial, to apply the decision only to items specially manufactured by a person for a particular purpose.  
    27    In the present case, in my opinion, if the evidence requires the conclusion that, as at the date of its conversion, the fabricated steel, which had been specially worked upon for use by ADC in the Quadrant project and the raw steel which had been specially acquired for the project, was no longer required for that project, then to award damages based upon cost of replacement would be quite erroneous. That is, unless there was a demonstrated use for the steel by the plaintiff in some other project. Failing that, the steel in the plaintiff’s hands would be surplus to its requirements and would have a pre-conversion value based upon its sale price as steel.  
    28    This is the position contended for by Allco. It is necessary to see whether the evidence supports it. 
    29    The following evidence was given by Mr Schick, the quantity surveyor employed by ADC for the Quadrant project: 
     
      
       
       “Q. … Do you know from your own observations, Mr Schick, as to whether the residential tower was constructed using materials other than steel? 
        
       A. It was constructed using reinforced concrete. 
        
        
       Q. In other words the engineering detail for the construction of the residential tower altered from one requiring the steel that Allco purchased in to one not using steel but using reinforced concrete? 
        
       A. That’s correct. 
        
        
       HIS HONOUR: Q. When was that change made, do you know? 
        
       A. Lindsay Mack (of) Group Architects and myself discussed the possibility of it shortly before the termination of the contract. 
        
        
       Q. Around about August of 1988, some time then? 
        
       A. Your Honour, I am not sure of the date but it was during the period of the strike and when it appeared as though the contract may be terminated. 
        
        
       Q. So, it was before the termination of the contract but during the period of the strike when it seemed as though the contract was to be terminated? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
        
       Q. The discussion with Mr Mack? 
        
       A. We suggested A D C as a way of overcoming some problems that we foresaw and saving some height in the floor to floor -- 
        
        
       McVAY: Q. Whatever the reason, there was a change in the method of construction and apparently in the design of the building? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
        
       Q. It then no longer involved the use of this prefabricated steel? 
        
       A. That’s correct. 
        
        
       Q. Which was then at Tomago? 
        
       A. That’s correct.” 
       
      
    30    In re-examination he gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
       “LINEY: Q. Just on that last point, Mr Schick, I ask you to assume for a moment that the relevant authorities’ approval to proceed in reinforced concrete rather than steel was not granted until about April, in fact until April 1989. Now, are you able to say until the approval for that was granted could the building have proceeded in reinforced concrete rather than structural steel - 
        
        
       OBJECTION. 
        
        
       HIS HONOUR: Q. Are you able to answer that? 
        
       A. The authorities certainly would not allow that construction to proceed until the revised structural design. 
        
        
       HIS HONOUR: They would have to approve the new plan and new construction. 
        
        
       LINEY: Q. So from somebody advising the proprietor and developer and looking at costs is one in a position to make a final decision on whether to proceed with reinforced concrete until one has the authorities’ approval with all the relevant conditions - 
        
        
       HIS HONOUR: I will allow it. 
        
        
       WITNESS: A. In fairness I suppose when the drawings are complete you could go out and get quotes and if my estimates have been shown to be incorrect perhaps A D C may have reverted back to steel but they did proceed with concrete. 
        
        
       HIS HONOUR: Q. These things are done more or less contemporaneously? 
        
       A. The drawings have to be completed and they are submitted. It frequently takes in excess of six weeks in Canberra to get plans through the authorities. 
        
        
       LINEY 
       : Q. It does not come to a grinding halt? 
        
       A. No. There was other work on the site going on. The office block was completed in steel. That work continued but the residence and the carpark remained inactive. 
        
        
       Q. They were put on hold? 
        
       A. That’s correct. 
        
        
       Q. The point was, as it were, is assuming one is thinking about changing to concrete instead of steel can any such decision be made with any finality prior to the seeking of authorities’ approval with all relevant conditions? 
        
       A. No, I don’t think you would make a decision until you knew all the conditions. 
        
        
       Q. And prior to April 1989 did any officer or employee of A D C ever say to you that such a final decision had been made -  
       
      
      
       
       OBJECTION. RELEVANCE. ALLOWED. 
       
      
      
       
       A. I wasn’t told the final decision had been made.” 
       
      
    31    Further evidence on the topic appears in a letter of 12 March 1990 sent by ADC’s solicitors to Allco. The letter addressed the allegation previously made by Allco that all steel purchased by it for the Quadrant project had been delivered to the site in Canberra. It stated: 
     
      
       
       “In particular, it notes that no steel had been delivered to the project site since the identification by its quantity surveyors in early November 1987 and December 1987 respectively of steel at your company’s Tomago yard worth $503,270.00 and $398,570.00 respectively as referred to in the said letter. We are instructed that the steel in question was ultimately not required to be used on the site due to the fact that the building for which it had been intended was changed to a concrete structure.” 
       
      
    32    No further evidence was given on this aspect of the case. In particular, no evidence was given in support of the assumption that Mr Schick was asked to make in re-examination as to the granting of approvals by relevant authorities and as to the time of such grant. What, then, is the effect of this evidence? 
    33    It is clear that the steel, the subject of these proceedings, was not required for the completion of the Quadrant project. Obviously a decision was made by ADC to proceed with a different form of construction, at which point it ceased to need the steel for that purpose. Did this change in the use of the steel occur before the time of its conversion? This would appear to be the fine point upon which the appropriate measure of damage depends. 
    34    I have come to the conclusion, not without some hesitation, having regard to the state of the evidence, that the steel, at the time of its conversion, was no longer required by ADC for the Quadrant project. I consider this to be the ultimate effect of the evidence set out. Mr Schick was an impressive witness. I am satisfied that his evidence points, with sufficient clarity, to the “change in the method of construction and … in the design of the building” having occurred when the prefabricated steel was still at Tomago, that is, before its conversion. 
    35    In these circumstances, I reject the primary claim of ADC that its damages should be calculated on the replacement value of the converted steel. There is no evidence to suggest that ADC would have had any use for the steel in its specially cut and fabricated state. Likewise, there is no evidence that the remaining raw steel was of any use to ADC. In my view, the only reasonable inference on the evidence is that it would have taken steps to dispose of the steel. In view of the fact that it had paid, through its contract with White, progress payments for the steel amounting to $901,840, it is reasonable to assume that it would have taken steps to recover the best possible price available. 
    36    For this reason, I am not prepared to accept the submissions made on behalf of Allco that the appropriate price to take was the amount received by it on its sale of the steel to Balcomb, namely $335,171. It was argued that this figure represented the proper value of the steel as it was the amount of the highest tender received when Allco sought to sell the steel into the re-useable steel market. It sold the steel into that market on an “as is - where is” basis. Balcomb was the highest tenderer. 
    37    Plainly, the steel, being a significantly large lot, occupied considerable space in Allco’s premises. Allco was anxious to have it removed and, apparently, had no desire to maximise the price obtained. In selling to Balcomb, it sold to a dealer in scrap and re-useable steel. It is clear from the evidence that Balcomb thereafter made profits from on-selling the steel into smaller more specialised markets, where steel in somewhat deteriorated condition and in non-uniform shapes and lengths could be used for particular purposes.  
    38    The evidence makes it clear that other avenues for the commercial disposal of the steel were available other than selling it as a single lot to a dealer such as Balcomb. Very elaborate evidence was given on behalf of ADC by Mr Thornton, a quantity surveyor, who, by reason of careful examination of the structural steel plans for the Quadrant project and other documents, estimated the quantities and configurations of the steel that would have been the subject of the sale by Balcomb. Mr Dean, a steel merchant and broker, then gave evidence as to the prices he would have expected to achieve in the market for steel so described. The resulting figure was $598,515.73. This figure would have been achieved by careful selling of the steel into selected markets. 
    39    This is not an area where precise computation is possible. Assumptions should not be made in favour of a tortfeasor who has converted another’s property. In particular, it is not to be assumed that ADC would have chosen the method of disposal followed by Allco. On the other hand, it is unlikely that it would have undertaken sale of the steel as though it were itself a dealer or broker. It is clear, for instance, that if it had sold the steel to Mr Dean, the price achieved would have been considerably less than the prices that Mr Dean would have expected to achieve when on-selling. In my view, in circumstances where accurate calculation of damages is impossible or inappropriate, the Court must, as a jury would, “give whatever (it thinks) would be the proper equivalent for the unlawful withdrawal of the subject-matter then in question”(per Earl of Halsbury LC in The Mediana [1900] AC 113 at 118.)  
    40    Approaching the problem in this way, and using the figures from the evidence as guides, I consider that the proper amount to award the plaintiff for damages for the conversion of its steel is $475,000.  
    41    I think it reasonable to add that, had I proceeded along the path of replacement cost as being the appropriate measure, it would have been necessary to take into account that the steel was stored in Allco’s yard. ADC had no entitlement to keep it there. Accordingly, in my view, the damages would have been subject to reduction, to a quite substantial extent, to allow for the cost of removal of the steel from Allco’s premises. There is evidence in the case, to which I need not refer in detail, that it was a lengthy, labour-intensive and necessarily costly process for Balcomb to remove the steel from the Tomago site. Moreover, some further reduction would have been required having regard to the somewhat deteriorated condition of the steel. 
    42    As I indicated at the termination of the hearing, I will give counsel the opportunity to argue the question of interest and costs. Accordingly, I direct that within 14 days of the handing down of these reasons that counsel approach my Associate for the purpose of fixing a mutually convenient time for the disposal of those issues.

     CARRUTHERS AJ  FRIDAY 11 JUNE 1999 DIANE ELIZABETH BAKER v REGINA (NSW) JUDGMENT 1 CARRUTHERS AJ: Diane Elizabeth Baker seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her at the Newcastle District Court on 11 August 1998 by his Honour Judge Job QC in respect of one count of armed robbery under section 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour was also asked to take into account five matters on a schedule, namely one count of obtain benefit by deception, one count of goods in custody, two counts of break, enter and steal and two counts of assault.2 His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two years and four months penal servitude to commence on 6 August 1998 and to expire on 5 December 2000. His Honour fixed an additional terms of nine months to commence on 6 December 2000 and to expire on 5 September 2001.3 It is also convenient to note that on 25 September 1998 the applicant was sentenced at the Newcastle Local Court, for breach of her recognisance, to a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 25 September 1998 and to expire on 24 September 1999. That recognisance was breached by reason of the offences for which Judge Job sentenced the applicant.4 The circumstances of the subject armed robbery are serious and I shall take them from a statement by the victim, Robert Clark, which was tendered by consent before his Honour.5 At about 5pm on Friday 27 March 1998 the victim, Robert Clark, was then 89 years of age with greatly reduced vision and greatly impaired hearing, living by himself at home at Cooks Hill. He was in the bedroom of his home. A person unknown to him, but who admittedly was the applicant, with a robe over her head entered the room and yelled at him, ""Get your wallet"". She had what was described as a 12 inch knife in her hand. Mr Clark was frightened and got his wallet out. He extracted $30 from it which was all the money which he had in the wallet. The applicant took the money and left the room. Mr Clark tried to follow her. Then she turned and pushed him away. He banged into the door. The applicant then grabbed his spectacles, pulled them from his face and threw them on to the floor.6 The victim received quite a severe abrasion to his right arm as a result of being pushed against the door by the applicant. This bled and caused him pain. He then saw the applicant near the kitchen door. She was still holding a knife in her hand and she said something like, ""Give me your pin number and your card"". The appellant did not appear to Mr Clark to be in control of her senses. I might add, parenthetically, that I have no doubt she was affected by the ingestion of drugs.7 In any event, Mr Clark explained to her that he did not have a pin number and a card and that he used a withdrawal form to get money from the Building Society. She then told him to get out a withdrawal form, together with his passbook. He said that she was waiving the knife around in front of his face.8 He got the passbook and withdrawal form and, on her instructions filled out a withdrawal form for $400. She took the form and the passbook and left the house endeavouring to reach the Building Society before it closed. But she did say to him, ""If this doesn't work tonight, I'll be back tomorrow"". She also took some coins from a jar on Mr Clark's bedside table.9 After she had left, Mr Clark contacted a neighbour who then contacted the police and a ambulance was also called. The following morning, whilst the neighbour was with Mr Clark providing support for him, the phone rang. The applicant was on the line and she said to Mr Clark, ""I told you not to tell the police"". He replied, ""If you go to the Building Society this morning, you are in trouble"". She replied, ""No, you're in trouble"".10 The evidence before his Honour was to the effect that the applicant was unable to get to the Building Society before it closed to withdraw the money. Before she could take the matter any further, however, she was arrested on the following day.11 His Honour accepted that when the applicant entered Mr Clark's home she was unarmed and that she had obtained the knife from his kitchen. The applicant said that she had obtained this knife so that she could cut the telephone cord. His Honour was somewhat dubious about accepting that explanation. However, when arrested, the applicant made full admissions. His Honour noted that her fingerprints were found on the inside of the victim's wallet.12 I shall not refer to the details of the various matters on the schedule but they themselves were all significant matters and unquestionably attributable to the applicant's attempts to obtain money to support her drug addiction.13 The applicant was born on 15 March 1962 with a criminal history going back to 1984. She has a criminal history in Queensland as well as New South Wales. On 14 November 1997 she was granted a three year bond at the Newcastle Local Court in relation to the offence of steal articles in the course of post. That was the bond that was, of course, still current at the time of the subject offences and in respect of which she was dealt with at the Newcastle Local Court on 25 September 1998.14 Sadly the applicant has a long history of drug addiction with intermittent periods of abstention. Indeed, it looks as though that history could have gone back as far as when she was 10 years of age. At the time of the commission of the subject robbery, she alleged that she was using up to five grams of heroin a day at a cost of approximately $2,000 per day. 15 The applicant remained in custody from 27 March 1998 until conditional bail was entered on 14 May 1998. That bail had actually been granted on 11 May 1998 so she was in custody for a period of 47 days. A condition of the bail which she entered was that she reside at William Booth Institute and undertake to complete a course of drug rehabilitation. Further, that she was not to leave that institution until the rehabilitation course had been completed, except for the purpose of complying with the reporting conditions or for conferences with her legal advisers or to attend court.16 In fact, the applicant seems to have resided for most of the 12 weeks between 14 May 1998 and 7 August 1998 (when she was taken back into custody) at Selah Farm. Captain Drayton, a drug counsellor at Selah Farm, gave evidence before his Honour and to use his Honour words, ""described that she was doing well on the programme"". This was, however, a reference to a programme of 26 to 32 weeks at Selah Farm and then a further eight to 10 weeks at the William Booth Institute to complete that programme. Unfortunately, but inevitably, the sentence which was imposed upon her by the Judge disrupted that rehabilitation course.17 When sentencing the applicant, his Honour said that he was being as lenient as he could in the circumstances and specifically referred to the fact that he was taking into account the 47 days pre-sentence custody. At the conclusion of the sentencing process his Honour was asked by the applicant's legal representative whether he could clarify one particular point, namely counsel said, ""I take it from that calculation that your Honour has not found any special circumstances"". His Honour replied:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Yes, I should say I did not find special circumstances. I did consider that but no, I did not find special circumstances. Thank you for that Mr Johnson. I should have mentioned that. I had intended so to do"".  
         
        
       
       
      
     18 It could not be taken in these circumstances, therefore, that his Honour had overlooked the issue of special circumstances.19 It is not argued on behalf of the applicant by Ms Burgess that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive, (notwithstanding the plea of guilty and the applicant's contrition) by reason Ms Burgess concedes of the seriousness of the subject offence and the matters on the schedule.20 However, Ms Burgess submits that his Honour erred in not finding special circumstances. It is contended that there was abundant material to support a finding of special circumstances, namely the applicant's long drug addiction and related criminal history, together with the evidence of ""her successful rehabilitation"", the insight she had gained into her behaviour and her motivation to change. Ms Burgess submitted that these were all matters which lead to the irresistible conclusion that there was a need for a longer than usual additional term.21 It was further submitted that his Honour does not appear to have determined the total sentence as such, but rather approached the sentencing process by imposing a minimum term and adding an additional term, which procedure carried the risk that separate questions which arise under section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act would be overlooked. Reliance was placed here upon the decision of this Court in Fisher, (unreported 18 September 1998).22 Finally it was argued that his Honour failed expressly to take into account the 12 weeks which the applicant had spent at Selah Farm which amounted to quasi custody. Reliance was placed here on the decisions of this Court in Eastaway (CCA unreported 19 May 1998), Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR at 258-259 and Douglas (CCA unreported 4 March 1997).23 It was submitted that applying those principles to this case, the applicant should have been given the benefit of a credit to the order of approximately 50 percent of the subject 12 weeks. Ms Burgess submitted that the principles enunciated in the cases to which she made reference were not to be restricted to Odyssey House, a submission with which I respectfully agree, as long as the type of restraint referred to in those cases was applicable and here I think it was.24 Ms Burgess submitted that this was an unusual case in that despite this lengthy period of drug addiction, the stage has finally been reached where there is concrete evidence that the applicant has embarked upon a potentially successful course of rehabilitation.25 It was submitted that although the applicant has by reason of her drug addiction a long criminal record, the type of offences which were being considered by the sentencing judge here were inconsistent with the type of convictions on her record.26 Mr Hulme, on behalf of the Crown, has submitted that if there is any error in this matter by reason of the length of the additional term, it could only have reasonably been corrected by an extension of the additional term with no consequential reduction in the minimum term.27 It has been pointed out by this Court in recent cases with regard to section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, that there is, in effect, only one question: Are there special circumstances which justifies a larger additional term than one third of the minimum term? A finding by the sentencing judge that there were no special circumstances would therefore generally involve a finding that there were no such special circumstances as would justify the imposition of an additional term longer than the one third period. This is a discretionary decision. See Hampton (CCA unreported 25 June 1998).28 The decision to vary the statutory proportion requires consideration, not only of the desirability of increasing the additional term, but also the appropriateness of reducing the minimum term which must nevertheless remain such as to appropriately reflect the criminality involved. Morrissey (CCA unreported 15 July 1994). The objective criminality of the offence should be reflected not only in the full term but also in the minimum term McDonald (CCA unreported 12 October 1998). And finally, although it may be open to a sentencing judge in the exercise of his or her discretion to regard certain circumstances in combination as special circumstances, the Judge is not bound to respond to the circumstances by setting an additional term which is in excess of one third of the minimum term GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR at 376.29 Applying those principles to this case it seems to me that there is much weight in the submission of Mr Hulme on behalf of the Crown. The minimum term which his Honour fixed was, in my respectful view, completely within his Honour's discretion and appropriate to the high degree of criminality involved in the subject offences. Were his Honour to have allowed a greater period of time for the applicant to be subject to the rehabilitation process, then it could, in my view, have only reasonably been by the extension of the overall term and necessarily an increased additional term.30 His Honour must therefore have taken the view that although it was open to him in the exercise of his discretion to regard the relevant circumstances to which reference was made before him in combination as special circumstances, he nevertheless did not feel bound to respond to the circumstances by setting in the particular situation before him an additional term which was in excess of one third of the minimum term. That was a perfectly appropriate approach in my respectful view.31 As to the question of the 12 weeks spent at Selah Farm, I have a strong suspicion that the matter was not raised before his Honour although, as Mr Hulme has pointed out, submissions by counsel were not recorded and therefore one cannot necessarily infer that the matter was not raised. But I must say, speaking for myself, I doubt that it was. But what does one do with this fact? It has troubled me but it seems to me that when one looks at the overall criminality involved in the subject offences, and what I consider to be a sentencing regime which was not too severe and well within his Honour's sentencing discretions, that it would be inappropriate, or indeed one could say de minimis, to attempt to take into account 50 percent of that 12 week period.32 One always feels a deep sense of regret when one must reject an appeal on the ground of severity when there is concrete evidence before the Court of rehabilitation because sadly the instances which come before this Court of a demonstrated determination on the part of the appellant to rehabilitate himself or herself are much more rare than one would wish. However, it is our responsibility to administer the law and applying the relevant principles to the evidence, I am left with the conviction that the Court has no alternative but to grant the application for leave to appeal but to dismiss the appeal.33 GROVE J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be that the application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted but that the appeal is dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONHAMILTON JWEDNESDAY, 2 JUNE 199913988/98 PHILIP JOHN RAPSON & ANOR v WILLIAM EDWIN WRIGHT & ORSJUDGMENTHis Honour:1    In these proceedings I made orders on 19 December 1997 that there be a permanent stay of proceedings on two informations in the Local Court at Sutherland and subsequently gave reasons for my orders. Costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court were awarded against the defendants, following the event of the proceedings. The formal substantive orders made were simply that the proceedings on the informations be permanently stayed. Those orders were formally entered on 13 October 1998. Essentially the basis on which I ordered that the proceedings in the Local Court be permanently stayed was that those proceedings had been brought for an improper or inappropriate purpose, being a purpose other than the due enforcement of the criminal law and were consequently an abuse of proceedings. Subsequently, the plaintiffs in these proceedings have brought proceedings in the District Court for malicious prosecution based upon the laying of those informations in the Local Court. Those proceedings are shortly for trial in the District Court. The defendants in those proceedings are propounding, amongst others, the defence that the proceedings for malicious prosecution must fail because the orders for permanent stay did not amount to a determination of the proceedings on the informations in favour of the defendants in those proceedings, a precondition to the success of an action for malicious prosecution. 
    2    Under the present motion the plaintiffs initially sought that I should vary or add to the orders I made by way of permanent stay by ordering that, in the proceedings in the Local Court, the informations be dismissed. I am of the view that, on the present state of the law, this Court cannot make orders for dismissal in the Local Court. A contrary view was expressed by Brennan J in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19, but was not the view of the majority of the High Court in that case. The very reason for the orders of this Court being by way of permanent stay is that the proceedings on the informations are not in this Court but in the Local Court; no ground for a certiorari was established which would have permitted the proceedings to be removed into this Court, whereupon this Court would have had the power to make orders in those proceedings; and the orders by way of permanent stay were the way of dealing with the situation. The present plaintiffs have applied in the Local Court to have the proceedings upon the informations dismissed, but the Magistrate has declined to do this, in my view correctly, on the basis that, the proceedings being permanently stayed by order of this Court, he could or ought do nothing whatever in the proceedings. Likewise the present plaintiffs, at the time of asking for the orders of dismissal in the Local Court, asked the Local Court to order the costs of those proceedings in their favour upon dismissal, and the Magistrate refused that application for like reason. 
    3    However, the main thrust of debate in this case has come to be, whether the Court has power, bearing in mind that its earlier orders have been entered, to lift the stay in part in order to permit the matter to be dealt with further in the Local Court, and whether, if it has such power, that power ought in this Court's discretion be exercised to make such an order. Mr Lakatos, of counsel for the first and second defendants, has made supplementary written submissions which address these questions and which have been particularly helpful. It is conceded on behalf of the first and second defendants that the Court does have power to lift a permanent stay and in that regard reference is made to Nicholas v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 456; 151 ALR 312, see per Brennan CJ at [41]; and Hayne J at [255]. The power to lift the permanent stay was, in that case, conceded. However, for the reasons there stated, it seems to me that the concession made in that case was correct and that the concession made on behalf of the first and second defendants in this case by Mr Lakatos was correct and inevitable. 
    4    The question therefore becomes one of whether the discretion to lift the stay pro tanto should in this case be exercised. It seems to me that the correct view of the discretion is that it is at large. It must, of course, be exercised judicially, but there are no particular criteria upon which it should be exercised or preconditions to its exercise. I should say that if it were a necessary precondition to its exercise, that there should have been a change in circumstances since the making of the original order (as was provided in Nicholas by the legislative abolition of the difficulty which had led to the permanent stay being granted in the first place), then I should find that there was a relevant change of circumstances in the present case which would justify the partial lifting of the stay in that, upon malicious prosecution proceedings being brought in the District Court, the defendants have pleaded in that Court that there was a defence available to them that the proceedings in the Local Court had not been determined in favour of the defendants in those proceedings. This was a subject matter certainly not contemplated by this Court when original orders were made in December 1997. However, it seems to me that there is also a different basis upon which the discretion may be exercised in the same sense, although arising from the same subject matter, that is, that the basis of the jurisdiction to grant permanent stays is a jurisdiction that is intended to prevent injustice arising. The jurisdiction which was exercised in the present case is a jurisdiction not in respect of proceedings in this Court, but a supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals which do not themselves have power to grant permanent stays or do not stay the proceedings before them. The supervision is exercised to ensure that justice is done. Justice, in my view, would not be done by this Court's orders if they were left in such a state as to prevent the dismissal by the Magistrate of the informations before him which, since they cannot proceed and cannot succeed, ought, in my view, be dismissed, particularly since there is an issue estoppel between the plaintiffs in this Court and the informant in those proceedings that the laying of the informations in the Local Court was an abuse of process. Often it will make no practical difference whether criminal proceedings are dismissed or permanently stayed, but here, where the rights of the parties may vary depending on whether the criminal proceedings are or are not dismissed, the dismissal of proceedings which cannot and ought not succeed ought be facilitated. I therefore propose to order that the permanent stays be varied so far as is necessary to permit the Local Court to dismiss the informations before it. It was at the heel of the hunt contended before me that there could be no dismissal of the informations in the Local Court by reference to s 80 of the Justices Act 1902. That contention does not appear to be correct, although it should be said that it has not been fully argued before me. 
    5    The question of costs in the Local Court is perhaps, in a sense, different. Certainly there are cases in this Court to which Mr Lakatos has drawn attention, including Kable v DPP [1999] NSWSC 95, where, costs having been overlooked at the time of substantive orders being made, the Court in its discretion refused subsequently to make orders for costs. In that case, however, the costs under consideration were the costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, which have, of course, in this case been already dealt with. Costs in the Local Court did not arise at the time the substantive orders were made in this Court, and, indeed, could not and cannot arise in the Local Court, until an order of dismissal has been made. Whilst, if the application were for a lifting of the stay to deal with costs alone, the result might be different, in my view, since the occasion for costs in the Local Court does not arise until the orders of dismissal are made in that Court, it is appropriate that that matter also now be allowed to be agitated in the Local Court when orders for dismissal of the informations are made. The order that I propose to make, therefore, is that the permanent stay granted in respect of each of the informations referred to in my earlier order be lifted so far and only in so far as is necessary to permit the Local Court to dismiss the said informations and to hear and determine an application by the defendant named in each information for an order in respect of the costs of the proceedings in the Local Court. I shall order that the first and second defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of this motion.

ON APPEAL FROM MR. JUSTICE GIROUARD IN CHAMBERS.

Criminal law—Indictable offence—Summary
trial—Jurisdiction of magistrate—Offence committed in another county.

If a person is brought before a justice of
the peace charged with an offence committed within the Province, but out of the
limits of the jurisdiction of such justice the latter, in his discretion, may
either order the accused to be taken before some justice having jurisdiction in
the place where the offence was committed (Cr. Code [1892] sec. 557; Cr. C.
[1906] sec. 665) or may proceed as if it had been committed within his own
jurisdiction.

S. was brought before the stipendiary
magistrate of the City of Halifax charged with having committed burglary in Sydney, C.B.

Held, that the
stipendiary magistrate could, with the consent of the accused, try him summarily
under Cr. C. [1892] sec. 785 as amended in1900. (Cr. C. [1906] sec. 777).

APPEAL from a decision of Mr. Justice
Girouard in Chambers refusing an application for a writ of habeas corpus.

The applicant, Seeley, is confined in the
penitentiary at Dorchester, N.B., on conviction by a stipendiary magistrate for
Halifax, N.S., of having committed burglary at Sydney, Cape Breton. He
was at the same time convicted of burglary in Halifax and sentenced to the penitentiary therefor, such sentence to run
from the termination of that imposed for the first-mentioned offence.

Seeley applied to a judge of the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick for a writ of habeas corpus, which

[Page 6]

application was referred
to the full court and the writ was finally refused[1]. He then applied to Mr. Justice Girouard,
who, following In re White[2],
refused to interfere with the decision of the provincial court. He then
appealed to the Supreme Court from such refusal.

O'Hearn, for the
appellant.

J. J. Power K.C., for the Crown.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from an order made by Mr.
Justice Girouard in Chambers
refusing a writ of habeas corpus[3].

It may be convenient to state now briefly the
mode in which the courts in England have administered the law in relation to the writ of habeas
corpus. Lord Herschel, in Cox v. Hakes[4],
at page 527, says:

It was always open to an applicant for it,
if defeated in one court, at once to renew his application to another.
No court was bound by the view taken by any other, or felt itself obliged to
follow the law laid down by it. Each court exercised its independent judgment
upon the case, and determined for. itself whether the return to the writ
established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the law.
A person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until
he obtained his liberty. And if he could succeed in convincing any of the
tribunals competent to issue the writ that he was entitled to be discharged,
his right to his liberty could not afterwards be called in question. There was
no power in any court to review or control the proceedings of the tribunal
which discharged him. I need not dwell upon the security which was thus
afforded against any unlawful imprisonment. It is sufficient to say that no
person could be detained in custody if any one of the tribunals having
power to issue the writ of habeas corpus was of opinion that the custody
was unlawful.

[Page 7]

In this statement of the law as applicable to Canada we desire to express our full
concurrence.

The facts of this case summarily stated are:

The prisoner was convicted at Halifax on the 23rd December, 1903, by George H.
Fielding, stipendiary magistrate in and for the City of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, of the offence of burglary, alleged to have been
committed at the City of Sydney,
in the County of Cape Breton, also in Nova Scotia. It is submitted in support of the application that the magistrate
had no jurisdiction to convict on the short ground that the offence was not
committed within his territorial jurisdiction, the limits of which are made by
virtue of the provisions of the Nova Scotia statutes co-terminus with the area of the City of Halifax.

There is no doubt that the powers of a justice
of the peace are all derived from statute and being purely statutory must be
construed strictly. It must also be conceded, I think, that a magistrate must
exercise his powers within the local limits of his jurisdiction. In England,
the Criminal Acts (Indictable Offences Act, 1848, and Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1867) empower a justice of the peace to issue a warrant upon information
in writing on oath against any person charged with having committed an
indictable offence within his jurisdiction, or against any person residing or
being or suspected to reside or be within the limits of his jurisdiction and
who is suspected to be guilty of having committed any offence elsewhere (11
& 12 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 1); and in the case of a man apprehended in one
county for an offence committed in another it is provided that the magistrate
shall examine such witnesses and receive such evidence in proof of the charge
as shall be produced

[Page 8]

before him within his jurisdiction, and if, in
his opinion, the evidence shall be sufficient proof of the charge he shall
commit the accused to the gaol, or house of correction, for the county, borough
or place where the offence is alleged to have been committed, or admit to bail;
and if the evidence is not deemed sufficient to put the accused upon his trial,
the justice binds over the witnesses and sends the accused back to the county
where the offence is alleged to have been committed to be dealt with by a
justice there (11 & 12 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 22), so that in the result the
offence is finally dealt with and the offender tried within the district in
which the alleged offence was committed, in accordance with the common law
rule. This proceeding is plain, intelligible and consistent with the general
principle that the authority of a justice of the peace or of a magistrate is
limited to the county or district for which he is appointed.

We must, however, consider this application in
connection with sections 554  and 557  of the Criminal Code  (Canada, 1892), which ""re-enact in part
only those provisions of the Impérial Act to which I have just referred. Section 554  gives a magistrate
jurisdiction to issue his warrant and compel for the purpose of preliminary
inquiry the attendance of an accused charged with an indictable offence who resides
or is found or apprehended or is in custody in the justice's county. Section
557  provides that the magistrate holding the preliminary inquiry where the
accused is charged with an offence committed out of the limits of the
jurisdiction of such magistrate may, after hearing both sides, order the
accused, at any stage of the inquiry, to be taken before a justice having
jurisdiction in the place where the offence was

[Page 9]

committed. Whereas the ""Imperial Act,""
as already pointed out, is imperative, our section is permissive[5], and makes no special provision for the
commitment or trial, as the English Act does, of a prisoner charged with an
offence committed in another county in the same province. Must we not
therefore assume that in such a case, provided the offence is triable in the
province, the prisoner is to be dealt with as if the offence had been
committed within the territorial limits of the magistrate's jurisdiction,
unless, in the exercise of his discretion, he chooses to send him before a justice
of the county where the offence
was committed. I am confirmed in this opinion by the terms of section 554 :

Every justice may issue a warrant or
summons, as hereinafter mentioned, to compel the attendance of an accused
person before him, for the purpose of preliminary inquiry in «any of the
following cases:—

(a) If such person is accused of having
committed in any place whatever an indictable offence triable in the province
in which such judge resides, or is, or is suspected to be, within the limits
over which such justice has jurisdiction, or resides or is suspected to reside
within such limits;

(b) If such
person, wherever he may be, is accused of having committed an indictable
offence within such limits;

(c) If such person is alleged to have
anywhere unlawfully received property which was unlawfully obtained within such
limits;

(d) If such
person has in his possession, within such limits, any stolen property.

The words preliminary inquiry in the
first paragraph, which specially confer jurisdiction in the cases enumerated in
sections (a), (b), (c), (d), must carry the same meaning throughout the
whole section. It would be contrary to the general rules of construction to
give a different meaning to these words in

[Page 10]

different portions of the same section[6], and there is no doubt that construed with
special reference to sections. (b), (c) and (d), they must be held to confer on
the magistrate power to inquire and commit for trial in the cases provided for
in these sections, that is to say, where the accused is charged with an offence
committed in the justice's county or with unlawfully receiving. I can see no
reason why these words should receive a more limited meaning when used in
connection with sub-section (a) where the accused is charged in the justice's
county with an indictable offence committed elsewhere in the province. Article
785 of the Code, as amended by the statute of 1900,[7], gives the magistrate jurisdiction to try
summarily with his consent any person charged before him with having
committed any offence for which he may be tried at a Court of General Sessions
of the Peace and undoubtedly the offence of burglary is triable at sessions[8]. There are certain offences enumerated in
the latter section with respect to which a magistrate can hold a preliminary
inquiry only. What is the meaning of the word charged as used here? The
charge is contained in the information sworn to and lodged with the magistrate
and upon which he issues his warrant, as well as in the depositions taken at
the preliminary inquiry, if an inquiry is held; but if the prisoner waives the
inquiry and consents to be tried summarily, then the magistrate makes the
charge for the purpose of that proceeding on the sworn complaint and
information then before him and, when read to the prisoner for the purpose

[Page 11]

of enabling him to make his option, he is
charged within the meaning of this section and the magistrate has jurisdiction
to deal with him. Some stress was laid upon the point that to be clothed with
jurisdiction under section 785 the magistrate must be acting within the local
limits of his jurisdiction. I have endeavoured to point out that section 554 
does not distinguish and that with respect to an offender found within the
county charged with an offence committed beyond, but within the province, the
jurisdiction of the magistrate is as complete as if the offence had been
committed within his territory. The legislation is somewhat elliptical, but our
duty is to give effect to what is apparently the intention of the Act if we can
do so on a proper construction of the words used. If the Canadian Parliament
had intended to adopt the procedure followed in England, it would have been
easy to use the language of the ""Imperial Act,"" and as this was not
done I conclude that the intention was to establish the principle that mere
presence in the county will subject even a passing stranger to the jurisdiction
of the magistrate if charged with an indictable offence wherever committed
within the limits of the province, and I can see no reason why on the principle
of effectiveness and considerations of convenience we should not give effect to
what apparently was the intention of the legislature. I construe sections 554 ,
557  and 785 , taken together, to mean that when an offence is committed within
the limits of a province any presence, however transitory, of the accused
in any part of that province will justify the exercise of as full and complete
jurisdiction as if the offence was committed where the offender is apprehended,
leaving to the magistrate a 

[Page 12]

discretionary power to send the prisoner for
further inquiry or for trial before the justice having jurisdiction over the
locus where the offence was committed. It has been suggested that difficulty
may arise out of the clashing of jurisdiction; but we can only concur in the
opinion expressed by Lord Watson in the Orr-Ewing Case (1), that
wherever a real conflict of jurisdiction does arise between two independant tribunals, the better course for
each to pursue is to exercise its own jurisdiction so far as it can and not to
issue judgments proclaiming the incompetency of its rival.

Application dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
      
     1  
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by Gibson DCJ where the applicant appeared upon two charges of larceny as a servant. He pleaded guilty to both counts. The circumstances out of which the offences arose were that the applicant was in a relationship with a young woman, apparently not more than half his age, who had steady employment with the well-known tobacco manufacturers and distributors, Rothmans of Pall Mall. On her recommendation the applicant was contracted as a salesman to that company. I observe that the applicant was given that contractual employment although it is known to the Court that between 1962 when he was a juvenile and 1985 he had been convicted of many offences including multiple offences of significant dishonesty. Be that as it may, the applicant was in possession of a truck which was loaded with the product of the Corporation. As I understand it, he proceeded upon a round of sales and delivered to retailers the contents of the truck, as required. The arrangement was that upon delivery of the tobacco products the retailer would pay the applicant in cash or immediately available currency of similar type. On 17 March 1998 the applicant was on his rounds and on completion he was in possession of $4773.49, which it was his duty to account for to the company.  
      
     2  
     At some earlier point he had been approached by a man who said that he would be interested in purchasing the content of his truck. This approach was clearly not a commercial approach in the interests of the tobacco company. On 18 March the applicant by arrangement took the truck to a location apparently near Picnic Point where the content was unloaded and given to the man who had approached him. The value of the content was a little over $144,000. For passing the content to the purchaser, and I use the term loosely, the applicant received $30,000. He apparently returned to the premises that he was sharing with the young lady whom I have earlier mentioned and left a thousand dollars with some petfood. He left a note on the refrigerator indicating that she should not forget to feed the cat. He then left the State. He went to Tasmania. He spent money on accommodation and the purchase of some transport. He claims that some fifteen thousand dollars was stolen from him. In April his funds had substantially been expended and he returned to New South Wales. He surrendered himself to police. It was inevitable that his crime and his commission of it would be discovered. He had abandoned his empty truck near a shopping centre, and as I have already said, he left the State without any explanation.  
      
     3  
     He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity of the two charges related to the value of the content of the truck and the amount of cash collected on the day previous to that upon which he had passed the content to the purchaser. Clearly the two offences were connected. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of five years penal servitude for the offence on 18 March and a concurrent fixed term of eighteen months penal servitude for failing to account for the money on 17 March. 
      
     4  
     The argument in support of the appeal was centred upon an ultimate proposition that the enveloping sentence was manifestly excessive. It was said to be so because the sentencing judge had failed to give sufficient weight to three matters in particular. The first was the surrender of the applicant. It was said that in the absence of the applicant it could not be said that there was a strong Crown case. That submission confuses two separate matters. The Crown case was at all times strong. What was necessary was the presence of the applicant in order for that case to proceed. His Honour was well aware that the applicant had voluntarily presented himself to police. It was one of the first things he mentioned in his remarks on sentence. 
      
     5  
     The second matter was the gap of thirteen years which had elapsed since the applicant had committed any offence. It was correctly acknowledged by the learned Crown Prosecutor that that gap represented something which was unusually encountered in circumstances such as these. The applicant had last been before a Court in 1985 where he had received a sentence of 300 hours community service for being an accessory before the fact to a break, enter and steal. He then was of apparent good behaviour for the next thirteen years. Again this is not a matter which his Honour overlooked. Indeed he expressly said that he would take into consideration that the applicant had been ""out of trouble"" for some thirteen years.  
      
     6  
     The third matter related to a finding by his Honour concerning the general topic of gambling. The evidence in relation to this was in a sense ephemeral and to a large extent speculative. The applicant claimed at the sentencing hearing that he had what was described as a gambling problem. He gave no explicit evidence of the expenditure of any part of the ill-gotten gains of these crimes upon gambling. There was a statement by the young lady with whom he had a relationship that she had seen him on the previous night, which I take to have been 17 March, gamble at a higher rate than on other occasions. But that is somewhat distant from giving evidence of some compulsive gambling problem. There were other pieces of evidence relating to gambling. The applicant is the father of a small boy from an earlier relationship. The mother of that boy spoke to the lady with whom he was in the relationship at the time of these offences and mentioned that he had been a problem gambler of some sort. Surprisingly, therefore, the applicant when interviewed by psychologist for the purpose of his sentencing proceedings and indeed, when interviewed by police after surrender, made no mention of a compulsion to gambling being the inspiration for his offence.  
      
     7  
     There is one other aspect of the evidence concerning gambling to which reference should be made. On 23 April when the applicant surrendered to police, he had previously gone to see an officer of the Salvation Army a bout what he called “a gambling addiction"". The only information before the sentencing Court was this assertion by the applicant relayed by Major Rose. His Honour thought it was not without significance that the approach to the Salvation Army was made whilst the applicant was in custody. That observation by his Honour was patently wrong. The applicant must have seen Major Rose before he was taken into custody although the visit was on the same day as he surrendered.  
      
     8  
     Recognising that error, however, his Honour in his remarks on sentence recorded that the applicant had, in effect, advanced as a reason for his crimes that he was a compulsive gambler. His Honour's finding was expressed in these terms after referring to some of the matters that I have adumbrated: 
      
       
        
         
         ""If he had a gambling problem I am not satisfied that it had anything to do with the offences that he was involved in on these occasions."" 
         
        
       
      
      
     9  
     Given the absence of complaint to the police or to the psychologist, and given the ephemeral nature of the other material I am unpersuaded that that finding by his Honour is demonstrated to be wrong. In any event, even taking into account the matters of surrender, the thirteen-year gap since offending and the asserted gambling problem cumulatively, I am of the opinion that the material still falls still short of demonstrating that there was error in his Honour's assessment of five years as an appropriate overall sentence for the two offences committed by the applicant. The assessment was, in my view, well within the appropriate range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
      
     10  
     I turn, however, to a second matter advanced on behalf of the applicant and it relates to the division of the major (enveloping) term into minimum and additional components. His Honour observed that it had been suggested that because of the applicant's background and the fact, which I note was no more than really an assertion, that he was a compulsive gambler, that there was a case made out for special circumstances, that is to say an extension of the additional term component of the sentence during which the applicant might be on parole. His Honour finally said: 
      
      ""In my view there has not been evidence put before me sufficient to require me to make a finding of special circumstances and I decline to do so."" 
      
      
     11  
     It is apparent from the observations that I have made that the submission made to his Honour, seeking a finding of special circumstances in the sense that I have mentioned, was based upon reference to the so-called gambling problem. It appears to have been overlooked in this context that the thirteen-year gap in offending was a matter of considerable significance. The significance of it is that it is evident that given the appropriate circumstances the applicant appears capable of maintaining himself in a situation of good behaviour for an extended period of time. It follows that there is a real benefit to be perceived in the supervision of the applicant in an attempt to return him into a law-abiding situation.  
      
     12  
     The statutory division of term which his Honour necessarily applied when he declined to find special circumstances, left a period of only one year and three months during which the applicant might be supervised whilst on parole. That period would seem on an overall view to be too short to be of as much assistance as would be appropriate to this case. It seems to me that an additional six months would bring the sentence and the additional term component thereof into a span when it might usefully return the applicant to the path of rehabilitation which he seems to have achieved after 1985 until these offences were committed. 
      
     13  
     I would therefore propose the following orders. That the application for leave to appeal be granted. That the appeal be allowed. That the total terms imposed on the first and second counts be reimposed. That is to say on the first count the applicant be sentenced to a total term of five years penal servitude but in lieu of the orders below, it be ordered that that term consist of a minimum term of three years and three months to commence on 23 April 1998 and to expire on 22 July 2001, together with an additional term of one year and nine months commencing on 23 July 2001. On the second count the applicant have the sentence confirmed of eighteen months penal servitude to commence on 23 April 1998 and expire on 22 October 1999. That it be specified that the applicant be eligible for parole from 22 July 2001 and that whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.  
      
     14  
     KIRBY J: I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons given for those orders.  
      
     15

   JUDGMENT1. The plaintiff in these proceedings was granted leave to discontinue on 5 October 2007. The plaintiff had commenced these proceedings by way of statement of claim filed on 28 March 2007 asserting that on or about 10 October 2001 the defendant published to a Reverend Craig Fulton some words, which I will not set out in this judgment because of the damaging nature of their contents.2. The matter came before me for directions on 27 April, 1 June and 27 June 2007. It was agreed that there would be trial before a judge alone (sitting without a jury), but it appears that the parties were operating under the misapprehension that the matter would be conducted under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and were not aware of the Court of Appeal decision in Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2006) 65 NSWLR 264 which required a s 7A jury trial to be empanelled. This was drawn to their attention apparently by Mr Evatt. Mr Evatt appeared before me ex parte on 27 June and obtained a provisional date for a s 7A jury trial. There was objection by the plaintiff and when the attention of counsel for the plaintiff was drawn to Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd the matter was stood over to 17 August and then to 24 August for allocation of s 7A jury trial, with an estimate of two days plus.3. The date of Monday 3 December was provisional and was not convenient. Attempts by me to give a provisional hearing on Wednesday 17 October were also unsuccessful. In the meantime, the plaintiff had been ordered to file statements. The defendant filed a s 7A defence denying publication and the plaintiff was then obliged to file statements by 31 August. The plaintiff did not do so. The plaintiff made an offer on 30 May 2007 seeking an apology and a small amount of costs. The defendant on 4 July offered to settle for agreed costs of $15,000.00.4. In Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201, Hill J set out the basic principles relating to cost on discontinuance. His Honour noted these as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
     “(1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order:  
     Stratford  
     and the  
     SEQEB  
     case. 
     (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford supra. This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. 
     (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them (SEQEB, supra). 
     (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh (1933) 33 SR(NSW) 371. 
     (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the court may take into account the fact that that interlocutory relief has been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd (in liq) [1973] 1 NSWLR 603 at 606 , a case which, however, depended upon the specific wording of the statute under consideration.” 
    5. Effectively there are two kinds of cases where there is discontinuance, as Burchett J said in ONE.TEL Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 543. The first is where one of the parties, after litigating for a while, effectively surrenders to the other, and the second is one where it is not the case that one or the other side has won, it is simply that no issue remains between the parties except that of costs; examples of this are applications for interim injunctions and the like.6. Neither side referred me to the ongoing debate in the Court of Appeal about whether or not there is a presumption that the discontinuing party pays the costs. This application solely relates to the issue of whether the circumstances of iniquity or injustice of the kind referred to by Hunt J in Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486 have occurred. I therefore do not need to concern myself with the strong dissenting view of Santow JA in Fordyce v Fordham (2006) 67 NSWLR 497. The question is whether or not the conduct of the plaintiff warrants an order for indemnity costs.7. I have read the correspondence that has been handed up to me. I have also had some explanation from the bar table about the circumstances in which the plaintiff commenced proceedings, it has to said, at the eleventh hour. I have an unfettered discretion as to costs and I have to take into account that when a case such as this started it is distressing for both parties. It is distressing for the plaintiff who may or may not believe he has been defamed and it is distressing also for the defendant to be faced with a statement of claim served many years afterwards. However, the circumstances in which an order for indemnity costs would be made in relation to proceedings commenced for defamation would really have to fall within the classes set out by Hunt J in Packer v Meagher. 8. It is my view that there is no disentitling factor of a kind, no delinquency of the kind referred to by Hunt J in Packer v Meagher in this case. This is a case where the plaintiff has commenced proceedings and has discontinued them and while there is not a presumption that costs should follow the event, that is the usual pattern and I see no reason why that should be varied here.9. I do note that there is an offer to settle which is a Calderbank offer dated 4 July 2007, and that is a matter about which I have not been addressed. I have no way of knowing whether the estimate of costs at $15,000.00 is reasonable. It does seem to me that, for a matter that has been before the Court for mention only, for a total of seven times, including today, plus the time Mr Evatt mentioned it without the other side being present, this is somewhat erring on the side of indemnity costs rather than party/party costs. If there had been an offer to pay costs on a party/party basis I would have given serious consideration to the making of an order for indemnity costs on the basis that it was a Calderbank offer and the plaintiff had not effectively done better. 10. However, in the circumstances, it is my view that the appropriate order to make is that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs on a party/party basis. These costs are to include the costs of today because in my view, the costs of today are an indistinguishable part of this litigation. While Mr Rollinson may have succeeded in persuading me that the costs of today should not be ordered on an indemnity basis, it is my view that the circumstances in which such an application was made are so inherently a part of the costs of this litigation that they should not be separated out. Accordingly it is my view that I should not make a separate order for the plaintiff who has successfully opposed this order to be entitled to the additional advantage of doing so at the defendant’s expense. 11. Accordingly the orders that I make are as follows:(1) Grant leave to the plaintiff to file a Notice of Discontinuance in court.(2) The plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs on a party/party basis, including the defendant’s costs of today and in relation to this argument.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The trial of Dennis Arthur Bellchambers is listed before me. Before commencing the trial Mr Bellanto told me that he had an application to make. He said it would be “preferable” (and I quote Mr Bellanto in the use of that word,) that I not do the trial. When I inquired why, it was apparent that no legal reason could be articulated for that application. 2 The most that perhaps can be said is that in an earlier trial I made a ruling that some evidence would be admissible as tendency evidence. That trial resulted in a hung jury. Subsequently another trial was held before another Judge who ruled that although the evidence to which I have referred was admissible, it was admissible as relationship evidence.3 That trial resulted in a conviction which was overturned on appeal, the appeal having nothing to do with the admission of the evidence. It is said that perhaps I might be influenced by the earlier decision that I have made concerning the admissibility of the evidence. I made no ruling as to Mr Bellchambers’ guilt or otherwise. Mr Bellanto does not suggest that I made any comments suggesting that I formed a view as to Mr Bellchambers’ guilt. I can see no possibility that there could be any suggestion that a fair-minded observer would have an apprehension that I might be biased one way or the other in this case.4 The Crown Prosecutor also suggested it would be “preferable”, again using that word, that I not do the trial. He suggested that perhaps Mr Bellchambers might have an apprehension that I would be unable to bring an unprejudiced mind to this case, but the basis for that observation was never really made clear to me. 5 The matter is listed before me, matters should not likely be shuffled from judge to judge without good reason. There is no good reason, I propose to do the trial.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: This morning evidence was called from Mr Kennedy. He had previously been interviewed by police. A video recording of that interview is available. I have read the transcripts of what he said. There is material in the interview which the Crown seeks to rely on. There was also material which I expect that the accused will seek to rely on. 2 This judgment concerns the admissibility of that part of the recorded interview which concerns admissions made by KJ to Mr Kennedy. Mr Kennedy professed to have no memory of many things in the witness box when he was called on the voir dire this morning. In particular he could not recall someone called BR; did not know a person by the name of KJ or KB, one of the accused, and could not recall being to premises where it is common ground that relevant events occurred.3 In the interview with the police, he said something quite different. Whether or not he was making a genuine attempt to give evidence, it is clear that Mr Kennedy has made a prior inconsistent statement and thus he can be cross-examined under s 38 of the Evidence Act. I did not understand counsel for either accused to challenge what I have thus far said.4 The question then becomes what happens to the recorded interview that Mr Kennedy made with the police. The Crown wishes to tender that interview in accordance with the Court of Criminal appeal decision in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96. Mr Stratton SC and Mr Evers accept that the Crown is entitled to put before the jury some parts of that interview but submit that what is not admissible by the means I have just described is the playing to the jury of statements made by Mr Kennedy to police that the effect that KJ had made admissions to him. 5 This judgment as I have said is limited to the admissibility of that evidence. That is, is the Crown entitled to play to the jury that part of the ERISP where Mr Kennedy says to police that KJ made admissions to him? This issue is not without difficulty. It is, for me at least, a difficult area of the law. The jury has been in the jury room for the entirety of the morning. It is important therefore that I give judgment in the matter sooner rather than later. 6 The starting point perhaps for an analysis of the legal issue that presents itself is the decision of the High Court in Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594. There the High Court held that the Crown was not entitled to put before the jury a statement made to a police officer in which the person making the statement had told police that the accused Lee had admitted to him that he had just committed a robbery. At first blush one might have thought that would cover the present situation but the Crown seeks to distinguish Lee on this basis: the Crown says that it is an important distinction that what Mr Kennedy said to police was recorded electronically rather than being simply typed out in a statement which Mr Kennedy signed.7 The Crown relies on two decisions, in particular, of the Court of Criminal Appeal, one of R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509 and one of Tan v R [2008] NSWCCA 332 In both cases, the Court of Criminal Appeal distinguished Lee and held that the Crown was entitled to play to the jury as evidence a video recording made when a witness repeated what the accused had told him. The Crown says that the point of distinction between Lee and the two Court of Criminal Appeal cases is that what the witness in Lee said was recorded only by way of written statement but in the latter two cases it was recorded electronically so that the jury could hear the witness’s very words as he told police what he had been told. 8 Mr Stratton and Mr Evers on the other hand say that that is not the relevant point of distinction at all. They say that the relevant point of distinction is that in R v Suteski and in R v Tan the original utterances were not relied on to establish the truth of what was said. They say that in this case the Crown seeks to rely on statements made by KJ to establish the truth of what is said and thus those statements were hearsay when they were said to Mr Kennedy and become second hand hearsay when he repeats them to the police. 9 The resolution of the issue is not without difficulty. It is required close examination of the two Court of Criminal Appeal decisions in particular.10 It is to be noted that even if the Crown is right and there is a relevant point of distinction between Lee and the Court of Criminal Appeal cases concerning the means by which the witness’s utterances to the police are recorded, that does not necessarily mean that the point of distinction relied on by Mr Stratton and by Mr Evers is not also present.11 The Crown has taken me to various passages of two decisions in which the Court of Criminal Appeal refers to the difference between a statement and an ERISP. The Crown relies on passages where the Court of Criminal Appeal points out that it is one matter to have a police officer repeat in the witness box what a witness has said to him or her but it is a completely different matter, as far as the law of evidence is concerned, for a video recording of the witness’s words to be played to the jury. 12 There is, as far as the laws of evidence are concerned, a difference between a statement made to the police, even one signed by the witness, and a video recording of that witness’s words, and the difference is made apparent where, as here, the witness denies or fails to recall, what the witness earlier said. In the case of a statement, proof that it was made would require the calling of the person to whom the utterances were made to say that the witness had said certain things to him or her, which were then recorded in written form. That of course could amount to second-hand hearsay. But as the Crown points out, that problem is eliminated where the video recording itself is played. There needs in that case to be no, if I can call it, retransmission of the utterances through the intervening police officer. So I accept that, as the Crown points out, there is a valid point of distinction between Lee on the one hand and Tan and Suteski on the other. 13 But as I said above that is not the end of the matter. The question remains whether doing what the Crown proposes to do is prohibited because it would involve second-hand hearsay being put to the jury. I should interpose here to say that is common ground that the amendments made to s 60 of the Evidence Act amendments made in response to the decision of Lee v The Queen do not impact upon that decision as far as insofar as the present case is concerned. 14 In Lee v The Queen it is clear that the Crown was relying on the statements made by the witness in order to prove their truth. Of course the witness said other things apart from the fact that Lee had made admissions to him, but the Crown was in particular relying on the words spoken by Lee to the effect that he had committed a robbery, that is an admission, which has always been accepted as being hearsay, albeit admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule because it is an admission against the person’s interest.15 In Tan and Suteski, the utterances made by the relevant accused were relied on not to prove the truth of what was asserted but to merely prove that they were said, that is for a non-hearsay purpose. This distinction also appears to have been important to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In Suteski at para 104 Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
      “His Honour accepted however that where Sakisi had repeated to the police assertions of fact by someone else, and where the only relevance of that evidence was the facts asserted, it would have been second-hand hearsay. Similarly repetition by a police officer of Sakisi’s account would have been second-hand hearsay.” 
      
    (I quoted the entire passage for completeness but it is the first sentence which is of most importance.) 16 The trial judge in Suteski accepted something which the Court of Criminal Appeal also appears to have accepted, namely that where assertions of fact are made by a witness and where the only relevance of that evidence was the facts asserted, this would have been second-hand hearsay. This suggests that had the position in Suteski been that the only relevance of what the accused said was that it amounted to an admission, it would have been accepted by the trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal that that was second-hand hearsay. 17 Similarly in Tan Tobias J says at 101: 
     
      
       
      “The answers to the questions of which complaint is made did not amount to confessional material of the nature of that which was rejected in Lee.” 
      
    18 The material before me is confessional material of the nature of that which was rejected in Lee.19 I am therefore satisfied that the Crown is not entitled to play that part of the ERISP to the jury where it contains admissions by KJ. To do so would put before the jury second-hand hearsay, a matter that was adverted to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in those two passages that I have just quoted.20 Although the Crown is right in saying that a relevant point of distinction between Lee on the one hand and Tan and Suteski on the other is that the witness’s utterances to the police were recorded by way of electronic video recording, Mr Stratton and Mr Evers are also right in that the playing to the jury of what Mr Kennedy said that KJ had told him would involve second-hand hearsay. 21 Accordingly the Crown application to play that part of the video recording to the police is refused.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Kolja Nikoljic appeals against four sentences of imprisonment imposed by a magistrate after the appellant pleaded guilty to four counts of obtaining a benefit by deception. In relation to each of those counts there are associated forms 1 relating to other similar offences. 2 In overall terms, taking into account the four offences plus the four forms 1, the appellant defrauded insurers of the sum of $363,642.63. I have looked at the matter in overall terms at this stage because of Ms Rodger’s submissions, they being focused on the overall term imposed by the magistrate of imprisonment for four years and two months with a non-parole period of three years and two months.3 The sentences imposed by the magistrate also should be looked at individually. For the first matter he received 289 days imprisonment, that being a fixed term. Identical sentences were imposed on the second and third matters. But on the fourth there was a sentence of 654 days imposed with a non-parole period of 289 days. All of those sentences were ordered to be served cumulatively.4 The fact that the sentences for the first three matters are significantly less than the sentence for the final matter suggests that the magistrate has given effect of the principle of totality by reducing the sentences which would otherwise have been imposed for those matters. It would have been preferable for him to have imposed identical sentences on each count to reflect the identical criminality, subject to minor variations about the amount involved, and ordered that the sentences be served partially accumulatively. However, the approach which the magistrate took was open to him and there has been no suggestion that any error was made in that respect.5 The offences were brazen. The offender registered completely fictitious businesses. As soon as the business is established, he obtained up to five workers compensation policies in relation to each business. Through those means, he had obtained fourteen workers compensation policies for businesses which did not exist. The next stage was that the appellant would then lodge a workers compensation claim under each of the policies. He or another person would attend at a doctor using a false name and then he would make a workers compensation claim in relation to the injuries supposedly observed by the doctor. The businesses were fictitious and so were the employees. Through these means the offender obtained more than $350,000. These were, thus, very serious offences involving ongoing, deliberate defrauding. 6 The offender is fifty-three years of age and has a reasonably lengthy criminal history. Most of those matters do relate to driving offences, but it is significant to see that there are other offences of dishonesty on his criminal history for which he received sentences of imprisonment. 7 Ms Rodger asked me to accept that the offender was remorseful. That is a difficult submission to make in view of the contents of the presentence report. Under the heading Attitude to the Offences this appears: 
     
      
      “Mr Nikoljic completely minimised his role in the current offences, blaming his co-offenders for organising the whole scheme and stating that his own involvement had been very negligible. The offender appeared to have no recognition of the antisocial nature of his offending conduct. He also did not appear to take any personal responsibility for his offending behaviour, either present or past.” 
      
    I reject the submission that he is remorseful.8 Ms Rodger said also that he was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions. In this respect she relies upon a psychologist’s report. The psychologist diagnoses the appellant as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, the initial stress coming when he was the subject of a robbery by violent criminals. However, there is little that I can see in the presentence report explaining why those suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, and in particular why this appellant, would be unable to recognise that the consequences of systematic defrauding are a significant breach of the law and the suffering of significant loss.9 The next matter relied on by Ms Rodger was the plea of guilty entered by the appellant. That came only on the day that the matter was listed for hearing, although some short time earlier a plea had been indicated to WorkCover who were the prosecuting authority. It may be that there has been some delay in the appellant’s lawyers conveying to the prosecutor the intention of their client to plead guilty, but the discount that Ms Rodger was addressing is a discount for the utilitarian value of a plea, which is not affected by any delays in a person’s lawyer communicating an intention to plead guilty to a prosecutor. It is the utilitarian value which is taken into account, and that appears to have been done so adequately by the magistrate. It may be that the plea of guilty has other benefits such as an expression of remorse, but in this case I am not satisfied at all, even taking into account the plea of guilty as well, that the offender is remorseful. 10 There is one matter which Ms Rodger referred me to which is somewhat unusual. In the course of the robbery which I mentioned earlier the appellant shot and killed one of the would-be robbers. He was tried for murder, but acquitted. Nevertheless, the fact that he has killed a person who was trying to rob him has led to him serving his sentence in something of a state of fear. He is concerned that those who knew or are related to the person whom he killed might seek retribution from him whilst in custody. It may be necessary at some time in the future for the offender to serve his sentence on protection. I will take that matter into account. Whether he serves his sentence in protection or not, there is no doubt that the offender will do his time in custody harder than the rest of the prison population.11 Ms Rodger also relied on the offender’s age. He is fifty-three. It has to be said that there are very few ages which are not the subject of submissions by defence lawyers. There is nothing particularly significant about someone being fifty-three. He is not elderly, nor is he young. I do not regard his age as significant at all.12 Ms Rodger addressed me about some similar cases, or cases which she said were similar. Without me going through them, Ms Rodger in this judgment, Ms Rodger submitted that the four years two months head sentence was slightly excessive. But I took that to mean that she could not say that the head sentence was outside the range appropriate to this sort of offence and this sort of conduct. When looking at the cases to which Ms Rodger referred me, there was no information given as to whether the offenders in those cases had blemish-free criminal histories or had been doing this sort of thing regularly in the past. As I have noted, the offender does have previous offences of this nature on his criminal history, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment.13 Ms Rodger’s main submission, however, was directed to the issue of special circumstances. A calculation of the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall head sentence reveals that the former is 76 per cent of the latter. Ms Rodger relied on those factors which I have already identified as suggesting the need for an extended period of supervision on parole. 14 When I look at the offender’s criminal history revealing an absence of any willingness to take advantage of leniency which is offered to him in the past, when I look at the presentence report suggesting the response of the offender to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, (and I include here this sentence, “overall Mr Nikoljic’s response to supervision has been very negative, with him having breached almost every order he has been placed on”), and when I consider the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct, I am satisfied that no less overall non-parole period is appropriate.15 The appeal is dismissed and the orders of the magistrate are confirmed.16 CASSELTON: Your Honour, does that include the restitution orders which were made below?17 HIS HONOUR: Yes, of course. It includes the restitution orders made by the magistrate.

    JUDGMENT1. HIS HONOUR: I want the accused to be referred to, for the purposes of this judgment only, as K.N. Today, 28 May 2007 K.N.’s trial was set down for hearing at the Penrith District Court. He had been arraigned by the crown earlier this year on a charge that he had sexual intercourse with a twenty-one year old complainant, A..H., in December of 2005 without her consent, knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the offence he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon her.2. Today, 28 May 2007, The Daily Telegraph announced on its front page it was launching a major campaign to help rape victims and to encourage more women to come forward. Normally it would be difficult to find a nexus between these two events. Mr Pickin, counsel for the accused, has made an application for a temporary stay of the trial upon the grounds that in the face of the launch of The Daily Telegraph’s complaint there is a risk the accused may not receive a fair trial.3. That application has been made pursuant to s.19 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Although that section is headed ‘Traverse of Indictment’ it seems to me that the terms of subs. 2 are wide enough to permit such an application to be made.4. The Crown opposes the application. The onus falls to the accused to demonstrate the risk that his trial would not be a fair trial in all the circumstances.The crown case. 5. The Crown alleges that the accused and complainant were both employed by the same company. It was in this way they had come to know each other. Early in December 2005 the Crown says the complainant had dropped an item off at the accused’s premises. She had at that time a short visit with him. She was picked up by her boyfriend and departed. She had inadvertently left her mobile phone at the accused’s place. It was during the return visit to retrieve the mobile phone, on the Crown case, that she was the subject of aggressive, non-consensual sexual activity by the accused.6. On the Crown case the complaint was never consenting, she made her absence of consent known verbally and by her body language as she physically struggled to resist him.7. On the Crown case the accused was in no doubt she was not consenting, demonstrated not only by his use of physical aggression to subdue her but also by the words used when so doing.8. On the Crown case in the course of this aggressive, physical encounter the accused forced at least one finger into the complainant’s vagina and manipulated it there for some moments.9. On the Crown case the complainant escaped from the accused’s premises, complained immediately to her boyfriend, was cared for by other friends who witnessed her distress. She was taken to a police station where she made a statement.10. The Crown has medical evidence on its case supporting the complainant’s account of receiving actual bodily harm.11. The following morning police arrested the accused. He denied assaulting the complainant. He told police she claimed to be “As horny as hell”, showed him she was not wearing underwear and “Came on” to him.12. The accused told police that he had pushed her off the lounge and away from him. She then left the premises leaving behind her shoes and mobile phone.Evidence on the application. 13. Six articles were tendered from today’s “The Daily Telegraph”. Also tendered was an Internet printout of a companion article from The Daily Telegraph’s website entitled “It’s time to end rape nightmare”. This article is attributed Janet Fyfe-Yeomans and Lisa Davies.14. The relevant portions of that article are set out below.  
     
      
      “The shocking treatment of rape victims by the courts has been overwhelmingly condemned by police, prosecutors and health workers The Daily Telegraph can reveal. 
      
     
     
      
      The State Government’s own sexual assault task force has found the criminal justice system guilty of violating and humiliating women all over again... 
      
     
     
      
      The truth is eight percent of rape cases reported to police are never prosecuted. Of those that make it to trial almost three out of four end up in an acquittal. 
       
       
      Between seventy and ninety percent of rapes are never reported. That’s thirty-five thousand rapes of women - and the victims are usually women - in New South Wales every year that are never even investigated. 
       
       
      The Daily Telegraph today launches a campaign to give victims of sexual assault equal justice under law, to make the system fairer and to encourage more women to report sexual assaults. 
       
       
      The campaign has been put together in consultation with rape victims, the NSW Rape Crisis Centre, police and academics.  
      Read on to find out the reforms we seek. If you wish to support the campaign  
      c 
      lick here to add your name to our petition 
      . 
       If you want to have your say on the subject then use the feedback form at the bottom of this story. 
      
     
     
      
      ...While the State Government established a task force following public outrage over the notorious gang rape trial in 2003 and 2004 nothing has been done about its findings. 
      
     
     
      
      The Daily Telegraph 
       campaign seeks four key reforms. 
      
    #1 No delays 
     
      
      Rape cases can last several years, this is far too long. The longer a case takes the more likely the victim will drop out. 
       
       
       
      The Daily Telegraph 
       wants a limit of twelve months to be set from the date charges are laid to the end of the appeals process. 
       
      
     
     
      
      This should be broken up into three deadlines: Four months from charges to committal; four months from committal to trial; four months to decide appeals. 
       
      In South Africa specialist courts ensure no rape case takes more than seven months. 
      
     
     
      
      The District Court has already tackled part of this process. 
       
       
      Earlier this year it introduced priority lists for rape charges and ordered lawyers must be ready to start trial within four months of the case being committed for trial. 
      
    #2 Lawyers for Victims 
     
      
      In thirteen European countries rape victims have a right to some form of legal representation. 
       
       
      This is not the case in New South Wales. 
      
     
     
      
      The defendant has a lawyer and the crown has a lawyer but the victim does not. It was recently made clear by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to gang rape prosecutor Margaret Cunneen that the crown prosecutor’s role was not to support or represent the victim. Their role is to prosecute the police charges. 
       
      
     
     
      
      Lawyers for the victim should be able to object to unduly hostile cross-examination of the complainant but also provide information about the investigation and trial process and make submissions at bail hearings. 
       
       
      A NSW study on rape trials showed victims could be asked questions on the same issue between twenty and a hundred and seventy different times indicating trial judges don’t always intervene to stop the harassment of witnesses. 
      
    #3 No Means No 
     
      
      This must be enshrined in the criminal law, the government task force reported that consent was a difficult concept for jurors to understand when wrapped up in legalese. 
       
      A simple statutory definition of consent should be adopted that states the person has a capacity to consent and they did so freely and voluntarily. 
      
    #4 One Stop Shop15. The six articles tendered from today’s The Daily Telegraph commenced with a first article on the front page, thereafter there were five other articles on pages 5 and 6.16. The front page article with white on black background, two inch headlines “Justice For Women Now”. Then a series of bullet points 
     
     “Ninety percent of rapes left unreported 
     Victims face marathon trials 
     Horrific court room questions 
     Today, we say enough is enough”. 
    17. Then a paragraph in normal font, again still white on black background: 
     
      
       “Too many women are refusing to report sexual assaults because they are frustrated with our torturous legal system and how it allows them to be humiliated all over again.  
      The Daily Telegraph 
       today launches a major campaign to help rape victims and encourage more women to come forward.”. 
      
    Underneath that contained in a box is this: 
     
      
      “Full report and how you can help: Pages 6 and 7”. 
      
    On page 5, the first article contains the following:It is headed, 
     
      
        
      “Consent Issue, It’s a Legal Barrier. 
       
       Judges and lawyers have vigorously opposed a commonsense change to the rape laws that were to define for the first time what consent means. 
      
     
     
      
       There is currently no statutory definition of consent in the NSW law. 
      
     
     
      
       Judges must base their decisions on common law which is based on decisions from previous court cases, but the common law rule provides that consent obtained after persuasion is still consent. 
       
       
       The rule also requires the prosecution to prove that the victim did not consent. 
       
       
       The government sexual assault task force recommended a simple legal definition of consent that states: ‘A person consents if he or she freely and voluntarily agrees to the sexual act and has the capacity to make that choice’... 
       
       
       But a study of juries in eighteen sexual trials found jurors had little idea what consent meant - which is not surprising in light of what the trial judge must currently tell them. 
       
       
       The judge must direct the jury that in order to establish that the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented to the sexual act the Crown must: *PROVE beyond reasonable doubt that his or her state of mind was such that either he realised the possibility the complaint was not consenting and went ahead regardless: or *PROVE he failed to consider whether or not the complainant was consenting and went ahead when the risk that the complainant was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with the accused’s mental capacity had they turned their mind to it. 
       
       
       The NSW Director of Public Prosecution, Nicholas Cowdey has supported writing a simple definition of consent into the law...”. 
      
    18. The second article appears with in a picture frame of a couple photographed from behind, the male leaning against a tree under the heading “Numbers Reveal the Sad Truth”. It really is a series of bullet points. 
     
     “Between seventy and ninety percent of sexual assaults are never reported to police. 
     More than eight percent of sexual offences reported to police do not proceed to prosecution. 
     Most accused rapists plead not guilty. 
     In the Local Court only twenty-four percent of people charged with a sex offence pleaded guilty compared to forty-eight percent of those charged with assault and fifty-seven point one percent overall. 
     In the higher courts thirty-five point three percent of people accused of a sexual offence plead guilty compared to sixty-five point one percent charged with assault and seventy point seven percent of all offences generally. 
    19. In the second column of that article appears: 
     
      
      “Daily Telegraph 
       
      Show your support. Join our online petition seeking justice for rape victims and listen to the NSW Rape Crisis Centre, Karen Willis explaining the campaign. 
       
      dailytelegraph.com.au” 
      
    And then continuing on in that second column is the bullet points made that I earlier referred to including these two: 
     
     “In the Local Courts thirty-six percent had the case dropped compared to seven percent of all offenders. 
     In the higher court charges were dropped against 23.3% of sex offence defendants compared to just 8.3% of defendants generally”. 
    20. That material was said to be sourced from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.21. The third article is headed “It’s Time to End Rape Nightmare”. That article reflects the material I earlier referred to coming from the Internet.22. A fourth article is under the heading “Resolving to Fight After a Trial’s Terrors”. That article purports to report Salvation Army Major Joyce Harmer’s experiences in supporting one of the complainants during a hard-fought sexual assault trial of some notoriety conducted in 2002. Major Harmer has of course retired for more than a year now but was well-known in the Downing Centre.23. The fifth, is an article headed “Brave Victim Vows to Help Campaign”. That recounts claimed aspects of a rape victim’s ordeal experienced after she complained of rape. Her personal views on the need for reform as a result of her post-sexual assault experiences are also canvassed.24. The final article is headed “Now It’s Lawyers Turn to Change”. This article focuses upon claimed tactics employed by some defence barristers. Of relevance to this application are the following: 
     
      
      ...”But put some of them (defence barristers) in a court room with an accused rapist for a client and it becomes a blood sport in which the woman as the witness in the witness box is ripped to shreds. 
      
     
     
      
      No-one could fail to be appalled by cross-examination of one young gang rape victim. The barrister for one of the fourteen men who raped her twenty-five times over six hours suggested to her that far from screaming and crying at them to stop she was ‘moaning in pleasure’. 
       
       
      That is not a defence, it’s a crime. 
      
     
     
      
      ...It used to be the police who copped the flack for the clumsy way they dealt with rape victims but they have done a lot of work. Now it is the turn of lawyers and the courts to take a hard look at themselves...”. 
      
    Defence arguments. 25. The defence argue there is a real risk that the accused, although not personally named in any of the articles, would not receive a fair trial commencing today in the face of The Daily Telegraph’s articles and proposed campaign.26. The defence argue that jurors selected today may be influenced by the articles and the call to associate themselves with the campaign.27. The defence argue the articles fail to distinguish between a victim and complainant, telescoping, as I understand the argument, all complainants into de facto victims.28. It is said that impacts upon the directions I must give concerning the presumption of innocence, burden and standard of proof. It is argued the use of statistics exhibited in the article would inhibit the jury in acquitting an accused in circumstances where an acquittal was fairly open on the evidence. 29. It is argued the examination of the evidence and arguments by the jury must be conducted without fear or favour, by which I understand counsel to be saying, dispassionately, calmly and with sound reasoning.30. The Crown argues that there is no personal prejudice to the accused, that directions from the trial judge would adequately address the situation. It points out that in this trial the jury will see things are better than presented in the articles tendered. It pointed to the use of the CCTV for the complainant’s evidence, her access to a support person and that her evidence would be given in camera.31. This is a trial, he says, in which directions will be given upon the burden and standard of proof, he pointed out that the trial will require a “Murray” direction. It was his argument that the directions given by me would adequately deal with any risk of prejudice.Resolution. 32. Justice in New South Wales, particularly insofar as adults are concerned, is almost invariable done in open court. That is so that the Court, its processes and results are available for public scrutiny. For some time now, and in some quarters there has been a level of disquiet about the processes and efficacy of sexual assault trials in New South Wales. 33. The issue raised in today’s The Daily Telegraph are important issues, appropriate for public debate. While I have serious reservations as to the presentation and accuracy of some material presented by The Daily Telegraph in at least some of the articles and editorialising of the reporters, that does not diminish the importance of the debate.34. No doubt jurors making themselves available for selection may also entertain a view as to the importance of the issues raised in the articles but perhaps without the critical eye that I have at least credited myself with having.35. An overview of the reporting and editorialising of the journalists must yield a number of imputations being advanced by them including: 
     
     Female complainants under the present system are not receiving justice. 
     Rape victims are receiving shocking treatment at the hands of the trial court. [and the Appeal Courts] 
     That the problem is so appalling that it has been overwhelmingly condemned by responsible organs of government including police prosecutors, the relevant task force, health workers and others. 
     The absence of a personal lawyer for the complainant disadvantages the complainant. 
     As a consequence of the above ninety percent of rapes are unreported. 
     The court process is so unfair to victims because trials are marathon and/or questions asked by defence counsel are horrific. 
     The situation is so grim that The Daily Telegraph [responsibly] says ‘Enough is enough’ and seeks support from those of its readers willing to help. 
     One of the major failings of the system is the directions currently being given by trial judges.. 
     Further, directions on consent are unfair to the victims of sexual assault. 
     Those directions are out of keeping with better directions sought by a responsible Government task force and the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales. 
     The directions on consent permit accused who rely upon belief of consent that the complainant was consenting to cause the Crown to fail to prove absence of consent. 
    . 36. I interpolate here to suggest the journalist has confused the crown’s obligation to prove absence of consent with the crown’s obligation to prove that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting. 
     
     That a defence lawyer may belong to a group that regard cross-examination of a complainant as a blood sport. 
     That judges are not adequately policing defence counsel’s cross-examination. 
     That defence counsel should censor his/her instructions from the accused and put to a complainant only those that are least offensive to the account given by the complainant. 
     That the human interest stories are compelling evidence of the failure of the court system to give complainants a fair go. 
     That a complaint equals a victim. 
    37. It would appear The Daily Telegraph regards the campaign and debate it has launched as an important opportunity to deal with a social ill that needs to be addressed.38. I am satisfied it is well open that some of the jurors may regard the imputations I have referred to above as fair comment and that holding such a belief may distract that juror or those jurors from their task of confining themselves to the evidence led in Court, to the arguments advanced by counsel in Court and the directions given by the trial judge, particularly on the issues of consent.39. In my view there is, as matters presently stand, a real risk that the accused may not receive a fair trial at this time.40. I am satisfied it is in the interests of justice that the trial be stood over for a month or so by which time I would anticipate the campaign, if it continues to exist, will be more subdued.41. In those circumstances the risk of tainting the fair trial of the accused will obviously abate.42. The application for a temporary stay is granted.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment by Knox DCJ in the District Court refusing an application for a permanent stay of proceedings in that court in relation to a charge that the applicant between 31 October 1996 and 17 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did make a false instrument, namely a letter addressed to John Preston dated 19 April 1984, with the intention of using it, namely to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine, and because of that acceptance to do some act to the prejudice of John Preston. 
     
      
    2 The matter has an unfortunate history, a matter which forms a substantial basis for the application that was made before Knox DCJ and which this Court would be asked to consider. 
     
      
    3 There have been a number of proceedings before the District Court in relation to this charge. The history commences when a magistrate discharged the applicant at committal proceedings on the magistrate's view that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction on that charge. 
     
      
    4 Notwithstanding the magistrate's decision the Director of Public Prosecutions proceeded with the prosecution by filing an ex officio indictment in the District Court. The matter came for trial, firstly, on 31 January 2005. The trial was adjourned on the application of the Crown because of the failure to issue certain subpoenas. The adjournment was granted on 2 February 2005. 
     
      
    5 The matter was again listed for trial on 16 May 2005. That trial commenced before his Honour Judge Phegan. As I understand the situation, the jury retired to consider its verdict but because the jury numbers were reduced to below twelve by the inability of one of the jurors to continue with deliberations, the jury was discharged before verdict. That occurred on 27 May 2005. 
     
      
    6 The third time the matter was before the District Court for trial was on 27 February 2006 before his Honour Judge Geraghty. The jury retired to consider their verdict but unfortunately were unable to come to a unanimous decision and were discharged by his Honour without giving a verdict. 
     
      
    7 The matter then ultimately came before Knox DCJ by way of various interlocutory applications before various judges. There was also, as I understand it, an application made to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a no bill based upon the history of the matter, what was said to be inadequate evidence to support the charge and other subjective considerations. The Director refused the application. 
     
      
    8 The matter came before Knox DCJ. There were again a number of applications made for temporary stays to allow various enquiries to be carried out in relation to a significant piece of evidence in the prosecution case, which is referred to as document Q1, being allegedly the false instrument made and the subject of the charge. 
     
      
    9 Ultimately the situation is that an application was made to Knox DCJ for a permanent stay of the proceedings and that was refused. His Honour then proceeded immediately to commence the trial by empanelling a jury. The trial has been continuing ever since that application was refused on 6 August 2007. 
     
      
    10 An application was brought to this Court for leave to appeal against the decision of Knox DCJ. The matter was fixed for hearing and this Court was due to hear the application. No application had been made to this Court to stay the trial before Knox DCJ pending the resolution of the application before this Court. 
     
      
    11 On the morning of the hearing the Court was notified that the application had been abandoned and that it was to be withdrawn by the applicant. The Court allowed the applicant to withdraw the application and determined to make no further orders. 
     
      
    12 The matter has now come before this Court again on a further application being made for leave to appeal, one filed shortly after the decision had been made by the applicant to abandon the application in this Court. The reasons why there has been this change of view as to whether to proceed with an application in this Court need not be of concern although it appears there has been a difference of opinion as to the merits of the application by counsel who have been briefed to appear for the applicant. 
     
      
    13 The trial is still in progress. We were informed this morning that it has reached the stage that the applicant is giving evidence in the defence case. It is also anticipated that at least one further witness will be called by the defence during the course of the trial and no estimation was able to be given by counsel appearing for the applicant as to when the trial might be conclude. 
     
      
    14 There are a number of grounds of appeal sought to be argued in this Court if leave were granted. Those grounds of appeal deal with matters of the following nature: firstly, it is argued that the trial is oppressive and therefore an abuse of process given the history of the proceedings, the amount of costs already expended by the applicant to this point of time and what is said to be the weakness of the prosecution case. 
     
      
    15 Next is it submitted that there is unfair prejudice to the applicant caused by delay in the prosecution and the consequence that for one reason or another document Q1 can no longer reliably be investigated by a document examiner or any other person who may give relevant evidence in respect of it and its creation by reason of other examinations of the document that have been carried out by various persons at various times. 
     
      
    16 Thirdly it is also submitted that it is an abuse of process for the Director of Public Prosecutions to continue to seek to prosecute this matter particularly in light of the magistrate's original decision to discharge the applicant and the unfortunate history of events including at least one jury being unable to agree upon a verdict. 
     
      
    17 There are I think 14 grounds but in brief they cover the same sort of arguments being abuse of process by reason of oppression, prejudice to the applicant by reason of the difficulties in the applicant now being able to properly have Q1 examined and, further, the lack of likely success of the prosecution case bearing in mind the lengthy history of the matter and the cost to the applicant no doubt both in financial and personal ways. 
     
      
    18 The difficulty for the applicant is that the trial has been proceeding for about two weeks and probably has less than that to proceed to finality. Notwithstanding that this application was being made today, counsel who is appearing for the applicant at the trial made no application to Knox DCJ to stay the proceedings or to seek an adjournment so this matter might be argued before this Court and matters raised in the application for leave to appeal be determined. 
     
      
    19 Insofar as one of the matters relied upon relates to the paucity of the prosecution case, it is significant that as we were informed no application was made to the trial judge at the end of the prosecution case that the matter should be withdrawn from the jury by reason of the inability of the prosecution to prove on the available evidence any one of the elements of the offence. A number of submissions have been made to this Court on the leave application to the effect that there is a deficiency in the prosecution evidence to prove the offence yet no such application was made by counsel appearing for the applicant at trial. With respect there appears to be two cases being presented on behalf of the applicant, one before this Court and one before the trial judge. This is an unacceptable way of this matter being resolved and is caused clearly by the fact the trial is continuing even though the application for leave to appeal against the judgment of Knox DCJ has not been determined. 
     
      
    20 One of the reasons the Court is in this situation is clearly because the applicant himself abandoned the previous application that was before this Court and which the Court was ready to hear. The was at a much earlier stage when that application might have been determined and it may have been that the Court was prepared to grant leave to the applicant notwithstanding that the trial was in progress. 
     
      
    21 One of the most significant matters in considering whether to grant leave is the fact that the applicant is not deprived of arguing any of the matters raised in the application if leave were refused and were he convicted. The provisions of s 5F itself make clear that refusal of leave does not deprive an applicant of taking any point at the hearing of an appeal following conviction that could have been and would have been argued at the hearing of the application. 
     
      
    22 To the extent that some of the submissions relating to unfair prejudice to the applicant depend upon whether or not the trial judge is able to overcome that prejudice by proper directions and warnings to the jury that is a matter that is very often best considered after the trial rather than before it. As I pointed out to the applicant, I know of no decision made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State granting a stay because of the loss of evidence or witnesses by reason of delay or otherwise, or where the accused was contending that in some way by delay or for any other reason he had been prejudiced in carrying out forensic testing on a particular exhibit or otherwise adducing evidence about any particular fact in the prosecution case. 
     
      
    23 Where an accused asserts such prejudice arises, this Court has considered that those matters can generally be addressed by a judge in the summing up pointing out to the jury any prejudice allegedly suffered by the accused in testing the prosecution’s evidence or in calling evidence in reply by reason of delay or for any other reason and asking the jury to take that matter into account when determining whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the offence with which the jury is concerned. 
     
      
    24 In my view this is an appropriate case to refuse the application for leave to appeal. In particular it seems to me that this Court should take that course by reason of the history of the matter in this Court, that is the prior abandonment of the application which the Court was prepared to consider at an earlier stage in the trial, the state of the trial that is presently before Knox DCJ, the conduct of counsel appearing for the applicant at the trial and, importantly the fact that the refusal at this stage of the application does not seem to me to give rise to such prejudice to the applicant that this Court should be prepared to hear the argument on the merit of the matter. 
     
      
    25 I should add that on a brief consideration of the grounds of appeal raised and the arguments set out in the very full written submissions that have been placed before us by counsel for the applicant that there is nothing that this Court would need to address at this stage in order to ensure the accused a fair trial in the proceedings before Knox DCJ. 
     
      
    26 Therefore, in my view, the application for leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
    27 SANTOW JA: I agree. 
     
      
    28 HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    29 SANTOW JA: The order of the court is that leave to appeal is refused.

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    The proceedings 
     
      
    1 These proceedings brought by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia commenced on 16 January 2007 on which occasion orders were made inter alia freezing the defendant's assets in Australia, imposing conditions upon the defendant's entitlement to dispose of or to deal with or diminish the value of any of his ex-Australian assets and, subject to conditions treating with the possibility that the defendant may claim privilege against self-incrimination, ordering that the defendant make written disclosure of all of his assets worldwide. 
     
      
    The notices of motion 
     
      
    2 There are presently before the Court two notices of motion: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. The first, brought by the defendant, seeks a stay of the proceedings until after the completion of concurrent criminal proceedings which have been commenced; 
         
         
        ii. the second, brought by the plaintiff, seeks orders that the defendant file and serve an affidavit, in particular disclosing details of financial institutions in terms of accounts in which the defendant has had an interest over particular periods, detailing the names and addresses of persons or entities to whom the defendant has made loans or gifts over particular periods, detailing the names and addresses of persons or entities to whom the defendant has transferred assets over a particular period and like information. 
        
       
      
    The nature of the proceedings 
     
      
    3 The claims made by the Bank are described in its overview submissions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. The defendant is said to have been employed in the Bank’s Group Security Division. In that role, he is said to have had access to the personal information of the Bank’s customers. In late 2005, the Bank is said to have detected that a large number of fraudulent credit card applications were being made with a similar modus operandi. It is said to have been discovered that multiple applications were being made using the same post office box, and in some cases the same identification referee. As a result, the Bank alleges that it undertook various surveillance measures. Critically, this is said to have led to: 
         
         
          
          a) the observation of the defendant using credit/debit cards at ATMs that had been fraudulently applied for in the names of Bank customers: Bank CDs 1, 3, 4 and 6; 
           
           
          b) the observation of the defendant collecting mail from post office boxes not in his name, that had been used as addresses for fraudulent credit card applications: Bank CDs 2 and 5; 
          
         
         
          
          c) Bank officers ringing the mobile telephone numbers provided on various fraudulent credit card applications. Four Bank officers (co-workers of the defendant) identified the voice on the recorded message for those mobile telephone numbers as being the voice of the defendant: Hilton, Keaney, Moore and Misitano of 12 April 2007; 
           
           
          d) monitoring the defendant’s use of the Bank’s computer system, from which it was discovered that the defendant had accessed the details of three customers in whose name fraudulent card applications had been made: Misitano no. 3 of 24 April 2007. 
          
         
         
          
          e) nine fraudulent credit card applications included with them a forged reference, purportedly signed by Dr P Radvan, a veterinary surgeon in Wakeley. Those references are said to have been compared with a sample of the defendant’s handwriting by an expert handwriting analyst, Ms Novotny. The conclusion of Ms Novotny is said to have been that the defendant had prepared the forged references. 
           
           
          f) the total loss to the Bank from the defendant’s alleged fraud is $1,151,199.94. 
           
           
          
         
        
       
      
    4 A plethora of evidence has been adduced by the Bank exposing its serious case in terms of these allegations and of the alleged wrongdoing of the defendant. This included some four folders of exhibits, which went into evidence as exhibit VMM1 volumes 1 to 4 inclusive and 21 affidavits identified in MFI P1 and the sundry exhibits to those affidavits [which included in various instances bank tapes and bank CDs, some of which evidence was screened during the hearing of the motions]. The stay application 
     
      
    The principles5 There are a number of authorities which set out the principles to be applied on stay applications of the type presently before the Court. Naturally each particular set of circumstances requires to be separately assessed in terms of the principled exercise of the Court's relevant discretion. 
     
      
    6 In what appears to be the most recent affirmation of the well-established principles, Niven v SS [2006] NSWCA 338 Tobias JA [with whose reasons Giles JA agreed] [Beazley JA expressing some reservations] referred with approval to the guidelines stated by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 at 206–207. Those guidelines [excluding citations] were summarised as follows : 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Prima facie a plaintiff is entitled to have his action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the court;  
         
         
        (b) It is a grave matter to interfere with this entitlement by a stay of proceedings, which requires justification on proper grounds;  
         
         
        (c) The burden is on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with;  
         
         
        (d) Neither an accused nor the Crown are entitled as of right to have a civil proceeding stayed because of a pending or possible criminal proceeding;  
         
         
        (e) The court's task is one of ‘the balancing of justice between the parties’, taking account of all relevant factors;  
         
         
        (f) Each case must be judged on its own merits, and it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors;  
         
         
        (g) One factor to take into account where there are pending or possible criminal proceedings is what is sometimes referred to as the accused's ‘right of silence’, and the reasons why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in a criminal proceeding;  
         
         
        (h) However, the so-called ‘right of silence’ does not extend to give such a defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings. The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules  
        merely 
         because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceedings;  
         
         
        (i) The court should consider whether there is a real and not merely notional danger of injustice in the criminal proceedings;  
         
         
        (j) In this regard factors which may be relevant include:  
         
         
          
          (i) the possibility of publicity that might reach and influence jurors in the civil proceedings;  
           
           
          (ii) the proximity of the criminal hearing;  
           
           
          (iii) the possibility of miscarriage of justice eg by disclosure of a defence enabling the fabrication of evidence by prosecution witnesses, or interference with defence witnesses;  
           
           
          (iv) the burden on the defendant of preparing for both sets of proceedings concurrently;  
           
           
          (v) whether the defendant has already disclosed his defence to the allegations;  
           
           
          (vi) the conduct of the defendant, including his own prior invocation of civil process when it suited him; 
           
          
         
        (k) The effect on the plaintiff must also be considered and weighed against the effect on the defendant. In this connection I suggest below that it may be relevant to consider the nature of the defendant's obligation to the plaintiff;  
         
         
        (l) In an appropriate case the proceedings may be allowed to proceed to a certain stage, eg, setting down for trial, and then stayed. 
        
       
      
    7 As Tobias JA observed at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        McMahon 
         was expressly approved in the Court of Appeal by McHugh JA in  
        Halabi v Westpac Banking Corporation 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 26 at 59. After observing that the source of the appropriate power of a court when application for a stay of civil proceedings pending the hearing of criminal proceedings was made was the inherent jurisdiction of the court to prevent an abuse of process and to achieve justice between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant after a proper evaluation of all the relevant circumstances, his Honour identified that approach as having been espoused by Wootten J in  
        McMahon 
        , noting that it had been followed on numerous occasions both in the Court of Appeal and other jurisdictions. It was an approach which required attention be paid  
        to all factors relevant to the case 
        .” [emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    8 Albeit that Mr Tregenza of counsel appearing for the defendant recognised the nature of the guidelines set out in McMahon v Gould in terms of binding a first instance judge, he sought to reserve his client's position to argue on appeal that those guidelines were no longer appropriate or should not be followed in this case for particular reasons.The defendant's submissions in support of the stay application9 The defendant submitted as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        i. In (h) of the criteria in  
        McMahon v Gould 
         Wootten J deals with the right of silence. His Honour puts it that a plaintiff is not debarred from civil proceedings  
        merely 
         because a defence to those proceedings may lead to a disclosure of a defence in the criminal proceedings (the emphasis is His Honour’s). Clearly His Honour anticipates that together with another or other factor/s the “right of silence” may be given full effect. 
         
         
        ii. Taking the factors specifically identified (j) of the criteria in  
        McMahon v Gould 
        : 
         
         
          
          Publicity 
           
           
          a) There is a possibility that publicity might reach and effect potential jurors in the criminal proceedings. The reference in  
          McMahon v Gould 
           is to “jurors in the civil proceedings”. However, that is an obvious typographical error for “jurors in the criminal proceedings” as may be verified by examining the authority upon which that proposition is based (Megaw LJ in  
          Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha 
           [1979] 1 WLR 898 at 905 line E). 
           
           
          b) The likelihood of future publicity is not a matter that is capable of expert evidence and the Court must apply common sense. 
           
           
          c) The matters the subject of these proceedings is of significant public interest. They involve allegations of credit card fraud for an overall large amount of money from a well-known Bank. 
           
           
          d) There is a real possibility of there being publicity in the media by television, radio and newspapers in relation to the civil proceedings if they proceed prior to the criminal trial. That publicity is likely to reach potential jurors. 
          
         
         
          
          Proximity of Criminal Hearing 
          
         
         
          
          a) This factor is usually considered if the criminal proceedings are to be heard within a reasonably short period of time. However, in this matter the criminal proceedings are not far advanced. Even as this application was being foreshadowed in directions hearings before Bergin J. fresh charges were still being laid (the last nine). 
           
           
          b) At this stage the defendant has the benefit of information provided to his legal representatives by the prosecution that there will be no further charges brought against him. Common sense dictates that such assurances may be given in good faith but later departed from as the prosecution develops. At this early stage the ambit of the prosecution cannot be said to be fixed. 
           
           
          c) The defendant has been recently served with the prosecution brief in relation to four of the charges and not that in relation to the balance of the charges. His counsel in the criminal proceedings has not yet considered and advised him in relation to the brief received so far. 
           
           
          d) The defendant has not received the balance of the prosecution brief, being in relation to the further nine charges laid. 
           
           
          e) It is unfair to the defendant to anticipate all relevant factors that may have the effect of denying him a fair trial or which may adversely affect his rights where the defendant does not know the prosecution case that is to be brought against him. 
           
           
          f) It is also unfair to the defendant to prosecute the civil proceedings before he and his legal advisors have had a reasonable opportunity to consider the brief already delivered. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Miscarriage of Justice 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          a) The next factor is the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. The point made in  
          McMahon v Gould 
           is that disclosure of the defence in the civil proceedings may result in interference with the defendant’s witnesses or the fabrication of evidence. The likelihood of those particular events occurring is not raised in this application. 
           
           
          b) In  
          Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha 
           (supra) the possibility of interference with defence witnesses and fabrication of evidence was pointed to merely as an example of situations where a miscarriage of justice could actually arise rather than theoretically arise. Clearly, the manner in which a miscarriage of justice may actually arise is not limited to these two usual and unlikely events. 
          
         
         
          
          c) Just as much as the fabrication of evidence would be a miscarriage of justice, so would the requirement that a defendant defend civil proceedings until he knows the full case against him in the criminal proceedings and has an opportunity to consider his position. 
          
         
        
       
      
    Dealing with the matter 
     
      
    10 In my view none of these submissions makes good the proposition that the stay should be ordered. For the reasons given by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould the Court's task is one of the balancing of justice between the parties taking account of all relevant factors, the burden being on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with. The plaintiff’s submissions are generally adopted in what follows. 
     
      
    11 I deal with the bases relied upon by the defendant seriatim. 
     
      
    “Right to silence” 
     
      
    12 In McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 [at 208] Wootten J said this of the “right to silence”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…there are some consequences of the “right of silence” which no one, so far as I am aware, puts forward as legitimate reasons for its existence. These include the opportunity it may give the accused to remain silent till the end of the evidence given against him at the trial, and then produce a fabricated story perfectly tailored to meet that evidence. They include the possibility of depriving the prosecution of any opportunity to check the accused's story and obtain evidence to refute it before the trial is over. In one particular matter — the last minute production of alibis — the injustice was so frequent and obvious that the legislature made an inroad into the “right of silence” by requiring notice of such an intended defence. 
         
         
        These are advantages which the ""right of silence"" gives to an accused, but they cannot reasonably be regarded as part of the reason why the right exists. In exercising its discretion to stay civil proceedings the court need not be concerned to preserve these advantages. It should be concerned to avoid the causing of unjust prejudice by the continuance of the civil proceedings, not to preserve the tactical status quo in the criminal proceedings whether it be just or unjust.” 
        
       
      
    13 I accept that the submissions for the defendant do not advance any reason why the continuation of these proceedings would cause unjust prejudice, other than to say that “disclosure of the defence in civil proceedings has the potential to deny, wholly or in part, to the defendant that right of silence in the criminal proceedings” and that evidence in the civil proceedings “may have the effect of giving the Crown notice of … how he proposes to conduct his defence”. These perceived tactical advantages do not justify the stay sought. 
     
      
    14 Mr Tregenza also strongly urged upon the Court the proposition that the material injustice to the defendant in the Court not granting a stay was to be found in the fact that the defendant for various reasons could not be said yet to be in a position to know the full ambit of the possible charges to be laid against him and/or to have received proper advice in that regard. In this respect the evidence before the Court was somewhat ambiguous. However, as Mr Tregenza explained, that which Mr Michael Baker had deposed to in his affidavit of 12 May 2007 [concerning the brief in respect of the first four charges having been served and concerning there having been a facts sheet provided by the prosecution in respect of another seven charges, in respect of which the brief in respect of the additional charges had not been served], may or may not be correct. None of that seems to me to be of radical significance in relation to the point which Mr Tregenza sought to make. The essence of the submission was that it was simply inappropriate to permit these proceedings to go forward at this point in time, bearing in mind the pendency of the criminal proceedings and the fact that Mr Michael Gallagher of Lachlan Macquarie Chambers in Parramatta [being the barrister briefed for the defendant in the criminal matters], had stated that he had not yet had an opportunity to read the brief in respect of the first four charges, but proposed to do so in this coming week. Apparently the matter is listed again before the Local Court on Monday 21 May 2007.  
     
      
    15 The plaintiff is entitled in these civil proceedings, unless the defendant has satisfied the Court that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with, to have these proceedings progress in the usual manner. Nothing in the suggested special grounds of injustice put by Mr Tregenza as referred to above is to my mind of substance. It cannot be the case that the plaintiff must stand by dependent upon the exigencies of when those who are briefed by the defendant in the criminal proceedings ultimately place themselves into a position, on an informed basis, to give advice to the defendant. 16 I further accept that the assessment of any asserted prejudice must be made against the facts of the case. While the Bank’s evidence is voluminous, as I have said, having regard to the quantity of the allegedly fraudulent transactions, the case is likely to be essentially a simple one from the plaintiff's side of the Bar table. As the plaintiff has submitted, the Court would likely either accept or reject the identification of the defendant in the video and audio recordings; as the plaintiff has submitted, the defendant is likely to either admit or deny being the person in the recordings and, as the plaintiff has submitted, any evidence which the defendant would give would undoubtedly be the subject of a certificate issued pursuant to section 128 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    The likelihood of future publicity / the proximity of the criminal hearing 
     
      
    17 As the Bank has contended it is useful to consider these points together. Apparently the defendant has been charged with twelve offences or, if not so charged with all twelve, a facts sheet has been provided in respect of the additional seven charges. He has pleaded not guilty to four before the Bankstown Local Court and has not yet been arraigned on the others. He has not yet been committed to the District Court for trial. The defendant has not adduced any evidence of when those charges could be tried. The plaintiff has submitted that realistically it would not be within twelve months that those charges could be tried, but the Court has no hard evidence in relation to that estimate.  
     
      
    18 It seems also correct to observe that if the Court’s judgment in these civil proceedings was to attract some publicity, it will hardly be likely to remain in the memory of members of the public much longer than it will take to turn, as the plaintiff has suggested, the page of a newspaper. The misappropriation of money by employees (including bank employees) is not uncommon. The amount involved in this case is certainly substantial, but is far from astonishing. As the plaintiff has submitted, the criminal law system copes with far greater publicity than this case would ever generate or be likely to generate. As Spigelman CJ observed in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [59]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D'Arcy, Bruce Burrell ( 
        Murphy v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 94;  
        R v Milat 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported);  
        R v Bell 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported);  
        R v Long 
         (2002) 128 A Crim R 11;  
        R v Dudko 
         (2002) 132 A Crim R 371;  
        R v D'Arcy 
         (2003) 140 A Crim R 303;  
        R v Burrell 
         [2004] NSWCCA 185. 
        
       
       
      Naturally the Court does not here regard Mr Tregenza's submissions as being for a permanent stay of the proceedings, but the observations by Spigelman J are nonetheless apt to be cited here. 
       
      
    19 It is also correct to observe that if the defendant had a proper basis for contending that the Court’s judgment in these civil proceedings would interfere with his right to a fair trial in the criminal proceedings, he could apply for an order preventing publication of the judgment until after the verdict: John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476–477 per McHugh JA. 
     
      
    The possibility of a miscarriage of justice 
     
      
    20 The defendant’s submissions in contending that a miscarriage of justice would arise from “the requirement that a defendant defend civil proceedings until he knows the full case against him in the criminal proceedings and has an opportunity to consider his position” are not of substance. As the plaintiff has submitted, this is for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. The Bank sues the defendant for the same matters in respect of which he has been charged (albeit the Bank sues him in respect of many more transactions than those with which he has been charged).  
         
         
        ii. If the effect of the submission is to point to the possibility that the defendant might adopt different strategies in these proceedings as opposed to the criminal proceedings, this is not a matter justifying the stay.  
         
         
        iii. As earlier observed, the defendant’s evidence in these proceedings would undoubtedly, if given, attract a certificate under s 128 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . 
        
       
      
    The Bank’s desire to proceed 
     
      
    21 The Bank claims that its total loss from the defendant’s alleged fraud is $1,151,199.94.  
     
      
    22 However, the defendant asserts in his affidavit of 24 May 2007 to have only net assets of $379,800. On the Bank’s case, the defendant’s affidavit falsely understates the extent of his assets. In this regard the Court's attention has been drawn to the affidavit made by the defendant on 24 January 2007 where an entirely different order of net assets was given. It is correct to say that the sooner the Bank obtains judgment against the defendant, the greater will be its chances or likely chances of recovering some of its loss. Conversely, those chances likely reduce as time continues. 
     
      
    23 In terms of the current forensic position pursued by the Bank, it has made clear that it is ready for the matter to be set down for final hearing and that it seeks for the Court to do so on the earliest available date. It makes the point that the defendant has not yet filed a defence and has made clear that it, the Bank, is prepared to proceed on the basis that it will be put to proof on all issues.  
     
      
    Decision 
     
      
    24 For the reasons given above, the principled exercise of the relevant discretion is to dismiss the motion for the stay. Dealing with the Bank's motion for orders that the defendant file and serve affidavits particularising particular matters and for the defendant to sign particular forms of authority25 In relation to the application pursued by the Bank under cover of its notice of motion filed on 14 May 2007, the Court has made plain during the course of submissions that insofar as there would be no concession by the defendant of his being content to make an affidavit without claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court following Ross v Internet Wines Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 195 would only make the orders sought in the amended notice of motion subject to a condition that if and insofar as the defendant sought to raise an entitlement to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination, that matter would require to be treated with by notice of motion and affidavits of the usual type and ultimately would be determined by the Court. In that event the defendant does not, as long as that condition forms part of the Court's orders, oppose the orders sought in the amended notice of motion in paragraphs 1(a) to (e) inclusive.  
     
      
    26 In relation to the amended notice of motion paragraph (f) the defendant by his counsel Mr Tregenza has made clear that there is no intent to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination so that an order may be made in terms of paragraph 1(f) of the amended notice of motion in unconditional terms.  
     
      
    27 Likewise, in relation to paragraph 2 of the amended notice of motion, the Court will make an order to that effect but only conditional upon the defendant having an entitlement to claim that there should be no requirement that he sign that form by reason of any suggested privilege against self-incrimination. In the event that, as I have already indicated, the stay is not to be granted, the plaintiff does not pursue the relief sought in paragraph 3 of the amended notice of motion.  
     
      
    Costs28 The orders of the Court are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the plaintiff’s amended notice of motion. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · I order that the defendant pay all of the plaintiff's costs of the defendant's notice of motion seeking a stay, excluding any of the plaintiff's costs of and occasioned by the need to prepare exhibits VMM1 volumes 1 to 4 inclusive to the affidavit of Vistoria Marie Misitano sworn on 13 April 2007 and excluding also, any of the plaintiff's costs of the preparation of the materials to be found in MFI P1.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · The Court having earlier ordered that pending conclusion of the hearing of the motions the Bank was to pay the costs of the external transcription, it is necessary to note that those costs are as between the parties to be paid by the defendant in relation to the two motions. Pending that payment the plaintiff is to pay the whole of the external transcription costs. 
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    · I order that the proceedings be before the Commercial List list judge on Friday 18 May 2007 for directions.

   IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONMcDOUGALL J 25 January 2010 (ex tempore – revised 25 January 2010) 2010/21997 DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v WAYNE DENNIS JOHN CLEVELAND  
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for restraining orders under section 18 of The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) and for ancillary orders. The orders are sought ex parte. The application is supported by an affidavit of an ""authorised officer"" of the Australian Federal Police.  
     
      
    2 Section 18 of the Act requires a court having jurisdiction under it to order that property not be disposed of, or not be disposed of except in specified ways, if the DPP for the Commonwealth (DPP) applies for the order; if there are reasonable grounds to suspect, relevantly, that the person against whom the order is sought has committed a ""serious offence"", and if that suspicion is held on reasonable grounds.  
     
      
    3 In this case, the defendant, Mr Cleveland, has been charged with two counts of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin. Each of those offences is a ""serious offence"" for the purposes of s 18.  
     
      
    4 Mr Cleveland, together with his mother and his stepfather, are registered as proprietors of two parcels of land. One of those parcels of land is relevantly unencumbered. The other is mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. To the extent that it is relevant, it may be noted that the stepfather has been charged as a co-accused in the conspiracies.  
     
      
    5 In addition, the affidavit discloses that Mr Cleveland is, or may be, a person having an interest in two sums of currency that were found on a search of his residence.  
     
      
    6 The affidavit is based on a statement of facts prepared by the investigating Australian Federal Police officer, in conjunction with other agents involved in the investigation. There is no need to go to the statement of facts in detail. It sets out, in great detail, numerous communications between Mr Cleveland and others relating to matters described in a rather clumsy code. The code references are clearly capable of being taken as references either to border controlled substances in general, or, in particular, to cocaine. In this context it may be noted that, after the last of those communications, the conspiracy was (according to the statement of facts) executed in that one of the conspirators imported a substantial quantity of cocaine into Australia on an airlines flight and another of the conspirators collected the cocaine from the aeroplane.  
     
      
    7 The communications to which I have referred are clearly capable of showing that Mr Cleveland either orchestrated or was, at the least, involved in the nurturing and execution of that conspiracy.  
     
      
    8 In the circumstances, I am satisfied on the basis of the affidavit not only that the deponent does hold the suspicion to which s 18 refers, but also that there are reasonable grounds for him to hold that suspicion.  
     
      
    9 In the circumstances, and noting that the Commonwealth by the DPP gives the usual undertaking as to damages (failure to give it may justify refusing to make a restraining order - see s 21 of the Act), I am satisfied that some relief should be granted.  
     
      
    10 In this context, I note that, among other things, if the orders sought are made, Mr Cleveland has the right to rely under s 42 of the Act to have them revoked in circumstances where (as here) the application is made ex parte.  
     
      
    11 However, the orders sought are in terms orders restraining ""any person"" from dealing with Mr Cleveland's interest in the specified property. As I have said, one of the parcels of real estate is mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Ms Lawrence, who appeared for the applicant (the DPP), said that in accordance with the DPP's usual practice, notice of the orders (if made) would be given to all parties, including the bank.  
     
      
    12 The difficulty is that an order in the terms sought, in respect of a particular property that is mortgaged, would prevent the bank from exercising its rights as mortgagee, should it feel the need to do so. The bank would be required to move the Court for leave to take such action as it might be empowered to take under the terms of the mortgage. In circumstances where there is not the slightest basis for thinking that the bank's mortgage, or its interest as mortgagee, have anything to do with the conspiracy, I have great difficulty in seeing why the bank should be put in that position. I do not think that it is a sufficient answer to say that the bank will be notified and can take its own course thereafter: at least in circumstances where, as I have said, there is no reason for thinking that the bank is in any way whatsoever connected with the events that give rise to this application.  
     
      
    13 Accordingly, I think, pursuant to s 18 (1) (b) of the Act, the relief in respect of the property that is mortgaged should be moulded to give effect to the bank's rights. 
     
      
    14 The other question relates to the ancillary orders that are sought. They are orders that various people, including Mr Cleveland, be examined about certain matters. The people who are sought to be examined include Mr Cleveland's partner, his stepfather (who is a co-accused as I have said), his mother and, someone who I think is a real estate agent. None of those persons, apart from Mr Cleveland, are parties to the proceedings.  
     
      
    15 There is no doubt that the Act empowers examination orders of the kind sought: see s 180. However, as is apparent from the terms of s 180, the examination is in effect in aid of, or ancillary to, the restraining order. That follows from the fact that an examination order can only be made if a restraining order is in force, and that an examination order ceases to have effect if the restraining order to which it relates ceases to have effect. See, respectively, sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 180.  
     
      
    16 Given that the application for the restraining orders is made ex parte, and given, as I have said, that Mr Cleveland has the right to apply for revocation of those orders, it is my view that ancillary orders should not be made, including orders for examination under s 180, at least until the time within which Mr Cleveland may apply to revoke the restraining orders has expired.  
     
      
    17 For those reasons, I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. An order in accordance with paragraph 1, as amended, of the short minutes of order initialled by me and dated today's date.  
       
       
      2. An order pursuant to the Act that the specified property (within the meaning of ""property"" as defined in s 338 of the Act) of the defendant described in sub-paragraph (c) of the first Schedule is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person other than the Commonwealth Bank of Australia acting as mortgagee pursuant to mortgage registered AE625874.  
       
       
      3. An order in accordance with paragraph 8 of those short minutes of order.  
       
       
      4. A direction that these orders be entered forthwith.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Disorderly house—Common betting house—Place for
betting—Betting booth—Race-course of incorporated association—Crim. Code, 1892,
ss. 197, 204—Crim. Code, 1906, ss. 227, 235.

A perambulating booth used on the race-course of an
incorporated racing association for the purpose of making bets is an “office”
or “place” used for betting between persons resorting thereto as defined in
sec. 197  of the Criminal Code , 1892 (Crim. Code, 1906, sec. 227 ).

Sub-sec. 2 of sec. 204 of the former Code (now sec. 235) which
exempts from the provisions of the main section (dealing with the recording or
registering of bets, etc.), bets made on the race-course of an incorporated
association does not apply to the offence of keeping a common betting-house.
Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 615) affirmed,
Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
affirming the conviction of the appellant by the police magistrate of Toronto
for keeping a common betting house.

The appellants were operating as bookmakers at the annual spring
meeting of the Ontario Jockey Club, an incorporated association. In a building
near the public stand they had a number of booths on castors which they moved
about the building or in fine

[Page 383]

weather on the lawn in front for the purpose of making bets with
persons attending the races. Having been convicted of the offence of keeping a
common betting house the magistrate at their request, stated a case for the
opinion of the Court of Appeal which contained the following:

“1. That the Ontario Jockey Club is a duly incorporated race
association.

“2. That the common betting house herein referred to was opened,
kept and used by the defendants during the actual progress of a race meeting.

“3. That the defendants kept a betting booth placed in that part
of the grounds of the Ontario Jockey Club specially set apart for betting
purposes.

“4. That such betting booth was opened, kept and used by the
defendants for the purpose of betting with persons resorting thereto.

“5. That all the defendants were engaged in conducting the
business of the said betting booth, which was leased by the defendant Saunders
and under his immediate superintendence.

“6. That a very large number of bets were made by the defendants
against certain horses winning the different races, with persons resorting to
said booth.

“7. That in the enclosure specially set apart by the Ontario
Jockey Club for betting purposes as aforesaid there are 36 betting booths,
including the one above mentioned, known as two dollar books, which were leased
to persons called bookmakers for the purpose of betting as aforesaid.

“8. That the defendants conducted and managed a betting booth as
aforesaid during the whole of the race meeting, and the defendant Saunders paid
there-

[Page 384]

for and for the betting privilege the sum of $100 for each day.

“9. That the betting booths in question are of the following
dimensions, six feet two inches in length, five feet two inches in width, and
four feet seven and one-half inches high, and are equipped for the purpose of
carrying on betting therein, and are supplied with castors so that in fine weather
they may be moved from under the covered part of the betting section of the
grounds to a distance of a few feet from the roof.

“10. The defendants’ position was changed daily from booth to
booth, there being a daily drawing for position among the bookmakers, but
during each day these defendants occupied the same booth, where they made bets
with persons resorting thereto.

“The questions submitted are:

“(a). Am I right in holding that a betting booth as
aforesaid falls within the terms of section 197  of the Criminal Code  as a
house, office or other place?

“(b). Am I right in holding that the provisions of
sub-section (2) of section 204  of the Criminal Code  do not apply to the offence
of which the defendants are found guilty?”

The Court of Appeal having affirmed the conviction the defendants
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

C.H. Ritchie K.C. and Godfrey for the appellants,
contended that a wooden booth such as was used in this case was not an “office”
or “place” for making and recording bets, under section 197  of the Criminal
Code , 1892 (now sec. 227 ); and if it was it was within the exception of section
204  (now 235), being on the

[Page 385]

course of an incorporated association citing Tremeear, Cr. Code,
pp. 146, 152; Stratford Turf Association v. Fitch[2].

Cartwright K.C., Deputy Attorney-General, for the
respondent, referred to Powell v. Kempton Park Racecourse Co.[3]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This case comes before us by way of appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which confirmed a conviction
by the police magistrate for the City of Toronto on a case reserved for the
opinion of that court.

A statement of the facts will be found in 12 Ontario Law Reports,
page 615.

The offence with which the defendants were charged before the
police magistrate was, as stated in the reserved case, that of keeping a
disorderly house, to wit, a common betting house. Section 197  of the Criminal
Code  defines a common betting house as

a house, office, or other place opened, kept or used
for the purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto and the owner,
occupier or keeper thereof.

Section 198 enacts that every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year’s imprisonment who keeps a common betting house
as hereinbefore defined.

It has been found as a fact by the police magistrate, admitted by
all the judges below and not seriously denied by counsel for defendants at the
argument here, that the betting booth used by the defend-

[Page 386]

ants must be held upon the authorities Powell v. Kempton Park
Racecourse Co.[4], and Brown
v. Patch[5],
to be a place within the meaning of section 197 . The defendants were
convicted by the police magistrate on the ground that to use such a betting
booth as was described by the witnesses for the purpose of betting between
persons resorting thereto, and the owner, occupier or keeper thereof, is an
indictable offence under sections 197  and 198  of the Criminal Code . On a
reserved case the conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
Meredith J. and Garrow J. dissenting. It was not denied that the defendants
used the booths in question for the purpose of betting with all comers, but it
was put forward as a defence to the charge that the booths or moveable stands
having been erected on the premises of an incorporated racing association to be
used for the purpose of making bets during the actual progress of a race
meeting brought the defendants within the proviso of section 204 .

Section 204  declares every one guilty of an indictable offence,
who:

(a) Uses or knowingly allows any part of any premises
under his control to be used for the purpose of recording or registering any
bet or wager or selling any pool; or

(b) Keeps, exhibits or employs in any part of any
premises under his control any device or apparatus for the purpose of
recording any bet or wager, etc.; or

(c) Becomes the custodian or depositor of any money *
* * wagered; or

(d) Records or registers any bet or wager.

By sub-section 2 of section 204 , it is expressly declared that
the provisions of the section shall not extend to bets between individuals or
to bets made on

[Page 387]

the race-course of an incorporated association during the
actual progress of a race meeting. These words were added as an amendment
when the Criminal Code  was enacted in 1892.

Bets between individuals are not illegal at common law and the
provisions of this section do not extend to bets between individuals or to bets
made on the race course of an incorporated association during the course of a
race meeting. I quite agree that the amendment of 1892 was intended to reserve
the race courses of incorporated associations as places where bets might be
recorded and registered, and any apparatus or structures used for the more
conveniently recording such bets or wagers provided this was done during the
actual progress of a race meeting, were exempted from the operation of that
section.

But to use a place for the purpose of recording or registering
bets or wagers is something entirely different from using a place for the
purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto and the owner or occupier
thereof.

Bets between individuals or bets made on the race course of an
incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting can be
recorded in any place used for that purpose, but to keep a place whether within
or without the grounds of a racing association for the purpose of betting
whether during the progress of a race meeting or not, is an offence under
section 197 .

In my opinion two distinct and separate statutory offences are
created by sections 197  and 204 , and that which may be invoked successfully as
a defence in one case cannot avail in the other. To keep a place for making
bets which may be recorded at that place or

[Page 388]

elsewhere and to keep a place for recording bets wherever made
are distinct and separate acts, each of which has been made an offence and each
of which is declared to subject the offenders to a different penalty. The
exception created by sub-section 2 of section 204  with respect to anything
therein, does not apply to those places that are kept for the purpose of
betting. I do not understand the rule of construction to be that all the
sections of the Code dealing with nuisances are to be read together to see how
they can be made to harmonize any more than the sections dealing with offences
against the person or against property. Distinct and separate acts are by these
sections declared to be common nuisances and the only question to be considered
is: Do the facts proved in evidence support the charge as laid in each
particular case?

No useful purpose can be served by going over the ground already
covered by the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal. I quite agree
with him that the intention of Parliament, which can only be gathered from the
language it has used, was to exempt from the operation of section 204  betting
on race courses controlled by incorporated associations during the actual
progress of a race, but not to sanction the existence of betting houses on such
race courses at such times and under such circumstances. Section 197  makes no
exception; at all times and under all circumstances betting houses are
prohibited and it is not for this court to introduce into this clause
qualifying expressions which the legislature has not chosen to put there.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.

GIROUARD J. (dissenting).—I concur in the reasons given by Mr.
Justice Davies for his dissent.

[Page 389]

DAVIES J.—While I concur with the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in their answer to the first question of the case submitted, that a betting
booth such as that described in the case falls within the terms of section 197 
of the Criminal Code  as “a house, office, room or other place,” I am not able
to concur with the majority of that court in holding that the provisions of
sub-section 2 of section 204  do not apply to the offences of which the
defendants were found guilty so as under the circumstances and conditions to
exempt them from liability to conviction.

Mr. Justice Osler concurred with the majority on this point
considering himself bound by previous decisions of the same court, but without,
as he himself says, being called upon to consider whether these decisions were
sound or not. Apart from him the court was equally divided.

I concur in the conclusions reached by Garrow and Meredith JJ.
that the conviction should be quashed on the ground that the provisions of
sub-section 2 of section 204  must be read as applying to the offence of which
the defendants were convicted.

I agree with Garrow J. when he says:

The proper construction in a word is in my opinion to hold
that sections 197 -198  have no application to the case of betting carried on
upon the race-course of an incorporated association during the actual progress
of a race meeting whether or not such betting takes place within or without
doors or in any particular “house, office, room or other place,” so long as it
is within the boundaries of the race course and so long as the betting is
confined to the races then in progress upon that race course.

The history of the two sections 197  and 198  and of section 204  of
the Criminal Code , so far as it seems desirable to know it for the purposes of
this argument, is that section 204  formed a part of the criminal

[Page 390]

law for years before 1892 when the Code was enacted but without
the latter words of the exempting subsection on which this controversy turns,
namely, betting when “made on the race course of an incorporated association
during the actual progress of a race meeting.” These words were added to section
204  at the time the Code was enacted and sections 197  and 198  were also then
for the first time introduced into our criminal law.

These two new sections 197  and 198  define a common betting house
and declare it to be illegal and a disorderly house.

It is a defined place

opened, kept or used for the purpose of betting between
persons resorting thereto and the owner, occupier or keeper, or opened, kept or
used for the purpose of any money being received or on behalf of any such
person as and for the consideration of any bet on any race, etc.

The object and purpose of Parliament in enacting the several
sections of the Criminal Code  under review was no doubt the suppression of
betting and poolselling between professional bookmakers and poolsellers and
their patrons. To that end sections 197  and 198  defining and penalizing the
keeping of a common betting house for the purpose of betting or for
the purpose of receiving any money by the keeper of such house for or in
connection with any bet were no doubt introduced into the Code when it was
passed in 1892. To more effectually insure the carrying out of the same objects
section 204 of the then criminal law was retained penalizing the using of any
part of any premises under his control by any one for the purpose of recording
any bet or wager or for the purpose of becoming the custodian or depositary of
any money staked or wagered upon the result of any election, race

[Page 391]

or trial of skill or endurance, but it was so retained with an
additional and important exemption added. That exemption included three
specific kinds of betting even when done by the class of persons struck at in
the penalizing parts of the section. First, betting when the bet or stake was
payable to the winner of any race or game, or to the owner of any
horse engaged in a lawful race, and not to the bookmaker or poolseller;
secondly, betting between individuals. These still remained perfectly lawful.
So long as the person struck at (the poolseller or bookmaker using a defined
place to carry on his calling) was not a party to the bet or a possible
beneficiary of the bet, so long as the practices by or through which such
person carried on his calling which Parliament aimed to suppress were not
involved, neither the bet or anything incidental to it was prohibited; and,
thirdly, introduced for the first time as an exemption, betting

made on the race course of an incorporated association
during the actual operation of a race meeting.

This latter exemption covered bookmakers as well as other
individuals and left betting with bookmakers and poolsellers using premises
under their control to record bets and to receive stakes, legal, when carried
on within the limitations specified in the exempting words.

But if the substantive act of using part of any premises to
receive deposits or stakes of a bet as well as to record such bet or any number
of such single bets were thus permitted when done at the special places, times
and on the races specified in the exemption, how can it be contended
successfully that any other necessary or ordinary incident or act in the
carrying on of

[Page 392]

the main substantive thing permitted such as holding himself out
at a particular place for the purpose of doing the act, continued to be an
offence?

It must be conceded that the using of a part of the race premises
such as a betting booth or house for the purpose of recording bets and there
receiving stakes and deposits or the money representing the bets upon the
result of any race when the betting and recording and money received were all
done and happened on the race course of an incorporated association during the
actual progress of a race meeting and with reference alone to one of the races
at that meeting was permitted by sub-section 2 of section 204 . Now what are
these limited acts as to time, place and event so permitted and not prohibited
but the keeping of a common betting house, on the race-course but exclusively
for the races being run there.

I think for the purpose of construing the exemption clause the
three sections must be read together, and that so far as that exemption clause
extends to sanction or allow any act which otherwise would be illegal it must
be read as covering that act even if the act is made an offence by both
sections.

In my opinion the special privilege or permission conceded by the
sub-section to carry on betting in a special place at a special time and with
reference to special races, necessarily permitted all acts ordinarily essential
to the carrying out of the substantial purpose.

If the amendment made to the exempting sub-section
contemporaneously with the introduction of the new sections 197  and 198 
penalizing the common betting house did not operate to exempt betting made and
recorded at such house or place when confined within

[Page 393]

the limitations expressed in the amendment then it appears to me
to be quite meaningless because all betting made between individuals had
already been exempted as also all bets which were payable to the owner of the
horse racing. The only effect of the amendment could be to extend the sanction
of the clause to betting at the common betting house made between the keeper of
the house and outside parties when erected on the race grounds and which
betting was confined within the special limitations expressed in the amendment.

Keeping a house or place for the purpose of betting between
persons who resort thither to bet with the keeper of such house or place is an
indictable offence within section 197 of the Code, but it is not such an
offence when it is kept on the grounds of an incorporated race association and
the sole and exclusive purpose for which it is kept is for the special classes
of betting defined and limited by the sub-section of 204.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and answer the first
question of the case submitted in the affirmative and the second in the
negative.

IDINGTON, MACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. agreed with the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL PROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal law—Practice—Crown case
reserved—Reserved questions— Dissent from affirmance of
conviction—Appeal—Jurisdiction— Criminal
Code , 1892, ss. 742 , 743 , 744 , 750 —R.S.O. (1906), c. 146, ss. 1013,1015, 1016,1024—Admission of
evidence—Res gestae.

Evidence of statements made by a person, since deceased,
immediately after an assault upon him, under apprehension of further danger and
requesting assistance and protection, is admissible as part of the res gestce,
even though the person accused of the offence was absent at the time when such
statements were made. Reg. v. Beddingfield (14 Cox 341); Rex v. Foster (6 C.
& P. 325) and Aveson v. Kinnaird (6 East 188) followed.

Statements not coincident, in point of time, with the
occurrence of the assault, but uttered in the presence and hearing of the
accused and under such circumstances that he might reasonably have been
expected to have made some explanatory reply to remarks in reference to them, are
admissible as evidence.

On the trial of an indictment for murder the evidence was that
the deceased had been killed by a gun shot wound inflicted through the
discharge of a gun in the hands of the accused and the defence was that the gun
had been discharged accidentally.

Held, that, in view of the character of the defence and
the evidence in support of it, there could be no objection to a charge by the
trial judge to the jury that the offence could not be reduced by them from
murder to manslaughter but that their verdict should be either for acquittal or
one of guilty of murder.

Two questions were reserved by the trial judge for the opinion
of the court of appeal but he refused to reserve a third question, as to the
correctness of his charge on the ground that no objection to the charge had
been take at the trial. The court of appeal

[Page 285]

took all three questions into consideration and dismissed the
appeal, there being no dissent from the affirmance of the conviction on the
first and third questions, but one of the judges being of opinion that the
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered upon the second question
reserved. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,—

The majority of the court, being of opinion that the appeal
should be dismissed, declined to express any opinion as to whether or not an
appeal would lie upon questions as to which there had been no dissent in the
court appealed from, but it was held,—

Per Girouard J.—That
the Supreme Court of Canada was precluded from  expressing an opinion on points
of law as to which there had been no dissent in the court appealed from, McIntosh
v. The Queen (23 Can. S.C.R. 180) followed. Viau v. The Queen
(29 Can. S.C.R. 90) ; The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen (31
 Can. S.C.R. 81) and Rice v. The King (32 Can. S.C.R. 480)
referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of the North-West Territories, affirming the conviction of the appellant at the trial on an
indictment for murder, upon a reserved case stated by the judge who presided at
the trial.

The case reserved was stated by the trial judge,
Mr. Justice Newlands, as follows:—

""STATED CASE.""

""The above named Josiah Gilbert was charged
before me with the murder of one Barrett Henderson on or about the 15th day of
August, A.D. 1906, near Regina
in this judicial district. The accused pleaded not guilty and was tried before
me with a jury at Regina on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of November,
1906, and was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging at Regina on the 18th day of January, 1907.

""At the trial the annexed evidence was
admitted after being objected to by counsel for the accused.

[Page 286]

""After the verdict the counsel for the
accused applied to have the following questions reserved and I have, decided to
reserve the same under section 937  of the Criminal Code  for the opinion of the
court.

""1. Were: the statement; of the deceased
made while running towards Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them
admissible?

""2. Were the statements made by the
deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm
admissible?

""Said counsel for the accused also applied
to have the following question reserved:—

""3. Was the learned trial judge right in
stating to the jury in his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in
reducing the verdict from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted
only a verdict of murder or not guilty?

""In my charge to the jury I said, 'As far
as man-slaughter is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which
would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As
far as this case is concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before
you of provocation. As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has
been given in evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from
murder to manslaughter. The verdict as far as I can see can either be one of
not guilty, or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as
far as I can see, that are open before you.'

""No objection was taken to this charge at
the trial so I declined to reserve this question.""

""Regina, December 14th, 1906.""

""H. W. Newlands, J.S.C.""

[Page 287]

After hearing the
arguments of counsel, the court, in banc, affirmed the conviction, the opinion of the court being
unanimous as to the first and third questions. Mr. Justice Wetmore dissented
from the opinion of the majority of the court as to the
points of law involved in the second question.

His Lordship Chief
Justice Sifton and their Lord-ships Justices Newlands and Stuart concurred in
the following opinion
delivered by His Lordship Mr. Jus­tice Harvey.

Harvey J.—""The accused was charged with murder and tried by my brother Newlands with a jury and convicted,
and the matter now comes before this court by
way of a reserved case as to the admissibility of certain evidence which was given on the trial.

""Two men were
passing near the scene of the alleged murder about the
time it was supposed to have been committed
and their attention was drawn to the accused
whom they saw running with something in his hand, which they took to be
a gun and which the subsequent evidence shews was a gun. At almost the same moment they heard a shout and saw the deceased
apparently fleeing from the accused and waving
his hands and calling to them to stop. The gun was dropped, but the pursuit continued until the deceased reached
the witnesses, and on his way to them and when reaching them, he shouted more
than once, 'Hold on, hold on; he shot me and he will shoot me again. Hold on, boys, hold on.' The first question
which is reserved is whether the
evidence of these statements was
properly admitted, and I am of the opinion that this question should be
answered in the 20 1/2

[Page 288]

affirmative. Apart
altogether from whether the words were uttered in the
presence of the accused, it appears to my
mind clear that the circumstances, including
the utterance of the words used, were so closely connected with the
shooting as to be properly admissible for, although the witnesses in question
did not hear the sound of a shot, another witness did hear such sound and
almost immediately after saw the two men
running as they were when they first attracted the attention of the two witnesses
first mentioned.

""The strongest
case which could be referred to against the admissibility of this evidence was Reg. v. Bedingfield ([1]), in which Chief
Justice Cockburn refused
to receive the evidence of a statement made by the
deceased to a person whom she met after coming out of the house where the
accused was and where the murder was alleged
to have been committed. It is easy to see a difference in principle
between the two cases. In the present case
there was a continuity of circumstances of which the shooting was part and in
which the accused was a participant, which did not exist in the Bedingfield Case ([2]).
So that for the purpose of this case it is not necessary to dissent from Chief
Justice Cockburn's view though some of the text writers, Taylor, par. 583; Phipson, p. 49, express
the view that he interpreted the rule too
strictly.

""In Rex v. Foster ([3]) the court, consisting of three judges,
held as admissible a statement made by the deceased in answer to a question by
a witness who did not see the act which was
the cause of the death but came up
after. This case appears to have been accepted as authoritative, and the principle is given by Taylor, par. 583, as follows: ""The
principal points








[Page 289]

for consideration are, whether the circumstances
and declarations offered in proof were so connected with the main fact under consideration as to illustrate
its character, to further its object
or to form in conjunction with it one
continuous transaction.""

""It appears to
me beyond question that the present case falls within this principle and the authority of Rex v. Foster ([4]).

""The second question reserved is as to the
admissibility of evidence of an expression of
the deceased at a later time and in
no way connected with the res gestce. An exchange of
conveyances was being made by the deceased
and the accused, and the witness states
that while the deceased was being helped by him across, he turned around and saw the accused who was about
five or six feet behind, whereupon 'he made a
big jump into the buggy and said, 'Don't let him knife me.""

""This utterance appears to me to be nothing
more than an unequivocal exclamation indicating fear of injury from the accused on the part of the deceased. The principle
on which an exception to the rule that hearsay
evidence is inadmissible is made in the case of statements made in the
hearing of an accused, or in a civil case in
the hearing of an opposite party, is that
he has an opportunity of denying it, and if he fails to do so, it is
some evidence as against him of the truth of
the statement. When one considers that the utterance in question is not a
statement of fact at all and is not
susceptible of denial by the accused, it is at once evident that the principle has no application and at the same
time the principle of exclusion as hearsay has no application. The question
appears to








[Page 290]

me to be one then simply of
whether the state of mind of the accused in
this respect is material, and if it is, there is no rule as far as I am aware that requires the exclusion of this remark. It seems to me that
the evidence of the witness when he said that when de-ceased saw accused near him 'he made a big jump
into the buggy' stands in exactly the same position as the evidence of
what deceased said, for each indicates the
same thing, viz., fear of accused, and nothing more except that the
spoken words are less equivocal than the act.

""The charge is one of
deliberately shooting the deceased while the
defence is that the shooting was purely accidental. If it were shewn that after
the shooting the state of mind of the
man shot were one of friendliness to
the accused, it surely would be deemed
to have an important bearing on the question in issue, and in the same way evidence indicating aversion and fear have
as important a bearing in the opposite
direction. Wigmore, in his work on Evidence,
points out very fully the difference between the admission of utterances as proof of the truth of the facts stated and
their admission to prove a state of mind
which he terms their circumstantial use as opposed to the other or testimonial use, and states, in par. 1790, that to the use circumstantially the
hearsay rule makes no opposition 'because the utterance is not used for the sake of inducing belief in any
assertion it may contain.'

""For
the reason stated I am of opinion that this evidence was properly admitted.

""A third question,
though not reserved, was argued by counsel,
viz., that the learned judge erred in charging the jury that there was
no evidence to justify them in finding a verdict
of manslaughter.

[Page 291]

""No
one gave evidence of the actual shooting except the accused himself, and his
evidence and evidence of admissions made by him before the trial was the only evidence of the
actual occurrence. These all concurred in maintaining that the shooting was
purely accidental.
If the jury had believed this evidence, the only verdict they could have found would have been one of acquittal; but if they did not believe it,
the only conclusion from the
evidence was that the shooting having been established the intention to
effect the natural consequence of the act
existed and that the act was one of
murder. It is quite easy to see that a hypothesis
could be advanced that the actual facts made the case one of
manslaughter, but that the accused, being
the only eye witness of the shooting, determined
to concoct a story which would enable him
to escape the consequence of even that act; but this would be simply a
hypothesis, and the jury were bound to bring
in a verdict on the evidence and not on
hypothesis. I am of opinion that the judge's charge was right in this respect.

""In
the result therefore the learned trial judge's rulings on the two questions reserved and on the other
question which was argued should be confirmed and the conviction should be affirmed.""

The
opinion of Mr. Justice Wetmore was delivered, as follows:—

Wetmore J.—""I agree with my brother Harvey that the evidence of the statements made by the
deceased Henderson to the witnesses Koch and
Dick while coming towards them and after he arrived there was properly admitted as being part of the res
gestce. I also agree that there was no misdirection in the case. 

[Page 292]

But I am
of opinion that the statement made by the deceased and testified to by McKinnon,
namely, 'Don't
let him knife me,' was improperly received in evidence. This statement was offered
in evidence as
a statement made in the presence and hearing of the accused and only upon that ground.
It was not pretended that it was
admissible on any other ground. Evidence of this character is admissible
because the jury or judge of fact is able to
draw an inference from the conduct,
the language, or the silence of the other
party in whose presence and hearing the statement is made. Evidently, if the statement was not heard by such party, no inference could be drawn from his conduct, language or silence. In this
case I may say that any reference that
might be drawn was to be drawn from
the silence of the accused. In order
to render such testimony admissible I think that the judge ought to be thoroughly satisfied that the party accused
heard the statement. I will concede
that, ordinarily, if it is established that the statement was made in the presence of the accused and that he was at such a distance at the time that
the statement would likely be heard
by him, this would be sufficient to
admit the evidence of the statement. But if the circumstances are of such a
character that render it possible that the statement might not have been heard by him or render it doubtful whether it
was heard by him, evidence of the
statement ought not to be received.
In this case the witnesses Koch and
Dick were not very far distant from where the deceased and the accused were at the time the statement was made, and I think they would have been likely to hear it. Now, if they did not hear it, I think it is open to doubt whether the accused heard
it. I am not prepared, however, to
state that I would

[Page 293]

hold that the evidence of this statement was
improperly received if there was nothing further in the case than what I have stated. But it was developed at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings that the accused was hard of hearing, and he distinctly swore that
he did not hear the statement made by the deceased and testified to by
McKinnon. This state of facts having come
out, in my opinion rendered the testimony of McKinnon as to the statement inadmissible, or in other words
improperly received. It is urged that inasmuch as the testimony when received
was admissible, it is not rendered inadmissible by testimony subsequently
given. I dissent from that proposition. If
testimony of this character is
received under a mistaken apprehension of facts it must be considered none the
less inadmissible if future
developments of facts shew that it ought not to have been admitted. In a case of that sort I am of opinion that either the jury should be
discharged from giving a verdict or
the objectionable testimony expressly withdrawn from their consideration by the
trial judge. I am inclined to think
that the latter course would have
been quite sufficient for the purpose.
It was further urged that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the admission of this testimony. I cannot accede to this
proposition either. It is very
difficult to state what will or will not
influence the mind of a juryman. The remark 'Don't let him knife me' had
no direct reference to the shooting; it must
be remembered that when the remark was made the accused had no gun with
him and a remark such as 'Don't let him shoot me' would not be pertinent as he had no means of shooting. The
words, Don't let him knife me' might
be pertinent however, and it was a
remark from which a juryman might

[Page 294]

infer
'Don't let this man who shot me, as I told you, knife me.' Nor can I bring my mind to the conclusion that this was a mere exclamation of fear alone.
Doubtless it was an exclamation of fear, but it was an exclamation which
not only expressed fear but expressed fear of
the accused. I am of opinion, for the
reasons above stated, that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.""

Chrysler K.C. and James Balfour for the appellant. The statutory provisions affecting the case are to
be found in the ""Criminal Code ,
1892,"" sections 742 , 743 , 744 
and 750 , and in the new Code as consolidated in the Revised Statutes of 1906, sections 1013, 1015. 1016 and
1024.

The court of appeal, the
Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, was not unanimous in affirming the conviction,
Mr. Justice Wetmore being in favour of allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial; therefore, we
comply with the condition of section 742 of the old Code. We come to this court upon a judgment as entered
there and we appeal against the affirmance of the conviction by a judgment which was not
unanimous; it is of no consequence what might have been the individual reasons
of any of the judges for their opinions which led to that judgment.

We
refer to the Queen v. Cunningham ([5]), which is referred to in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([6]),
by Taschereau
J., at page 185. The question has been since discussed in the case of Viau v.
The Queen ([7]), in the








[Page 295]

judgment of the
court by Taschereau J. In the present case the third
question, although not reserved, was argued
and decided in the court below which treated the point of procedure as
having been waived. See also Rice v. The King ([8]), per Strong C. J.

We rely upon Reg.
v. Bedingfield ([9]),
on which Lord Cockburn subsequently wrote a pamphlet
which will be found in the Law Journal for
1880, at page 5. See also Best on
Evidence ([10]).
Archbold in his work on Criminal Evidence, concludes that Reg. v.
Bedingfield ([11]), was
affirmed by the decision in Goddard's Case ([12]).

Latchford K.C. for
the respondent.

Chief Justice:—The
appellant in this case was tried at Regina, Province of Alberta, in the month of November, 1906,
and found guilty of the murder of one
Barrett Henderson; thereupon he was sentenced
to death.

The learned judge
before whom the case was tried, at the request of
counsel for the prisoner to reserve some
questions as to the admissibility of evidence,








 

[Page 296]

stated a special
case for the opinion of the court of appeal. The questions reserved for the opinion of the court were:

Were the statements of the deceased made while running towards
Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them admissible?

Were the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on
arriving at the house on deceased's farm admissible?

The counsel for the
accused also applied to have the following question reserved:

Was the learned trial judge right in stating to the jury in
his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in reducing the verdict
from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted only a verdict of
murder or not guilty?

The judge in the case,
as reserved, says:

In my charge to the jury I said: ""As far as manslaughter
is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which would other-wise be
murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so
in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As far as this case is
concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before you of provocation.
As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has been given in
evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from murder to
manslaughter. The verdict, as far as I can see, can either be one of not guilty
or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as far as I can
see, that are open before you.

No objection was taken to this charge at the trial so I
declined to reserve this question.

The court of appeal, Wetmore J. dissenting, held
that the statements made by the deceased to
McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm were admissible. The court was unanimously of opinion that the statements made by deceased while running towards
Dick and Koch and after joining them were properly
admitted and also that there had been no misdirection.

A question was raised here as to whether an
appeal

[Page 297]

lies to this court on the question reserved as
to which there was no dissent in the court of appeal, but as we all agree that the appeal should be dismissed we
do not think it necessary to express
any opinion on that point of practice
nor as to whether or not the question
of misdirection was ever properly before the court below. Section 1016 , Criminal Code ; McIntosh v. The Queen ([19]).

The first
statement of the deceased was made immediately after the assault. The only evidence as to the actual shooting was given by the accused, but a witness, Vine
Brooks, heard the sound of a shot and immediately afterwards saw two men whom
she describes as running away from the barn one apparently pursuing the other. Koch and Dick to whom the statement
admitted in evidence was made were passing on
the highway not far from the barn in which the fatal shot was fired.
When first seen by the witnesses the
accused was running through the field with something in his hand, which subsequent evidence shews was a gun,
and, almost immediately, their attention was drawn to the deceased who was
running from the accused towards them shouting, as they afterwards ascertained, for protection. The pursuit continued,
although the gun was dropped by the accused, until the deceased reached the
witnesses when he shouted to them several times as he approached—

Hold on, hold on, he shot me and he will do it again; hold on
boys, hold on.

When Koch and Dick were
examined their evidence as to what occurred under these circumstances when the
deceased approached them and immediately there-








[Page 298]

after when with
them in the vehicle was objected to. The trial judge held it to be admissible
and his ruling was
sustained by the unanimous judgment of the court of appeal, and, as was intimated at the close
of the argument here, we
entertain no doubt that the evidence
was properly admitted.

At the trial, in the
court of appeal and at the argument here, counsel for the accused relied in
support of their
objection on the case of Reg. v. Bedingfield ([20]), wherein the
admissibility of this kind of evidence was discussed and Cockburn, C.J. excluded all testimony
of declarations after the
act was done. This ruling was
much criticized at the time and led to a vigorous discussion of the whole subject by Judge Pitt
Taylor, in England, and
Professor Thayer, in the United States, in the course of which the chief justice issued a pamphlet in defence of his ruling
wherein he defines the
term res gestce:

Whatever act, or series of acts, constitute, or in point of
time immediately accompany and terminate in, the principal act charged as an
offence against the accused, from its inception to its consummation or final
completion, or its prevention or abandonment,— whether on the part of the agent
or wrong-doer in order to its performance, or on that of the patient or party
wronged, in order to its prevention,—and whatever may be said by either of
the parties, during the continuance of the transaction, with reference to it,
including herein what may be said by the suffering party, though in the absence
of the accused, during the continuance of the action of the latter, actual or
constructive,-as e.g., in the case of flight or applications for assistance—
form part of the principal transaction, and may be given in evidence as part of
the res gestce, or particulars of it.

There can be no doubt that under this definition
the statement of the deceased to Koch and Dick would be admissible as








 [Page 299]

having been used under the apprehension of
further danger and when asking for assistance and protection even if the accused
was absent.

It will be observed further that in the Bedingfield
Case ([21])
when the woman Eliza Rudd came out
of the house with her throat cut all
action on Bedingfield's part had ceased and she was not fleeing as in the present case from her assailant.

In Rex v. Foster
([22]),
the court, consisting of three judges, held as admissible a statement made by deceased in answer to a question by a
witness who did not see
the act which was the cause of the death but came up after.

The case of Aveson v. Lord Kinnaird ([23]) bears strongly upon the point, Park J. and Patterson J. concurring. In that
case Lord Ellenborough said

if at the time she fled from the immediate personal violence
of the husband I should admit what was said.

The admissibility of the second statement to McKinnon is not so clear. It was made under these circumstances: After the deceased running up to Koch
and Dick in the road where they were joined by
Gilbert had given his first explanation of the shooting and asked for
their protection; the parties then present
separated, Koch and Gilbert going to the latter's barn to get his team while Dick and the deceased
went over to the shack in which Henderson lived with his hired man McKinnon who, on their arrival, very naturally asked for an explanation of the
occurrence which has not been given
in evidence. Subsequently, however,
Gilbert appeared on the scene with Koch; then ensues a conversation with McKinnon during the








[Page 300]

course of which
Gilbert attempted to explain that the shooting was due to an accident. The deceased who was being placed in a buggy, to be
conveyed to the hospital at
Regina for medical treatment, perceiving the accused who stood about six feet away
from him made a jump
exclaiming, ""Don't let him knife me.""

It has been argued
that this statement of the deceased is not admissible
as part of the res gestce not being
coincident in point of time with the main facts to be proved. However that may be we are all of opinion that the words spoken on this occasion are
admissible on the ground that they
were uttered in the presence and
hearing of the accused, and under such
circumstances, in the light of what he had previously stated to
McKinnon, that he might have been reasonably
expected to make some answer or remark in
reply thereto or explaining that his proximity to deceased did not involve any such danger as he seemed to feel.

The presumption,
even taking the previous statement of counsel as to the
condition of accused's hearing as a fact,
would be that he might reasonably be presumed
to have heard. And the learned and careful
trial judge has in the exercise of a discretion vested in him decided the preliminary fact and allowed the
evidence on the ground that the necessary conditions
had been fulfilled.

The later statement
of accused when giving evidence
denying having heard the statement, could not have any effect on the previous ruling or become a test of its correctness.

The charge in view
of the character of the defence and evidence in support of it cannot be complained of in so far as we can express an
opinion in the ab-

[Page 301]

sence of the text of
the charge which is not before us.

There was no case
of culpable homicide of less degree than murder presented on the evidence. And the accident testified to by the accused would
have, if credited,
entitled him to acquittal.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Girouard J.—Following
the decisions of this court in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([24]); Viau
v. The Queen ([25]) ; The Union Colliery Co. v. The Queen ([26]); Rice v. The
King ([27]), I
feel that I have no jurisdiction to express any opinion upon the points of law involved in questions one and three. It was decided in those cases
that no appeal lies to this court on
questions as to which there was no
dissent in the court of appeal. For
that reason I agree that the appeal must be dismissed as to those two points.

As to the second question, I concur in the
reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. I
wish to add merely a word. The trial
judge was undoubtedly the sole judge
as to the admissibility of the statement or exclamation to McKinnon. He could not suppose that the prisoner, when standing within four or
five feet, did not hear it. When,
subsequently, the prisoner, being
examined, disclosed the fact that he did not hear the deceased, the counsel for the prisoner does not appear to have requested the trial judge
to leave the veracity of this statement to the jury. Perhaps he did, and it may be that the judge left the
question to the jury. We have no means
of knowing. At all events, the point is not reserved, and is not even








[Page 302]

mentioned by the learned judge. I, therefore,
believe that, as to this second question also, the appeal should be dismissed.

Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal law—Crown case
reserved—Appeal—Extension of time for notice
of appeal—""Criminal Code "" s. 1024 —Order after expiration of time for service of notice—Jurisdiction.

The power given by section 1024 of the ""Criminal
Code "" (R.S.C. (1906) ch. 146) to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to extend the time for service on the Attorney-General of notice of
an appeal in a reserved Crown case may be exercised after the expiration of the time limited by the code for the
service of such notice. Banner v.
Johnston (L.R. 5 H.L. 157) and Vaughan v. Richardson (17
Can. S.C.R. 703) followed.

APPLICATION, on behalf of the prisoner, for
an order extending the time for the service of a notice of appeal from the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories,
affirming the conviction of the prisoner, Wetmore J. dissenting.

The prisoner was convicted, on 16th November, on
the charge of murdering one Barrett Henderson, and sentenced to be hanged on
the 18th of January, 1907. Pursuant to the provisions of section 743of
""The Criminal Code , 1892,"" the case was reserved for the opinion of
the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, and was heard on the questions reserved in the
said court on the 9th of January, 1907, at Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and judg-

[Page 208]

ment was reserved. Subsequently, on the 15th of
January, 1907, judgment was pronounced on the re served case affirming the
decision of Newlands J., at the trial, in respect to the matters objected to,
by the majority of the said court in banc, Wetmore J. dissenting.

An application was then made to the Minister of
Justice, at Ottawa, for a new trial under the provisions of section 748 of the
""Criminal Code , 1892,"" and, owing to the time occupied in
correspondence, travel ling from Regina to Ottawa, and obtaining a reply from
the Minister, more than fifteen days elapsed after the date of such affirmance
of the conviction, and, in the meantime, no notice of appeal therefrom had been
served upon the Attorney-General as required by the provisions of section 1024
of the ""Criminal Code ,"" R.S.C. (1906) ch. .146. In
consequence of the expiration of the time so limited, the application was made, in Chambers, for an order to extend
the time for the service of the necessary notice.

Bethune and Balfour appeared in support
of the application.

DAVIES J.—An application was made to
me, at Chambers, today on behalf of the prisoner for an order under the 750th
section of the ""Criminal Code  of 1892,"" now section 1024 of the
""Criminal Code ,"" R.S.C. (1906), ch. 146, to extend the time for
service of notice of appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the
North-West Territories refusing a new trial.

As the court of appeal was not unanimous in af-

[Page 209]

firming the conviction of the prisoner he had a
right, on serving notice on the Attorney-General

within fifteen days after such affirmance
or such further time as may be allowed by the
Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

to appeal to the latter court against the
affirmance of such conviction.

For reasons set out in the affidavits and
exhibits produced before me, he did not give
the notice of appeal and now, after the expiration of the fifteen days, applies for an extension of the time.

The only question upon which I had any doubt was
as to my power to grant the extension after the expiration of the fifteen days.
A construction requiring the application to be made within the fifteen days
would, in a section such as this dealing with the criminal law and where
sometimes, as in the case before me, the prisoner's life is at stake, be a very
narrow one and might in many cases which can be conceived of in a country of
the extent of the Dominion of Canada, if adopted, defeat the object which
Parliament seems to have had in view. I, therefore, felt strongly inclined to
adopt the broader construction and to hold that the power of extension is
exercisable under the section even after the expiration of the prescribed
period.

There are two authorities which seem to be conclusive upon the point. One is that of Banner v.
Johnston ([1]), at
pages 170 and 172, and the other that of Vaughan v. Richardson ([2]).

Reference is also made to The North Ontario
Election Case; Wheeler v. Gibbs ([3]),
which was discussed

[Page 210]

by Sir William Ritchie C.J., in The Glengarry
Election Case ([4]), at
page 460.

I have had the advantage of consulting with the
Chief Justice and with Mr. Justice Girouard, who agree with me that in view of
these authorities, there can be no doubt of my power to make the order.

Ordered accordingly.

the applicant: James Balfour.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT, SITTING
IN REVIEW, AT MONTREAL.

Finding of jury—Questions of fact—Duty of
appellate court.

Where the question was one of fact, and the
jury, on evidence properly submitted to them, accepted the evidence on one side
and rejected that adduced upon the other, the Supreme Court of Canada refused
to disturb their findings.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior
Court, sitting in review at Montreal, which affirmed the judgment of His
Lordship, Mr. Justice Doherty, entered upon the findings of a special jury at
the trial, in favour of the plaintiff, for $11,067, with costs.

The plaintiff was injured in attempting to
alight from a passenger elevator in use in the appellants' hotel. He was a
guest of the hotel, at the time, and was using the elevator, in the usual
manner, to pass from one part of the hotel to another. At the trial, in answer
to questions submitted to them, the jury found, among other things, that the
accident was not due to any fault of the plaintiff that it was due to the fault
of the defendants, owing to the practice of not closing the door of the
elevator before putting it in

[Page 337]

motion, and they assessed the damages at
$11,067, for which the judge entered a verdict for the plaintiff with costs.

This judgment was affirmed by the judgment
appealed from.

Heneker K.C. and Maréchal K.C. for the appellants.

R. C. Smith K.C. and G. H. Montgomery for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I agree that this appeal should be dismissed
with costs. I adopt the reasons given in the court below.

Girouard J.—I think this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.

The question is not whether the verdict is the
best one that could have been arrived at, but whether it is one which twelve
reasonable men would have rendered.

It is admitted that the appellants were guilty
of negligence in moving their elevator before its door was closed. They say, it
is true, in answer, that Mr. Odell forced his way out when the elevator boy was
in the act of closing the door and moving the elevator down, and there is some
evidence to that effect. Mr. Odell swears positively the door was wide open
when he attempted to move out. The jury have believed him and I am not prepared
to say that their finding is unreasonable.

Davies J.—The question before us is not whether the verdict is, in our
opinion, a right or just one, under

[Page 338]

the evidence, but simply, whether it is one
which a jury could, under all the circumstances, fairly find. While, if acting
as a juryman, I might not have agreed with the conclusion reached by the
majority of the jury, I am not, sitting here in a court of appeal, able to say
that the verdict is one which reasonable men might not fairly, under the
evidence, have found. I agree, therefore, in dismissing the appeal.

Idington J.—I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Maclennan J.—I agree to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Duff J.—The principle which we have to apply here is, for the purposes of
this case, aptly put by the language of Lord FitzGerald, delivering the
judgment of the Judicial Committee, in The Commissioner for Railways v. Brown[1] at page 134;—

Where the question is one of fact and there
is evidence on both sides properly submitted to the jury, the verdict of the
jury, once found, ought to stand; and the setting aside of such a verdict
should be of rare and exceptional occurrence.

There is nothing rare or exceptional about this
case; it is the common case of a conflict of evidence which the jury, having the
witnesses before them, have resolved by accepting the story of one side and
rejecting that of the other.

We could not allow this appeal without
disregarding this rule and adopting a principle of decision

[Page 339]

which would open for examination, as res nova
in a court of appeal, every issue of fact tried and passed upon by a jury.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
NOVA,SCOTIA.

Jury trial—Judge’s charge—Practical withdrawal
of case—Evidence —New trial.

On trial of an action against a surety, the
defence was that he had been discharged by the plaintiff’s dealings with his
principal. The trial judge directed the jury that the facts proved in no way
operated to discharge him; and that while, if they could find any evidence to
satisfy them that he was relieved from liability they could find for defendant
he knew of no such evidence and it was not to be found in the case.

Held, that the
disputed facts were practically withdrawn from the jury, and as there was
evidence proper to be submitted and on which they might reasonably find for
defendant there should be a new trial.

Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the
verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.

The action was on a promissory note to which
defendant pleaded inter alia that he only signed it as surety for the
other maker, and was discharged by dealings with his principal. At the trial
the jury were directed by the judge that they were at liberty to find for the
defendant on this issue if there was any evidence, but that none was to be
found in the case and that the facts proved did not operate as a discharge. A
verdict was given for the plaintiff which the full court upheld, the Chief
Justice dissenting.

[Page 166]

Roscoe K.C. for
the appellant.

J. J. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Davies J.—Much as I regret reaching the conclusion that there must be a new
trial in this case I cannot help so finding.

The trial judge charged the jury explicitly: (1)
that the defendant, Wood, was a principal debtor and not a surety on the note
sued on; (2) that the facts proved in no way and no matter whom they believed
operated to discharge Wood and that, while if they could find any evidence to
satisfy them that Wood was relieved from liability they could find for
defendant, he knew of no such evidence and it was not to be found in the case.

By this charge he practically withdrew from the
jury all the disputed questions of fact.

I assume he must have held the view, afterwards
expressed by Graham J., in which Townshend J. concurred, that there was no evidence
in the case from which a jury could fairly find for the defendant.

The Chief Justice very emphatically dissented
from this view, while Russell J. admitted that he had held different views, but
finally determined to refuse a new trial.

At the argument before us it was conceded by Mr.
Ritchie that the defendant Wood must be considered as only a surety on the note
for one Porter, another maker, and that the questions open were whether he had
been discharged from his suretyship obligation by any action of the plaintiff,
Rockwell.

Mr. Roscoe contended there was ample evidence to

[Page 167]

go to the jury to shew that time had been given
to the principal debtor, Porter, by the acceptance from him of another note
signed by himself and one D. E. Ross, at five months, for the full amount of
the indebtedness.

Whether or not this note was so accepted
depended entirely upon whose version of the facts was to be believed. We had
the evidence, on one side, of plaintiff and his son supported, as it was
argued, by the inherent probabilities. On the other side was the evidence of
Porter and his wife and the defendant. If the evidence of these latter parties
was accepted by the jury in preference to that of the plaintiff’s witnesses, I
cannot say that a verdict for the defendant on the question of the acceptance
of the new note would be such as reasonable men, under all the circumstances,
could not fairly find. It might not be such a verdict as I would find myself
but that is another thing altogether.

The acceptance of the version of defendant’s
witnesses would relieve the defendant from any difficulty arising from the
terms of the letter of Porter enclosing the note. If the story told by Porter
and his wife is accepted as the true and correct one, then the offer which came
from the plaintiff to Porter, the principal debtor, to send him back his note
(which Rockwell admittedly had taken to Porter’s house and left with Porter’s
wife), signed by Porter and some third party, no names being mentioned, was
accepted when the note was returned into plaintiff’s hands with D. E. Boss’s
name on it, and plaintiff’s retention of it for four months without objection
was corroborative evidence of his acceptance. I think there is evidence in
these facts combined with Rockwell’s subsequent 

[Page 168]

assumption of dominion over the new note in his
conversation with the defendant Wood, which ought to have been submitted to the
jury on the point, and I, therefore, refrain from further discussion so that
neither party may be prejudiced on the new trial.

The appeal should be allowed with costs in this
court and in the court en banc and a new trial ordered; costs of the
first trial and new trial to abide the event.

Appeal allowed with costs, and new trial
ordered.

on appeal from
the supreme court of nova scotia.

Criminal law—Criminal Code , 1892, ss. 241 ,
242 —Wounding with intent— Verdict—Conviction—Grown case reserved.

On an indictment for wounding with intent a
verdict of ""guilty without malicious intent"" [is an acquittal. Judgment
appealed from (9 Can. Crim. Cas. 53) reversed, Davies and Idington JJ.
dissenting.

Appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming, on an equal
division of opinion, the conviction of the appellant on the verdict of the jury
rendered at the trial.

The prisoner, appellant, was indicted
""for that he, on the 18th day of May, 1904, at St. Margaret's Bay Road, in
the County of Halifax, with intent to disable one William Hill, did unlawfully
wound the said William Hill, by shooting at him, the said William Hill, with a
loaded gun."" On a reserved case stated by Mr. Justice Townshend, the judge
at the trial, to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the learned judge referred
to the evidence and then proceeded as follows:

""I told the jury that under the evidence
they could convict the prisoner of the charge laid in the indictment if they
were satisfied he intended to disable Hill at the time he fired the gun, and
that he fired with that object, and that they were at liberty to infer such intent
from the facts in evidence. If they thought he

[Page 608]

had no such intent at
the time, still they could convict him of the lesser offence, under section
242, of unlawfully wounding Hill with the gun because of his unlawful act in
pointing a loaded gun, and firing it at Hill, and it was for them to say
whether the accused knew or ought to have known that it was loaded, and whether
he did point it at Hill; that it was not necessary to constitute this offence
to prove actual malice. It was enough that it was unlawful.

""The jury, after deliberation, returned
a verdict of 'Guilty without malicious intent,' and that verdict I accepted,
and it was recorded as found.

""The prisoner's counsel, Mr. Power, then
requested me to reserve for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
sitting as a Court of Appeal for Crown Cases Reserved, certain questions of law
which I do now state and reserve.
These questions are: (a) ""Whether or not upon the finding of the
jury a verdict of acquittal should have been entered? (b) Were my
instructions in law correct?

""I sentenced the prisoner to two years
in Dorchester Penitentiary, but did not respite the execution of the
sentence.""

The reserved case was heard before the full
court composed of all the judges of that court, including the trial judge, the
result being an equal division in opinion, Weatherbe C. J. and Graham and Russell JJ. holding that the conviction
should be quashed, while Townshend, Meagher and Fraser JJ. considered it valid.
The questions argued upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now
reported.

John J. Power for
the appellant.

Longley K. C., Attorney-General
for Nova Scotia, for the respondent.

[Page 609]

The judgment of the majority of the court was
delivered by:—

Grirouabd J.—At the July Assizes, 1904, at Halifax,
the appellant was indicted for that he, on the 18th May, 1904, at St.
Margaret's Bay Road, in the County of Halifax, with the intent to disable one
""William Hill, did unlawfully wound the said William IIill by shooting at
him with a loaded gun. The jury after deliberation returned a verdict of
""guilty without malicious intent"" and that verdict the trial judge
accepted and, upon being recorded as found, he sentenced the prisoner to two
years in the Dorchester Penitentiary and did not respite the execution of the
sentence. At the same time at the request of prisoner's counsel, Mr. Power, the
learned judge reserved two questions.

(a) Whether or not upon the finding of the
jury a verdict of acquittal should have been entered? (b) Were my
instructions in law correct?

The reserve case
came before the court in banco with the result that the court was evenly
divided, Weatherbe O. J., and Graham and Russell JJ. for quashing the
conviction; Townshend J., who presided at the trial, Meagher and Fraser JJ. for
affirming the conviction.

It is contended on
the part of the appellant that the addition made by the jury to their verdict
""guilty "", of the words ''without malicious intent"", amounted to
an acquittal. The majority of the court is of that opinion.

It is conceded by
the judges affirming the conviction that the verdict is not a conviction of the
offence mentioned in section 241  of the Criminal Code  under which the prisoner
was indicted. It is contended that it is valid under section 242  which provides
that every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to three years
imprisonment who

unlawfully wounds or inflicts any grievous
bodily harm on any other person either with or without an instrument.

[Page 610]

Probably the jury
could have returned a verdict under this section or a verdict of common
assault, but they have not done so. Their finding that the offence committed by
the prisoner, whatever it might be, was without ""malicious intent"",
removed the essential requirement of a crime, whether malice is to be inferred
from an unlawful act or is ""express."" We have the less hesitation in
arriving at this conclusion because the Attorney General for the Province of
Nova Scotia, (Hon. Mr. Longley), declared before us that he could not sustain
the verdict as worded.

Without going
further into the examination of the reasons of the learned judges pro and con,
we order that the said conviction be quashed and the prisoner discharged from
the said penitentiary.

Davies
J. (dissenting):—This was an
appeal upon a Crown case reserved by Mr. Justice Townshend. On the hearing the
six judges were equally divided for and against sustaining the conviction. The
two questions reserved were (a) Whether on the verdict rendered an
acquittal should have been entered? and (b) Were the judge's
instructions to to the jury correct?

I am of the opinion
that a verdict of acquittal should not have been entered on the jury's finding
and also that the judge's instructions were correct.

I would have been
content to express my simple concurrence in the judgment prepared by my brother
Idington were it not for the reference therein to the question of ""common
assault"" which does not appear from the record to have been referred to at
the trial or on the hearing of the case reserved and was not raised or touched
upon by the prisoner's counsel before us. 1 do not wish to be understood as
expressing any opinion upon the point discussed by my brother Idington. In all
other respects I concur in his opinion.

[Page 611]

The prisoner was
indicted under the 241st section of the Code for wounding one Hill with
intent. The trial judge told the jury, I think properly, that they could,
under the provisions of the Code, convict the prisoner of the lesser offence
simply of ""wounding"" under the 242nd section, if they were not
satisfied he was guilty of the offence of wounding with intent specially
charged against him under section 241  and that to find him guilty of the lesser
offence it was not necessary for the Crown to prove or for them to find actual
malice.

The jury returned a
verdict of ""guilty without malicious intent"". I think that verdict means just what it says. The jury found
the intent which is an essential element in the offence defined by section 241 
to be wanting. The prisoner, therefore, was entitled to be acquitted of that
offence. The finding of the absence of malicious intent negatived the
existence of ""actual malice"" on the part of the prisoner about which
the judge had instructed them. But it meant neither more nor less than that. I
construe the verdict to mean—""We find the prisoner guilty of the lesser
offence of wounding under the 242nd section as he had no malice and no
intent""—or, as they put it, malicious intent. To complete the offence
under the 242nd section ""intent"" or malicious intent was not an
essential ingredient. It was such an essential element to complete the offence
defined in the 241st section. The jury found that ingredient wanting but that
the defendant was guilty. It seems to me, therefore, plain beyond reasonable
doubt that he must be acquitted under the 241st section and convicted under the
242nd section of the offence without the intent pursuant to the power contained
in the 713th section of the Code.

That is what the
trial judge did and I think he was right. I agree with him that the case of The
Queen v.

[Page 612]

Latimer,[2] decided unanimously by six judges all
experienced in criminal law, is ample authority, if such was needed, for his
decision.

It was said by one
of the learned judges in the court below that we are not entitled to indulge in
speculations as to the meaning of the jury's verdict. I agree, but think
speculation as to this verdict quite unnecessary. On the other hand I do not
think I am justified in giving effect to arguments which present themselves to
my mind merely as subtle refinements upon words and which would nullify what
appears to me a plain and clear verdict.

Idington
J. (dissenting):—The appellant
was tried upon an indictment preferred under section 241 of the Code and found by the verdict of the jury who
tried him, ''guilty without malicious intent"".

The learned trial
judge upon this verdict sentenced the prisoner but reserved certain questions
which as finally settled were

(a) Whether or
not upon the finding of the jury a verdict of acquittal should have been
entered? (b) Were my instructions in law correct?

I do not think that
the verdict was one of acquittal.

I am, with due respect, unable to understand
how such a contention can have any solid foundation in law, when regard is had
to the provisions of section 713, where it is said:—

Every count shall be deemed divisible; and if
the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating
the offence, or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any other
offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included, which
is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; etc., etc.

This was intended to
avoid the necessity of repeating in a needless multiplication of counts, as
ancient

[Page 613]

learning rendered
necessary, substantially the same or a minor cognate offence but having
otherwise a slight variation in degree of criminality.

The indictment
charged that the prisoner

with intent to disable one William Hill, did
unlawfully wound the said William Hill by shooting at him.

The indictment, if
the intent had been stricken out, would have been a perfectly good indictment
charging accused with ""unlawful wounding"" and such charge was, in the
language of section 713, included in the charge as described and would have
been included in the commission of the offence charged and as described, and
when and if the proof of intent fell short of establishing the charge as laid
but proved the charge without the intent it became the duty of the jury to
acquit the accused of the offence as charged and find him guilty of the
unlawful wounding.

This, I take it, is
clearly the evolution of law that the Code in this regard is intended to
express and declare to be the law in substitution of what had gone before.

It is not an
uncommon thing for juries to return such verdicts, with simply stating without
intent, and I think it can make not the slightest difference that they used an
adjective that aptly described the sort of intent that was here charged, and
may mean and I think was intended by the jurors to mean, more than the mild
form of malice that the law imputes to every man who infringes even in the most
trifling manner the criminal law.

The intent to
disable another carries with it actual deliberation that may be well designated
malicious in the wilful sense of the word, and to discriminate that from the
legal malice implied in unlawful wounding is all that the jury no doubt meant.

[Page 614]

To impute to them
something else is, I submit, with due respect, a clear departure from the
canons of construction that require words to be read and interpreted in the
light of the surrounding facts and circumstances and by their plain and
ordinary meaning.

To interpret such a
verdict as an acquittal seems to me to 'treat the jurors' verdict differently
from what we would the expressions of other ordinary people, trying to express
their meaning.

As to the proper
interpretation to be put upon these words we are not, by the case, left free to
determine otherwise than as to whether or not an acquittal. If not an acquittal
our duty as to that ends.

I am not quite free
from doubt as to whether it might not be said that as the statute allows a
verdict of assault to be rendered upon such a count the jury might not, if
properly directed, have found prisoner guilty of assault. This, however, is
not what I would draw from reading the charge as laid and the verdict without
looking beyond. And if we turn to the judge's charge, as I think we can here to
any part of the case submitted, and see no allusion to the third alternative of
an assault, it seems less chance exists for having any doubt as to the meaning
of the jury.

This is not a case
where, as in Reg. v. Gray,[3]
the jury expressly negatived fraud which was of the essence of the crime
there charged and, therefore, clearly in law shewed that the prisoner was not
guilty; or Reg. v. Healey,[4]
where a verdict of guilty of murder had added thereto, that there was no
evidence to shew malice aforethought and premeditation, which was found too
ambiguous to allow judgment to pass upon it. The foundation of the conviction
was taken away.

This finding without
intent or malicious intent does not meet the case and mean acquittal, where a man
may

[Page 615]

be found guilty
without intent of any kind, nay, as in the Queen v. Latimer,[5] against
the actual intentions of the accused.

As to the
instructions given the jury by the learned judge, I do not think that so far as
he went they contained error of law; but I think he ought to have gone further
and explained to the jury the three alternatives open to them upon such an
indictment as was preferred here.

I think, though no
statutory requirement may exist in regard to this, in respect of more than one
or two specified cases, that proper practice requires a verdict of acquittal,
where that is intended, in respect of the higher offence as laid, and a
conviction found in respect of the lower, just as if there had been two counts
in the indictment dealing respectively with each charge.

In regard to that,
however, Latham v. The Queen[6]
 shews that even where there were separate counts the omission of a finding
on the first count did not prevent the judgment going on an appropriate finding
of guilty on, or applicable to, a subsequent count.

That shows that what
was omitted to be done here would not vitiate the proceedings so as to render
the conviction liable to be quashed.

I may point out that
much of the interesting argument addressed to this court is in light of
sections 743 and 745 no longer valid, and that cases such as this are governed
by these much wider provisions than prevailed so late as Reg. v. Gibson,[7] which,
however, as indicated in the opinion of the court there a right beyond what was
contended for here, in regard to what could be looked at, to interpret the
proceedings calle [Illegible Text]n question.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM HIS LORDSHIP MR. JUSTICE
DAVIES, IN CHAMBERS.

Criminal law—Venue—Indictment—Commitment to
penitentiary—Warrant—Criminal Code , 1892, ss. 609 , 754 —R. S. C. c. 182, s. 42 .

The venue mentioned in section 609  of the
Criminal Code , 1892, means the place where the crime is charged to have been
committed and, in cases where local description is not required, there is an
implied allegation that the offence was committed at the place mentioned in the
venue in the margin of the record. It is of no consequence whether or not the trial
court should he considered an inferior court.

Under section 42 of ""The Penitentiary
Act,"" R. S. C. chap 182, a copy of the sentence of the trial court
certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of that court is a
sufficient warrant for the commitment and detention of the convict.

Judgment appealed from (35 Can. S. C. R. 189)
affirmed.

Appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies, in chambers[1], refusing the application of
the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of bis
imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Dorchester, N.B., on a conviction in a
County Court Judges' Criminal Court, under the provisions of Part LIV. of
""The Criminal Code , 1892,"" for the Speedy Trial of Indictable
Offences.

The questions raised on the appeal were
similar to those raised on the application for the writ of habeas corpus
mentioned in the report of the judgment appealed from.

[Page 491]

John J. Power for
the appellant. The forms FF. to the Code are merely examples of the manner of
stating offences. See Endlich on Statutes, sec. 71, pp. 91-92. A form given in
a schedule, especially if there is no reference to it in the body of the Act,
is to be regarded merely as an example. See also the foot note 77, on page 92.

Every element must be stated in an indictment
as heretofore required by law. Smith v. Moody[2], at page
60-63, per Alverstone C. J., and Wills and Chan-nell JJ.

The words ""County of Halifax"" in
the margin must denote either (a) the
place where the document was drawn up; 1 Burns's Justices of the Peace (30 ed.)
1118, and Austin's Case[3];
or (b) the venue as laid down
in section 609 of the Code. The venue is intended to shew where the facts were
alleged to have occurred and that the court and jury had jurisdiction in the
matter. It was formerly necessary to state the venue expressly in the
indictment, or by reference to the venue in the margin in every material
allegation. Now, by virtue of sec. 609 of the Code [taken from 18 ""Vict.
c. 92, (U.C.) E. S. C. ch. 174, sec. 104, and 14 & 15 Vict. (Imp.) ch. 100,
s. 23] it is not necessary to state any venue in the body of any indictment.

Section 651 of the Code relates to procedure
only, and does not authorize any order for the change of the place of trial of
a prisoner, in any case where any such change would not have been granted under
the former practice; it does away with the old practice of removing the case,
by certiorari, into the Queen's Bench, and then moving to change the venue. But
if the venue be changed, what of the marginal ""place"" as indicating
where the crime was committed.

[Page 492]

It is submitted, at all events, that the
words ""any record"" referred to in s.s. (l) of sec. 3  of the
Criminal Code  means ""any nisi prius record."" See sec. 30 of 14 &
15 Yict. (Imp.) ch. 100. By sub-sec. 3 of sec. 764  of the Code the record in
any case must be filed in the court. The warrant is a certificate under sec. 42
of the ""Penitentiary Act,"" and is given to the warden of the
penitentary through the officer who carries the prisoner, the act of a
ministerial officer; it is not a ""record,"" and therefore, is not
covered by sec. 609 and sub-sec. (1) of sec. 3 
of the Code.

As to the distinction of courts of general
and limited jurisdiction, see the Lefroy Case[4],
and 8 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, (2 ed.) pages 37, 38. Jurisdiction in the
County Court Judge's Criminal Court depends on (a) committal for trial or binding over; Code sees. 596, 601,
765; The King v. Komiensky[5]
(b) certain crimes; sea 765; or (c) consent of prisoner; secs. 765-767.

We also refer to Christie v. Unwin[6], at p. 379; The Queen v. Slavin[7]; Ex
parte Macdonald[8];
Case of the Sheriff of Middlesex[9].

Longley K.C., Attorney
General for Nova Scotia, for the Crown. Under the Criminal Code , 1892, and the
Dominion statutes respecting the imprisonment of convicts in the penitentiary
the warrant in question in this case is a sufficient compliance with the law. I
adopt the arguments used in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies in
the judgment appealed from. There can be no doubt that the marginal venue is a
proper and sufficient allegation of the place where the offence charged was
committed.

The judgment of the court was delivered by:

[Page 493]

Killam
J.—We are all of the opinion
that this appeal should be dismissed.

By sec. 609 of the
Criminal Code ,

it shall not be necessary to state any venue
in the body of any indictment, and the district, county or place named in the
margin thereof stall be the venue for all the facts stated in the body of the
indictment; but if local description is required such local description shall
be given in the body thereof.

The word
""venue"" in this section means the place where the crime is charged to
have been committed. See Taschereau's Criminal Code , page 671, and 22 Enc. Pl. &
Pr., page 819.

By sec. 764 of the
Criminal Code , and R. S. N. S. (1900) c. 157, county court judges' criminal
courts are courts of record. The forms of records for these courts given by the
Criminal Code , MM and NN, do not state any place of commitment of the offence.
By sec. 3, sub-sec (l), of the Criminal Code , the word
""indictment"" includes ""any record."" The offence of which
the appellant was convicted was not one for which local description was
required.

The venue in the
margin of the record was:

Canada,

Province of Nova
Scotia,

County of Halifax.

There was, then, by
force of the statute, an implied allegation that the offence was committed in
the County of Halifax and the Province of Nova Scotia. This was sufficient to
show the jurisdiction of the court, and it is unimportant whether that court
should or should not be considered an inferior court.

By the Penitentiary
Act, R. S. C. c. 182, sec. 42, the officer conveying a convict to a
penitentiary is to deliver him over without any further warrant than a copy of
the sentence taken from the minutes of the court before which the convict was
tried and certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of such

[Page 494]

court. This was done
in the present case and the copy furnished showed a record in a form which
satisfied the statute, and which by virtue of the statute showed the
jurisdiction of the court.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM MR. JUSTICE KILLAM, IN
CHAMBERS.

Criminal law—Jurisdiction of
magistrate—Criminal Code  sec. 785  — Constitutional law—Constitution of criminal
courts.

By sec. 785 of the Criminal Code  any person
charged before a police magistrate in Ontario with an offence which might be
tried at the general sessions of the peace, may, with his own consent, be tried
by the magistrate and sentenced, if convicted, to the same punishment as if
tried at the general sessions. By an amendment in 1900(63 Vict. ch. 46) the
provisions of said section were extended to police and stipendiary magistrates
of cities and towns in other parts of Canada.

Held, that
though there are no courts of general sessions except in Ontario, the amending
Act is not, therefore, inoperative but gives to a magistrate in any other
province the jurisdiction created for Ontario by sec. 785.

Though the organization of courts of criminal
jurisdiction is within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures, the
Parliament of Canada may impose upon existing courts or individuals the duty of
administering the criminal law and its action to that end need not be
supplemented by provincial legislation.

Appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Killam
in Chambers refusing a writ of habeas corpus.

The appellant Yancini was charged with the
crime of theft before the Police Magistrate at Fredericton, N.B., and having
elected to be tried summarily he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
imprisonment in the penitentiary. Application was made to a judge of the
Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a writ of habeas corpus on the two main
grounds: 1. That as by sec. 785  of the Criminal Code , as amended by 63 Vict.
ch. 46 a summary trial can only be had for an offence triable at a court of
general sessions of the peace

[Page 622]

such section is
inoperative, there being no such court in New Brunswick. 2. That the Dominion
Parliament cannot give jurisdiction to a provincial court to try criminal
offences the power to constitute a court of criminal jurisdiction being given
only to the legislature.

The application for the writ was referred to
the full Court in New Brunswick by which it was refused[1]. A similar application was
then made to Mr. Justice Killam of the Supreme Court of Canada, in chambers,
who also refused the writ, and this appeal was taken from his decision.

On March 21st, Crockett, for the
appellant, applied to have a day fixed for the hearing, but the Supreme Court
of Canada ordered the case to stand until notice of hearing was served on the
Attorney-General for New Brunswick and the Attorney-General for Canada. Notices
having been served as ordered, the hearing took place on the 27th of April,
1904.

Crockett for
the appellant, referred to the facts of the case as stated above and in the
judgment now reported and relied upon the provisions of the British North
America Act, 1867, sec. 91 par. 27; sec. 92 par. 14; sec. 101; secs. 539, 540
of the ""Criminal Code "" and the decisions in Ex parte Wright[2]; Ex
parte Flanagan[3];
Peirce v. Hopper[4];
James v. The Southwestern Railway Co.[5];
and In re County Courts of British Columbia[6].

Newcombe K.C. Deputy
Minister of Justice, for the Attorney-General for Canada. The question at issue
in the case of The County Courts of British Columbia (6) affected merely
the powers of the provincial legislatures 

[Page 623]

respecting the constitution
maintenance and organization of provincial courts and for defining their
territorial jurisdiction. In that case it was decided that the ""Speedy
Trials Act"" was not a statute conferring jurisdiction but an exercise of
the power of Parliament regarding criminal procedure. See remarks by Strong J.
at page 454 of the report. The Criminal Code  Amendment Act, 1900, consequently,
is not inoperative but gives to magistrates in cities and towns in all the
other provinces of Canada the same jurisdiction as that created for Ontario by
sec. 785 , imposing a duty for the administration of the criminal law without
any need of supplementary provincial legislation. We also refer to Reg v.
Toland[7]
at page 509; Valin v. Langlois[8];
Lefroy's Legislative Power in Canada, p. 510; and In re Liquor License Act, 1883[9].

The judgment of the court was delivered by

SEDGEWICK J.—This is an appeal to the court from
an order of Mr. Justice Killam refusing an application for an order nisi for a writ
of habeas corpus.

The prisoner was
charged before the Police Magistrate of the City of Fredericton, on the 18th
January, last, with the theft of two binocular glasses, of the value of $50.00;
one revolver value $15.00, to get her with several articles of jewelry, the
property of one Captain Kemmis-Betty, an officer of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry, stationed at Fredericton. He
consented to be tried by the Police Magistrate, pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to three years imprisonment in Dorchester Penitentiary, with hard
labour. He was placed in custody in the said penitentiary on the 21st January
and is now detained there under his

[Page 624

sentence. An
application was made before Mr. Justice Landry, of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, for his discharge under the Habeas Corpus Act. That learned judge
referred the question to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which court
dismissed the application. Subsequently application was made to Mr. Justice
Killam of this court, as above stated.

Two contentions were
made before us by counsel for the prisoner to shew that he was illegally
sentenced. 1. Because the prisoner was not charged before the magistrate with
an offence for which he might be tried by a Court of General Sessions of the
Peace, which was a condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction
purporting to be conferred by section 785  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, under
which the said, magistrate acted. 2. Because section 785 of the Code, as
amended by the Act of 1900, chpater 46 is ultra vires of the Parliament
of Canada, and there was no good or sufficient legislation of the Province of
New Brunswick to make its provisions operative or effective in that province.

We are of opinion
that neither of these contentions can be sustained. As to the first ground, by
section 782 the expression ""magistrate"" in the Province of New
Brunswick, means and includes any police magistrate acting within the local
limits of his jurisdiction. Then, section 785 provides that if any person is
charged in the Province of Ontario before a police magistrate with having
committed any offence for which he might be tried at a Court of General
Sessions of the Peace, such person may, with his own consent, be tried before
such magistrate, and may, if found guilty, be sentenced by the magistrate to
the same punishment that he would have been liable to if he had been tried
before the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. Section 783 provides that
whenever any

[Page 625]

person is charged
before a magistrate with having committed theft, the magistrate may hear and
determine, subject to the further provisions of the Act, the charge in a
summary way.

By the amending Act
of 1900, a sub-section was added to section 785 as follows:

2. This section shall apply also to police
and stipendiary magistrates of cities and incorporated towns in every other
part of Canada' and to recorders where they exercise judicial functions.

We are of opinion
that that gives the magistrate in provinces and territories, other than in the
Province of Ontario, the same jurisdiction to try the crime of theft as a Court
of General Sessions in Ontario has to try the offence in that province.

The contention that
inasmuch as there is no Court of General Sessions of the Peace in New Brunswick
the amending Act is inoperative and that it can only relate to a province where
such a court exists would entirely frustrate the object of Parliament. I do not
know anywhere in Canada, outside of Ontario, where there is a Court of General
Sessions of the Peace or any similar court, except in the cities of Montreal
and Quebec, in the Province of Quebec, and if it had been the intention to
limit the operation of the amendment to the places mentioned, the only
amendment necessary would be to have changed the first line of section 785 by
substituting for the words ""in the Province of Ontario"" the words
""in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.""

In addition to this,
it does not appear whether the prisoner was convicted under section 785 or
section 789, which section applies to the whole of Canada, and which, as much
as section 785, gives ample authority to the magistrate to make the conviction
complained of. As to the second point in our view

[Page 626]

the Dominion Parliament can, in matters
within its sphere, impose duties upon any subjects of the Dominion, whether
they be officials of provincial courts, other officials, or private citizens;
and there is nothing in the British North America Act to raise a doubt about
the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose new duties upon the existing
provincial courts, or to give them new powers; as to matters which do not come
within the subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces,
or to deprive them of jurisdiction over such matters. (Lefroy on the Legislatative
Powers in Canada, page 510.)

This statement of
the law is mainly founded upon the celebrated decision of this court in Valin
v. Langlois[10]
where it was held that the Dominion Controverted Elections Act (1874) was not ultra
vires of the Dominion Parliament, and whether or not the Act established a
Dominion court, the Dominion Parliament had a perfect right to give to the
courts of the respective provinces and the judges thereof the power thereby
created, and did not, in utilizing judicial officers and establishing courts to
discharge the duties assigned to them by that Act, in any particular invade the
rights of the local legislatures; and the majority of the court, Ritchie C.J.
and Taschereau and Gwynne JJ, held that that Act established a Dominion court as
authorized by section 101 of the British North America Act.

The question is most
fully treated by Mr. Justice Taschereau, now Chief Justice of this court, and
it is unnecessary now to do more than refer to that opinion. The judgment of
this court, in that case, was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council upon the grounds stated[11].

This court again
affirmed the same principle in Attorney-General v. Flint[12], which,
however, related to a jurisdiction imposed by the Parliament of Canada

[Page 627]

upon the imperially
created Court of Vice-Admiralty, in Nova Scotia.

Where once the
Parliament of Canada has given jurisdiction to a provincial court whether
superior or inferior, or to a judicial officer, to perform judicial functions
in the adjudicating of matters over which the Parliament of Canada has
exclusive jurisdiction, no provincial legislation, in our opinion, is necessary
in order to enable effect to be given to such parliamentary enactments.

On these grounds, we
think the application for a writ of habeas corpus in the present case should be
refused.

Appeal dismissed.

District Judge Liew Thiam Leng
1.         The accused/appellant, Goh Lee Yin, pleaded guilty to the following two charges:
DAC 19595/2005 (Exhibit P1)
You, Goh Lee Yin, F24 years old, NRIC S8104437F, are charged that you, on the 16
th
 day of May 2005 at or about 4.40 pm, at ‘Metro’ Departmental Store, Paragon Shopping Centre, Orchard Road, Singapore a place used for the custody of property, did commit theft of four bottles of ‘Clarins’ Sun Care lotions valued $180.00 cts (each $45.00 cts) in the possession of the Duty Manager, Mdm Amy Ho and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
DAC 24015/2005 (Exhibit P2)
You, Goh Lee Yin, F24 years old, NRIC S8104437F, are charged that you, on the 16
th
 day of May 2005, at or about 4.00 pm, at ‘Cold Storage’ Supermarket, Novena Square, Thomson Road, Singapore, a place used for the custody of property, did commit theft of the following:
a)         18 boxes of Shaver Cartridges valued $234.90cts (each $13.05cts)
b)         One Gillette Razor valued $16.90cts
c)         8 packet of Scholl insoles valued $37.60cts (each $4.70cts)
d)         One Scholl Skin File valued $46.30cts
e)         One Oral dental Floss valued $4.85cts
f)          One Oral satin Floss valued $5.90cts
having a total value of $306.53 in the possession of the Duty Manager, Mr Ang Kwong Chye and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The Statement of Facts
2.         On the 16
th
 May 2005 at about 4 pm, the accused entered Cold Storage Supermarket located at Novena Square, Thomson Road.  Upon entering the said supermarket, the accused stole the following items:
a)         18 boxes of shaving cartridges valued at $234.90 @ 13.05 per box,
b)         One Gillete Razon valued at $16.90,
c)         8 packet of Scholl insoles valued at $37.60 per packet,
d)         1 Scholl skin file valued at $46.30,
e)         1 oral dental floss valued at $4.85
f)          One oral satin floss valued at $5.90
with a total value of $306.53.  The accused placed the above mentioned items into three empty Cold Storage bags which she had taken at the Supermarket.  On the same day at about 4.40 pm, she proceeded to the Metro Departmental Store at the Paragon Shopping Centre, Orchard Road and stole four bottles of ‘Clarins’ Sun Care lotions valued at $180.  The accused admitted the statement of facts without any qualification.
3.         In addition, four other charges of shoplifting (Exhibits marked P3 to P6) were taken into consideration.  The accused consented to have these four charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
Psychiatrist Reports
4.         The Defence Counsel tendered two reports from the Accused’s Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr.Tan Chue Tin dated 16
th
 May,2005 and 19
th
 August, 2005 (Exhibit ‘D1’).  The two reports stated that the accused was suffering from Kleptomania ie an uncontrollable impulse to steal.  According to Dr.Tan, the Accused was having tension anxiety and distress followed by an uncontrollable pathological urge to steal, thus affording her immediate relief to the overwhelming, overpowering mental distress.  This led to the shoplifting offences committed during this period.  The accused had been under treatment since September, 2004 with prescribed medication to control her kleptomanic impulse.  Dr.Tan indicated in his two reports that the accused had defaulted the follow up treatment and medication since 18
th
 January, 2005 as the accused felt that she was “better” and “able to control her impulses.” He added that the accused also felt bad and embarrassed to admit she needed psychiatric help and medication. 
5.         The prosecution also tendered a report from Dr.Jerome Goh Hern Yee from the Registrar, Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Woodbridge Hospital and Institute of Mental Health (Exhibit “C”).  Dr.Jerome Goh opined that the accused has kleptomania which is an impulse control disorder and had responded favourably to treatment in the past.  In his report, Dr.Goh also stated that the accused was aware of her actions and that they were wrong.  He also opined that she would need long-term  psychiatric follow-up and treatment for her condition.      
Sentence
6.         In passing sentence, I considered the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty in the first instance and had no previous convictions.  I also considered the circumstances in which the accused had committed the offences as submitted by the Defence Counsel in the mitigation plea (Exhibit D1). 
7.         It is apparent that the thrust of the mitigation is the accused’s kleptomanic impulse as supported by the psychiatrist reports.  In 
Siauw Yin Hee v
 
PP 
[1995] 1 SLR 514
, the accused was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for shoplifting and on appeal before His Honour, the Honourable Chief Justice stated at [8]:
“ If our criminal law is to have any protective ambit over the lives of ordinary citizens, persons such as the appellant cannot be allowed to deal with their personal problems giving vent to their kleptomanic tendencies with abandon; or indeed, by resorting to any other form of crime.”
8.         Although in that case, the accused had a record of eight similar convictions, his Honour’s comments are pertinent to the present case.  The accused was aware of her kleptomanic condition and had sought assistance by seeing the psychiatrist in September 2004.  However, the accused defaulted in her follow-up and medication since January 2005 and this resulted in the series of shoplifting offences between 27
th

Public Prosecutor 
[2003] 3 SLR 178
 where the offence was one of committing a rash act and the court took into account the fact that the offender suffered from a significant mental disorder and committed a minor offence and particularly, that a causal relationship existed between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence.  He further submitted that the High Court in that case discounted the principle of general deterrence, recognised the accused’s condition would worsen and substituted the imprisonment term with a fine of $250.  In that case, His Honour, the Honourable Chief Justice had referred to the “Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (2
nd
 Ed, 2003) where the learned authors opined that the existence of a mental disorder is always a relevant factor in the sentencing process, 
but its impact will vary considerably according to the circumstances of
 
the individual case. 
 The learned authors also cited at page 93, the following approach suggested in the case of 
R v Wiskich 
[2000] SASC 64
 (a decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia delivered by Martin J) at para.  62:
“An assessment of the disorder is required.  A sentencing court must determine the impact of the  disorder upon both the offender’s thought processes and the capacity of the offender to appreciate the gravity and significance of the criminal conduct ….(A)s a general proposition, if an offender acts with knowledge of what is being done and with knowledge of the gravity of the criminal conduct, the importance of the element of general deterrence otherwise appropriate in the particular circumstances is not greatly affected.  The gravity of the criminal conduct is also an important consideration.  It is not difficult to understand that the element of general deterrence can readily be given considerably less weight in the case of an offender suffering from a significant mental disorder who commits a minor crime, particularly if a causal relationship exists between the mental disorder and the commission of such an offence.  In some circumstances, however, the mental disorder may not be serious or causally related to the commission of the crime, and the circumstances of the crime so grave, that very little weight in mitigation can be given to the existence of the mental disorder and full weight must be afforded to the element of general deterrence.  
In between those extremes, an infinite variety of circumstances will arise in which competing considerations must be balanced.”
10.       It would appear that the impact of a mental disorder on the sentencing process would depend on the circumstances of each individual case and the element of deterrence is not greatly affected if the offender acts with knowledge of what is being done and with knowledge of the criminal conduct.  In the present case, the appellant was well aware of her acts and was able to appreciate the gravity of the offence.  Moreover, as indicated earlier, the appellant had committed the offences six times on three different occasions.  This is confirmed from the reports given by the psychiatrists (Exhibits C and D1).  In the report given by Dr.  Jerome Goh, the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (Exhibit C) at page 2, para.  4, he stated that:
“Before she shoplifts, she would feel an urge to steal associated with a sense of anxiety, like a “rush, tension”, which would build up when she tries to fight it, until rational thoughts get displaced.  She said she proceeded to shoplift despite knowing that it was “not worth it” and having resolved never to do so again.  She said that only when she shoplifted would this “tension” be released and she would be at peace”, but only for a while.”
11.       The Defence Counsel had also urged the court to consider probation or a fine.  I was of the view that probation or a fine would not be appropriate in the present case.  Although the prosecution had proceeded on two charges, four other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.  I then considered the circumstances of this case in totality and decided to impose a short custodial sentence of two and a half months on each of the two charges proceeded with.  I also ordered the sentences to run concurrently.

Lai Siu Chiu J:
Introduction
1          This case involves a motor accident which took place on 28 March 2002 and which resulted in Tan Siok Kee (“the first plaintiff”) sustaining serious head injuries. The first plaintiff remains in a comatose state to date. I am tasked with determining who is liable for her injuries.
The facts
2          The first plaintiff is the wife of Liew Chee Kong (“the second plaintiff”). The third to fifth plaintiffs are the children of the first and second plaintiffs. Ivan Chong (“the defendant”) was at the material time a sales executive employed by a company which office was situated at 5 Hong Kong Street.
3          On 28 March 2002, at about 9.55am, the defendant and two of his colleagues decided to go for breakfast at a place called Killiney Kopitiam (“the coffee shop”) located at 11 Lorong Telok (“the road”) which road is bounded by North Canal Road on one side and by Circular Road on the other side. The defendant drove his vehicle, a Suzuki station wagon numbered SQR47R (“the car”). His front-seat passenger was Sim Kok Leong (“Sim”) while Lai Wye Jin (“Lai”) sat in the centre of the rear seat.
4          The threesome arrived at the road at about 10.05am. The road has two lanes for one-way traffic and has parking bays on both sides. The coffee shop is situated on the right side as one enters the road from North Canal Road. Noting that all the parking bays were occupied, the defendant decided to wait for a bay to become available.
5          The defendant noticed that a van numbered GN3066J (“the van”), parked in a bay on the left side of the road, had its driver’s door open and a man appeared to be doing some packing. He moved forward and asked the man whether the latter was moving out of the parking bay. Getting a negative answer, the defendant moved the car forward to the right side of the road ahead of the coffee shop and put on his handbrake.
6          While waiting for a parking bay, the defendant and his colleagues engaged in conversation with the windows rolled up and the air-conditioning switched on in the car. After waiting for about five minutes, the defendant noticed from his rear view mirror that a vehicle parked somewhere between parking bays 15 to 19 on the left side of the road had reversed out of its parking bay and had moved forward in the direction of Circular Road. The defendant waited for the vehicle to pass him on the left before he started reversing the car into the parking bay. After releasing his handbrake, the defendant turned his head to the left to look back and to check his blind spot. He then checked his rear view mirror and two side mirrors. Noting that the road was clear, the defendant shifted the car into reverse gear and started to reverse slowly.
7          The defendant intended to reverse in a straight line along the right lane before moving forward to the left lane and reversing into the empty parking bay. In the course of reversing, the defendant continued to maintain a lookout in his rear view mirror as well as the side mirrors. He had both his hands on the steering wheel.
8          After he had reversed for about two to three seconds (according to his estimation), Lai suddenly saw a woman’s face in the rear mirror of the car and yelled out a warning. The defendant heard a bang and felt a light impact. He applied the brakes of the car immediately, pulled up the handbrake and put on the hazard lights. The defendant thought he had hit a vehicle at an angle. He (and his passengers) alighted from the car. They found the first plaintiff lying unconscious on her back on the ground behind and parallel to the rear of, the car. According to the police sketch plan,
[note: 1]
 
the car stopped abreast of parking bay 7A which is on the right side of the road. The coffee shop is adjacent to parking bays 15 and 16 on the left side of the road.
9          At the material time, the first plaintiff worked at the coffee shop as a supervisor. Her duties included going to United Overseas Bank Ltd (“the Bank”) near Boat Quay between 10.00am and 11.00am daily, to deposit cash into the account the coffee shop maintained with the Bank. The first plaintiff was on her way to the Bank that morning when she was knocked down.
10        The defendant was subsequently charged with failing to drive in an orderly and careful manner without due regard for the safety of others, 
viz
 the first plaintiff. He was offered, which he accepted and paid, a composition fine of $500 on 29 August 2003 to compound the offence.
11        On 11 October 2002, the second plaintiff was appointed the committee of the person and the estate of the first plaintiff in Originating Summons No 1413 of 2002.
The pleadings
12        In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs alleged the defendant caused the accident by, 
inter alia
, failing to keep any and/or a proper lookout and failing to observe the presence of the first plaintiff along the road.
13        In the Defence, the defendant averred that he had lawfully reversed the car along the road when the first plaintiff suddenly emerged from the rear and the left of the car without proper care and/or attention and thereby caused the accident. The defendant pleaded that the collision was due to an inevitable accident that occurred without negligence on his part.
14        The defendant went on to allege contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff. He denied the allegation of injuries, loss and damages particularised in the Statement of Claim.
The trial
15        The two passengers in the car, 
viz
 Sim and Lai, did not testify even though both had given statements to the defendant’s insurers on 17 and 19 August 2002 respectively. Neither did Tham Weng Kuen (“Tham”) the driver of the van and Nurizzah bte Khalil, an eye-witness, both of whom had lodged police reports.
The plaintiffs’ case
16        Liew Hoe Peng,
[note: 2]
 
who is the third plaintiff and the eldest child of the first plaintiff, was a witness. However, large portions of his testimony were expunged from his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief as he deposed not to facts but to hearsay evidence, gave his opinion of the first plaintiff’s daily routine and how the accident probably occurred and contained submissions. His evidence was irrelevant.
17        Another witness called by the plaintiffs whose testimony was also irrelevant was that of Soh Lee Yong (“Soh”), the manageress of the coffee shop. Soh
[note: 3]
 
testified that she was in Chinatown that morning when she received a telephone call from her staff informing her of the accident. She rushed to the scene and found the first plaintiff still lying on the road. By then the first plaintiff had been moved from her original position by an employee of the coffee shop. Soh stayed with the first plaintiff until an ambulance arrived. She then accompanied the first plaintiff to the hospital. What Soh learnt of the accident was told to her by her staff, none of whom saw the accident themselves. Soh’s testimony was hearsay.
18        The last witness of the plaintiffs was Assistant Superintendent of Police James Lim (“ASP Lim”) who is the head of licensing and testing in the Traffic Police department. In compliance with the subpoena served on his department, ASP Lim
[note: 4]
 
produced two handbooks of the Traffic Police, 
viz
 the sixth editions respectively of the 
Basic Theory of Driving
 and 
Advanced Theory of Driving
.
[note: 5]
19        ASP Lim testified that the handbooks provided recommendations on driving and were not exhaustive of every driving situation that might occur. However, although compliance with the handbooks’ recommendations was not compulsory, he said failure to comply meant that a learner driver would not pass the theory test for driving.
20        ASP Lim was referred to ss 111 to 115 of 
Advanced Theory of Driving
 (“P2”) which sections recommended techniques on reversing. He opined that the traffic police did not encourage driving in reverse for a long distance. Questioned by the court, he clarified that anything more than reversing into a parking bay should be avoided. As for a pedestrian, he agreed that the person should look in both directions before he/she crossed a road, even in one-way streets.
The defendant’s case
21        There were three witnesses who testified for the defendant who was also a witness. One of them was Denny Sim (“Denny”) who was the executive director of Crawford & Company International Pte Ltd (“Crawford”). Crawford was instructed by the defendant’s insurers to interview the defendant, Sim and Lai and by the defendant’s solicitors to take photographs and measurements of the accident site. Denny
[note: 6]
 
took the photographs and measurements while his (former) colleague Mohamed Raffi bin Sharwan (“Sharwan”) interviewed the defendant, Sim and Lai. The photographs taken by Denny included those taken from inside the car, to ascertain the extent of vision outside of the car.
22        Sharwan
[note: 7]
 
recorded and transcribed the statements that he had obtained from the defendant and the defendant’s passengers. His evidence was not particularly useful since, as stated earlier at [15], save for the defendant, neither Sim nor Lai testified.
23        As the defendant’s version of events that transpired that fateful day has been set out earlier (at [3] to [8]), I turn to the evidence that was adduced from him during cross-examination.
24        The defendant said he did not see the first plaintiff before the collision. The defendant’s evidence suffered from lack of details, was vague in several respects and was generally unhelpful. He could not recall whether his hazard lights were on nor where the car was dented. (The police photographs showed the car to be dented on the right side of its rear ladder). Neither could he recall the position of the first plaintiff when the car collided into her, although the defendant was certain he did not run over her. The defendant also could not remember whether he had asked his passengers for help in reversing. However, had he seen her, the defendant asserted he would not have knocked down the first plaintiff. The defendant appeared to want to forget the entire episode. It could be because it was the first time he had knocked down a pedestrian although he had previously been fined and had been given demerit points, for knocking down a motorcyclist. (The defendant explained in cross-examination that the previous accident took place on a wet road and his vehicle had skidded at a traffic light).
25        Although he would not describe himself as a “regular” at the coffee shop, the defendant had visited that place two to three times in the past six months and after the accident, he recognised the first plaintiff as someone who had served him previously. He agreed that he was aware the presence of a number of food outlets along the road meant that there was a greater risk of pedestrians crossing the road.
26        Questioned why he did not drive off into Circular Road, make a round and return to the entrance of the road while waiting for a parking bay to be available, the defendant explained he had parked by the roadside. If he was to accept counsel’s suggestion and make a round, he might as well go somewhere else. He said it did not occur to him that it would have been safer for him to make a round and return to the entrance of the road and wait there, adjacent to either of the first two parking bays. To get the car into the vacant bay, the defendant would have had to reverse the length of seven to eight car park bays. The defendant agreed such an action was not the right thing to do. The defendant also agreed that reversing along the road was a more difficult (albeit more convenient) process than driving off and returning to the entrance of the road.
27        I should at this juncture make two pertinent observations. First, the original rear mirror in the car had been replaced by a larger and broader mirror by the defendant. Second, the defendant had learnt to drive while serving his national service. He drove a three tonne truck as well as a minibus while in the army. During his army days, the defendant was taught not to look back but to rely on the side and rear view mirrors of the vehicle when reversing. As he continued this method of reversing after his discharge from the army, changing the rear view mirror of the car to a larger one helped to give the defendant a better view of the back.
28        The defendant recalled he was driving at a “normal” speed (estimated to be 10–15km/h) that morning. Pressed further, the defendant said he could not remember his speed while reversing. The defendant could not recall if the car’s radio was on although Sim said he (Sim) was listening to music, according to Sim’s statement to Crawford. The defendant recalled he wanted to get into parking bay 17 which was two parking bays behind bays 14 and 15 on the same side as the coffee shop.
29        The defendant had an expert witness. He was Christopher Curtis O’Neill Marks (“Marks”) a professional (mechanical) engineer from New Zealand who is also a forensic scientist and motor vehicle accident analyst. Marks was tasked with assessing the timing relationship between the first plaintiff’s actions and those of the defendant when the defendant decided to reverse and looked behind to see if the road was clear to do so. Marks’ further objective was to assess the extent to which the defendant could have viewed the first plaintiff from the reversing stage onwards until the collision and whether the defendant could have avoided the accident.
30        At the outset, I should point out that Marks
[note: 8]
 
visited the road (twice) before the first hearing and, by the time of the second hearing, he had also inspected a car of the same model as the defendant’s car. Marks took measurements (width and length) of the road, the car and the parking bays. For purposes of his report, Marks was provided with all the relevant documents including the police sketch plan and photographs of the accident scene, the police reports lodged by the defendant and his two passengers and the statements they gave to Crawford. He noted that there were minor differences between the measurements taken by the police and Crawford which were not material, although Crawford was clearly wrong in its positioning of the coffee shop 
vis-à-vis
 the left parking bays. Based on the measurements he took, Marks calculated
[note: 9]
 
the stopping distances of the car based on various speeds it travelled or would have travelled at the material time.
31        As part of his analysis, Marks had to estimate the location of the point of impact. He then used that point as a reference for all time and distance relationships between the first plaintiff and the rear of the car.
32        Based on the evidence, it was Marks’ opinion that the first plaintiff left the kerb at about the dividing line of parking bays 14 and 15, outside the coffee shop. There would have been a gap between the vehicles parked in the two bays for her to pass through. Marks further opined that as the first plaintiff was not run over, the car must have stopped very quickly after the impact. Consequently, the point of impact would very likely have been abreast of the dividing line between parking bays 14 and 15. It was also likely to have been within a few metres towards Circular Road from the rear of the car. The first plaintiff was likely to have crossed the road almost at right angles
33        Using the measurements taken by the police of the distance (4.6m) across the road between the parking bay edge markings, the width (1.4m) of the car, the damaged area (about 0.4m on the rear left side) of the car, and the parking bay width (2.3m), Marks calculated that the distance from the edge of the left parking bays 14 and 15 to the damage on the car was about 2.5m. The distance from the left kerb to the damaged area of the car was about 4.8m. He estimated that the first plaintiff would have walked between 2.5m and 4.8m from her first available visibility to the defendant, until she reached the point of impact. He discounted, as having a negligible effect, any small angle at which she might have walked across the road.
34        Marks then relied on statistics from pedestrian walking tests conducted by Texas A & M University showing that 70% of 57 female test subjects aged between 50 and 59 years of age (which was the first plaintiff’s age group) would be expected to walk at between 1.31m and 1.74m per second. At that speed range, he estimated that the first plaintiff would have walked from the edge of parking bays 14 and 15 to the point of impact in 1.44 to 1.91 seconds. Similarly, she would have walked from the edge of the left kerb to the point of impact in 2.76 to 3.66 seconds nominally in 3 to 4 seconds at the most.
35        Therefore, to be detected by the defendant as a potentially emerging hazard, the first plaintiff would have to be seen by the defendant as she became visible to him crossing onto the road from about 3 to 4 seconds prior to impact. If the defendant had looked and decided to reverse at more than 3 to 4 seconds prior to impact, the first plaintiff was most unlikely to have been visible to him as a potential hazard. At any stage thereafter, the defendant would have been able to detect the first plaintiff as she came into view only by looking as he continued reversing.
36        In order to assess the timing relationship of the defendant’s action to those of the first plaintiff’s, Marks had to determine the expected time that the defendant would have taken from his last deciding look behind the car until it started moving, together with the expected time that it would then have taken to reach the point of impact. Based on tests he and other researchers had conducted, Marks found that the time lapse between a driver viewing an expected signal to proceed and a vehicle’s first movement is a minimum of one to two seconds. This is made up of the decision time and the implementation time each of which takes between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds. Once moving, tests done by Marks and other researchers showed that reversing vehicles normally accelerated at 0.05 to 0.10 g (where g = 9.8m/s²) up to a speed of 5km/h to 15km/h, depending on the circumstances.
37        Marks noted there was no clear evidence from the defendant or his passengers on the location at which the car started to reverse. However, the position of the first plaintiff after the collision showed the rear of the car as just beyond the motorcycle parking bays on the right side. His best estimate therefore was that the car stopped with its rear one to two parking bays beyond the motorcycle parking bays. The car would then have travelled 5m to 10m from this location to the point of impact. After listening to the oral evidence, Marks revised these distances to between one and a half and two parking bays’ lengths. His measurement of the length of one parking bay lot was 5.2m,
[note: 10]
 
as against Crawford’s measurement of 5.4m. The distance travelled by the reversing car would therefore range from 7.8m to 8.1m and 10.4m to 10.8m. At an acceleration of 0.05 to 0.10 g, the car would have travelled 10m in 6.39 seconds and reached a speed of about 11km/h according to Marks’ calculations. Given his earlier calculations, the time lapse from the moment the defendant last looked back to the point of impact was likely to be between 4.19 and 8.39 seconds, nominally 4 to 8 seconds minimum.
38        The next issue which Marks addressed was reversing technique. He opined that drivers of vehicles have limited options for detecting emerging pedestrians. In order to monitor left and right and behind, it was necessary for a driver to carry out a repeated scanning sequence of all three directions. Twisting around while driving was both awkward and of limited scope. It was difficult to see directly behind and to the right of a vehicle by twisting to the left. The same problem existed if twisting to the right.
39        Marks opined that using the rear view mirrors was likely to give a better ability to monitor the views to the left, right and behind provided the mirrors covered the necessary fields. He added that the use of rear view mirrors while reversing would more likely detect an emerging pedestrian in the circumstances of this accident than twisting around to look behind. Further, tests have shown that drivers take at least about 0.5 second to switch between views and at least 1.0 second to dwell upon each view when checking for possible objects. Thus the minimum elapsed time between repeats of any particular view amongst the three required for the defendant when reversing was about 3.5 to 4.5 seconds.
40        Therefore, if the defendant had maintained a continuous sequence of monitoring the back by the car’s rear view mirrors, he could have completely missed detecting the first plaintiff from the moment she left the kerb outside the coffee shop and came into view until the impact occurred. This would apply to any normal attentive driver reversing in the same circumstances. Earlier detection of the first plaintiff’s presence would only occur if the view scanning sequence happened to coincide with her coming into view after she stepped off the kerb, while the defendant was looking to the left. If the defendant had seen the first plaintiff, a reaction time of at least about 1.0 second would be expected before he started braking. At the estimated speed of 11km/h and an expected braking deceleration of 0.7 g, it would have taken about 0.45 second to stop. Therefore, in order to avoid the collision by stopping, the defendant’s detection of the first plaintiff would have to occur about 1.5 seconds prior to the car’s rear reaching the impact location. At that stage, the first plaintiff would have either been at or just past the parking bay edge markings. The defendant would have had no more than about 3.0 seconds to look in her direction and detect her. This was less than the scanning repetition time and thus could have been achieved only by chance. On the available evidence, the impact most probably occurred after a reversing movement of 5m to 10m. The most probable cause was the first plaintiff failing to detect the reversing car as she crossed the road.
41        While he agreed that the technique recommended by the traffic police in ss 112 to 115 of the handbook (P2) was a correct method of reversing, Marks qualified his answer by pointing out that it was not the only correct method.
42        As for the defendant’s act of reversing down a one-way street with vehicles parked on both sides, Marks seemed to think there was nothing wrong. He opined that reversing a short distance to reach a parking bay being vacated was essential because the road width was such that clearance ahead of the vacating vehicle was required. However, he acknowledged that if reversing in a one-way street was prohibited under Singapore law (of which he was not familiar), then the defendant would have been responsible for a transgression that led to the collision.
The findings
43        Whilst I do not doubt Marks’ credentials as an expert, his report was an 
ex post facto
 surmise of what was likely to have happened at and before the collision. The court had no reliable eyewitness account of what actually transpired. The first plaintiff could not testify while the defendant’s oftentimes vague testimony did little to throw light on the distance and speed at which he reversed the car before it hit the first plaintiff.
44        The best evidence before the court on the collision was the damage to the car itself. It was not in dispute that the damage was not serious but only a shallow dent to the right of the ladder at the left side of the rear. This was consistent with the police report lodged by Nurrizah bte Khalil who said she saw the first plaintiff hit her head on a metal ladder at the back of the vehicle. Unfortunately, as stated earlier at [15], Nurrizah was not called to testify. Counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court
[note: 11]
 
that Nurrizah had migrated to Boston in America while the van driver, Tham, was not in Singapore during the trial period. With greater effort (albeit at some cost in the case of Nurrizah) these witnesses could and should have been called by the plaintiffs to testify. My comment would equally apply to Sim (who was in Hong Kong at the time of trial) and to Lai who was doing his national service. It was not for counsel for the defendant or the defendant, but for the court, to decide whether the evidence of Sim or Lai was material.
45        It was Marks’ opinion (which I accept) that the low impact and slight damage to the car coupled with the absence of skid marks were consistent with the defendant’s testimony that he had reacted to Lai’s warning and had braked before the impact. As a result, the first plaintiff was not run over and she did not sustain lower leg injuries. Yet the first plaintiff was and is still comatose. Why? I believe the injuries to the first plaintiff resulted from her head hitting the car’s body and/or ladder and then hitting the road when she fell to the ground. At this juncture, I should point out that none of the medical reports pleaded in para 16 of the Statement of Claim were annexed to the pleadings nor did they appear in any of the bundles of documents produced in court.
46        Why did the defendant not see the first plaintiff? The likely explanation was because she came within the blind spots of the car when she attempted to cross the road. When she eventually came into the defendant’s view (confirmed by Lai’s warning) it was too late. Photographs taken by Denny from Crawford
[note: 12]
 
showed that a significant blind spot was created by the left rear corner structure and that a greater blind spot was created by the right rear corner structure of the car, the right structure being wider than that on the left side.
47        The car’s blind spots were exacerbated by the height of the car which was 1.691m.
[note: 13]
 
Marks’ inspection
[note: 14]
 
of a car of the same model as the defendant’s car revealed that the height of the lower edge of the rear window was 1.1m laden. The driver’s seat measured from road level to the bottom of the rear window was similar. Consequently, any object or part thereof that was lower than that height would not be seen when close to the car.
The issue
48        The only issue that needs to be determined in this case is who caused the collision? The accident was a tragedy as far as the first plaintiff’s family was concerned. The other four plaintiffs are understandably aggrieved and hold the defendant responsible for the first plaintiff’s present unfortunate condition from which she is unlikely to recover.
The law
49        At law, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant was negligent in order to succeed in this action. In this regard, the plaintiffs’ reliance on the maxim 
res ipsa loquitar
 in their opening statement is misconceived. 
Res ipsa loquitar
 is only applicable where the facts proved are more consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant than with other causes. As was rightly pointed out in the defendant’s submissions, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove there was negligence on the part of the defendant, which negligence caused the collision between the car and the first plaintiff. It is only when the plaintiffs have proved a 
prima facie
 case of negligence on the part of the defendant that the evidential burden then shifts to the defendant to negative his liability by proving it was an inevitable accident, as pleaded in the Defence.
50        What then is the duty of care on the part of the defendant as a motorist? According to 
Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2001) at para 9-186:
[T]he duty of a person who either drives or rides a vehicle on the highway is to use reasonable care to avoid causing damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind on or adjoining the highway. In this connection, reasonable care means the care which an ordinarily skilful driver or rider would have exercised, under all the circumstances, and connotes an “avoidance of excessive speed, keeping a good look-out, observing traffic rules and signals and so on.”
The above principles were culled from various cases cited by the learned authors.
51        The learned authors then went on to say (at para 9-219):
It is the duty of the driver or rider of a vehicle to keep a good look out. Indeed, a driver will be held negligent if he fails to notice in time that the actions of another person have created a potential danger. He must look out for other traffic, which is or may be expected to be on the road, whether in front of him, behind him or alongside him, especially at crossroads, junctions and bends.
52        There is a corresponding duty on the part of pedestrians as road users as can be seen from the following passage (at para 9-231) from the same textbook:
Where pedestrians seek to cross the road either near to or at places other than pedestrian crossings, they have no specific precedence and the responsibility for causing an accident more often than not will be shared between the pedestrian and the vehicle driver. Nevertheless, the court has held that a pedestrian may cross a road at ay point he chooses, provided that he takes reasonable care for his own safety. He is not obliged to cross over the road only at an adjacent or nearby light-controlled crossing [see 
Tremayne v Hill
 
[1987] RTR 131
].
The decision
53        It was the opinion of the defence expert, Marks, that the first plaintiff was entirely to blame for the collision. Conversely, the second to fifth plaintiffs blamed the defendant for what had happened to the first plaintiff, their counsel relying on 
Zhang Wan Bo v Poh Kay Leong
 
[2002] SGHC 274
 for his submission that the defendant was solely liable for the accident.
54        Based on the evidence adduced in court, it would appear that the following events took place on that fateful morning of 28 March 2002:
(a)        The defendant and his two passengers, Sim and Lai, arrived at the coffee shop at about 10.05am.
(b)        Finding all the parking bays occupied, the defendant decided to wait for a bay to be vacated.
(c)        While waiting for a vacant parking bay, the defendant moved the car forward to the right side of the road ahead of the motorcycle bays while engaging in casual conversation with his passengers.
(d)        Based on the police sketch plan, the parking bay which became vacant (bay 17) necessitated the defendant having to reverse a distance of at least four to five parking bays from where he waited.
(e)        The defendant reversed the car slowly (at maybe 10–15 km/h) judging from the absence of brake skidding marks on the road.
(f)         The defendant knocked down the first plaintiff after he had reversed one and a half to two parking bay lengths.
(g)        The defendant did not see the first plaintiff before Lai’s warning.
(h)        It was a light impact between the car and the first plaintiff (judging from the slight dent to the car). Hence, the first plaintiff did not suffer any lower leg injuries. However, it caused the first plaintiff to knock her head on the rear body and ladder of the car and then on the road when she fell.
(i)         The first plaintiff sustained serious head injuries from the collision or, more likely, from her fall.
55        Although the court will not lightly disregard the testimony of any credible court expert, I am not prepared to accept the evidence of Marks without some reservations. The fact that the plaintiffs did not challenge such expert testimony did not mean (as the defendant rightly acknowledged in the closing submissions) that the court must accept it without question. Granted, Marks was very thorough in his investigations – he inspected the road and a car of the same model as the defendant’s car, took measurements of both, and reworked (retrospectively based on various data) to the best of his abilities the possible speeds (and distances) at which the defendant could have reversed the car at the material time. Marks then relied on empirical data to estimate the speed at which the first plaintiff would have walked just before the collision. He then concluded that the defendant could not see the first plaintiff in time to avoid knocking into her; she was thus to blame.
56        There was a glaring omission in Marks’ report. I find that he was too eager to absolve the defendant from liability and in the process forgot his role as an independent expert. Marks overlooked the fact that the defendant (by his own admission) attempted to reverse a fairly long distance (more than the recommended one to two parking bay lengths according to ASP Lim’s testimony) to get into the vacant parking bay. In my view, a reasonable driver would not have attempted to reverse such a distance to get into the vacant parking bay. It was not a valid defence for the defendant to say that it was inconvenient for him to make a round by driving out of and back to the entrance of the road again to get into parking bay 17. Such laziness cannot be overlooked; it was a contributing factor to the accident.
57        In the closing submissions of the defendant, it was argued that he was lawfully reversing the car when the first plaintiff suddenly emerged, and the collision was an inevitable accident. I have difficulties accepting this submission in the light of my observation in [56] above. Marks himself testified that there were blind spots in the car which would prevent the defendant from having an unobstructed rear view when he reversed the car, be it by relying solely on the rear and side mirrors (as recommended by Marks) or by a combination of looking through the rear view mirror and looking back (as recommended in the traffic police’s handbook P2). That being the case, a reasonable and prudent driver would not have reversed almost the entire length of the road to get into a parking bay.
58        At the same time, I have no doubt that the first plaintiff was equally to blame. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion put forth by the defendant’s closing submission that she had stepped suddenly into the road and that the first plaintiff had failed to exercise due caution for her own safety when she crossed the road. With respect, I disagree. Why else would she not have seen the car and a station wagon at that, being reversed?
59        There is no provision in the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) or in its regulations or in our Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed) that puts the onus solely on motorists to look out for pedestrians. At law, there is a corresponding duty on the part of pedestrians to watch out for oncoming traffic. Indeed, r 7 of the Highway Code specifically exhorts pedestrians not to step into the road suddenly without looking. According to ASP Lim, that duty equally applies in one-way streets. It also cannot be disputed that it is usually easier for a pedestrian to see a reversing vehicle than 
vice versa
 (because every vehicle has its blind spots and a vehicle is a large object) unless the pedestrian’s view is blocked, or he or she is not alert.
60        I have no doubt that the first plaintiff suddenly stepped out onto the road from the kerb on the left side of the road. She did so by making her way through a gap between the vehicles parked outside the coffee shop and failed to look out for traffic in the process. Otherwise, she could not have missed seeing the car being reversed by the defendant.
61        It serves no purpose to rely on case law to determine liability in this action as the fact situation in every case is different. Consequently, counsel’s reliance on 
Zhang Wan Bo v Poh Kay Leong
 ([53] 
supra
) to say that the defendant should be liable is misplaced. Granted that in that case, the accident took place along the same road, but the court there upheld the plaintiff’s claim because there were witnesses (including the plaintiff’s wife) who testified that the plaintiff had moved aside to avoid the defendant’s car when it passed him. The defendant’s car had then stopped and reversed, hitting the plaintiff in the process.
Conclusion
62        Applying the legal principles enunciated in 
Charlesworth & Percy
 ([50] 
supra
) to the facts, I find that the first plaintiff and the defendant were equally liable for the accident. There will be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiffs with costs based on 50% liability. The Registrar is directed to assess damages and the costs thereof are reserved to the Registrar.

Kan Ting Chiu J:
The parties
1          Mr Wong Chee Tieng or C T Wong is the second plaintiff in this action. He is the director of research and development of the first plaintiff, Icadam Technologies Sdn Bhd. In 1995, he set up a company known as CT Design Software House Sdn Bhd (“CT Design”). CT Design developed and marketed software for use in the metal stamping industry known as “V6 Software”.
2          In 1999, the second plaintiff and CT Design entered into a joint venture with the first defendant CAD-IT Consultants (Asia) Pte Ltd, another company which is now named V6 Technologies (Asia) Pte Ltd (“V6”), and two individuals. Pursuant to the joint venture, CT Design assigned its rights in the V6 Software to V6, and the second plaintiff became a shareholder and director of V6 and also the first defendant’s general manager of V6 Software development.
3          Disputes arose between the joint venture parties which led to a settlement whereby the second plaintiff sold his shares in V6 and ceased to be involved with V6 and the first defendant.
4          After parting ways, the second plaintiff set up the first plaintiff which also engaged in developing software for the metal stamping industry, and it developed software known as “iCADAM Software”.
5          As the first plaintiff and the first defendant were in the same field of business, they had common target clients, one of which was Amtek Engineering Limited (“Amtek”).
6          The action arose from a visit to Amtek by two employees of the first defendant, namely Mr Alvin Tan Chin Yew and Mr S Elamurugan (“Elamurugan”) on 9 March 2004 to promote V6 Software. The former was a market development manager and also the second defendant in this action. The latter was a software engineer. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants defamed them during that visit.
The words complained of
7          The words complained of were not set out in the Statement of Claim filed by the plaintiffs. Both the defendants wanted the plaintiffs to give particulars of the words. The words provided in the Further and Better Particulars to the Statement of Claim were:
CT Wong has no any rights to develop software that is related to the Metal Stamping Industry;
The software developed by CT Wong might have infringed the Intellectual Property Right of CAD-IT/V6’s technology software, and will be subjected to future legal pursue and consequences; and
Any future user/customer, including prospective user/customer like Amtek, who uses the software developed by CT Wong will have to pay the royalty fees to CAD-IT for the usage of CAD-IT/V6’s technology.
8          The plaintiffs claimed that those words, by their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean that:
(a)        the plaintiffs, by developing and commercially exploiting their software for use in the metal stamping industry, had acted in breach of their legal obligations and would be subject to civil and/or criminal liability for such breach;
(b)        the plaintiffs, by developing and commercially exploiting their software for use in the metal stamping industry, had infringed or are likely to have infringed the intellectual property rights of the first defendant and/or V6 such that legal proceedings would be commenced against the plaintiffs and they are thereby subject to civil and/or criminal liability for such breach under the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1999 Rev Ed) or any other relevant laws;
(c)        in relation to the promotion of the iCADAM Software the plaintiffs have been dishonest and/or dishonourable in their dealings with Amtek; and/or
(d)        the plaintiffs were dishonest and/or dishonourable in their trade or office.
The defences
9          The first defendant denied that the words complained of were understood to bear or were capable of bearing the meanings the plaintiffs asserted. It was also pleaded that the statements were made without its knowledge, approval and consent.
10        The second defendant’s defence was a bare denial of the words complained of and the meanings attributed to them.
11        Neither defendant pleaded justification, fair comment or qualified privilege in defence.
The issues
12        There were not many issues in this case, and at the close of the case, the issues that needed to be addressed were narrowed down to:
(a)        whether the second defendant had said the words complained of;
(b)        whether the words complained of bore the meaning the plaintiffs alleged;
(c)        whether the plaintiffs’ action was sustainable without proof of special damage; and
(d)        whether the first defendant was vicariously liable if the second defendant spoke the words complained of.
Whether the second defendant spoke the words
13        The plaintiffs did not have first-hand knowledge of those words themselves. The second plaintiff was informed of them by Liow Leong Eng (“Liow”), an employee of Amtek.
[1]
 
The plaintiffs sought to obtain more information from Amtek. Amtek was reluctant to be brought into the dispute and did not provide it voluntarily. Eventually, the plaintiffs obtained the information after pre-action interrogatories were served on three Amtek employees, namely Liow, Kok Chia Liang (“Kok”) and Ng Tong Chye (“Ng”).
14        Liow, Kok and Ng were principal witnesses for the plaintiffs in this action. Liow and Kok were the Technical Development and Research and Development managers respectively of Amtek whilst Ng was a senior engineer. They all related the events of 9 March 2004 where the second defendant and Elamurugan went to their company to demonstrate the V6 Software to the three of them and another Amtek employee, Xin Shou Jun, an engineer from China.
15        Their accounts set out in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief were largely similar. They recounted that the second defendant told them that he was aware that the second plaintiff was trying to sell his own metal stamping software to Amtek. The critical parts of the second defendant’s statements were set out by them in identical terms:
I have come to inform you that CT Wong has no any [
sic
] rights to develop software that is related to the Metal Stamping Industry.
and that:
[T]he software developed by CT Wong might have infringed the Intellectual Property Right of CAD-IT or V6’s technology software and will be subjected to further legal pursue [
sic
] and consequences.
and when Liow cautioned him that these were serious allegations and he was not concerned about the dispute between CT Wong and CAD-IT, the second defendant issued a warning that:
[A]ny future user or customer, including any prospective potential user/customer like Amtek, who uses the software developed by CT Wong will have to pay royalty fees to CAD-IT for the usage of CAD-IT or V6 technology.
16        The second defendant’s statements troubled Liow, Kok and Ng as they could affect their company, which was already a client of the first plaintiff. They had a discussion among themselves about two days later and submitted a report on the matter drafted by Liow to Amtek’s senior management. The text of the report was:
Re: Records of Incident for the Preview of V6 software of CAD-IT
1.         On the 9th March, 2004 at about 2.30 pm, Mr. Alvin Tan, Market Development Manager and Mr. S.Elamurugan, Application Engineer of CAD-IT, came to our office on our invitation for V6 CAD software preview.
2.         With Liow Leong Eng, Mike Kok, Ng Tong Chye and Xin Shou Jun attended the demonstration session in one of the meeting room at 3rd floor of No. 1 Kian Teck Drive, Singapore (628818).
3.         Before the demonstration session started, Mr Alvin Tan made a claim that he has come here to inform us, that CT Wong has no rights to develop software that is related to the Metal Stamping Industry.
4.         Mr. Alvin Tan also made a claim that he has come here to inform us that, the software developed by CT Wong might have infringed the Intellectual Property Right of CAD-IT/V6’s technology software, and will be subjected to future legal pursue and consequences.
5.         Subsequently to statement 3 & 4, that accordingly to Mr. Alvin Tan, any future user/customer, including prospective potential user/customer like Amtek, who uses the software developed by CT Wong will have to pay the royalty fees to CAD-IT for the usage of CAD-IT/V6’s technology.
6.         Upon watching the demonstration session, and testing on one of our assembly drawing (softcopy) created by the software developed by CT Wong, we found that V6 software was not able to read the data.
7.         Mr. S.Elamurugan made a remark that it is a different data structure and hence V6 is not able to read it.
8.         Mr. Alvin Tan said that he will announce the claim of statement 4 & 5 on the public launch of the V6 software on the 18th March 2004 at their seminar.
9.         Mr. Alvin Tan verbally agrees to write to us on the claims of statement 4 & 5 after the public launch.
10.        The demonstration session ends at about 3.30 pm.
11.        We hereby state that the above statements are true within our personal capacity and best knowledge.
17        While both defence counsel questioned the three witnesses on this document, no questions were raised about its authenticity. Their evidence that the report was prepared and submitted to inform Amtek’s senior management of matters that happened on 9 March 2004 was not disputed.
18        Counsel cross-examined the three witnesses at some length and in some detail. They went through the events from the time of the arrival of the second defendant and Elamurugan, to their entry into the room where the demonstration was conducted, the persons who entered and left the room, the preliminary small talk, the presentation, the questions asked, and the discussions.
19        Not surprisingly, there were inconsistencies in the accounts of the three witnesses particularly on peripheral matters and matters of detail. But the main thrust of their evidence endured, that the words complained of were spoken in the course of that meeting. It was noteworthy that in cross-examination, it was not put to the witnesses that they had conspired to incriminate the second defendant, that they had reason to bear false evidence against him, or that he had said something which they mistook for the words complained of.
20        The allegations the second defendant made were taken seriously by Liow, Kok and Ng and their employers because Amtek had purchased software from the first plaintiff. In January 2004, the first plaintiff had contracted to sell to Amtek its iCADAM software customised to Amtek’s requirements. The US$162,000 purchase price for the software was to be paid in two equal payments.
[2]
21        On learning of the allegations, Amtek withheld the second payment for the software until the doubts over the rights on the software were resolved. The second payment was not paid till after the defences in this action were filed, when it became clear that the defendants did not contend that the allegations were true.
[3]
22        The first defendant denied that the words complained of were said. Its only witness with direct knowledge of the meeting of 9 March, Elamurugan recounted a conversation between Liow and the second defendant as follows:
a.         that Mr. Liow informed the 2
nd
 Defendant that he was aware of the agreement between the 2
nd
 Plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendants;
b.         that Mr. Liow had read the agreement between the 2
nd
 Plaintiff and the 1
st
 Defendant and felt that neither the Plaintiffs had breached the terms of the agreement nor has the Plaintiffs infringed the intellectual property rights of the 1
st
 Defendants;
c.         the 2
nd
 Defendant informed Mr. Liow that he was in no position to comment on the terms of the agreement or the intellectual property rights of the 1
st
 Defendants and he had to leave the matter to the management of the 1
st
 Defendants to decide after consulting with Solicitors;
d.         Mr. Liow insisted that if the 1
st
 Defendant feels that the Plaintiffs had breached the terms of the agreement and has infringed the intellectual property rights of the 1
st
 Defendants, the 1
st
 Defendants should commence legal action against the Plaintiffs; and
e.         again, the 2
nd
 Defendant said that he was not in a position to comment as it was up to the management of the 1
st
 Defendants after consulting their Solicitors.
[4]
23        Elamurugan’s references to “the Plaintiffs” as well as “the 2
nd
 Plaintiff” were significant in that they showed that both plaintiffs were referred to. This confirmed that during the visit, in addition to demonstrating and promoting the first defendant’s software, the unhappy relationship between the plaintiffs and the first defendant was discussed.
24        The second defendant admitted that the question of the first defendant taking legal action against the first plaintiff was also brought up. However, in his version of the discussion it was Liow who brought that up.
[5]
 
Nevertheless, his admission confirmed that something more than a product demonstration took place.
25        When I reviewed the evidence to determine whether the words complained of were said, the following factors were in the plaintiffs’ favour:
(a)        Liow, Kok and Ng were independent and neutral parties with no stakes in the first plaintiff or the first defendant.
(b)        There was a contemporaneous record of the second defendant’s allegations tendered by Liow, Kok and Ng to Amtek’s senior management.
(c)        Amtek delayed the second payment of the iCADAM software to the first plaintiff when it learnt of the allegations.
(d)        There was no suggestion that Liow, Kok and Ng knowingly made false allegations against the second defendant, or that they had misunderstood what he had said.
26        On the other hand, I was not impressed by the evidence of the second defendant and Elamurugan. They were not neutral witnesses, as both were employees of the first defendant. Although the second defendant has since left its employ, he remained a defendant in the action.
27        He was shown by uncontroverted evidence to have spoken poorly of the plaintiffs at a seminar organised by the first defendant nine days later on 18 March 2004. At that seminar to introduce V6 Software, he made unprovoked and negative statements about the original developers of the V6 Software (
ie
 the second plaintiff and CT Design), describing them as a one-man operation with limited management and marketing capacity. The second defendant’s disposition to talk dismissively of the second plaintiff at a product launch added credibility and corroboration to the evidence that he had run the second plaintiff and his company down while speaking to a common target client a week earlier.
28        I found that the plaintiffs have established on the balance of probabilities, that the second defendant spoke the words complained of.
Whether the words complained of bore the meaning the plaintiffs alleged
29        In 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 at 683, [41], the Court of Appeal held:
In considering the natural and ordinary meaning of the words the proper approach is to consider what meaning the words would convey to an ordinary reasonable person who is neither unduly naïve or suspicious, using his general knowledge and common sense. Such a meaning is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences which can reasonably be drawn by such person: see 
Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 at p 258; and 
Jones v Skelton
 [1963] 3 All ER 952 at p 958.
30        The ordinary reasonable person contemplated is an ordinary reasonable person who heard the words in the context when they are published, not one who only read the words set out in the pleadings. In 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
 at 318–319, [19], the Court of Appeal explained:
In determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, the sense or meaning intended by the appellant is irrelevant. Nor for such purpose is the sense or meaning in which the words were understood by the respondent relevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire speech made by the appellant on that occasion. It is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by reasonable members of the audience at the Bedok car park on that evening using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words, but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons …
31        The test in this case was what those words meant to Liow, Kok and Ng if they were ordinary reasonable persons.
32        The first defendant set out the context of the statements in its Closing Submissions:
[T]he alleged defamatory statements have to be read in the following context:
a.         that Amtek and/or their representatives had prior to the publication of the statements knowledge of the existence of the V6 Software. This is found in the evidence of Ng where he states that Liow had asked him to evaluate whether the 2 softwares were identical and in the evidence of Liow where he states that he had prior knowledge of the Intellectual Property issue in the teleconversation with Mr. Derek Chua, prior to the presentation on the 9
th
 March 2004;
b.         that Amtek and/or their representatives had prior to the publication of the statements were concerned about any potential Intellectual Property issues between the V6 and ICADAM Software. At the meeting between Mr. Chan Eng Guan and Mr. Tan Sook Kiang, Mr. Chan was queries as to the ownership of V6. Why would the technical director of Amtek in his discussion highlight this issue, but to show that he was concerned about the Intellectual Property issue between the V6 and ICADAM software. This is not disputed by the Plaintiffs or raised in cross-examination of Mr. Chan;
c.         that Amtek and/or their representatives was aware of the history between the Plaintiffs and the 1
st
 Defendant having dealt with the 1
st
 Defendants prior to the incorporation of the 1
st
 Plaintiffs.
33        Viewed in that context, Liow, Kok and Ng would understand that the second defendant was referring not only to the second plaintiff who was specifically referred to, but also to the first plaintiff, the company he had set up to market the iCADAM Software he had developed.
34        When the link to the first plaintiff was established, the words complained of were clearly defamatory of both plaintiffs. It bears remembering that neither defendant had pleaded justification, fair comment, or privilege as alternative or further defences to their pleas that those words were never said.
Whether the action is sustainable without proof of special damage
35        This question was raised by the second defendant. His counsel was aware of, and cited s 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 1985 Rev Ed) in his submissions:
In an action for slander in respect of words calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business.
36        A simple reading of the provision would suggest that this action came within its purview, as the words complained of were clearly calculated to disparage the plaintiffs in their profession, trade and business.
37        However, it was submitted that:
It is for the Plaintiffs to nail their colours to their mast and the Defendants are entitled to be told the case they were required to answer. The Plaintiffs have not adduced any corroborative evidence to show that the Plaintiffs have been disparaged in any office, trade or business held or carried on by the Plaintiffs at the time of the publication.
38        It is not clear what counsel intended by the words “have been disparaged”. If counsel meant that the plaintiffs had suffered in their office, trade or business, the submission was misguided. Once the plaintiffs have shown that the words complained of were calculated to disparage the plaintiffs in their profession, trade or business, s 5 comes into operation. The section does not require actual harm to be caused; it looks only at the intention.
Whether the first defendant is vicariously liable for the words complained of
39        There was no question that the second defendant had gone to Amtek’s office on 9 March 2004 in the course of his employment with the first defendant to demonstrate the V6 Software. This was admitted by the second defendant and Elamurugan.
40        The first defendant’s defence on this issue was:
The [first defendant] further says that even if statements were made by the representatives and/or employees of the [first defendant] on the 9
th
 March 2004 (which is denied), the statements were made without the knowledge, approval and consent of the [first defendant].
[6]
41        This defence implied that knowledge, approval and consent are elements of vicarious liability, but this was not elaborated on by counsel during the hearing, and was not touched on in the closing submissions. I took this fallacious defence to have been abandoned.
My decision
42        In view of my findings on the issues, I found in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendants.
43        I ordered that damages be assessed by the Registrar. I also decided that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the aggravated damages they sought.
44        When I made the order I was mindful of the view I expressed previously in 
Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan
 
(No 2)
 
[2005] 1 SLR 552
 and 
Goh Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan
 
(No 2)
 
[2005] 1 SLR 573
.
 The senior assistant registrar who heard those cases entered interlocutory judgment for the respective plaintiffs and ordered that “damages (including aggravated damages) to be assessed by a Judge in Open Court”, and I stated that inasmuch as the assessment process must necessarily include the determination whether aggravated damages are to be ordered, that decision should be left to the person who assesses the damages. I should have amplified on that and put the proper context to it, as it appeared to be inconsistent with my judgment in another defamation action, 
Macquarie Corporate Telecommunications Pte Ltd v Phoenix Commications Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 1 SLR 463
 (“
Macquarie
”) where I entered judgment for the plaintiffs with aggravated damages to be assessed.
45        In those two cases against Chee Soon Juan, the matters came up before the senior assistant registrar on the plaintiffs’ applications for summary judgment. The issue before him was whether there was any triable issue that could be raised on the issue of liability. The evidence was led by affidavits, with no cross-examination. Against that backdrop, there was little before the senior assistant registrar which could assist him in determining whether aggravated damages should be awarded, and he should have left that to the court that was to assess damages.
46        In the present case (as in 
Macquarie
), however, there was a full trial with witnesses being produced and examined. Evidence was led on the background of the second plaintiff’s involvement with the V6 Software and the joint venture, and the first defendant’s reaction when the first plaintiff marketed its software after the break-up, in addition to the circumstances in which the words complained of were spoken. Only the quantification of the damages was not gone into.
47        At the conclusion of the hearing before me, there was little or nothing left to consider in deciding whether aggravated damages should be awarded. I found that unlike the senior assistant registrar in those two cases, I should make the determination.
48        After reviewing the matter, I did not award aggravated damages. Two factors led me to this decision. While the words complained of were serious allegations, the defendants had not attempted to justify the allegations, or to claim that they were entitled to make them. Secondly, the words complained of were said to a limited audience and were not repeated by the defendants. The plaintiffs have not appealed against this part of my decision, and the defendants cannot be unhappy that aggravated damages were not awarded.

District Judge Kow Keng Siong:
The charge & the appeal
1.         This Grounds of Decision arises from an 
appeal against conviction and sentence
.
2.         The Accused, Mr Ricky Hwa Lai Heng, claimed trial before me to a charge under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for allegedly conspiring with one Roger Cheong Sing Whee and one Joyce Tia Hui Yee to cheat the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd into disbursing $1,940,000 to Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd.
3.         At the end of the trial, I found the Accused guilty of his charge and sentenced him to 20 months’ imprisonment.
4.         I shall now set out the reasons for my decision.
Undisputed facts
The parties
5.         At all material times, 
the Accused
 was an Assistant Sales Manager of Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd (Yamazaki), a company in the business of manufacturing and repairing machinery.
[1]
 
As an Assistant Sales Manager, it was the Accused’s job to collect orders, coordinate production schedule, prepare delivery orders and invoices, and collect payment from customers.
6.         
Roger Cheong Sing Whee
 (Cheong) was a majority shareholder and Managing Director of Sin Yuh Industries Pte Ltd (Sin Yuh), a company which manufactured precision machine components for sale to IC manufacturers and computer makers. 
Joyce Tia Hui Yee
 (Joyce) was Sin Yuh’s Finance Manager.
Purchase of 47 Yamazaki machines
7.         Sometime in late 2001 and early 2002, Sin Hui purchased 47 machines (amounting to a total of $4,874,750)
[2]
 
from Yamazaki in anticipation of increased production from a new project. This project was intended to be carried out by Zhang Hui Industries Sdn Bhd – Sin Yuh’s subsidiary company.
8.         To pay for the 47 machines, Sin Yuh issued 36 post-dated cheques sometime in late 2001 and early 2002 in favour of Yamazaki. However, Yamazaki was able to eventually present only 7 of these cheques (amounting to a total of 
$902,460
) for payment as Sin Yuh later encountered cash flow problems.
[3]
Financing for 16 of the machines
9.         Joyce was entrusted with the responsibility of sourcing for additional funds to pay for the Yamazaki machines. She successfully secured financing for 15 of the Yamazaki machines by way of hire purchase agreements with Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd (9 machines) and Tokyo Leasing (Singapore) Pte Ltd (6 machines). These hire purchase arrangements were entered into in May 2002.
[4]
 
The Accused knew of these 2 hire purchase arrangements, including the specific 15 machines involved. He had in fact earlier confirmed with Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing that Yamazaki had received 
$438,000
 (from Sin Yuh’s cleared cheques) towards the payment of the relevant 15 machines.
[5]
10.       Due to an oversight, Sin Yuh did not obtain any financing for one of the Yamazaki machines.
DBS loan application
11.       As for the financing of the remaining 31 Yamazaki machines, Sin Yuh applied to the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) for a loan under the Regionalisation Finance Scheme
[6]
 
in early 2002. Sometime before May 2002, the Accused came to know of this loan application from Joyce.
[7]
 
On 21 May 2002, DBS agreed to lend Sin Yuh $1.94 million or 60% of the valuation / purchase price for 31 specified Yamazaki machines, whichever is lower: DBS’s Letter of Offer (P55).
Pre-condition to DBS loan disbursement
12.       There were 2 important pre-conditions before the DBS loan could be disbursed:
[8]
a.         The relevant legal documentation must first be completed: clause 2(j)(ii) of P55. This requirement was fulfilled sometime in November / December 2002.
[9]
b.         
Sin Yuh must furnish satisfactory evidence that it had paid the remaining 40% of the purchase price of the 31 machines – which in this case amounted to 
$1.293 million
: clause 2(j)(i) of P55
.
13.       Both Cheong and Joyce knew that Sin Yuh must make 40% deposit payment for the 31 machines before DBS would disburse the loan. In fact, sometime before 13 December 2002, Joyce received a request from DBS for a letter confirming that this pre-condition to loan disbursement had been satisfied.
[10]
Accused’s representation to DBS
14.       On 13 December 2002, Joyce sent an email (P63) to the Accused, requesting the latter to prepare a letter to DBS stating, 
inter alia
, that Yamazaki had received $1.293 million from Sin Yuh. By that time, the Accused knew that DBS was going to provide financing of $1.94 million for the outstanding 31 machines. He complied with Joyce’s instructions.
[11]
 
On or before 
16 December 2002
, the Accused prepared and signed a letter to DBS (P64) stating that Yamazaki had received from Sin Yuh $1.293 million as down payment for the 31 machines intended to be financed by DBS. This confirmation letter was later sent to DBS.
Loan disbursement
15.       After receiving the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64), DBS delivered (by way of bank transfer) $1.94 million to Yamazaki’s bank account on 10 March 2003 (P66).
Default on loan repayment
16.       Sin Yuh soon defaulted on the DBS loan repayment. In fact, due to cash flow problems, Sin Yuh did not make any of the instalment payment to DBS. The bank later repossessed and sold 26 of the 31 machines secured to the loan. As for the remaining 5 machines, they were repossessed by Yamazaki in Malaysia. DBS was not able to repossess these 5 machines because Yamazaki had not been fully paid for them.
Prosecution’s evidence
Accused chased for outstanding payments
17.       According to Joyce, the Accused was the only person whom she liaised with at Yamazaki regarding the 47 machines.
[12]
 
It was her evidence that he frequently chased her for full payment on the machines. Joyce recalled instances when the Accused enquired from her about the status of the DBS loan application and when the loan would be disbursed.
[13]
18.       Joyce’s evidence was corroborated by Cheong, who testified that before the DBS loan was disbursed, the Accused had chased Sin Yuh for full payment of the Yamazaki machines. During such chasers, the Accused would want Sin Yuh to ask DBS to expedite the loan disbursement.
[14]
Circumstances in which Joyce sought P64 from Accused
19.       Sometime on or about 13 December 2002, Joyce told Cheong about DBS’s request for a letter to confirm that Yamazaki had received the 40% deposit payment for the 31 DBS machines from Sin Yuh. When Cheong directed her to obtain the letter from Yamazaki, she informed that they had not made such payments yet. Cheong however replied that he did not care, as Yamazaki was then chasing him for payment. Joyce accordingly sent the email (P63) to the Accused.
[15]
Accused sent P64 to DBS
20.       Joyce testified that she did not send the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) to DBS. According to her, this letter was sent directly to DBS by the Accused. Joyce also received a copy of P64 from the Accused. It was Joyce’s evidence that when P64 was prepared, Sin Yuh had not paid $1.293 million to Yamazaki for the 31 DBS machines.
[16]
 
During cross-examination, she denied having told the Accused to treat all the funds received by Yamazaki from Sin Yuh, Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing as making up the 40% deposit payment for the 31 DBS machines.
[17]
The Defence
Accused did not chase Sin Yuh for outstanding payments
21.       The Accused denied having chased Sin Yuh for the outstanding payments on the Yamazaki machines.
[18]
Joyce’s purported instructions to ‘reallocate’ funds
22.       The Accused testified that at the time he prepared P64, Yamazaki had received a total of about $2 million from Sin Yuh, Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian towards payment for all the 47 machines. Joyce had told him to treat $1.2 million from these collective funds as payment towards 40% of the purchase price of the 31 DBS machines. The Accused agreed, because he did not wish to offend Sin Yuh which was a VIP customer. Furthermore, he believed that until Sin Yuh made full payment for all the machines, it was entitled to deal with the collective funds received by Yamazaki in any manner that it (Sin Yuh) deemed fit.
[19]
Joyce sent P64 to DBS
23.       The Accused testified that after preparing P64, he sent it to Joyce who then sent it to DBS.
[20]
Assessment of the evidence
Offence of cheating
24.       To make out an offence of cheating
 under section 420 read with section 415 of the Penal Code, three elements had to be satisfied: (a) the victim had to be 
deceived
; (b) there had to have been an 
inducement
 such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and (c) there had to have been a 
dishonest or fraudulent intention
 on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property: 
Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 969
.
Whether DBS had been cheated
25.       
Defence position during the trial
: During the trial, Mr Manicka (Accused’s counsel) did not dispute – through cross-examination of the relevant prosecution witnesses – the Prosecution’s case that –
a.         the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) was sent to DBS;
b.         DBS accepted the Accused’s assertion in P64 that Sin Yuh had paid 40% of the purchase price of the 31 DBS machines, and was thus led to believe that the pre-condition to loan disbursement in clause 2(j)(i) of P55 had been satisfied; and
c.         DBS had relied on P64 in finally allowing the disbursement of $1.94 million to Yamazaki.
26.       The Defence in fact did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case.
27.       From the conduct of the Accused’s defence, it appeared that the material issues before me were principally (i) whether the Accused was involved in the conspiracy between Cheong and Joyce to cheat DBS, and (ii) whether the Accused had the intention to cheat DBS at all material times. In regards to (ii), the matter really turned on –
a.         whether Joyce had told the Accused to consider funds received by Yamazaki from Sin Yuh, Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian as payment towards the 40% deposit of the DBS machines at the time the confirmation letter (P64) was prepared; and
b.         assuming that such instructions were given, whether the Accused did honestly believe that Joyce was entitled to do so.
28.       
Defence submissions at the close of the trial
: However, in his submissions at the close of the trial, Mr Manicka argued that the Prosecution failed to show that DBS had been cheated as –
a.         The charge did not specify which DBS officer was cheated by the Accused;
[21]
 
and
b.         The Prosecution did not adduce evidence to show that all the DBS officers involved in processing the loan had been deceived by the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) and thereby induced to disburse the loan to Yamazaki.
[22]
29.       
Prosecution’s burden of proof
: I found the Defence contention to be wholly misconceived. I agreed with DPP Lee that the Prosecution need only prove that DBS, through its relevant officer(s), had been deceived by P64 into disbursing the loan. There is no need to show that every DBS officer called by the Prosecution was deceived.
[23]
30.       
Burden discharged
: The undisputed evidence showed that DBS’s Credit Documentation Department was responsible for loan disbursements.
[24]
 
Tan Li Eng (Tan), an officer from that department, testified that she was the one who approved the loan disbursement to Yamazaki.
[25]
 
According to Tan, she approved the disbursement after being satisfied that Sin Yuh had fulfilled all the pre-conditions in DBS’s Letter of Offer (P55). In regards to the pre-condition in clause 2(j)(i) of P55, Tan testified that she had seen the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64). After consultation with DBS’s Credit Department, she accepted P64 as fulfilling the 40% deposit payment requirement in clause 2(j)(i).
[26]
 
It is thus clear that DBS extended the loan to Sin Yuh for the purchase of 31 Yamazaki machines on the Accused’s representation in P64 that Sin Yuh had made the necessary 40% deposit payment for these machines. In reliance of P64, DBS permitted the drawdown of the loan and disbursed the funds to Yamazaki.
31.       I am of course mindful that there were other matters which DBS considered in finally allowing the loan disbursement. These would include financial risk involved in the lending, the credit-worthiness of the borrower (Sin Yuh), and completion of the relevant legal documentation.
[27]
 
Nonetheless, asthe High Court had made it clear in Seaward v PP 
[1994] 3 SLR 369
, to prove a cheating charge, the inducement need not be the sole or even main reason for the delivery of the property by the deceived party. So long as the deceiving party’s deception played some part in inducing the victim to deliver some property, this element in the offence would be satisfied. In this case, it cannot be denied that Sin Yuh’s 40% deposit payment for the 31 machines was a 
material
 pre-requisite to loan disbursement.
 
This requirement is described in clause 2(j)(i) of the Letter of Offer (P55) as a ‘
Pre-condition
 for Disbursement’.
 
As Gui Kong Hwa, Vice-President of DBS’s Credit Department (which department was responsible for credit evaluation) had explained, the rationale for this pre-condition was to ensure that charges created by DBS over the relevant machineries would not be threatened by 3
rd
 party claims.
[28]
 
If DBS had known that Sin Yuh was not able to make the 40% deposit payment for the 31 machines, they would certainly have had questions about the company’s financial health and its ability to repay the loan
.
32.       I am satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that DBS was deceived by the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) and thereby induced into disbursing $1.94 million to Yamazaki.
DBS’s omission to verify P64
33.       Before turning to other aspects of this case, I would like to briefly deal with a minor point raised by the Defence in submissions. According to Mr Manicka, DBS should have carried out its own due diligence test – instead of relying on the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) – before disbursing a huge loan of $1.94 million to Yamazaki.
[29]
34.       I found this argument to be wholly disingenuous.
a.         Firstly, there is nothing on the face of P64 which would have reasonably aroused the suspicion of DBS about the authenticity of the Accused’s confirmation and thereby necessitated further inquiry by the bank. The Accused had (i) given the confirmation in P64 as an Assistant Manager of Yamazaki’s Sales Department, (ii) sent the letter apparently on Yamazaki’s letter-head, and (iii) provided the relevant information necessary for DBS to process the loan application and disbursement.
b.         Secondly, whether DBS had been negligent in relying on P64 is an irrelevant consideration in determining whether an offence of cheating had taken place.
[30]
 
The whole purpose of section 420 lies in the protection of innocent parties against being cheated by unscrupulous persons: 
Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 969
 @ 980. Cheating offences frequently occur precisely because the victim is naïve, less cautious, or more trusting of others. ‘[F]raudsters should not be decrying trusting or even gullible victims’: 
PP v Teo Cheng Kiat
 
[2000] SGHC 129
; 
PP v Chia Teck Leng
 
[2004] SGHC 68
 @ para 36. The fact that DBS failed to independently verify or investigate whether Yamazaki had received 40% deposit payment for the 31 machines did not detract from the fact that the bank had been deceived by the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) and was thereby dishonestly induced into disbursing the $1.94 million loan.
Did Cheong conspire with Joyce to cheat DBS
35.       Mr Manicka submitted that there was no evidence that Cheong had conspired with Joyce to cheat DBS. According to the Defence, Cheong’s evidence suggested that he was in fact unfamiliar with the financing arrangements for the 47 machines (including details of the DBS loan), and had left these matters to Joyce.
[31]
 
Mr Manicka also highlighted Cheong’s testimony that he could not say affirmatively whether he had seen the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64), or whether it was sent to DBS.
[32]
36.       I am not impressed by this submission. It is trite law that communication between each conspirator is not required to establish the presence of a conspiracy: 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
; Explanation 5 to section 108 of the Penal Code and accompanying illustration. Furthermore, the High Court had emphasized in 
Nomura Taiji & Ors v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 173
 @ 193 that –
… although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details. However, they must at least be aware of the general purpose of the plot and that plot must be unlawful. The test of guilt is not what was the object of the accused, but whether having regard to the immediate object of the instigation or conspiracy, the act done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and commonsense, the abettor must have seen as foreseeable — see 
The Penal Law of India
 by Sir Hari Singh Gour at p 945.
37.       To establish the element of conspiracy, it is thus not necessary for DPP Lee to prove that Cheong was intimately familiar with the details of the plot to cheat DBS, or that he had personally communicated with the Accused on the matter.
[33]
38.       On the facts, it is plain to me that Cheong and Joyce had conspired to cheat DBS. Firstly, Cheong had testified that at the time of the DBS loan application, he knew, and was concerned, that Sin Yuh did not satisfy one of the pre-conditions for loan disbursement – ie that Sin Yuh must have made 40% deposit payment for the 31 machines.
[34]
 
Nonetheless, he proceeded to request for the loan disbursement by sending a letter (P65 – dated 16 January 2003) to DBS’s solicitors.
[35]
39.       From the evidence, it appears that a copy of the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) was in fact attached to Cheong’s letter (P65). In this regard, I noted that the last paragraph of P65 states:
Attached copies of acknowledgement letters
 
from
 Henko Industries Pte Ltd and 
Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd
 for the receipt of deposits paid by Sin Yuh. The 
original letters
 have been forwarded to DBS – Mr Choo Jon Haw on 
16/12/2002
. (emphasis added)
From the evidence adduced before me, the only acknowledgement letter from Yamazaki which fitted the above description was P64.
[36]
 
Indeed, Joyce confirmed that she had attached a copy of P64 to P65 when she presented P65 to Cheong for his signature.
[37]
40.       I am mindful that Cheong was not sure if he had seen P64 at the time of signing P65. Contrary to Defence’s submissions,
[38]
 
I do not find this to be fatal to the Prosecution’s case, given that due allowance should be given to fallibility of recollection, especially with a long passage of time, which in this case was about 2 ½ years. What is more significant is that according to Cheong, he should have seen P64 as it was referred to in P65, and P65 was an important letter which he had to sign.
[39]
41.       It is pertinent to note that by the time of the trial, Cheong had already pleaded guilty to an offence under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (vide DAC 5575/2005) and was sentenced for that offence. He had also admitted to another charge relating to the same subject-matter of the present charge against the Accused, and consented to it being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
[40]
 
During the trial, Cheong unequivocally admitted that he was involved in a conspiracy with Joyce 
and the Accused
 to deceive DBS into disbursing the $1.94 million loan.
[41]
 
I find it wholly inconceivable that if the Accused was not involved, Cheong would (i) at his own proceedings, falsely admit to a charge of having conspired with Joyce and the Accused to cheat DBS, and agree for this charge to be taken into consideration in determining his sentence, and (ii) subsequently at the Accused’s trial continue to insist on the Accused’s complicity, thereby placing himself at risk of being prosecuted for perjury when he was merely a witness.
Was the Accused involved in the conspiracy
42.       
Peripheral issues
: It was not disputed during the trial that the Accused had prepared P64 – a letter which induced DBS to disburse the $1.94 million loan. In this letter, the Accused represented to DBS that Sin Yuh had made a 40% deposit payment (or $1.293 million) for the 31 machines subject to the DBS loan.
43.       Although there was some controversy as to (i) whether Joyce had seen a draft of P64 (D2) before it was sent to DBS, and (ii) who (the Accused or Joyce) had sent P64 to DBS,
[42]
 
I did not find these issues to be material. The fact remained that –
a.         the Accused had prepared P64 pursuant to Joyce’s email (P63);
b.         Joyce (i) knew at the material time that P64 contained false representations about Sin Yuh’s payment of 40% of the purchase price for the relevant machines to Yamazaki, and (ii) admitted to having the intention to cheat DBS,
[43]
 
and
c.         DBS had received P64 and relied on it to disburse the loan.
44.       
Objective evidence
: On the objective evidence, the representation in the Accused’s confirmation letter (P64) – that Yamazaki had received $1.293 million (or 40% deposit payment) from Sin Yuh for the 31 DBS machines – is obviously false. At the material time, Yamazaki had only received $902,460 from Sin Yuh towards the payment for all the 47 Yamazaki machines. Out of this, the Accused had confirmed that –
a.         $147,000
[44]
 
was supposed to have been considered as the down payment for 6 machines under hire purchase arrangements with Tokyo Leasing; and
b.         $291,000
[45]
 
was supposed to have been considered as the down payment for 9 machines under hire purchase arrangements with Arab-Malaysian.
This meant that Yamazaki would have received from Sin Yuh 
only about $464,460
[46]
 
(and not $1.293 million as represented in P64) for the 31 DBS machines.
45.       
Accused’s explanation
: To exculpate himself, the Accused claimed that when he prepared P64, Joyce had verbally instructed him to ‘reallocate’ the hire purchase funds Yamazaki had received from Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing for another 15 machines to the 31 DBS machines.
[47]
46.      
 According to the Accused, he did not query these instructions but had instead complied with them because –
a.         Sin Yuh was a VIP customer;
b.         He honestly believed that Sin Yuh was entitled to ‘reallocate’ funds from the hire purchase companies to DBS machines as these funds were Sin Yuh’s monies; and
c.         He had considered payment for all the 47 machines purchased by Sin Yuh as a package. As a sales coordinator, the Accused claimed that he was only concerned with the total payment collected – regardless of whether the funds came from Sin Yuh, Arab-Malaysian or Tokyo Leasing.
[48]
47.       I found the Accused’s purported reasons for sending P64 to be unbelievable.
48.       
No intention to offend a VIP customer
: When giving his evidence, the Accused portrayed himself as a compliant and meek employee who did not dare to offend Sin Yuh, a major client, by pressing the company for the outstanding payments. This evidence was contradicted by both Cheong and Joyce, who testified that the Accused had in fact chased them for payment at all material times. In fact, it was Joyce’s evidence that she decided to cheat DBS as the Accused was pressing her for the outstanding payments.
[49]
49.       I found no reason to disbelieve Cheong and Joyce, who impressed me as candid and truthful witnesses. Indeed, I noted that their testimonies were not in any way slanted or embellished against the Accused. If indeed both these witnesses had wanted to falsely incriminate the Accused, one would expect them to have portrayed the latter in a more sinister light, as being an active participant or instigator in the scheme. Instead, it is clear from their evidence that the Accused was not the mastermind of the scam.
50.       It is also pertinent to note that Cheong and Joyce’s evidence that the Accused had frequently chased them for the outstanding payments was not challenged by Mr Manicka during cross-examination.
[50]
 
In 
Alcontara a/l Ambross Anthony v PP
 
[1996] 1 MLJ 209
, 218, it was held that –
… in a criminal trial, the whole point and purpose of the defence having to put its case to such of the prosecution witnesses as might be in a position to admit or deny it, is to enable the prosecution to check on whether an accused`s version of the facts is true or false, and thus avoid the adverse comment, that the defence is a recent invention - in other words, `kept up its sleeve`, as it were - and revealed for the first time when the accused makes his defence from the witness box or the dock, thus detracting from the weight to be accorded to the defence.
I am of the view that the omission by the Defence to dispute Joyce and Cheong’s evidence that the Accused had frequently chased Sin Yuh for the outstanding payments seriously undermined the credibility of his claim that he had prepared P64 to comply with Joyce’s instructions because he was afraid of offending Sin Yuh, a VIP customer.
51.       Indeed, I found the Accused’s claim that he did not chase Sin Yuh for payment because it was a VIP customer to be most baffling. This is because the Accused himself admitted that –
a.         He was in-charge of the Sin Yuh account, and was responsible for ensuring collection of full payment for all the machines;
b.         Sin Yuh’s purchase totaling almost $5 million was a huge amount, even for Yamazaki. The Accused’s superior had been keen to ensure that Sin Yuh make prompt payment for all the machines;
c.         He knew of Sin Yuh’s DBS loan application as early as May 2002;
d.         As of December 2002 (the time when P64 was prepared), Sin Yuh had become a ‘huge liability’ to the Accused’s company – Sin Yuh was able to honour only 7 of its 36 cheques presented to Yamazaki for payment, with the last payment being made as long ago as June 2002.
[51]
52.       
Accused’s treatment of purported instructions
: Clearly, Joyce’s purported instructions relating to the allocation of substantial funds involving $1.293 million amongst the 47 machines (some of which had already been subject to hire purchase agreements) were highly significant. Being an experienced Assistant Sales Manager, one would expect the Accused to have requested Joyce to (i) confirm her verbal instructions in writing, (ii) reflect these instructions in some internal record, or at the very least (iii) communicate these instructions to either his boss or the appropriate officers in Yamazaki so that the relevant accounts or records could be updated. Strangely, the Accused did not do any of this. More incredibly, the Accused claimed that he did not have the habit of maintaining records of customer’s instructions in his company’s files.
[52]
53.       It appears from the Accused’s evidence that he was the only person at Yamazaki who was aware of Joyce’s purported decision to ‘allocate’ the funds.
[53]
 
When questioned why did he not inform other colleagues about these instructions, the Accused contended –
Even if I were to inform, no one cared. They only depended on the documentation prepared by myself.
[54]
On the facts, there was of course no documentation prepared by the Accused which recorded Joyce’s purported instructions regarding the re-allocation of funds. I found the Accused’s purported nonchalance at maintaining proper records of client’s instructions to be unbelievable.
54.       
Purported instructions contradicted by Yamazaki’s records
: If Joyce did in fact direct the Accused to ‘reallocate’ funds from Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian towards the 40% deposit payment for the DBS machines, one would have expected Yamazaki’s accounts to reflect these 31 machines as being fully paid once DBS disbursed $1.94 million (constituting 60% of the balance payment) to the company. This was not the case. In fact, 6 months 
after
 DBS had disbursed the loan, the Accused (a) wrote to Joyce (P68) stating that 
based on Yamazaki’s own records
, a substantial amount was 
still outstanding
 for a number of the DBS machines
[55]
 
and (b) requested full payment for these machines.
55.       When confronted with his own letter (P68), the Accused incredibly claimed that the statement of accounts contained therein was not based on Yamazaki’s accounting records:
Q:        Who gave you this statement of account (refers to P68)?
A:         Sin Yuh.
Q:         Joyce gave you this statement of accounts?
A:         Yes, I’ve the ageing report to show, to reflect this statement.   Information given by her to me, how she wanted me to consider the final outstanding on of this statement.
Q:        Did you check this figure with your own accounting figures?
A:         
Definitely not
, because this is the instruction from a customer - amount that they owed us. Based on their information, if not disputed, we will inform this to our accounts later.
Q:         This letter is just to confirm what they told you?
A:         Agree.
Q:         Your cover letter (P68), paragraph 2, “Please note … clearly.” You have not even confirmed this with your own accounts department. Why are you saying that the accounts showed the details clearly?
A:         This confirmation was made through the customer’s ageing report. I wrote this in to confirm what they told us initially.
Q:        If that is your sole purpose of sending P68 to them, why was there a ‘P/S’ stated in P68, “Please be … Bhd.”?
A:         It is normal because this is the final instruction from them. After they have told us the final figure that they owed us, it was normal for us to remind our customers of what they have said.
Suggest: The statement of accounts in this letter are as per what is reflected in Yamazaki’s account as at 30
th
 August 2003.
A:         No.
Suggest: You wrote this letter to Sin Yuh and Zhang Hui to confirm that their accounts reflect the same?
A:         As per the ageing report.
Suggest: At the same time, you wished to assert Yamazaki’s legal rights over the other machines.
A:         This is just a reminder, I don’t know what is legal right
.
[56]
 
(emphasis added)
56.       
Subsequent purported instructions from Joyce to further ‘reallocate’ funds (D4C)
: The Accused claimed that a number of the DBS machines were not fully paid even after the DBS loan disbursement because of subsequent instructions from Joyce to ‘allocate’ part of the DBS funds towards the payment of non-DBS machines. According to the Accused, these instructions were contained in D4C, a letter from Joyce dated 1 April 2003.
[57]
57.       A perusal of D4C immediately reveals that the Accused’s explanation is a sham. In D4C, Joyce had instructed the Accused to use 
only $13,000
 from the $1.94 million DBS disbursement towards payment of machines financed by Tokyo Leasing.
[58]
 
D4C does not help the Accused to account why – according to P68 – 
about $800,000
 of the purchase price of the DBS machines remained unpaid after the loan disbursement.
[59]
58.       According to Mr Manicka, D4C substantiated the Defence case that Joyce had given instructions on the re-allocation of funds when P64 was prepared – 
some 4 months earlier
.
[60]
 
I am unable to see how D4C can reasonably lend any support to such a contention.
59.       Furthermore, if D4C corroborated the Accused’s account that Joyce had instructed on the re-allocation of funds when P64 was prepared, it would have been an important piece of evidence, and one would have expected the Defence to adduce it 
at the outset when the Accused testified
. This was not the case. In fact, Mr Manicka, who had earlier been aware of D4C, apparently saw no real evidential value in that document.
[61]
 
It was 
only after re-examination
, when I sought certain clarifications from the Accused, that he produced D4C.
[62]
 
The manner that the Accused referred to D4C suggested that his evidence concerning that document was simply an 
afterthought
.
60.       
Purported instructions contradicted by Sin Yuh’s records
: Apart from being inconsistent with Yamazaki’s records, I noted that the Accused’s evidence of Joyce’s purported instructions vis-à-vis P64 (Accused’s confirmation letter) was also contradicted by Sin Yuh’s accounting documents. These documents (D4A and P48) showed that 
as of
 
28 February 2003
 (ie about 2 months 
after
 P64 was sent and less than 2 weeks before the loan disbursement), less than 40% of the purchase price for 27 DBS machines
[63]
 
had been paid. This was the position 
from as long ago as 30 November 2002
 (ie about 2 weeks 
before
 P64 was prepared).
[64]
61.       Mr Manicka did not dispute these accounting records but had in fact adduced them as part of the Defence case (D4C). The Accused agreed that with regards to D4A, these records –
a.         showed that a number of the DBS machines were not fully paid up even after the DBS loan disbursement; and
b.         contradicted his claim that Joyce had allegedly instructed him to treat all the monies paid to Yamazaki as constituting the 40% deposit payment for the DBS machines.
[65]
62.       
Proposed settlement of outstanding balance after DBS loan disbursement (P62)
: In fact, it is evident that as early as October 2002 (about 2 months 
before
 
the Accused prepared P64
), Sin Yuh had proceeded on the basis that it was not able to raise the 40% deposit payment required by DBS, and had in P62 (a letter which Sin Yuh sent to Yamazaki) requested that the outstanding amount for the DBS machines (less the anticipated DBS disbursement) be paid over a 5-year period with interest at 4% flat per annum. According to Joyce, it was the Accused who had (a) requested Sin Yuh to prepare P62, and (b) proposed the 5-year instalment plan. The Accused knew that Sin Yuh was not able to make the 40% deposit payment for the DBS machines, and had wanted P62 to show to his boss how Sin Yuh was going to pay Yamazaki the outstanding after the DBS loan disbursement. Joyce testified that Cheong signed the relevant legal documentation in November / December 2002.
[66]
63.       It is pertinent to note that during cross-examination, Mr Manicka did not challenge this aspect of Joyce’s evidence.
[67]
 
Neither did the Accused dispute Joyce’s testimony regarding P62 when he testified during examination-in-chief. It was only during cross-examination that the Accused claimed 
for the first time
 that he had not seen P62 before, and that he did not know that Sin Yuh had requested to pay the outstanding balance by way of installments.
[68]
64.       I am mindful that the letter (P62) was attention to the Accused’s boss, and not to the Accused himself. Nonetheless, I accepted Joyce’s evidence that the Accused had sought P62 from her. It is relevant to note that the Accused was in-charge of Sin Yuh’s account and payment collections from the company. At all material times, Sin Yuh had been late in paying for the Yamazaki machines. Under the circumstances, it is not implausible that the Accused had discussed the issue of outstanding payments with Joyce and sought some confirmation as to how full settlement might be effected. Having observed Joyce testify in court, she impressed me as an honest witness.
[69]
 
In my view, there is no reason why Joyce should wish to falsely implicate the Accused. He was after all merely someone whom she came to know and dealt with in the course of her work at Sin Yuh.
65.       
Accused’s belief that Sin Yuh was entitled to ‘reallocate’ hire purchase funds
: Even if Joyce did instruct the Accused to treat the monies disbursed by Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing as being payment towards 40% of the purchase price of the 31 DBS machines, I agree with DPP Lee that this did not absolve the Accused from the offence of conspiracy to cheat.
[70]
66.       It was the Accused’s case that he had honestly believed that Sin Yuh was entitled to ‘reallocate’ funds from Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing to DBS machines which were not subject to the hire purchase arrangements with these 2 companies. In this regard, section 79 of the Penal Code becomes relevant. That provision states:
Nothing is an offence, which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a 
mistake of fact
 and not by reason of a mistake of law 
in good faith
, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it. (emphasis added)
67.       To succeed on his defence, the Accused must thus prove that when he complied with Joyce’s instructions to ‘reallocate’ funds from Arab-Malaysian and Tokyo Leasing to the 31 DBS machines –
a.         he was justified by law in so doing; or
b.         he, by reason of a 
mistake of fact,
 
in good faith
 believed himself to be justified by law, in doing it.
68.       It is clear that the Accused’s case did not come within para 67(a) above – he was not ‘justified by law’ to represent to DBS in P64 that funds (a) 
from Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian
 (ie $438,000)
[71]
 
(b) disbursed for the sole purpose of financing 
specific machines
[72]
 
were funds 
provided by Sin Yuh
 to pay for the 
31 DBS machines
. I note that in his submissions, Mr Manicka – very rightly – did not pursue this line of defence.
69.       Turning to para 67(b), the Accused also could not argue that he had at the material time made a mistake of fact and had acted in good faith. The phrase ‘good faith’ is defined in section 52 of the Penal Code as follows:
Nothing is said to be done or believed in ‘good faith’ which is done or believed without 
due care and attention
. (emphasis added)
70.       In my view, the Accused did not display the level of ‘due care and attention’ expected of him. Being an Assistant Sales Manager –
a.         who had more than 10 years of working experience,
[73]
b.         who knew about the nature of hire purchase transactions,
[74]
 
and
c.         who knew that Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian had intended their funds to be applied towards the payment of 15 specific machines only,
[75]
I found it inconceivable that he did not suspect that something was amiss when Joyce told him to wrongfully treat the hire purchase funds as payment for a different set of 31 machines.
[76]
 
Any reasonable person would have known that it was inherently improper to manipulate the payment accounts in the manner suggested by Joyce. There was no evidence that the Accused had checked with his superiors in Yamazaki about the propriety of complying with Joyce’s instructions. In fact, he took a cavalier attitude towards the whole matter. According to the Accused, he was only concerned with the gross amount collected for payment of the machines – regardless of whether the funds came from Sin Yuh, Arab-Malaysian or Tokyo Leasing.
[77]
71.       I am of course mindful that the Accused was not a party to the 2 hire purchase agreements and he did not know their full details. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that the Accused knew that what Joyce had told him to do – to ‘reallocate’ the funds from Tokyo Leasing and Arab-Malaysian – was contrary to the general scheme of hire purchase arrangements and grossly improper.
[78]
72.       
Accused acted with dishonest intention
: While
 
Joyce did not explicitly convey to the Accused her intention to cheat DBS at all material times,
[79]
 
he was clearly a party to the cheating scam and had acted with dishonest intention.
73.       Although the Accused could not be expected to understand the intricacies of the DBS loan process, he obviously knew that his confirmation letter (P64) was going to be submitted to DBS, and that the bank would rely on P64 in deciding whether to disburse the loan. It is clear to me that the Accused had prepared P64 to induce DBS to disburse the loan. This disbursement would have enabled the Accused to fulfill his job of ensuring that Yamazaki received the long outstanding payments from Sin Yuh.
74.       The Accused’s inducement was ‘dishonest’, within the meaning of section 24
[80]
 
read with section 23
[81]
 
of the Penal Code, because there was an intention on his part to cause wrongful gain to his company, or alternatively to cause wrongful loss to DBS. He knew that Sin Yuh must show that it had made a 40% deposit payment (amounting to $1.293 million) for the 31 DBS machines before the loan is disbursed.
[82]
 
At the material time however, Sin Yuh had paid only $464,460
[83]
 
for the machines. The Accused must have known that DBS would not disburse the loan had it known that Sin Yuh paid only about 14%
[84]
 
(not 40%) of the purchase price.
Judgement
75.       In discharging its burden of proof, the Prosecution cannot merely point to the inadequacies of the Defence case, for an acquittal could follow either from successfully arguing an affirmative defence, or by casting reasonable doubt over the Prosecution case: 
Ang Kah Kee v PP
 
[2002] 2 SLR 104
; 
Tan Edmund v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 102
, 103; 
Simon Joseph v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 196
, 197; 
Mat v PP
 
[1963] 1 MLJ 263
, 264.
[85]
 
It has been held in
 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
 that –
68. … the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. That standard is impossible to achieve in the vast majority of cases. In almost all cases, there will remain that minutiae of doubt. Witnesses, apparently independent, could have conspired to ""frame"" an accused. Alternatively, an accused could be the victim of some strange, but unfortunate, set of coincidences. The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal.
76.       Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Cheong and Joyce to cheat DBS, and that pursuant to that conspiracy, the Accused had prepared the confirmation letter P64. I further found that DBS had relied on P64 in deciding to disbursement $1.94 million to Yamazaki.
Sentence
Prescribed punishment
77.       The prescribed punishment under section 420 is imprisonment for a term which may extend up to 7 years. The same punishment is prescribed for a charge for abetment by conspiracy under section 109.
Aggravating factors
78.       The Accused had perpetrated a 
fraud on a financial institution
. In my view, deception perpetrated on banks, if treated lightly, can lead to the erosion of public confidence on the banking industry. 
 
79.       I also noted that the Accused 
had 
played an active role
 by supplying Joyce with the necessary supporting document to facilitate the cheating scam, thereby helping
 
Sin Yuh to take a loan that it was in no position to repay. This is shown by the fact that after the $1.94 million was disbursed, Sin Yuh did not make even a single instalment payment to DBS.
80.       As a result of the Accused’s misrepresentation, DBS wrongly disbursed a substantial amount of $1.94 million. The bank was not able to enforce its security over 5 of the machines when Sin Yuh subsequently defaulted on its installment payment and 
suffered huge losses as a result
.
[86]
 
As of 30 April 2005, DBS had suffered a nett loss of 
$1,520,108.47
 on the loan.
[87]
81.       Finally, contrary to Counsel’s submission in mitigation, I found that the 
Accused did not appear to be the least remorseful
.  He refused to accept responsibility for his actions at all times, but had instead weaved a fanciful tale to explain away the incriminating evidence:
 
Trade Facilities Pte Ltd & Ors v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 475
.
  There was no offer of any restitution by him.
Mitigation
82.       I accepted that certain aggravating factors found in other cases of financial fraud such as the use of forged documents were not present in this case. Here, there was in fact a genuine sale and purchase of machinery. In addition, I took into account the Accused’s previous clean record, the fact that he did not profit from the offence, and that DBS had managed to recover $787,159.41.
[88]
Sentencing precedent
83.       In 
PP v Cheong Sing Whee
 
[2005] SGDC 124
, Cheong 
pleaded guilty
 to a charge under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for having engaged in a conspiracy with Joyce and 2 other persons to deceive DBS into believing that Henko Industries Pte Ltd (Henko) had received from Sin Yuh a total of S$1,034,000 as downpayment for 18 machines, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced DBS to deliver 
$1,540,000
 to Henko. A 
second charge
 involving the offence committed by the present Accused was 
taken into consideration
 for the purpose of sentencing. Cheong was sentenced to 
3 years’ imprisonment
.
84.       While the decision in 
Cheong Sing Whee
 is instructive, it is of course not binding on me. After all, Cheong was sentenced for a dissimilar offence. In my view, the Accused was less culpable than the Cheong. Unlike the Accused, Cheong faced 2 charges, and had directly profited from the commission of the offences.
Sentence imposed
85.       After careful consideration, I sentenced the Accused to 20 months’ imprisonment for his role in the cheating scam.
86.       The Accused, being dissatisfied with his conviction and sentence, had appealed on 23 June 2005. He is currently on bail pending appeal.
Post-script
87.       On 19 July 2005, the High Court heard the appeal against sentence by Cheong Sing Whee. His sentence was reduced from 3 years to 2 years: MA 72/2005.

District Judge Wong Peck
Background facts
1
         
 The accused, Aziz Bin Tawil was charged under section 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”) for the offence of having on 25 April 2005 at about 12.44 am, driven motor car SFA 5964J along Mandai Road towards Yishun Avenue 2 at a speed of 127km/h which is a speed in excess of the imposed speed limit of 70km/h for that road.
2
         
 The accused pleaded guilty to the charge by unequivocally admitting to committing the offence and was convicted of the charge he faced. The prosecution informed the Court that the accused had a previous speeding conviction and had been fined $300 on 6 October 2004. This was approximately 6 months prior to the commission of the present offence. The accused admitted to having such a previous conviction for speeding.
Mitigation
3
         
 In mitigation, the accused pleaded that he is a housing agent and that he needs the driving licence for his work. There were no other mitigating factors submitted by the accused for the consideration of the Court.
Sentence by the Court
4
         
 After carefully considering the mitigation plea presented by the accused, I sentenced him to a fine of $1,600 with 16 days’ imprisonment in default and ordered that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes for a period of 3 months from the date of conviction. The accused filed an appeal only against the order of disqualification. He has since paid the fine. I now give my reasons for the sentence imposed on the accused.
5
         
 Section 63(4) of the RTA provides that:
 
 
          
 ‘A person who drives a motor vehicle on a road at a speed exceeding any speed limit imposed by or in exercise of powers conferred by this Act shall be guilty of an offence.’
 
 
          
 As section 63 does not provide the penalty for speeding, such offences are therefore punishable under section 131 (2) of the RTA. Section 131(2) prescribes that:
‘(2) Any person who, under this section or any other provision, is guilty of an offence shall be liable upon conviction, where no special penalty is provided-
(a)
 
 in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months; and
(b) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not
 
 exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.’
6 
         
 The Court has the discretion to impose disqualification orders on offenders upon conviction for speeding offences. Section 42(1) of the RTA states that:
 
 
          
 ‘ A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.’
7
         
 Speeding poses a grave danger to other road users. The importance of promoting road safety in order to protect life and limb cannot be emphasized enough. In my view, the relevant factors to be taken into consideration when
imposing sentence would include the extent of the excessive speed (the more excessive, the more aggravating), the type of motor vehicle (the larger the vehicle, the greater the likelihood of more serious consequences in the event of an accident), the absence or presence of previous convictions or antecedents of similar offences, how recent these convictions or antecedents are and whether there were serious consequences resulting from the excessive speeding.
8 
        
 Turning to the facts of this case, I was alarmed that the accused traveled along Mandai Road at the speed of 127km/h. Such a speed would have exceeded the speed limits of all roads in Singapore including expressways which generally have a speed limit of 80-90km/h. Mandai Road ,not being an expressway, has a speed limit of 70km/h.To travel at such a high speed in the circumstances,
 
 shows a clear and flagrant disregard for the law.
  
 When imposing sentence, I took into account that he was traveling at 
57km/h
 in excess of the legal speed limit. This is 
80% more
 than the permitted speed limit. Such appalling lack of respect and total non-compliance with the law cannot be tolerated.
9
         
 I also took into consideration that the accused had been convicted of a similar offence of speeding barely 6 months prior to the commission of the present offence. For that earlier conviction, he was fined $300. Clearly, a fine alone was of little deterrent effect on the accused as he was caught speeding again 6 months later. This shows that the accused did not learn from his first conviction and exhibited a total lack of remorse for the offence. He is clearly a persistent offender for speeding offences.
10
       
 I note that section 131 (2) of the RTA provides for a maximum imprisonment term of up to 6 months for second offenders. In this case, the
 
mitigating factors are that the accused had pleaded guilty at the first mention, that he was not driving a heavy motor vehicle and that there were no serious consequences arising from the speeding incident. In the circumstances, I do not find an imprisonment term to be appropriate. However, in view of the aggravating factors of this case, I was compelled to exercise my discretion under section 42 of the RTA to impose a disqualification order on the accused. In determining the length of disqualification to impose, I assessed that 3 months of disqualification would be sufficient to send a message to the accused that repeated commission of speeding offences would not be tolerated by the Courts.",2005-07-06 00:00:00,SG District Court

District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim:
1          The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:
DAC 15795/2005 (P1A)
You, Maria Rica Baluyot Alagar, F/37,FIN:G9007692-U are charged that you on the 21
st
 day of April, 2005 at about 7.19 pm at the bus stop in front of Catholic Church of St Theresa at Kampong Bahru,Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the first schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 ,to wit by selling one packet containing 0.61 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain 0.48 gram of Methamphetamine to Woman Corporal Neeta Rai, an officer attached to the Central Narcotics Bureau for $200, without authorization  under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.
The Facts
2          The statement of facts (exhibit A) disclosed the following material facts:
On the 21
st
 of April, 2005 Woman Corporal Neeta Rai, a Central Narcotics Bureau(CNB) officer , posed as a buyer and contacted the accused to buy drugs from her.   The accused then met Corporal Rai at about 7.20 pm at the bus stop in front of the Catholic Church of St Theresa at Kampong Bahru. She sold a packet of crystalline substance believed to be controlled drugs to Corporal Rai for $200. After the transaction was completed, the accused was arrested by a party of CNB officers. The packet was analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and found to contain 0.61 gram of crystalline substance which consisted of 0.48 gram of methamphetamine.  This is a class A controlled drug as listed in the first schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
3          Upon her admission without any qualification of the above facts I convicted the accused on the charge.  The learned prosecutor informed the court that the accused had no related antecedents. However, she had been convicted of offences under the Women’s Charter relating to prostitution and an offence of harbouring an illegal immigrant on the 1
st
 of March, 2001.
Mitigation
4          In mitigation, the accused, a foreign national, and a single mother with a 7 year old child to support, said that she was deeply remorseful for what she had done. She urged the court to impose the minimum sentence and added that she had been remanded since the 23
rd
 of April, 2005, being unable to raise bail.
The Sentence
5
         
 In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused I was mindful of the  fact that the minimum sentence prescribed by the Misuse of Drugs Act for a drug trafficking offence of a Class A drug is mandatory imprisonment for a term of 5 years  and 5 strokes of the cane. Although the accused had prior convictions I regarded her as a first offender as these convictions were not drug related. I took into account too the fact that the weight of the drugs was rather low, being only 0.48 gram and the accused had not protracted matters as she had pleaded guilty, thereby saving the need for a trial. Since there were no other aggravating features, I saw no reason to sentence her to more than the minimum. I therefore sentenced her to the mandatory minimum term of 5 years imprisonment and backdated it to the date of remand which is the 23
rd
 of April, 2005. 
6          Further, I noted that the accused herself in mitigation had urged me to impose the minimum sentence.  It would appear therefore that when the accused pleaded guilty, she understood the nature and consequences of her plea and she was fully aware of the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the law. There is no basis for any sentence lighter or lower than the minimum as provided for under the act.  The accused, being dissatisfied, has now appealed against her sentence. She is currently serving her sentence.",2005-06-29 00:00:00,SG District Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1
         
 On 7 February 2002, a 24-year-old motorcyclist, Leong Weng Keong (“Leong”), was flung off his motorcycle and killed. A taxi driver, 57-year-old Wan Chin Hon (“the accused”) was charged for causing Leong’s death. The charge was brought under s 304(
b
) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The Prosecution’s case was that the accused swerved his motor taxi (bearing registration number SH 1709 R) into Leong’s path, and that he had done so “with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death to [Leong]”. The incident took place at 4.30pm along Lentor Avenue near lamppost 108. Leong was a Malaysian working in Singapore as a CISCO officer. At the material time, he was riding with his girlfriend, Hajar bte Hasan (“Hajar”), as pillion. The accused was driving his hired taxi with a passenger in the left rear passenger seat. The passenger was Neo Yi Yan, then a student in the Nanyang Polytechnic, and presently a regular in the Singapore Navy. At the material time, she was in the taxi on her way to her boyfriend’s home. Initially, the defence, as put to the prosecution witnesses, was that the accused had nothing to do with Leong’s death. He maintained that his taxi did not come into physical contact with Leong or his motorcycle, and that the motorcycle crashed solely because of Leong’s own conduct, of which he was not aware. However, the accused decided to change his plea after the Prosecution had led its material evidence. The essential parts of that evidence are set out as follows.
2
         
 Hajar was the first material witness for the Prosecution. She testified that she was riding as Leong’s pillion along Yishun Avenue 1 before Leong turned right at the junction of Yishun Avenue 1 and Lentor Avenue. She was not aware of any incident of note until the motorcycle made a right turn into Lentor Avenue. She testified that Leong, who had been travelling in the centre lane of the three-lane road suddenly veered to the left. She noticed a taxi and thought that it was probably the taxi that caused Leong to veer suddenly. Leong then became angry and chased after the taxi. She knew, by her close association with Leong, that he was angry with the taxi driver and wanted to ride close so that he can show his displeasure by glaring at the driver until he was satisfied that the driver had acknowledged the wrong done. What transpired after that was, from Hajar’s evidence, as well as that of Neo Yin Yan’s, that the accused disregarded Leong and began racing away from him. That made Leong more determined to catch up with him, and consequently, a high-speed race ensued between the two, during which the accused tried to prevent Leong from overtaking him. Eventually, Leong managed to manoeuvre between the taxi and the kerb. At this time, the taxi was in the rightmost lane. From Hajar’s and Neo Yi Yan’s testimonies, Leong pulled up next to the taxi and both vehicles were at high speed which, according to Neo Yi Yan when she last noted the taxi’s speedometer, was about 90 to100km/h. Leong was revving his motorcycle and staring at the accused. Neo Yi Yan testified that shortly after that, she felt the taxi swerving sharply to the right and then to the left. When she turned to look, she saw that Leong had been flung off his motorcycle. She looked back at the accused and saw that he was observing the wing mirror, and was grinning. Mr Raymond Ng, counsel for the accused, cross-examined Neo Yi Yan on the accuracy and veracity in regard to her evidence about the grin. Evidence of this nature is opinion evidence, the admissibility of which is governed by the Evidence Act, (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). I need not dwell on this point since it was not an issue at trial, save that it ought to be noted that I regard the reaction of a material witness (the accused) to an event to be relevant because it might corroborate or disprove other material evidence such as the state of mind of that person. Evidence of demeanour, such as a grin, needs to be interpreted and submissions made as to the appropriate inference to draw from it; whether it was a look of satisfaction of that person’s vile conduct, or a wry grin drawn from a different sort of satisfaction – such as to say, “serves him right for speeding”. Hajar testified that she saw the taxi veering sharply towards the motorcycle, and she was so frightened that she shut her eyes and screamed. The next thing she knew was that she was flung off the motorcycle. There was scant evidence as to whether the taxi actually collided or even touched the motorcycle, but the Prosecution’s case did not depend on actual contact. On the evidence led, I am satisfied that at the material time, the motorcycle was travelling at high speed, close to the kerb, and the action of the accused caused Leong to lose control of his motorcycle. Neo Yi Yan further testified that immediately after the accused swerved his taxi into the motorcycle’s path, she asked the accused how he could have done such a thing, but he remained impassive. She then asked if he was not going back to help the fallen motorcyclist, and again the accused did not respond to her but continued driving. He stopped some distance away to check his taxi for damage. When he got back into the taxi he told Neo Yi Yan that there was no damage to his taxi, and was about to drive away. At that point Neo Yi Yan realised that he was not going back to where the motorcyclist had fallen. She then got out of the taxi and, after noting the taxi’s registration number, ran back to render assistance at the scene.
3
         
 The accused was charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Culpable homicide is defined in s 299 of the Penal Code in the following terms:
Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or
 
with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death
, commits the offence of culpable homicide. [emphasis added]
The Prosecution’s case was presented on the basis of the limb emphasised above. The question whether the act is likely to cause death invites an objective inquiry, as opposed to a subjective one from the viewpoint of the actor alone. However, the separate, yet intertwined, question, as to whether the accused had knowledge that he was likely by such act to cause death, is a subjective one. It would be helpful to answer the question whether the act was likely to cause death first. From an objective point of view, I would hold that the manoeuvring of a motor car, so as to cause the smaller, more vulnerable, motorcycle to lose control at high speed, is an act that is likely to cause death. The word “
likely”
 means that the act is one that would readily cause an apprehension that death would result, but it does not require the Prosecution to prove that death was imminent, or had in fact been caused. The fact that Leong was killed but his pillion survived illustrated both aspects of this point. In the context, it was not at all remarkable that Leong was killed, but that Hajar survived.
4
         
 The next question relates to whether the accused had the personal knowledge that his act was likely to cause such death. This is relevant because there is no imputed knowledge of this nature in the accused. Had the Defence been put to answer the Prosecution’s case, it would be important to ascertain whether it was the sort of thing a person, in the circumstances of the case, would likely have contemplated or ought to have known so as to provide the contrast against which a subjective denial of such knowledge by the accused could be evaluated. In this case, the cross-examination of the witnesses as to the critical event was based on the defence that the accused had nothing to do with Leong losing control of his motorcycle. This defence would have precluded the accused from asserting that he had swerved his taxi into the path of the motorcycle without the knowledge that it would be likely to cause the death of the motorcyclist. The change of plea by the accused after all the evidence had been led and challenged as much as it could be by his counsel, served as an admission of the subjective element in the words “
with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death
”. Consequently, I accepted his plea and convicted him accordingly.
5
         
 The punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(
b
) is a range of imprisonment that may extend to ten years, or a fine, or both imprisonment and fine. The sentencing of an offender requires a steadfast devotion to two broad principles – the principle that like cases must be treated alike, and that each case must be assessed on its own merits. These principles are more easily stated than applied. In the case of the act of causing death, the law discriminates a number of categories of culpability, and the range of sentences prescribed varies accordingly. The sentence in each case must be assessed according to such considerations as are right, proper, and fair. It is with these considerations in mind that I feel justified in taking into consideration the maximum punishment of two years’ imprisonment for the offence (under s 304A of the Penal Code) of causing death by a rash or negligent act, and comparing that to a case such as the present in which death was caused with the knowledge that the act was likely to result in death. Further, I think that such comparisons are proper only if one is also mindful that the base (minimum sentence) is one day’s jail in each of the two cases, and not that the punishment for a s 304(
b
) offence begins where that in s 304A leaves off, namely, a term of imprisonment of more than two years. It is also important to explain what differentiates the two offences. A person is rash or negligent if he does an act not caring if harm might ensue. For example, a person would be rash if he drove against the flow of traffic even though at the time there was little or no traffic. In short, there was no specific target against which his act was directed. That target or person killed is one that might not, but ought to be, in the contemplation of the accused at the material time. In the present case, the person killed was directly within the contemplation of the accused and he had directed his mind to him. I would think that the present case merits a sentence of more than two years’ imprisonment. I would consider that a sentence of three years would be the appropriate one if there were no other considerations that might require a higher or lower sentence. In this case, I am of the opinion that there were other factors. I shall first consider the defence factors.

 In mitigation, counsel stated that his client is remorseful. A genuine and sincerely felt feeling of remorse, of course, returns a measure of good to the perpetrator, the victim’s family and friends, and also to society. But is the accused more penitent today than he was Monday last week, which was about a year and a half after the offence was committed? It is impossible to test the sincerity of his feelings in present circumstances, but I can accept his expression of regret (which is not nearly the same thing as remorse), and have regard to it, late as it is, together with the other factors that his counsel urged me to take into account, namely his age, his physical frailty and poor health and consider them in the overall circumstances of the case.
7
         
 The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor urged me to impose a sentence that is harsh enough to discourage others from committing this offence. Before proceeding further, I should add that the facts of this case are unusual, and so we may not likely see a proliferation of cases in which a motorist drives another off the road in similar situations. But, the underlying issue in this case is plainly bad behaviour on the road. That is more general, more widespread, and more readily correctible. In so far as bad behaviour is the common ill, that can be taken into account. Otherwise it would be wrong to take unrelated cases into account in the sentencing of the present one, or conversely, to apply a sentence in the present case in order to make a point in another. Culpable homicide cases of intentional violence, such as the knifing cases between persons known to each other, may not provide appropriate comparisons because the circumstances and the cause of death are totally different. However, the two cases cited by the Deputy Public Prosecutor under s 66(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) namely, 
PP v Kwan Yew
 
Hoong Adrian
 
[1999] SGDC 3
 and 
PP v Lim Chin Heng Bernard
 
[2002] SGDC 143
 are useful indicators for the present case. They were also road traffic cases, which resulted in death. In each case, the offender was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment. However, in both cases, the persons killed were friends of the respective accused persons, and death was caused in circumstances that were closer to rash and reckless conduct, and there was an absence of malice. In the present case, whatever else might have been in his mind or, conversely, not in his mind at the material time, the accused swerved his car into the path of the motorcycle knowing that he was likely, by that act, to cause death.
8
         
 I am of the opinion that in spite of the strong submission by Mr Raymond Ng for the accused, there were insufficient grounds to merit a light sentence. The sentence ought to reflect the gravity of this case where a motorist deliberately used his vehicle to endanger the lives of other road users, especially when the latter were in a more vulnerable position. Mr Ng also submitted that it was the motorcyclist’s conduct that precipitated the fatal skirmish at high speed. The evidence did not show that the motorcyclist was the initiator or creator of the bad-tempered situation. On the contrary, the evidence indicated that it was the accused that was the party initially at fault. However provocative the accused found the subsequent revving of the motorcycle engine and the staring by the motorcyclist to be, he was not entitled to respond so dangerously in using the bigger vehicle to drive the smaller one off the road – this is the point that needs emphasis.
9
         
 I am mindful that the type and nature of cases to which s 304(
b
) of the Penal Code applies are extremely varied. Some cases may be less heinous than the present, but it is likely that there are others that are more so. In the circumstances, and even having regard to his age, poor health and physical condition, I sentence the accused to four years’ imprisonment, and further order that he be disqualified from driving all classes of motor vehicles for life. His term of imprisonment shall take effect from 9 July 2004.",2005-07-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

Magistrate May Lucia Mesenas:
1          On 3 June 2005, the Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code Cap. 224. The charge is set out below:
Charge – Exhibit “P1A”
“You, Teo Kiam Meng, male/35 years, NRIC No. S6919441I, are charged that you on 13
th
 day of September 2004 at or about 7.55am, at Ayer Rajah Expressway near to the Normanton Park exit, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Ang Kah Yong, to wit, by punching   the said Any Kah Yong on his right cheek with your left fist, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
Statement of Facts
2          The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (
Exhibit ‘A’
) pertaining to the charge, without qualification.   He was therefore convicted on the charge accordingly. The salient points are as follows:
(a) On 13 September 2004, at about 7.55am, the victim was driving his car bearing registration number SDS 678Y in lane 2 of Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) towards Jurong. The victim’s colleague was sitting in the front passenger seat. At the same time, the accused was driving his car, bearing registration number SDZ 9562B, in between lane 1 and 2 on the said AYE and had cut into the victim’s lane abruptly without switching on his left signal. As such, the victim waved his right palm to the accused, indicating to the accused that he had driven in an inconsiderate manner. Thereafter, the victim resumed his journey.
(b) As the victim was driving on lane 4 along the said AYE towards the Normanton Park exit, the accused overtook the victim from his right and reduced his speed to stop his car, gradually causing the victim to similarly stop his car as well as he was right behind the accused’s car.
(c) The accused alighted from his car and confronted the victim who was still sitting in his car driver seat. The accused challenged the victim to a fight but the victim refused to do so. An argument subsequently broke out between the accused and the victim on the issue of inconsiderate driving. Thereafter, the accused punched the victim on  his right cheek once while the victim was still seated in his car driver’s seat. The victim alighted from the car and called for the police.
(d) As a result of the punch, the victim sustained a swelling (erythema) measuring 1 x 1.5 inches with tenderness on the right mandibular (lower jaw bone) area.
Antecedents and Mitigation
3          The accused did not have any similar convictions or antecedents. His last conviction was for a theft offence under section 379 Penal Code Cap. 224, for which the accused was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,000. This was on 2 November 2002.   Counsel for the defence tendered a written mitigation (
Exhibit “D1”
). The following mitigating factors are highlighted below:
(a)        The accused is having marital problems as his wife had intended to leave him which was also the subject matter of the altercation between him and his wife on the day prior to the incident;
(b)        Consequent to the altercation with his wife at the material time, the accused, whilst driving, was reflecting on his life on how it had ended in a mess, which in turn, caused him to lose concentration, thereby cutting into the victim’s lane;
(c)        The victim had provoked the accused by using his right palm to point at him;
(d)        In addition to the above provocation by the victim, the matter was  further exacerbated by the argument that ensued between the accused and the victim over their inconsiderate driving;
(e)        The punching incident was done on the spur of the moment;
(f)         The victim sustained a minor injury as the punch was not inflicted in a forceful manner;
(g)        The accused has a history of heart problems since 2000, suffers from hypertension and is under medication.
Defence’s submission on sentence
4          Mr Manicka, counsel for the defence, also highlighted in his written mitigation, two case authorities, namely, 
PP v Chua Tian Bok Timothy
 
[2005] SGMC 4
 and 
PP v Goh Eng Hwee
 
[2005] SGMC 7
.
 In 
Chua’s
 case, there was a scuffle and a lot of pushing and grabbing was involved between Chua and the victim. Furthermore, the victim also sustained far more injuries than the present case where the victim was punched only once. The accused claimed trial to the charge of voluntarily causing hurt and was fined $1,000. The prosecution’s appeal against sentence was subsequently dismissed by the High Court. In 
Goh’s
 case, the Magistrate sentenced the accused to two weeks’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of $1,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. Goh   had punched the victim several times on the head and hit the victim’s left eye, as a result of which the victim had sustained lacerations on his face, damage and bruising to the left retina, which necessitated corrective eye surgery to his left eye vision.
5          In light of these two cases cited, and the fact that the victim in the present case sustained a minor injury, counsel urged this Court to impose a fine.  
Prosecution’s submission
6          The prosecution did not submit on sentence and left the matter to the court.
Sentencing Considerations  
7          The punishment prescribed under section 323 Penal Code is a fine up  to  a maximum of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to one year or both. Although each case is to be decided on its merits and individual facts, our courts have generally taken a harsh stand on such cases. It has been reiterated in all road rage cases that there is a strong element of public interest involved where such display of hooliganism on our roads are to be deterred. The present facts of this case   falls under such a category of ‘road bully’ or road rage cases where the learned Chief Justice Yong Pung How in 
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 
[1992] SLR 745
, has laid down very clear pronouncments and guidelines on how such cases would be dealt with by the Courts.:
Violent crimes are one of the curses of our society against which it is the primary duty of the courts to protect the public. This is especially so on a small island like Singapore, where citizens live in close proximity to each other: our daily lives are unavoidably intertwined to some extent, making the preservation of order and harmony all the more important….
8          In 
Lee Seck Hing’s
 case, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to the victim by fracturing his arm, under section 325 Penal Code Cap 224, after the latter had cut into Lee’s lane, for which Lee followed the victim and confronted him when both their cars stopped at the traffic light. On appeal, the accused was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Another charge of criminal intimidation was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.  The learned Chief Justice Yong Pung How made these observations in 
Lee Seck Hing’s
 case, which is fully adopted by this Court:
The court must also be mindful of the need to deter anyone else who would resort with impunity to violence on the roads, especially in view of the deplorable increase in such incidents. Our roads are progressively becoming more crowded each month, as more and more cars add to the traffic, and motorists must simply learn to live with one another. There can be no place on our roads for road bullies. Such persons must be made aware of the severe detestation the law expresses in regard to such crimes. They must not be allowed to go away thinking that they can beat up somebody else on the slightest provocation for the price of a few thousand dollars. If this sort of incidents occur, when they get out of their vehicles and assault others who may have aggravated them by their driving or for any other reason, prison sentences must now follow where the offence is ‘voluntarily causing hurt’ under s 323 of the Code…
9          In the case of  
Ong Hwee Leong v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 794
, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of fisting the victim on his right cheek, after the victim had switched on his headlights to high beam to annoy the appellant, who initially had done the same to the victim. The accused was sentenced to one week imprisonment. The learned Chief Justice Yong Pung How in 
Ong Hwee Leong’s
 case observed the following:
This matter arose from what was certainly a trivial dispute. Such minor incidents occur on our roads many times every day. No doubt they are frustrating to those involved. But if, many times every day on our public roads, everyone were to lose his temper and react to the degree the appellant did, all semblance of order would quickly dissipate and only the most violent would prevail. The perceptible trend in this direction deservedly incurs the courts’ displeasure and must be determinedly discouraged. Drivers must refrain from alighting from their vehicles and assaulting others simply because those others have annoyed them by their driving or in some other way. I therefore adopt unreservedly Lord Land CJ’s view in 
Hassan & Schuller
 that prison sentences ought to follow this sort of incident.
10        References were also made to Rajendran JC’s (as he was then) judgement in 
Fred Khoo Chin Chye v PP
 
(1990) CLAS News No. 6 at page 28 which adopted Lord Lane CJ’s view in R v
 
Hassan; R v Schuller
 (1989) RTR 129, where he stated:
Resorting to violence over trivial traffic matters has been an unpleasant feature on our roads. Such conduct cannot be condoned and the trial judge cannot be faulted for having taken the view that a prison term was called for in order to prevent the accused and other like-minded motorists from committing such offences. I am therefore unable to accede to counsel’s plea that only a fine be imposed.
11        It is also pertinent to note that section 42(2) Road Traffic Act (RTA) Cap. 276, empowers the Court to make disqualification orders, that is, disqualifying the accused from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or a period specified by the court, in addition to the sentence imposed against an accused person, after he has been convicted of an offence under section 323 Penal Code Cap. 224 (or of any of the other offences listed under section 42(2) RTA Cap. 276), provided that the accused was the driver at the material time. With such an enactment, Parliament clearly takes a serious view that the public should be protected from such category of offenders by banning them from driving on our roads.
12        With these sentencing considerations in mind, I now turn to the present facts and circumstances of the case.
Facts of the present case
13        Counsel for the defence had urged this Court to consider imposing a fine on the accused. Notwithstanding the mitigating factors highlighted by counsel, I was not convinced that they amounted to exceptional circumstances which warranted a non-custodial sentence. 
14        The case authorities cited above are clear that such road rage cases would attract a custodial sentence in that a civic society would not be tolerant of violent behaviour which was wholly disproportionate to the trivial incidents that gave rise to the altercation between an accused person and his victim. In deciding the appropriate sentence, I took into account the following undisputed facts which were no doubt aggravating:
(a) The accused was driving between two lanes (lane 1 and 2) on the  AYE and had in fact cut into the victim’s lane without giving prior indication of his intention to change lanes by using his light signal  at the material time;
(b) The accused overtook the victim from his right and had deliberately slowed down his car in front of the victim, with an intention to confront the victim;
(c) The accused challenged the victim to a fight to which the victim refused;
15        Furthermore, counsel submitted that it was the victim who provoked the accused by using his right hand signalling to the accused that he was driving in an inconsiderate manner. Contrary to this, I am of the view that it was the accused himself, who was driving in an inconsiderate manner, as by his own admission, he had in fact, switched lanes without signalling to other road users his intention to do so (especially to the car behind him which was driven by the victim, at the material time). The victim was merely displaying his annoyance at the accused (by pointing his right palm at the accused) which was not only natural for any road user in the given circumstances, but also not unreasonable. Clearly, the accused’s perception that the victim had provoked him was misconceived and thus bore no mitigating value at all. Even if I were to accept that the victim’s action of pointing his right palm at the accused amounted to provocation, the accused’s subsequent reaction was totally disproportionate to what the victim had done, and for which specific deterrence must be factored into the sentence to ensure that the accused does not get the wrong impression that he can get away with such behaviour by merely paying a fine.
16        The accused had also deliberately confronted the victim even after the latter continued his journey on the AYE and as far as the victim was concerned, he had laid the matter to rest and merely wanted to get on with his journey. Alas, the accused, instead of apologising to the victim for his inconsiderate driving, had in actual fact, stopped his car and got into an argument with the victim, purportedly over who was driving inconsiderately. At that point in time, the accused even had the audacity to challenge the victim to a fight which the victim flatly refused. It would appear that the accused, unsatisfied that the victim was unwilling to take up the challenge, then threw a punch at the victim, whom I am of the view, had not provoked the accused at all during this entire episode. The accused’s wanton expression of violence in response to the victim’s refusal to fight with him was wholly unreasonable and patently deplorable, for which greater culpability should be attributed to the accused who was clearly the aggressor in the present case.  
17        Counsel also submitted that the accused had a lot on his mind at the material time, in particular, he had an altercation with his wife who expressed an intention to leave him on that very morning prior to the incident, which caused him to lose concentration while driving. Whilst the accused may have been pre-occupied with his personal problems at the material time, nonetheless, this should not excuse the accused from acting the way he did, which is to vent his anger and frustration on a fellow road user who, did not in any way contribute to what the accused may have perceived to have been inconsiderate driving. The accused’s inability to cope with the stresses of his personal life which caused him to inflict  violence on an innocent victim was not a mitigating factor in the circumstances and the accused’s violent outburst certainly cannot be condoned by this Court.
18        In addition, the fact that the incident had occurred in the spur of the moment, would in my view, carry little mitigating value. Such cases where violence is resorted due to a traffic collision or road dispute would in any event occur in the heat of the moment, where the accused person would have momentarily lost control due to the circumstances at hand. However, I would hasten to add that it would still not excuse or exonerate an accused person from his actions of losing his temper and using violence to vent his frustration on the victim, for to do so, would give rise to utter chaos on our roads where the safety of our road users should at no time be compromised.    
19        Counsel cited two cases namely, 
PP v Chua Tian Bok Timothy
 (
supra
) and 
PP v Goh Eng Hwee
 (
supra
). It must be noted that in 
Chua Tian Bok Timothy v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 514
, where the accused appealed against the trial court’s decision in withholding his consent to the composition of an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code Cap. 224, the learned Chief Justice Yong Pung How had ruled that the trial Magistrate was correct in withholding her consent to composition and reiterated that there was a public interest element in road rage cases:
While I agreed that each case should be decided on its own facts, I could not agree that this case should be treated differently from other road rage cases and that the public interest element be overlooked. The petitioner was not entitled to go around attacking others and reacting in such a violent manner merely because he claimed that he was traumatised after a near fatal accident.
20        By analogy, such category of road rage cases are viewed seriously and to this end, it is clear that the sentencing policy for such cases would have to take into account the strong element of the public interest which has to be protected. The trial Magistrate in 
Chua’s
 case was mindful of all these considerations but decided on imposing a fine based on “…
exceptional
 facts: the seriousness of the traffic accident which provoked his momentarily outburst of violence, his prompt attempts to right his wrong, his show of genuine remorse and his previous good conduct.”
21        It must be noted that all the above circumstances are clearly absent in the present case. No road accident or collision had occurred between the accused’s and victim’s cars at the material time. There were no attempts by the accused to apologise to the victim on the day in question, that is, 13 September 2004 till to date, which is some nine months after the event. Neither was there evidence of previous good conduct of the accused shown to this Court. Given the dissimilar facts between 
Chua’s
 case and the present, it would necessarily follow that the sentencing outcome in this case could not be the same as that in 
Chua’s
 case.
22        In 
Goh Eng Hwee’s
 (
supra
) case, the learned Magistrate had distinguished his case from that of 
Chua’s
 case in that the victim in 
Goh’s
 case had sustained more serious injuries for which he sentenced Goh to two weeks’ imprisonment and to pay a fine of $1,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. It is pertinent to note that he also added in his judgment, (which was referred by counsel), that the sentence is “on the lenient side” despite the serious injuries sustained by the victim. Given that the injury sustained by the victim in the present case was not so serious as that in 
Goh’s
 case, I took this into account as reflected in the sentence I imposed subsequently.
23        As reiterated above in the preceding paragraphs, the sentencing policy for road rage cases has not differed and each case has to be decided on its own merits. I now turn to previous case authorities whose facts are similar to the present, where the accused was the sole aggressor and the victim, a passive recipient of the accused’s violent outburst, for guidance on the range of sentences imposed. For such cases where the physical injuries are not serious, and that there was no form of provocation from the victim, it would appear that the sentences range from one month to three months’ imprisonment.
24        In 
PP v Koh Seng Koon MA
 369/2000, the dispute arose over a parking incident where the accused, who subsequently took over the wheel, eventually reversed the car in the parking-lot when his friend could not do so initially as the victim’s taxi was blocking it. The accused went over to the victim’s taxi, opened the driver’s door and punched the victim once on the right cheek. The victim sustained a swelling of about 2-cm in diameter on his right cheek. After the trial, the accused was fined $1,000, in default one months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence was enhanced to one month’s imprisonment and the fine of $1,000 refunded to the accused.
25        In 
Goh Ling Beng & Anor v PP
 MA 247/93, the accused B1 was driving his motor lorry behind the victim’s cement-mixer truck when he cut into the victim’s lane resulting in a collision. B1 and his passenger, accused B2, got out of the vehicle and fisted the victim in the face and body. The victim sustained lacerations on the mouth and ear and scratches on his chest and arms. After the plea of guilt, each of the accused persons was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment. The appeal against sentence was subsequently dismissed.
26        In the recent case of 
PP v Ong Eng Chong
 
[2004] SGMC 14
, the accused pleaded guilty after a four-day trial, to a charge of punching and kicking the victim, following a collision between the accused’s and victim’s cars. The victim wanted to drive off but was stopped by the accused, who continued to block him from getting access to his car despite the victim’s pleas. In an attempt to enter his car, the victim pushed the accused once on the neck. Subsequently the accused threw a punch at the victim, which caused him to fall to the ground. The accused continued to assault the victim by kicking and punching even after the victim fell to the ground. The victim sustained weals over both hands, left shoulder blade and the right side of his body. He also sustained a linear bruise over his left eyebrow. The trial Magistrate imposed a 10-week imprisonment term which was reduced to four weeks after the appeal was heard in the High Court.  
27        In 
Lim Kian Heng v PP
 (MA 180 of 2004, unreported), a dispute arose out of a traffic incident where the accused had unsuccessfully tried to overtake the victim. When the victim stopped her taxi to pick up a passenger, the accused confronted her and punched her once on her right arm.  The victim suffered mild tenderness of about 5cm on her right arm.  The accused was convicted after trial and sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt.
28        In 
Neo Ner v PP
 MA 113/2000, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under section 323 Penal Code, Cap 224, arising from a dispute on the road. The offender alighted from his car and moved to the victim’s car. When the victim opened his car door to get out, the offender slammed the door in the victim’s face causing him to sustain a 1-cm superficial laceration on his cheek and a 3-cm laceration on the back of his head. The accused was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.
Conclusion
29        Having considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, public policy clearly outweighed the individual’s interest and necessitated an appropriate custodial term. This was clearly stated in the preceding paragraphs by the learned Chief Justice Yong Pung How in previous cases concerning violence displayed on the roads consequent to road traffic disputes or accidents.
30        Thus, in deciding the appropriate term of imprisonment, I took into account the fact that the accused was a first offender for such offences and that he had also pleaded guilty to the charge, thus saving much time and resources for this Court. I was also mindful of the injury sustained by the victim which was minor.  There was also no sustained period of violence displayed [
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 (
supra)
, 
Ng Boon Teck v PP
 MA 99/2004, 
PP v Ong Eng Chong
 MA 174/2004] and neither were weapons or objects used by the accused [
Chai Thiam Choi v PP
 MA 225/92 (unreported), 
Neo Ner v PP
 (
supra
)]. After careful consideration of the present facts and case authorities highlighted above, I sentenced the accused to two weeks’ imprisonment which, on hindsight, would appear to be lenient in the circumstances, especially since there was no provocation on the part of the victim.
31        Dissatisfied with the custodial sentence, the accused, lodged a Notice of Appeal immediately after the sentence was imposed on 3 June 2005 and he has been on bail pending appeal since that date.
The Accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.",2005-06-08 00:00:00,SG Magistrates' Court

Lai Kew Chai J:
1          The central issue of fact in this action is whether the first defendant, 
ie
, SL Link Co Ltd (“SL Link”), is a party to a manufacturing agreement, as asserted by the plaintiffs, or Solar Link Co Ltd, as asserted by the defendants.
2          The party which on the face of the manufacturing agreement had entered into the agreement with the first plaintiff was “Solar Link Co Ltd” which, according to the defendants, was registered in Taiwan as
 
追日润工科技股份
 
有限公司
 (
Zhui Ri Run Gong Ke Ji Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) bearing Taiwanese company registration no 16991864 on 18 November 1999.
3          On the face of the agreement, therefore, SL Link is not a party to the agreement. SL Link is a company incorporated in Taiwan. It was incorporated in February 2001. As it is a company incorporated in Taiwan, it is known only by its Chinese name in Taiwan. It would have been conclusively identified if it had been correctly identified by its Chinese name and by its company registration number issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs. Its Taiwanese registration number was RC No 12737841. Its name in Chinese is

(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si).
4          The dispute as to the identity of the party to the agreement with the first plaintiff had come about because the first defendant was not identified in the agreement either by its name in Chinese or by its registration number. It was simply identified as “Solar Link Co Ltd” of a certain address, which was shared by SL Link.
5          There are several other issues which have to be determined should SL Link be found to be a party to the agreement. The first such issue is whether SL Link has breached its obligations under the agreement. The second issue is whether cl 7 of the agreement providing for non-competition is enforceable. Thirdly, have both defendants breached their duty of confidence owed to the plaintiffs? Fourthly, had both defendants conspired to cause harm to the plaintiffs and/or alternatively, had the second defendant induced SL Link to breach its obligations under the agreement? Fifthly, as alleged by the defendants, had the first plaintiff entered into the agreement in bad faith? Sixthly, the defendants raised the issue whether one Alex Wang, who had signed the agreement for ostensibly “Solar Link Co Ltd”, had the authority to enter into the contract on behalf of SL Link. Finally, the issue arises whether the defendants are entitled to counterclaim for damages against the plaintiffs for allegedly causing them loss.
The facts
6          The following facts were established by the evidence led. For the plaintiffs, the evidence was given in the main by Cheng Sui Yoong (“Mr Cheng”), the managing director of both plaintiffs. He was at all material times in charge of the operations of the Advantest Group in Southeast Asia. Mr Wang Ching Dong Alex William (“Mr Alex Wang”) gave the bulk of the evidence on behalf of the defendants. He was founder of Solar Link Co Ltd in Taiwan, registration number 16991864, whose Chinese name is as stated above at [2]. He was the substantial shareholder of the company and was the general manager from 1999 to 2004. This company’s main business was in the manufacture of an “interface” between the tester machine and the chips to be tested. But it was in liquidation before the manufacturing agreement was signed.
7          Based on Mr Cheng’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, which is not disputed, the plaintiffs are part of the Advantest Group of companies (“Advantest”) which has its headquarters in Japan. Advantest was the largest supplier of automatic test systems in the world in 2003. It had a 30% market share. Some of Advantest’s customers include big names in the semiconductor industry such as AMD, Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte Ltd (“MSA”), Motorola, NEC, ST Micro-electronics and Infineon Technologies Sdn Bhd.
8          Automatic test systems are used to test the functionality of integrated circuit chips (“IC chips”). The test system produced by Advantest consists of three main components, namely the test system, the handler and the device interface. The test system consists of computers designed to create and simulate different conditions to test the IC chips. The handler is a mechanism which places the IC chips into the device interface (known as “Hi-Fix”) which is connected to the test system. Hi-Fix is a form of adaptor between the test system and the IC chips. In parenthesis, it may be noted that the Hi-Fix together with the other accessories of the test system are known as the “tooling”. By applying a different Hi-Fix, different types of IC chips can be tested on the same test system.
9          Advantest is divided into three main regional groups, namely, Advantest America, Advantest Europe and Advantest Asia. Advantest Asia (the second plaintiff) is a holding company for all of the Advantest wholly-owned subsidiary companies in Asia, amongst which are Advantest Taiwan Incorporated (“ATI”) and Advantest Korea. They are autonomous and are run by their own managing directors. In 2001, ATI started a new subsidiary, Advantest Taiwan Engineering Incorporated (“ATEI”) which is involved in the manufacture of tooling such as Hi-Fix. ATI is the majority shareholder of ATEI, holding more than 50% of the shares in ATEI. Advantest companies do on occasion subcontract work to local companies in Taiwan, Korea and Singapore to assemble and solder some parts of the equipment required by their customers.
10        I turn to the history of SL Link. In 2001, SL Link was incorporated in Taiwan. Mr Alex Wang was part of the mind and management of this company. The name was used to benefit from what he alleged was the substantial goodwill of the name “Solar Link”. In capitalising on the reputation of Solar Link Co Ltd, it was important, in the interest of fair dealing, for Mr Alex Wang to ensure that the two companies, namely Solar Link Ltd and SL Link, were kept distinct and separate so that foreign parties negotiating with him, wearing different hats, did not confuse one for the other. This was especially necessary, seeing that companies in Taiwan are identified by their Chinese names and by their registration numbers. In a perfect world, of course, such foreign parties or those professionally acting for them could have made an official search at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, to ensure that any agreement is entered into with the right corporate party by stating a party’s name in Chinese and its registration number.
11        Mr Alex Wang found some investors, who were interested in Solar Link Co Ltd’s technology, to invest in SL Link. From February 2001 to October 2002, he was the general manager of SL Link. He was also a director until he resigned as director on or about 22 August 2003.
12        SL Link is involved in the Taiwanese local market in the soldering business. In contrast, Solar Link Co Ltd was in liquidation at all material times.
13        Mr Cheng gave evidence of his first contact with SL Link. SL Link was previously known as “
追日润工企业设
” 
(Zhui Ri Run Gong Qi Ye She). It also referred to itself as “Solar Link” in English. Sometime in February 2001, SL Link sent a memo to all its customers (including ATI) informing them that it had changed its name to its present name,
 
追日润股份有限公司
 
(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si). I refer to an instance where SL Link had referred to itself as “Solar Link Co Ltd”. In November 2000, ATI entered into a contract with SL Link (“the Taiwanese Agreement”) for it to assemble for ATI tooling such as Advantest’s T5581 and T53xx test systems. SL Link provided a quotation in October 2001. Its Mandarin name, “
追日润股份有限公司
” 
(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) was set out in large font while its English name, “Solar Link Co Ltd” was set out in much smaller font. The company registration was stated on the quotation as “12737841” which has always been its identification number. The address stated in the quotation was “2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City”, which up to 22 July 2002 has been the address of SL Link.
14        I therefore accept the evidence of Mr Cheng, a Malaysian comfortable with Mandarin, that in his mind SL Link was known as “
追日润股份有限公司
” 
in Mandarin and “Solar Link Co Ltd” in English. He said that before August 2003 he had never heard of a company named “SL Link Co Ltd” or a company named “
追日润工科技股份有限公司
” (Zhui Ri Run Gong Ke Ji Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si).
15        I refer to the Taiwanese Agreement. ATI entered into a contract with SL Link who was then known as “
追日润工企业社
” 
(Zhui Ri Run Gong Qi Ye She) in November 2000 for the latter to assemble tooling such as Advantest’s T5581 and T53xx test systems. SL Link could not, under the Taiwanese Agreement, solicit Advantest’s customers without prior approval from ATI.
16        In October 2001, Mr Cheng learned from his colleagues from ATI that MSA had placed a purchase order for five sets of Hi-Fix with SL Link. MSA had previously always ordered its Hi-Fix from the first plaintiff. He was concerned that SL Link did not seek the consent of ATI when it solicited the order from MSA, as it was obliged to do under the Taiwanese Agreement.
17        Since MSA appeared satisfied with the quality of SL Link’s work, and eschewing confrontation, Mr Cheng decided that the first plaintiff should co-operate with SL Link. He decided to engage SL Link as a subcontractor of the first plaintiff, to assemble and manufacture Hi-Fix sets for the first plaintiff to on-sell to its customers. He contacted Mr L A Tang of the second defendant whom he knew. Mr Tang arranged for Mr Alex Wang to meet Mr Cheng in Singapore.
18        The meeting took place on 28 November 2001 at the first plaintiff’s office at Alexandra Technopark. As Mr Alex Wang is Taiwanese, Mr Cheng spoke to him in Mandarin. Mr Alex Wang introduced himself as the general manager of
 
追日润股份有限公司
 (
Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) or SL Link. He also handed Mr Cheng a name card which showed SL Link’s English name as “Solar Link Co Ltd” on the one side while the other side described SL Link’s Mandarin name as
 
追日润股份有限公司
 
(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si). The address on the name card was 2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City.
19        The meeting was fruitful. On 4 December 2001, Mr Cheng sent a proposal. Mr Alex Wang replied on the following day accepting the proposal. On 11 December 2001, they signed a memorandum of understanding in broad terms confirming the co-operation.
20        In January 2002, Mr Cheng flew with his colleague, Mr Kenneth Ng, to Taiwan and met with their colleagues from ATI and ATEI and with Mr Alex Wang to further discuss Advantest’s co-operation with SL Link. While in Taiwan, Mr Alex Wang invited Mr Ng and Mr Cheng to visit SL Link’s office and factory. Mr Cheng was introduced to a Mr Roger Lo, one of SL Link’s managers and Mr Vincent Lo. They gave Mr Cheng their name cards which, like the name card of Mr Alex Wang, showed SL Link’s Mandarin name as
 
追日润股份有限公司
 
(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) on one side and described the company’s English name, “Solar Link Co Ltd” on the other side. The address on these cards was 2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City.
21        I turn to the explanation of Mr Alex Wang about the names on the name cards. His evidence is that during “the transition period, for convenience (instead of carrying multiple cards), [he] carried name cards bearing the name of SL Link Co Ltd in Mandarin on one side, and Solar Link Co Ltd in English on the reverse side. This is because SL Link Co Ltd’s business was in Taiwan, and Solar Link Co Ltd was dealing in overseas market. As Solar Link Co Ltd was in liquidation, [he] used the address, telephone number and registration number of SL Link Co Ltd for ease of contact”.
22        SL Link, ATEI and the first plaintiff then arranged to meet MSA. They gave MSA a presentation on a proposal where the design interface department of Advantest Japan would manufacture and design high-end Hi-Fix sets for Advantest’s latest models such as the T5593 and T5585 series of testers. During the presentation, SL Link was referred to as “Solar Link Co Ltd”. ATEI could subcontract the assembly and soldering of these high-end Hi-Fix sets to SL Link. SL Link could be engaged to assemble and solder Hi-Fix sets for older model Advantest test sets such as T5581 and T53xx. MSA would still issue the purchase orders to the first plaintiff who would then issue a purchase order to SL Link.
23        Mr Cheng continued to describe the developments between the first plaintiff and SL Link. Based on the understanding, according to Mr Cheng, ATEI and SL Link entered into an appointment agreement on 1 February 2002 (“the Appointment Agreement”). The Appointment Agreement was drafted in Mandarin and SL Link’s Mandarin name as stated above (Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) was used by ATEI to describe SL Link. The Appointment Agreement was signed by Ms Luo Wen Ling, who was the chairperson of SL Link’s board of directors as well as Mr Alex Wang’s wife. In the Appointment Agreement, the address of SL Link was stated to be 2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan.
24        The first plaintiff continued to negotiate with SL Link and entered into a manufacturing service agreement with SL Link on 12 March 2002 (“the Manufacturing Agreement”). The Manufacturing Agreement was drafted in English. As SL Link also referred to itself as “Solar Link Co Ltd”, the first plaintiff used “Solar Link Co Ltd” to denote SL Link in the Manufacturing Agreement. In the Manufacturing Agreement, the address of SL Link was stated to be 2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan.
25        In my view, it is noteworthy that both the Appointment Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement arose from the MSA presentation in which SL Link participated in its Mandarin name. Also noteworthy is the fact that Solar Link Co Ltd was in liquidation at all material times. Such a company would only transact to dispose of its assets and I am convinced that such a company is not permitted under Taiwanese law to undertake the manufacture, assembly and supply of Hi-Fix sets over a period of three years.
26        According to the evidence of Mr Cheng, which I accept, Mr Alex Wang had always traded and represented to him that the English name of SL Link was “Solar Link Co Ltd”. The first plaintiff therefore described SL Link as “Solar Link Co Ltd”.
The manufacturing agreement
27        Under the Manufacturing Agreement, it would be recalled, SL Link was to assemble and sell the products, 
ie
 the Hi-Fix sets, to the first plaintiff who would purchase the products. The first plaintiff would then on-sell the products to the eventual customer. SL Link also undertook in cl 2 of the Manufacturing Agreement that it and its agents would:
2.2.1     not directly or indirectly supply, sell, market, promote or distribute the Products or any other goods to any other person whether for use or resale or appoint a representative anywhere in the Restricted Territory (i.e. any country, the world over) without the prior written consent of the Company (i.e. the plaintiff) (such consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the Company);
2.2.2     not solicit any business from or enter into any business relationship with any existing or potential Customer without prior written consent of the Company (such consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the Company);
2.2.3     not engage in any business with any other person without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the company); …
28        SL Link further irrevocably and unconditionally covenanted in cl 7 that it and its agents would not at any time while the Manufacturing Agreement was in force and for three years thereafter, whether or not the Manufacturing Agreement had been terminated by the first plaintiff or otherwise:
7.1.1     be directly or indirectly engaged or concerned in (whether as an agent, independent contractor or otherwise) the conduct of any business competing directly or indirectly with the Affected Business within the Territory;
7.1.2     carry on for its own account either alone or in partnership or be concerned as a director or shareholder in any company engaged in any business competing directly or indirectly with the Affected Business within the Territory;
7.1.3     assist any person, firm or company with technical advice in relation to any business competing directly or indirectly with the Affected Business within the Territory;
7.1.4     solicit or entice away or attempt to solicit or entice away from the Company or any other Advantest Group Company any person, firm, company or organisation who shall at any time have been a customer, client, distributor or agent of the Company or any other Advantest Group Company or in the habit of dealing with the Company or any other Advantest Group Company;
…
7.1.6     in relation to any trade, business or company, use any name in such a way as to be capable of or likely to be confused with the name of the Company or any other Advantest Group Company and shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that no such name shall be used by any person, firm or company;
7.1.7     assist with technical advice any person, firm or company engaged in manufacture and/or marketing of any product(s) or service(s) in competition with the Company or any other Advantest Group Company which is likely to involve the disclosure or use by the Manufacturing Service Provider of trade secrets of the Company or any other Advantest Group Company; and
7.1.8     otherwise be interested, directly or indirectly, in any business competing with the Affected Business within the Territory;
…
29        Confidential information is defined at cl 8 of the Manufacturing Agreement as follows:
8.1        The Manufacturing Service Provider (i.e. SL Link) hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees and undertakes to the Company and the other Advantest Group Companies, and undertakes to procure its Agents (collectively referred to as “
Recipients
”) to preserve and maintain in utmost confidence all Confidential Information and use the Confidential Information only in the performance of its obligations in accordance with this Agreement.
…
8.5        Except to the extent if such information is public knowledge or becomes public knowledge other than by breach of the provisions of this Agreement, “
Confidential Information
” shall mean for the purposes of this Agreement:
…
8.5.2     information from time to time in the possession or custody of the Company (i.e. the plaintiff), or any other Advantest Group Company belonging to its customers or other users of services from time to time provided by the Company, including without limitation the names of customers;
...
30        The anti-competition and confidentiality clauses were added to protect Advantest’s technology, technical expertise, trade secrets and confidential information which ATI through its Taiwanese companies had or might have passed to SL Link to facilitate their assembly process. Socket files of some of Advantest’s customers and the circuit diagrams of a Hi-Fix for the Advantest T5585 test programs were furnished to SL Link. Socket files are documents containing information of customers. The socket files enabled SL Link to wire the sockets to the respective tester pins allowing the sockets to be compatible and able to interface Advantest’s customers’ (such as MSA’s) devices such as memory chips. The socket is an essential component of the Hi-Fix product as it is the interface between the customer’s device and the Hi-Fix product.
31        On or about 18 March 2002 SL Link provided the first plaintiff with a quotation for a full set of Hi-Fix at S$43,500. The quotation was issued in the English name of “Solar Link Co Ltd.” The first plaintiff ordered two full sets of Hi-Fix in order to supply them to MSA, one of Advantest’s major customers. The goods were supplied to the first plaintiff. Again, the invoice was issued under the English name of “Solar Link Co Ltd”. However, a Government Uniform Invoice chop was affixed on the invoice with SL Link’s Mandarin name
 
追日润
 
股份有限公司
 
(Zhui Ri Run Gu Fen You Xian Gong Si) and its registration no 12737841 stamped on the invoice. Its address was stated as “2F, No 64 Kuang Hua Street, Hsin-Chu City” which is the address of SL Link set out in both the Appointment Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement.
32        In breach of the Manufacturing Agreement, SL Link solicited business from MSA by providing MSA with a quotation for Hi-Fix sets on or about October 2002. As admitted by Mr Tang of the second defendant, SL Link was in the process of “negotiating a large order of US$3m with Advantest’s [customers]”. Both Mr Wang and Mr Tang had informed MSA that the Manufacturing Agreement was no longer binding on SL Link and that both defendants were free to deal with the customers of Advantest.
33        The benefits of the Manufacturing Agreement were assigned to the second plaintiff on or about 1 October 2003. Notice of the assignment was said to have been given by the first plaintiff but the defendants allege that they did not receive notice of the assignment. As both the plaintiffs are in any event parties in this action, nothing would turn on the issue whether notice was given or not.
Findings
34        In the light of the facts established by the evidence, I am satisfied that the first plaintiff had entered into the Manufacturing Agreement with SL Link.
35        On the issue whether SL Link had breached the Manufacturing Agreement, I find that it had breached the agreement on two occasions. It provided MSA with the equipment, as stated earlier, in the knowledge that it was for a project which the first plaintiff had tried to secure. Secondly, on the evidence, both defendants through their employees approached and solicited business from MSA and Infineon (M) Berhad, both customers of Advantest.
36        I turn to the questions whether the first plaintiff had entered into the Manufacturing Agreement in good faith and whether Mr Alex Wang had the authority to enter into the Manufacturing Agreement on behalf of SL Link. SL Link alleged that the Hi-Fix market in Singapore was worth US$20m but the first plaintiff only gave SL Link an order of two Hi-Fix sets worth US$85,000. The defendants have not led any evidence that the Singapore market for Hi-Fix sets was worth US$20m. The Manufacturing Agreement does not provide for any minimum orders to be given to the defendants. The first plaintiff was obliged to give priority to SL Link in respect of the supply of one type of Hi-Fix, namely T5581. Notwithstanding the priority, factors such as competitiveness of the product price and lead-time could be taken into account. In truth and in fact, what happened was that between March 2002 when the agreement was signed and October 2002 when it was breached, the first plaintiff received only one order of the T5581 Hi-Fix, which was in respect of the order for two Hi-Fix sets the first plaintiff had placed with SL Link for US$85,000.
37        The defendants put forward the alternative argument that SL Link was not bound by the Manufacturing Agreement because Mr Alex Wang was not authorised by SL Link. Mr Alex Wang had earlier personally negotiated the Appointment Agreement. He admitted that the chairperson of SL Link, Ms Luo Wen Ling (his wife), was not involved in those negotiations. She was in court throughout the entire hearing but she did not give any evidence to say that only she as the chairperson of SL Link was authorised to sign the Manufacturing Agreement. Mr Alex Wang was the general manager of SL Link. SL Link had held out Mr Alex Wang as the person in charge.
38        Further, assuming that Mr Alex Wang had no authority to enter into the Manufacturing Agreement on behalf of SL Link, the first plaintiff did not know this. It was never put to Mr Cheng that the first plaintiff had this knowledge. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence that under Taiwanese law, a general manager is presumed to have the power and authority to act on behalf of the company. As Mr Alex Wang was the general manager of SL Link, unless the first plaintiff had knowledge that he was not authorised to act on behalf of SL Link (of which there was not an iota of evidence), the alleged lack of authority of Mr Alex Wang cannot be a defence against a claim by the plaintiffs under Art 36 of the Taiwanese Company Law of 2001 and Art 169 of the Taiwanese Civil Code 2000.
39        The defendants have also put in issue the enforceability of the non-competition clause (cl 7) of the Manufacturing Agreement. They assert that the terms contained in the Manufacturing Agreement restricted or prevented Solar Link Co Ltd or SL Link from doing business with others with no promise of any minimum orders in return. Clauses 7 and 8, they contend, are unnecessarily wide and they extend beyond protecting the Advantest’s business or alleged confidential information. The defendants further allege that the first plaintiff has tried to use the Manufacturing Agreement to stifle competition and to prevent Solar Link Co Ltd and the two defendants from competing with Advantest. I am unable to accept these contentions. By the clauses the first plaintiff seeks to protect the legitimate interests of Advantest, which had invested heavily in its technology. The fact of the matter is that the first plaintiff had given the defendants confidential information contained in the socket files and the circuit diagrams.
40        Admittedly, cl 7 is a non-competition clause. However, in my view, it only restricts or prevents the defendants from doing business which is in competition with Advantest. It is not a blanket restriction.
41        In my view, SL Link is bound by cl 7. The contract between the first plaintiff and SL Link should not be re-written. In 
Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Harper’s Garage (Stourport) Ltd
 
[1968] AC 269
, Lord Pearce said at 323:
If a man wishes to tie himself for his own good commercial reasons to a particular supplier or customer it may be no kindness to him to subject his contract to the arbitrary rule that the courts will always reserve to him a right to go back on his bargain if the court thinks fit. For such a reservation prevents the honest man from getting full value for the tie which he intends, in spite of any reservations imposed by the courts, to honour. And it may enable a less honest man to keep the fruits of a bargain from which he afterwards resiles. … Where there are no circumstances of oppression, the court should tread warily in substituting its own views for those of current commerce generally and the contracting parties in particular. For that reason, I consider that the courts require on such a matter full guidance from evidence of all the surrounding circumstances and of relevant commercial practice.
42        Next, I deal with the issue whether the defendants had breached their duty of confidence owed to the first plaintiff. The first plaintiff has shown that ATEI and/or ATI had provided SL Link with the circuit programs (which are the instructional manuals or specifications of the Hi-Fix for the Advantest T5585 test system) and socket files of some of Advantest’s customers. Socket files are documents that contain information of the customer. The defendants required these in order to be able to wire the sockets to respective tester pins allowing these pins to be compatible and able to interface with the plaintiffs’ customers’ devices. Clearly, these sockets are an essential component of the Hi-Fix product as they are the interface between the customers’ device and the Hi-Fix product.
43        The defendants argue that they do not require confidential information from the plaintiffs and assert that they are selling a patented product. They claim that they have registered and obtained a patent for a universal Hi-Fix product. This was later clarified to be a universal “inter-facer”, which the defendants allege, is a “key component of the Hi-Fix Product” and not a “universal Hi-Fix product”. I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that the defendants’ alleged patent is only a small component in the Hi-Fix product. The plaintiffs all along had managed without this universal “inter-facer”.
44        I agree with the plaintiffs’ assertion that if any breach of confidentiality continues, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable damage. The defendants must be prevented from using the first plaintiff’s confidential information to compete against Advantest. Under the agreement, SL Link agreed by cl 8.10 that damages and/or an account of profits would not adequately compensate the first plaintiff. This assent was not unexpected as the plaintiffs’ loss of customers’ goodwill and confidence will not be compensated by an award of damages.
45        The penultimate issue which I need to deal with has two parts. The plaintiffs have alleged that both the defendants have conspired to cause harm to the plaintiffs by unlawfully soliciting business from Advantest’s customers and/or competing directly with Advantest in breach of the Manufacturing Agreement. The second part of the plaintiffs’ case against the defendants is that the second defendant has induced SL Link to breach its obligations under the Manufacturing Agreement.
46        Mr Tang of the second defendant admitted that both defendants visited the Advantest’s customers, namely MSA and Infineon. They provided those customers with a quotation, thereby suggesting that they could do better than the plaintiffs.
47        The defendants admitted in evidence that the second defendant is an agent of SL Link. According to Mr Tang of the second defendant, the agency was “for all business outside Taiwan”. The second defendant was aware of the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement and the obligations of SL Link under it. It was aware that SL Link was obliged to procure and/or ensure that its agents did not compete with Advantest and did not solicit business from Advantest’s customers.
48        As recited earlier, both defendants had run foul of the obligations of SL Link and clearly their conduct amounted to the torts of conspiracy and of inducing a breach on the part of the second defendant. There is ample evidence that they intend to continue to do so, asserting that the customers they had solicited were and always have been their own customers.
49        Finally, I will consider the question whether the defendants are entitled to counterclaim for damages against the plaintiffs for allegedly causing them loss. By para 34 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim they assert that the plaintiffs had commenced these proceedings with the ulterior motive of deterring the defendants’ potential customers from purchasing from the defendants. I agree with the plaintiffs’ contention that the defendants have not pleaded a recognisable cause of action. They have also failed to adduce any evidence to show that the plaintiffs had commenced the proceedings to deter any of the defendants’ potential customers from entering into further contracts with them. In the main, the defendants allege that the plaintiffs had spread rumours in the Singapore market that they had sued the defendants. As the fact remains that the plaintiffs have sued the defendants, there is no cause of action for disseminating what is fact. In any case, it was MSA and Infineon who sought clarifications from the plaintiffs whether SL Link continued to be bound by the Manufacturing Agreement. On the evidence, I am also not convinced that the defendants had suffered any loss of business as a result of the institution of these proceedings.
Conclusion
50        In the premises, I will grant the declaration and costs sought by the plaintiffs. The defendants’ counterclaim is dismissed with costs. As the Manufacturing Agreement may have expired by effluxion of time I will hear submissions on other reliefs. Parties are directed to appear before me to settle the orders.

The plaintiff, Mr Kamis Bin Satari, claimed against the defendant, Mr Nasir Natarajan, for damages for personal injuries and other consequential losses sustained in respect of an accident on 14 August 2003 whilst he was alighting from a lorry driven by Mr Natarajan.  Both men were co-workers employed at the material time by Wanin Industries Pte Ltd (“Wanin Industries”).
2.         Mr Kamis commenced this action against Mr Natarajan on 12 November 2003.  A request for interim payment was made by Mr Kamis’ solicitors on 20 August 2004.  Parties came to an agreement on this issue and the interim payment of $5,000 was forwarded to Mr Kamis on 2 October 2004 and acknowledged by Mr Kamis. 
3.         Subsequently, Mr Natarajan discovered that Mr Kamis received $11,025 from QBE Insurance (International) Ltd under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, Cap 354, on 6 September 2004.  Mr Natarajan therefore applied to strike out Mr Kamis’ claim, and for the return of the interim payment.  A deputy registrar made the orders applied for and I dismissed the appeal therefrom.  Mr Kamis has appealed and I now furnish my grounds of decision.
Effect of recovery under the Workmen’s Compensation Act
4.         Mr Natarajan’s counsel, Mr Goh, contended that no action could be maintained against his client as Mr Kamis has received compensation under the Workman’s Compensation Act (“the Act”).  Section 18 of the Act reads as follows:
Remedies both against employer and stranger
18.        Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages thereof –
(a)        the workman may take proceedings against that person to recover damages and may claim against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act, but he shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; and
(b)        if the workman has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid, and any person who has been called upon to pay an indemnity under section 17(3), shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid
5.         I agreed with Mr Goh that s 18 prescribes clearly that a workman may recover compensation under the Act or pursue a common law claim against a tortfeasor who is not his employer, but not both.  Section 18(a) of the Act thus allows a workman to file a suit and to start the process for compensation under the Act.  It does not, however, allow him to have the benefit of both damages and compensation.  Where he has been compensated under the Act, s 18(b) of the Act allows the person who paid the compensation to seek an indemnity from the tortfeasor. 
6.         In 
Chua Ah Beng v The Commissioner For Labour
, in a case concerning s 33 of the Act, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was), while summarising the law on the subject, stated that a workman could sue a “stranger” and make a claim under the WCA at the same time but could not be compensated twice for the same injury.  Other cases dealing with s 33 of the Act have also emphasised that the intent of the Act is to prevent the workman from being compensated by the dual machinery of the Act and a common law tort claim.  A workman has first to withdraw his claim for compensation prior to suing his employer: see s 33 of the Act and

The plaintiff’s contentions as to mistake
7.         Mr Hanam, counsel for Mr Kamis, conceded that s 18 of the Act was clear.  His case rests on mistake, which he explained as follows.
8.         Mr Kamis is Malay and speaks primarily Malay.  His highest education level attained was secondary one.  He worked for Wanin Industries as a delivery man.  After the accident, Wanin Industries assisted Mr Kamis to complete the forms for him.  After he signed them, the forms were submitted to the Ministry of Manpower.  Subsequently, this writ was filed, and his solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors to ask for an interim payment.  In his affidavit, Mr Kamis explained that when he received the letter from QBE informing him to go to their office to collect a cheque for $11,025 “as assessed by the Manpower Office”, he thought that this was the interim payment.  It was his evidence that at the QBE office, the staff did not explain to him what the cheque was for but only asked for his identity card.  He was asked to sign an acknowledgment form and that was not explained to him either.  In Mr Hanam’s view this was obviously a mistake.  There was no reason Mr Kamis would have settled his claim for only $11,025 as he had previously upon legal advice turned down an offer for $32,700 made by the defendant’s insurers.
9.         Mr Hanam relied on the case of 
Low Swee Fong v Gammon (Malaysia) 1959 Ltd
 
[1962] 28 MLJ 295
, where the defendant denied liability on the ground that the plaintiff had received compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance, the predecessor of the Act.  Section 20 of the Ordinance was identical to the current s 18 of the Act.  In that case the plaintiff had signed a document purporting to be an acknowledgment of 13 fortnightly instalments totalling $780 as workmen’s compensation.  Wee Chong Jin J (as he then was) held that  the plaintiff could recover common law damages. 
Analysis
10.       Several distinguishing factors in 
Low Swee Fong
 must be noted.  Wee J’s holding was on the ground that there was no evidence in that particular case that the plaintiff received from his employer workmen’s compensation payments.  He accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that he had not received the fortnightly payments which the defendant alleged were paid and acknowledged.  The learned judge also expressed doubt that the party who was alleged to have paid the compensation monies, one Kwong Maw Sawmill Co Ltd, was the plaintiff’s employer: the learned judge’s view was that one Lai Thow was his employer.
11.       In the present case, in contrast, there was no dispute that the $11,025 was received as compensation under the Act from his employers’ insurers.  There is no dispute as to the source of the monies or the reason for their payment.  Mr Kamis’ case rests upon his own mistake: he thought that the $11,025 was merely an interim payment for his suit.  I did not investigate these contentions of mistake as I did not think it necessary.  Section 18 of the Act is clear that Mr Kamis cannot be in receipt of money under the Act and yet press his claim in court.  Only the person who has paid out the compensation may seek an indemnity from the tortfeasor in court.  The relevant caselaw on the Act is also clear that the intent of the Act is to prevent the workman from obtaining compensation both under the Act and pursuant to common law.  If indeed Mr Kamis has recovered his compensation by mistake, then he must take any steps open to him under the Act if any, before pressing on with his claim in court.
Conclusion
12.       In the circumstances the appeal was dismissed.  Costs, fixed at $800, were awarded to Mr Natarajan after hearing submissions from solicitors",2005-05-06 00:00:00,SG District Court

22 April 2005
 
Kan Ting Chiu J:
1          The accused, Vanmaichelvan s/o Barsathi is appealing against the sentence I imposed on him for trafficking 499.99g of cannabis.
2          The accused, who is 35 years old and was a supervisor in a cleaning company, appeared before me with another person, S Manogaran (“Manogaran”).
3          At the outset, each of them faced two charges. The accused faced a capital charge of trafficking 749.17g of cannabis and a non-capital charge of trafficking 458.91g of cannabis mixture. Both offences were alleged to have been committed on 2 April 2004 at the cleaner’s store in the National Dental Centre (“NDC”) to which the accused had access in the course of his work. Manogaran was charged with abetting the accused in the commission of the two offences.
4          The accused and Manogaran claimed trial to the charges they faced and were tried together.
5          However, on the fourth day of the joint trial, the Prosecutor amended the charge of trafficking cannabis against the accused. The amendment was to reduce the quantity of cannabis stated in the charge from the original 749.17g to 499.99g. The effect of the amendment was that the accused would not face the mandatory death sentence if he was convicted, but was liable to a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane and a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes.
6          The accused pleaded guilty to the amended charge and admitted the Statement of Facts
[1]
 
prepared by the Prosecution, the relevant portions of which are:
6          Whilst at the vicinity of the rubbish collection centre, the accused admitted to ASP Krishnan [the investigation officer of the case] that he had hidden the drugs belonging to 
the accomplice
. The accused then led the party of CNB officers to the cleaner’s store 8-1 on the 8
th
 floor of the NDC. In the cleaner’s store, the accused indicated to ASP Krishnan, by pointing with his hand, that the drugs were kept above the false ceiling at the right-hand corner of the cleaner’s store. ASP Krishnan then recovered from above the false ceiling the following:-
a)         a paper bag (Kolber-Geneve) containing 1 plastic bag with 1 block and loose vegetable matter and 3 blocks of vegetable matter wrapped with aluminium and adhesive tapes
b)         1 block of vegetable matter wrapped with aluminium foil and adhesive tapes
7          The accused subsequently gave an oral statement to SI Ang in Tamil that the drugs that had been recovered belonged to the accomplice and that the accomplice had given him the drugs four to five days ago. The accused also admitted that he was keeping the drugs for 
the accomplice
 until the accomplice found a customer for the drugs.
[emphasis added]
The accused was then convicted on the amended charge.
7          The Prosecutor applied for the charge for trafficking in the cannabis mixture to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused consented to the application and admitted to that charge.
8          The Prosecutor then produced a record of the accused’s antecedents
[2]
 
which he admitted to. The record revealed a history of drug offences. He had been convicted on one charge of drug trafficking, two charges of possession of drugs and one charge of consumption of a drug on 19 October 1990 and had been sentenced to a total of 62 months’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. On 29 November 1995, he had been placed under drug supervision for 24 months for consuming a controlled drug. The accused informed me that the drug involved in those cases was heroin.
[3]
9          Then his counsel, Mr Subhas Anandan, made the plea in mitigation on his behalf. Mr Anandan told me:
… 
I’m instructed
 
to inform your Honour that
 
the accomplice, Manogaran, is a childhood friend who approached the Accused for help in storing the drugs. The Accused found it difficult to say “no” and agreed to hold it,
 but told him to take it off as soon as he can. The Accused was not paid anything for this, your Honour. There was no arrangement for him to get any profit out of this.
[4]
 
…
and
… he has already told the DPP that 
he will be a prosecution witness and do what he can in resolving this matter
.
[5]
 
… I hope your Honour will not give him a crushing sentence, your Honour, in that it will not be too heavy, your Honour. … Crushing sentence would be somewhere to the maximum, your Honour. I hope that will not happen because he has pleaded guilty after all, and he’s going to be a prosecution witness.
[6]
[emphasis added]
10        After hearing Mr Anandan, the Prosecutor did not address me on sentence. I reviewed the facts of the case, the accused’s antecedents and the plea in mitigation. When I passed sentence, I told the accused:
I’m sure you are acutely aware of what has happened. You were facing the death penalty, you are no longer facing that now. You have pleaded guilty to a charge for trafficking in 499.99 grams of cannabis; agreed to have taken into account for purpose of sentencing another charge for trafficking in cannabis mixture. But on the facts, you admit that actually the cannabis involved exceed 500.
Now, on your antecedents it is clear that this is not just a “one off” incident where you obliged a friend. You have a history of criminality with regard to the same drug – cannabis [this was incorrect, as his previous offences involved heroin] – and, really, I cannot see how we can just regard this as an incident of somebody helping a childhood friend because he found it difficult to say “no”. All right, I mean you must be very naïve you behaved that way, and I must be very naïve if I accept it that you behaved that way.
I give due recognition to those parts of the mitigation that has been brought up to me, the fact that you will evidence in this case and the fact that you have pleaded guilty.
[7]
I sentenced him to 26 years’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane.
11        I do not regard this to be a crushing sentence, as the maximum term is life imprisonment or 30 years and the minimum sentence is 20 years, 
and
 taking into account his drug antecedents 
and
 the second trafficking charge that was taken into account for the purpose of sentencing. To me, it was a fair and appropriate sentence on the facts then before me.
12        I would, in a normal case, have ended here and would not have gone further, but this turned out to be a most unusual case where the accused went on to say on oath that some of the facts he had admitted to in court and significant parts of the mitigation plea made on his behalf were untrue.
13        What happened was that after the charges against the accused were disposed of, the case against Manogaran went on. In accordance with the understanding that was alluded to, the accused was called to give evidence as a witness for the Prosecution.
14        The prosecutor asked him questions on Manogaran’s involvement with the drugs, and received surprising replies. I set out some of the questions and answers:
Q:   Now, with respect to the 749.17 grams of cannabis and 458.91 grams of cannabis mixture, did the Accused Manogaran have anything to do with them?
A:   No.
[8]
       …
Q:   Now, witness, do you recall that on the 13
th
 of January when you pleaded guilty to the charge, you agreed to the Statement of Facts at the same time?
A:   I agreed to take the offer and, as such, I agreed to whatever Statement of Facts.
[9]
       …
Q:   Now, can you look at paragraph 7 [of the Statement of Facts], in fact, look at paragraph 6 as well, Mr Vanmaichelvan. Right, in paragraph 6, you have admitted to the part that says, that you admitted to ASP Krishnan that you had hidden the drugs belonging to the accomplice, the accomplice being the Accused in the dock. Do you see that?
A:   Sir, at that point of time, I was told by my counsel that since an offer was made to me, I should accept whatever that was stated. As such, it did not matter to me what was stated in the Statement of Facts, I took the offer.
Q:   Now, look at paragraph 7, again, you agree that you gave a statement to SI Ang that the drugs that they recovered belonged to the Accused and that the Accused had given you the drugs 4 to 5 days ago.
A:   Sir, the fact is, it’s not true, Sir, paragraph 7 is not true. … I admitted it, but paragraph 7 is not true.
Q:   Now, in fact, besides the Statement of Facts, during your plea in mitigation, the counsel has said that he was instructed by you that the Accused [Manogaran] is a childhood friend who approached you for help in storing the drugs, and that you had found it difficult to say “no”. And you agreed to store it and you asked him to take it away as soon as possible. … [Y]our counsel also told the Court that you were not paid for helping the Accused to keep the drugs. Do you remember that, your counsel saying those during your case?
A:   Sir, I did not listen to what counsel was saying on my behalf in mitigation, the fact is it’s not true. I admitted the wrong that I did and I’ve been punished.
[10]
       …
Q:   Now, in that case, witness, would you be able to tell us why did your counsel say those things during your plea in mitigation?
A:   Sir, I was given this offer and I was considering the welfare of my family and child. I wanted to live, Sir, as such I took the offer, and whatever the counsel said on my behalf, he did it so that I could get this offer.
[11]
       …
Q:   Now, witness, I’m putting it to you that in paragraph 6 [of the Statement of Facts], you had admitted to ASP Krishnan tht the drugs belonged to the Accused Manogaran.
A:   I disagree.
Q:   And that is the reason why you agreed to that paragraph of the Statement of Facts on the 13
th
 of January.
A:   I was given an offer. I did not want to waste that offer and that is why I agreed to the Statements of Facts on that day.
Q:   Now I’m referring to paragraph 7 now. I’m putting it to you that you did give a statement to SI Ang which was interpreted by ASP Krishnan, saying that the drugs belonged to the Accused Manogaran.
A:   I disagree.
[12]
       …
Q:   Now, witness, I’m putting it to you that you had agreed to the Statement of Facts, namely, paragraph 7, the first sentence, second portion which states that the Accused Manogaran had given you the drugs four to five days ago. You agreed to that because that was the truth. I’m putting it to you.
A:   I disagree.
Q:   And I’m putting it to you that you agreed to the next sentence as well in paragraph 7: “The Accused also admitted that he was keeping the drugs for Manogaran, the accomplice …”. You agreed to that part of the Statement of Facts as well on the 13
th
 of January because that was the truth.
A:   I disagree. I had been advised by my counsel. Since I was taking up the offer, I was to agree and admit to whatever that was put to me.
[13]
       …
Q:   Now, witness, did you say that to ASP Krishnan as stated in the paragraph [para 7].
A:   I did not tell him that.
Q:   Now, I put it to you, witness, that you did say to ASP Krishnan what was stated in that sentence of paragraph 7, namely that you had nothing to do with the drugs and that it belonged to the Accused Manogaran, and that you were only doing Manogaran a favour by storing the drugs for him.
A:   I disagree. I did not tell.
Q:   Now, look at the last sentence of paragraph 7, (reads) “Vanmaichelvam again mentioned that the drugs belonged to the accused Manogaran and I told him that he should reveal this fact to the court”. Do you agree that you said that to ASP Krishnan?
A:   No, I did not.
Q:   Now, I put it to you that you have in fact said that to ASP Krishnan.
A:   I disagree. I did not tell this.
[14]
15        I have set out the questions and answers at length to show the extent of and reasons for the accused’s change of position.
16        He disavowed without apology significant parts of the mitigation plea that his counsel had made 
on his instructions
.
17        When Manogaran’s connection with the drugs was brought up by Mr Anandan in the mitigation plea, I took it into account in deciding on the sentence I imposed.
18        If that had not been brought up, there was little that mitigated the offence and sentence except that the accused had pleaded guilty. Even as regards that, however, there was already a trade-off. In exchange for admitting his guilt, the weight of the cannabis stated in the charge was reduced to 499.99g from the true weight of 749.17g to enable him to avoid the death sentence. When he pleaded guilty to the amended charge in such circumstances, he had already obtained the benefit of his plea from the reduction of the charge. His plea would not have had the same impact on sentence as a plea of guilt made without a trade-off.
19        If he had instructed Mr Anandan honestly, Mr Anandan would not have said most of what was said in mitigation on his behalf, including the assertion that he was only storing the drugs for Manogaran at the latter’s request, and I would probably have imposed a heavier sentence.
20        Nevertheless, the accused still feels that the sentence imposed is too harsh on him, and that he deserves a lower sentence.

Tan Lee Meng J:
 
1          The first plaintiff, Mr Teo Song Kwang alias Richard (“RT”), and the second plaintiff, Seng Hup Realty Pte Ltd (“Seng Hup”), sued the defendant, Mr Vijayasundram Jeyabalan (“VJ”), to recover a large part of the losses incurred by them in a business venture in the Indonesian timber market, on the ground that VJ had a share in the said business venture and had agreed to be liable for the amount claimed by them. In addition, RT, who settled a claim made against him by an Indonesian bank, PT Internationale Nederlanden Indonesia Bank (“ING Bank”), under a guarantee signed by him, VJ, and another party, claimed that VJ was liable for one-third of the settlement sum. VJ denied that he owed any money to RT or Seng Hup.
 
The background
2          RT was, at the material time, the managing director and majority shareholder of Seng Hup, his family’s investment company, whose subsidiaries include a number of companies in the lighting business in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and the United States.
3          In 1979, RT offered VJ a job in his lighting business. He was rather pleased with VJ’s work. In due course, RT regarded VJ as his right-hand man in his lighting business. In his own words, when it came to dispensing rewards, he was more generous to VJ than to his own brothers. RT gave VJ shares in a number of his companies without requiring the latter to pay a single cent for them. He allotted VJ 10% of the shares in Crystal Palace Brunei, Krystalina Worldwide Sdn Bhd and Kristalina Mannuggal. He also gave VJ 5% of the shares in his Malaysian company, Seng Hup Sdn Bhd.
4          From 1990 onwards, RT asked VJ to take charge of Seng Hup’s lighting business in Malaysia. As a result, VJ moved to Kuala Lumpur. By then, RT, who wanted to diversify his business, had taken an interest in the Indonesian timber market. His plan was to buy Indonesian timber logs and process them into parquet wood for the Italian market. For this purpose, he wanted to acquire an Indonesian company, PT Profilindo Sejahtera, which owned a wood-processing plant.
5          RT roped in his right-hand man, VJ, for his new business venture in Indonesia (“the Indonesian timber business”). The exact nature of VJ’s involvement in the Indonesian timber business was disputed. VJ said that he was only nominally involved as a trusted and faithful employee of RT. He added that apart from a couple of junket trips to Indonesia, he had very little to do with the Indonesian timber business. On the other hand, RT claimed that VJ was an equal partner in the new business. RT also decided to work with another person, one Mr Hendrick Tay Cheng Leong (“HT”), on his new business venture. According to RT, the duties and responsibilities were as follows. RT himself was to take charge of financing and marketing, VJ was to take charge of administration and co-ordination and HT was to take charge of the acquisition of the shares of PT Profilindo Sejahtera, the obtaining of the requisite approval from the Indonesian authorities for the transfer of the said shares to RT, VJ and himself, and finally, to handle matters relating to production and customer service.
6          The foray into the Indonesian market was carried out through Asiapac Pte Ltd (“Asiapac”) which was incorporated in July 1989. RT and VJ were directors and shareholders of Asiapac from its inception. All the shares issued by Asiapac to VJ and HT were paid for by RT. In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, RT said that VJ and HT “did not have the resources to contribute towards the teak business”.
[1]
7          On 2 July 1990, RT, VJ and HT signed a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with respect to the purchase of shares in PT Profilindo Sejahtera. Thereafter, RT and Seng Hup poured millions of dollars over the next few years into the Indonesian timber business. RT, VJ and HT furnished guarantees to a number of financial institutions, including the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”) and ING Bank, for the purpose of the said business.
8          The warm relationship between RT and VJ did not last. VJ eventually left RT’s lighting business in 1995 and set up his own lighting business in Kuala Lumpur.
9          After VJ left Seng Hup in 1995, RT continued to inject his own funds as well as Seng Hup’s funds into the Indonesian timber business. However, the Indonesian timber business proved to be a loss-making enterprise. There was a proposal by HT to take over the Indonesian timber business but nothing came out of this. By March 1997, it was decided that the parties’ assets in the Indonesian timber business would be sold. However, no buyer for the business was found and no further action was taken. On 27 October 1999, HT resigned as a director of Asiapac.
10        In December 1997, OCBC demanded from RT the repayment of US$563,803.01, which was due under an overdraft facility granted to Asiapac. This overdraft facility had been guaranteed by RT, VJ and HT. On 9 May 1998, RT paid OCBC US$264,596.86 in full and final settlement of the sum claimed. In District Court Suit No 50759 of 1998 (“DC Suit 50759/1998”), RT successfully sued VJ for one-third of the said settlement amount.
11        In March 2002, ING Bank sued RT in Singapore on a guarantee for US$700,000 that was executed by him, VJ and HT (“the ING Bank guarantee”). This High Court suit was settled by RT for merely US$200,000.
12        In April 2003, RT’s Malaysian solicitors wrote to VJ to demand that the latter pay two-thirds of the debt incurred by RT and Seng Hup with respect to the Indonesian timber business under the terms of a guarantee that was supposed to have been handed over to VJ for his signature in November 1992 (“the November guarantee”). Under the terms of this document, VJ and HT were required to jointly and severally guarantee to RT the payment of up to two-thirds of debts due to him and Seng Hup as a result of the Indonesian timber business. RT said that VJ told him that the November guarantee had been signed and he allowed the latter to keep the signed guarantee. He also said that the knowledge that VJ had signed the November guarantee induced him to put more money into the Indonesian timber business. On the other hand, VJ denied having seen the November guarantee in 1992 or at any time while he was still working in RT’s lighting business and he alleged that this document was created recently for the purpose of advancing the plaintiffs’ case.
13        In 2004, RT and Seng Hup commenced the present action against VJ. They both sought a contribution from VJ towards the millions of dollars that they claimed to have lost in the Indonesian timber business. RJ also sought to recover from VJ one-third of the US$200,000 that he paid to ING Bank to settle its bank’s claim for US$700,000 under the terms of the ING Bank guarantee.
VJ’s liability for the plaintiffs’ losses
14        VJ’s liability to contribute towards the loss suffered by RT and Seng Hup in the Indonesian timber business will first be considered. Although the plaintiffs claimed to have invested and lost more than $7.5m in the Indonesian timber business and had sought to recover either one-third or two-thirds of the said sum, their counsel stated in his closing submissions that, leaving aside the claim for a contribution by VJ towards the settlement with ING Bank, his clients had decided to claim only $2m from VJ.
15        The plaintiffs’ case against VJ for a share of the amount injected by them into the Indonesian timber business was hopelessly doomed from the start for the simple reason that there was insufficient proof as to the amount of money actually lost by them in the said business. The accounts of Asiapac were clearly qualified by the company’s auditors, M/s Thong & Lim, who were not called to give any evidence. Furthermore, no audited accounts from Asiapac’s Indonesian subsidiary, PT Profilindo Sejahtera Manunggal, which would have shed much light on the position, were made available, either to Asiapac’s auditors or to the court. Admittedly, Asiapac decided to write down its massive investment in its Indonesian subsidiary to $1, but its own auditors commented on this move in the following damning terms in their report to the members of Asiapac on 26 May 1998:
We have not sighted the share certificate nor [are] able to obtain independent confirmation of the Company’s investment in the subsidiary, P.T. Profilindo Sejahtera Manunggal. 
As such, we are unable to satisfy ourselves as to the validity of the Company’s investment in this subsidiary notwithstanding that the investment has been written down to S$1.00
. [emphasis added]
16        In the light of Asiapac’s own auditors’ views on the validity of the company’s investment in the Indonesian subsidiary, the amount of money put into the Indonesian timber business by the plaintiffs and the amount lost cannot be properly ascertained. As the plaintiffs did not prove their entitlement to the amount claimed by them, their action must be dismissed.
17        Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the plaintiffs’ grounds for claiming an indemnity from VJ will, for the sake of completeness, be considered. RT contended that VJ was liable to indemnify him for a number of reasons. Firstly, he alleged that VJ’s liability arose from the MOU signed by the both of them and HT on 2 July 1990, or under the November guarantee allegedly signed by VJ. Secondly, RT asserted that VJ induced him to inject more funds into Asiapac by representing to him that the November guarantee had been signed. Thirdly, he claimed that the parties had an understanding that VJ would be liable for one-third of all the funds injected by RT into Asiapac. As for Seng Hup, it claimed that its right against VJ arose out of the November guarantee. All the grounds relied on by the plaintiffs did not rest on a firm foundation.
The MOU
18        The MOU is the foundation of RT’s claim against VJ. In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, he said that the MOU sets out “the basic principles of the joint venture” and “the rights and responsibilities of the parties to the agreement”.
[2]
 
He testified that cl 5 of the MOU required VJ to pay him one-third of the amount lost by him personally or by Seng Hup in the Indonesian timber business.
19        Clause 5 of the MOU must be read together with cl 1. Both these clauses outlined the purpose of the MOU in the following unmistakable terms:
1          [RT] shall provide adequate financing needs by way of loan 
for the purchase by Indonesian nationals of all the issued equity of P.T. Profilindo Sejahtera
 … the legal and beneficial owner of all assets and goodwill in a wood processing plant …
5.         [VJ and HT] shall … be seised of the obligation to repay 1/3 each of the loan extended by [RT], including all applicable interest and cost of funds. …
[emphasis added]
20        Clauses 1 and 5 of the MOU are only concerned with the amount paid by RT for the purchase of the shares of PT Profilindo Sejahtera, which owned the Indonesian wood-processing plant eyed by RT. No other clauses in the MOU gave RT any right to seek a contribution from VJ for the money ploughed by him into the Indonesian timber business. RT finally accepted that this was the correct position when he said as follows during cross-examination:
Q:         Do you agree that the right to claim one-third of all sums disbursed by you [for the Indonesian timber business] is not found in the MOU?
A:         … 
I agree
 but I have to check 
other
 voluminous documents.
[emphasis added]
21        As the “other” voluminous documents referred to by RT had nothing to do with the MOU, it follows that, as far as the MOU is concerned, RT is, without more, only entitled to claim from VJ a contribution of one-third of the purchase price of the shares of PT Profilindo Sejahtera. However, his claim for the said contribution is time-barred. According to the MOU, VJ’s obligation to repay RT crystallised upon the transfer of all the issued and paid-up capital of PT Profilindo Sejahtera to himself, RT and HT. The transfer in question took place more than 12 years ago. As RT’s suit was commenced in 2004, his claim for a contribution towards the cost of the shares in question is, without more, time-barred. RT argued that his claim for such a contribution is not time-barred because VJ acknowledged this debt when he relied on Asiapac’s accounts for 1996 to fend off RT’s claim for a contribution with respect to the sum paid by RT to OCBC under the guarantee given to OCBC. There is a world of difference between an acknowledgment by VJ that Asiapac owes RT and Seng Hup money and an acknowledgment by VJ that he is still liable to RT for a contribution towards the purchase price of the shares of PT Profilindo Sejahtera. More importantly, whether or not the claim is time-barred, RT could not say for certain what the amount he had paid for the said shares was. Apparently, the records had been lost. No court can determine how much RT is entitled to under the terms of the MOU if the amount paid by him for the shares is not known. It is clear that his claim for a contribution from VJ under the MOU need not be further considered.
The unsigned November guarantee
22        The plaintiffs’ assertion that VJ is liable to them under the terms of the November guarantee will next be considered. The plaintiffs’ attempt to rely on the November guarantee is fraught with insurmountable problems.
23        To begin with, neither a signed copy of the November guarantee nor an original copy of the unsigned guarantee was furnished as evidence. RT contended that VJ had admitted in DC Suit 50759/1998, that he had signed this guarantee because it was included in his affidavit in that suit among the guarantees he claimed to have signed when asked to do so by RT. However, the copy of the November guarantee that was included in the said affidavit was also an unsigned copy, and when cross-examined in the present case, VJ said that he received a copy of the unsigned guarantee long after he had left Seng Hup. It appears that the unsigned copy of the November guarantee had been included among the copies of signed guarantees in VJ’s affidavit in DC Suit 50759/1998 by mistake.
24        At the outset, it must be noted that there was insufficient proof that the November guarantee was handed over to VJ for his signature in November 1992 or at any time thereafter. VJ, who had executed various guarantees when asked to do so by RT, stated categorically that if RT had asked him to sign the November guarantee in 1992, he would have done so unhesitatingly and immediately. After all, their working relationship was such that he signed, without questioning, other guarantees put in front of him by RT. It is rather telling that RT testified that he did not ask VJ to return the signed guarantee to him in November 1992 or at any time between 1992 and 1998. RT must have known that if the signed guarantee was not in his hands, it was unlikely to surface should it become necessary for him to rely on it in the future. In any case, one would have expected RT to ask VJ to hand over to him the November guarantee after his relationship with VJ deteriorated to such an extent that the latter left Seng Hup in 1995 to set up a rival business in Kuala Lumpur. It is significant that it was only in April 2003 that RT finally made a claim under the November guarantee. On balance, I believe VJ’s evidence that he was not given the November guarantee to sign in November 1992.
25        Notwithstanding my finding that VJ was not given the November guarantee to sign in 1992, RT’s allegation that he was induced to inject more funds into Asiapac by VJ’s fraudulent representation that the November guarantee had been signed will also be considered. As RT alleged that a fraudulent representation had been made, he has, in Lord Herschell’s words in 
Derry v Peek
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337
 at 374
,
 to prove that VJ made the false representation “(1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false”.
26        In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, RT alleged that the false representation that the November guarantee had been signed was communicated to him by VJ. He stated as follows:
[3]
Subsequently, during one of our regular meetings … [VJ] 
told me
 that he had signed the Guarantee and the duly executed copy is in his possession. I had no reason to doubt him. He was then my right-hand-man and business associate. We were good friends.
[emphasis added]
27        Surprisingly, instead of reiterating during cross-examination that VJ had told him that the November guarantee had been signed, RT repeatedly referred to the “impression” that had been given to him by VJ that the November guarantee had been signed. When questioned, his answers were as follows:
Q:         How did the defendant make a fraudulent representation?
A:         He gave the impression that it was signed and I continued to put in money.
Q:         
How did he give you the impression?
A:         
By allowing me to continue to support the Indonesian business when I thought I had the comfort of a Deed of Guarantee.
[emphasis added]
28        When cross-examined as to whether he had asked VJ if the November guarantee had already been signed, RT did not say that this was unnecessary because VJ had told him that it had been signed. Instead he claimed that he did not have to ask VJ this question because their “relationship was so good”. The series of questions and answers that merit attention are as follows:
Q:         You did not ask him to sign the guarantee on the spot?
A:         No, he kept the guarantee.
Q:         Did you ask if he had signed it?
A:         
Our relationship was so good.
Q:         Did you ask him if he had signed it in 1993?
A:         No.
Q:         Did you ask if he had signed it in 1994 or 1995?
A:         No.
[emphasis added]
29        Even when VJ’s counsel, Mr Leong Wai Nam, asserted that his client did not say that the November guarantee had been signed, RT did not contradict him. Instead, he said as follows:
Q:         You are saying that the very fact that 
VJ remained silent as to whether he signed the guarantee
 is a representation.
A:         He allowed me to carry out activities. That gave me the impression that he signed it and it is fraudulent.
[emphasis added]
30        I have no doubt that VJ did not tell RT that he had signed the November guarantee. Neither did he give any impression that the said guarantee had been signed. That being the case, RT’s case on fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit collapsed.
31        In any case, RT could not prove that he had been induced by any representation by VJ that the November guarantee had been signed to put more money into the Indonesian timber business. When asked how he could have been induced by VJ to pour more funds into that business when he was in fact the leader, he pointed to a letter from Seng Hup to the board of directors of Asiapac as evidence of inducement. This letter, dated 15 July 1995, which was signed by both RT and VJ as directors of Seng Hup, was worded as follows:
We hereby confirm that we will provide to Asiapac Pte Ltd and its subsidiary company, P.T. Profilindo Sejahtera Manunggal continuing financial support as may be required for them to meet their liabilities and their normal operating expenses incurred until this undertaking is revoked by us in writing. We further confirm that we will not demand immediate payment for debts owing to us so that Asiapac Pte Ltd and P.T. Profilindo Sejahtera Manunggal will be able to continue to operate as going concerns.
32        RT clutched at straws when he asserted that the above-mentioned letter was an inducement to him to continue to pour money into the Indonesian timber business as he finally admitted that the letter had been suggested by his auditors because the financial position of Asiapac was then quite critical. Such evidence could only further undermine his case against VJ. I thus hold that the allegation, that RT was induced by VJ’s representation that he had signed the November guarantee to inject more funds into the Indonesian timber business, had no substance whatsoever.
Whether there was an understanding to share the cost of funds
33        The plaintiffs’ assertion that the parties had an understanding to share the cost of the foray into the Indonesian timber business will next be considered. The alleged understanding is supposed to have been an oral one. However, there was insufficient proof of this.
34        Admittedly, RT, VJ and HT were to contribute one-third of the cost of the shares in PT Profilindo Sejahtera, but apart from this, RT appeared to treat the Indonesian timber business as an extension of his family group of companies and especially so after VJ and he went their separate ways and became competitors in the lighting business in Kuala Lumpur. In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, VJ stated as follows:
[4]
It is contrary to the nature of Richard Teo to give away any part of his business to anyone, let alone 34% in real terms of the timber business in Indonesia to me. I find the idea of me being the equal partner of Richard Teo absurd and preposterous. I wish to add that what I mean is that Richard Teo is always absolutely in control of the timber business in Indonesia and other businesses and he treated the Indonesian timber business as his own.
35        What VJ said is not without sense. Indeed, if RT had wanted to have VJ assume a share of the liabilities, it would have been very easy for him to do so when he gave the latter a 5% stake in his Malaysian company, Seng Hup Sdn Bhd. According to RT, he made VJ a rich man as the shares given to the latter were worth millions of ringgit after that company became a public company. That being the case, RT could easily have arranged for the money that was given on a silver platter to VJ to be diverted to the Indonesian timber business as the latter’s share of the money required by the said business, but he did not do so. As for the money loaned to Asiapac by Seng Hup, which was recorded as a debt owed to the company by RT, that debt could have been recorded in Seng Hup’s books as a debt that was owed equally by RT and VJ if both of them had an equal share in the Indonesian timber business, since they were both directors of Seng Hup at the material time.
36        Reference was made to a proposal by HT to take over Asiapac. In the proposal, HT assumed that he had a one-third share of the assets of Asiapac and calculated the price for his takeover on this basis. This, the plaintiffs alleged, showed that the parties must have agreed to share equally the cost of the foray into the Indonesian timber business. HT was not called to give any evidence on his rather skimpy proposal. He was named by the plaintiffs as a witness for the trial as late as September 2004 but RT said that he subsequently lost contact with HT. Without the benefit of cross-examination, HT’s proposal cannot advance the plaintiffs’ case. Furthermore, VJ said that he had not agreed to accept HT’s proposal and whatever may have been HT’s dealings with RT, he did not have a one-third share of the assets or liabilities of Asiapac.
37        I hold that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that an understanding was reached between the parties concerned that VJ would assume one-third of the liabilities incurred in the Indonesian timber business.
The decision
38        The plaintiffs’ claim against VJ for a contribution with respect to their losses in the Indonesian timber business is dismissed with costs.
The ING Bank guarantee
39        RT’s claim on the ING Bank guarantee, which stands on a different footing from his other claims, will next be considered. As has been mentioned at [11] above, RT was sued by ING Bank for US$700,000 under the terms of the ING Bank guarantee signed by him, VJ and HT. He compromised this claim for US$200,000 without consulting VJ.
40        It is trite law that a creditor is entitled to sue any of the guarantors of the sum loaned. It is also a well-established rule founded upon natural justice and equitable principles that if one guarantor is asked to pay a sum, his co-guarantors are liable to contribute their share of the amount paid if they benefit from such a payment to the creditor. In 
Craythorne v Swinburne
 (1807) 14 Ves 160; 33 ER 482, Lord Eldon LC explained that the equitable principle of contribution enabled a guarantor to assume the burden of suretyship on the faith of an implied promise of contribution from his co-sureties.
41        When cross-examined, VJ tried to avoid liability under the ING Bank guarantee on three grounds. Firstly, he said that he had signed a separate guarantee from that on which RT was sued. Secondly, he complained that the signature on the letter accepting the offer for credit facilities of $700,000 was not his and that he had signed a letter of offer for credit facilities of $500,000 instead. Thirdly, he said that he should not be liable because he was not given notice of the suit by ING Bank against RT and was not consulted in any way by the latter on the negotiations to compromise the suit.
42        Admittedly, VJ and RT signed separate documents in relation to the ING Bank guarantee, but it is not the case that co-guarantors need not contribute towards a claim merely because separate guarantee documents had been signed (see, for instance, 
Prosperous Credit Pte Ltd v Gen Hwa Franchise International Pte Ltd
 
[1998] 2 SLR 649
). Much depends on the facts of each case and on whether the papers signed by the parties were part of the same transaction. In the present case, VJ knew that the documents were all part of the same transaction as he and RT signed separate guarantee documents pursuant to ING Bank’s letter of offer, which made it clear that the loan of US$700,000 was to be granted on the basis of guarantees executed by VJ, RT and HT. As for VJ’s claim that the signature on the acceptance copy of the said letter of offer was not his, this was a bare denial without any proof whatsoever. Furthermore, it was not pleaded that his signature had been forged. As such, VJ cannot avoid liability on the guarantee on the basis that he signed a different document from that signed by RT.
43        As for the negotiations undertaken by RT, there can be no doubt that VJ ought to have been consulted. A person who settles a claim by a creditor under a guarantee without informing and consulting his co-guarantor runs the risk that the latter may defend a claim for contribution on the basis that the creditor’s claim could have been resisted or that a settlement could have been reached on better terms.
44        In the present case, there was no concrete evidence that this was not a good settlement of ING Bank’s claim under the ING Bank guarantee. Although VJ asserted that the proper forum for the determination of ING Bank’s claim against RT is Indonesia, there was no doubt that RT, who had received legal advice, had done quite well by compromising ING Bank’s massive claim of US$700,000 for only US$200,000. This resulted in a savings of US$500,000 for all the co-guarantors. VJ benefited from this settlement because part of the deal between ING Bank and RT was that the former could no longer sue VJ and HT after the payment of the settlement sum. In view of this, VJ is liable for one-third of the US$200,000 paid by RT to ING Bank.
45        As far as his claim for a contribution under the ING Bank guarantee is concerned, RT is entitled to costs.

16 March 2005
 
Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          The appellant, Choa Joo Liang, was charged with possession of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) punishable under s 33 of the MDA. At the trial below, he was convicted of the charge, and sentenced to suffer death. The appellant appealed against the sentence. Having dismissed the appeal, we now set out our reasons.
The facts
2          On 20 October 2003, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) raided Block 537 Bukit Panjang Ring Road #19-831. After gaining entry, the officers proceeded to the master bedroom where they found the appellant squatting inside the attached toilet. The appellant was arrested. There were some packets on the toilet floor. When asked what they contained, the appellant replied that it was “
peh hoon
” (Hokkien slang for heroin). In all, six packets of granular substance and two bundles were recovered from the toilet floor. Two sachets of granular substance were also recovered from the toilet cabinet.
3          When asked whether there were any more drugs, the appellant replied that there were some more in the bedside table drawer and a paper carton box in the master bedroom. Seven envelopes each containing ten sachets of granular substance, two loose sachets of similar granular substance, as well as a significant sum of money, were recovered from the bedside table drawer. Four envelopes containing 21 sachets of granular substance were recovered from the carton box.
4          Various drug trafficking paraphernalia were also found. A rolling pin was recovered from the bedside table drawer. A digital weighing scale, a plastic spoon, a sealer, and some empty sachets were recovered from underneath the bed in the master bedroom.
5          Subsequently, the packets and sachets, as well as the various paraphernalia, were sent for analysis at the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). In all, the granular substances in the packets and sachets were found to contain a total of 103.15g of diamorphine. The rolling pin and digital weighing scale were also found to be stained with diamorphine.
6          During investigations, various statements were recorded from the appellant. In his cautioned statement, the appellant stated that he had nothing to say. Subsequently, in his long statement, the appellant admitted that he had told the CNB officers that the packets on the toilet floor contained heroin, and that they belonged to him. He also admitted to having told the officers that there were more drugs in the bedside table drawer and a paper carton box in the master bedroom. He also admitted that the money found in the bedside table drawer were earnings from his drug-trafficking activities.
7          Subsequently, in a further statement, the appellant admitted that he had engaged in drug-trafficking activities on two occasions. He would buy heroin, grind it down into finer form, scoop the heroin into empty sachets, weigh the sachets so that there would be 8g of heroin in one sachet, and use a sealer to seal the sachets. The appellant claimed that he consumed about one sachet per day. He admitted to selling the rest at $200.00 each.
The proceedings below
8          In all, the appellant faced three charges for drug-related offences under the MDA, including the trafficking charge. The Prosecution proceeded with the trafficking charge. The appellant informed the court that he wished to plead guilty, being fully aware that the trafficking charge carries a mandatory death sentence. As it was a capital charge, the trial judge did not accept the appellant’s plea, and directed the Prosecution to prove its case against the appellant. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, counsel for the appellant did not submit that there was no case to answer. The trial judge informed the appellant that he would call for the defence, and adjourned the hearing for the appellant to consider whether he wished to elect to give evidence or remain silent. Subsequently, the appellant elected to remain silent, and did not call any witnesses to give evidence on his behalf. He also did not challenge the admissibility of the statements of the various CNB and HSA officers, as well as the statements that were recorded from him. Counsel for the appellant also informed the court that they would not make any submissions.
9          The trial judge was of the view that there was clear and credible evidence, which was unchallenged, that the appellant had admitted that the large quantities of diamorphine found belonged to him, and that he had intended to pack most of them for sale and to consume some himself. The trial judge felt that the amount of diamorphine found was so large that any reduction, which could reasonably be made from the amount intended for self-consumption, would not reduce the amount to below the 15g level so that it would not attract the death sentence. In the circumstances, the trial judge convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced him to suffer death.
The appeal
10        In their petition of appeal, counsel for the appellant contended that the sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly excessive. In response, the Prosecution submitted that such a contention was untenable. The death sentence was mandatory, and it was the only sentence, and no other, that could be imposed in the circumstances. Subsequently, in their written submissions, counsel for the appellant conceded that they were unable to make any submissions that could persuade us to set aside the conviction or alter the sentence. 
11        Section 33 of the MDA is the operative section that creates the punishment for trafficking diamorphine. In turn, s 33 of the MDA makes reference to the Second Schedule to the MDA (“the Schedule”). The offence of trafficking diamorphine falls under s 5(4) of the first two columns of the Schedule. One then looks across to the sixth column for the prescribed punishments. The amount of diamorphine involved in the present case is 103.15g. The relevant section to refer to is therefore s 5(4)(b) of the first two columns of the Schedule, which provides for the offence of unauthorised trafficking of more than 15g of diamorphine. The punishment for the offence is clearly prescribed in the sixth column as “Death”.
12        In 
Nguyen Tuong Van v PP
 
[2005] 1 SLR 103
 (“
Nguyen Tuong Van
”), to which the Prosecution referred, this court had emphatically stated, and had put beyond doubt, that the death penalty prescribed in the MDA, in that case for importing more than 15g of diamorphine, is a 
mandatory
 sentence. In this regard, the court had expressed at [48]–[53] that:
48         … If Parliament had intended to confer on the sentencing court a discretion to impose a range of punishments, it could have provided for it. Further, if a range of sentences is prescribed for the import of a range of diamorphine below 15g and not less than 10g, it is illogical to think that Parliament would in respect of any unauthorised import of diamorphine of more than 15g confer a discretion on the sentencing court to impose any sentence up to the maximum sentence of death.
49         … As the DPP has submitted, it is beyond doubt that Parliament legislated the offence as punishable with the sentence of death. That is patently clear from a reading of the Hansard. When the mandatory death penalty was introduced for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine in 1975, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Education, who tabled the Bill, said (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (20 November 1975 at col 1382)):
The death penalty will … be imposed for the unauthorised import, export or trafficking of more than 30 grammes of morphine or more than 15 grammes of heroin.
… It is not intended to sentence petty morphine and heroin pedlars to death. It is, therefore, necessary to specify the quantity by weight, exceeding which the death penalty will be imposed. … For heroin any quantity in which the pure heroin [
ie
 diamorphine] content is above 15 grammes will attract the death penalty. … As a comparison, Iranian law provides for a mandatory death sentence where the trafficking only involves more than 10 grammes of heroin.
50         The object of the 1975 amendments to the MDA is therefore clear. An interpretation of the punishment for the offence under s 7(4)(b) and falling within the first and second columns of the Second Schedule of the MDA must promote that object, which is the imposition of the mandatory death penalty …
…
53         The punishment for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine is, in our view, prescribed expressly and in clear terms. There is but one sentence for the High court to impose and that is the sentence of death.
13        As the Prosecution rightly pointed out, 
Nguyen Tuong Van
 was applicable here. It was of no consequence that the present case involved the trafficking of diamorphine, whereas 
Nguyen Tuong Van
 involved the importing of diamorphine. This is because, firstly, the level that will attract the death penalty for both importing and trafficking diamorphine is the same, 
ie
, the 15g level. Secondly, just like for importing between 10g to 15g of diamorphine, the same range of sentences is also prescribed for trafficking not less than 10g but below 15g of diamorphine, 
ie
, a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment or life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Indeed, the wording on punishments set out in the Schedule in respect of the trafficking of diamorphine under s 5 is identical to that for the importing of diamorphine under s 7.
14        Accordingly, the ground of appeal
 that the sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly excessive could not succeed, when there is only but one sentence for the court below to impose, and that is the sentence of death.
Conclusion
15        In the light of the overwhelming and unchallenged evidence against the appellant, we could see why the appellant had elected to remain silent at the trial when the defence was called. For the same reason, we could also see why the appellant did not advance his case during the appeal. We dismissed the appeal, and affirmed the death sentence imposed on the appellant.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 This was an appeal against the decision of a district judge, in which Jagir Singh Touwana (“the appellant”) was convicted of parking at unbroken double yellow lines under r 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Road Traffic Rules”), and sentenced to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment, under s 131(1A) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”). The most recent version of the RTA is the 2004 revised edition, where s 131(1A) has been renumbered s 131(2). At the time the appellant was charged, however, only the 1997 revised edition of the RTA was in force. Accordingly, all mention of the RTA in this Grounds of Decision is made with reference to the 1997 revised edition.
2
         
 The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeals, and now set out my reasons.
The facts
3
         
 The appellant was charged with parking at unbroken double yellow lines on 22 October 2003 at about 7.44pm, along Upper Serangoon Road. There was no dispute that the appellant had stopped his car on three occasions along this road on this date and at about this time, and that there were unbroken double yellow lines along this stretch of road. The only issue in contention at the trial below was whether the appellant’s actions had amounted to “parking” as defined in s 2 of the RTA. Section 2 of the RTA states that to “park” means “to bring a motor vehicle or a trailer to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage”.
4
         
 The Prosecution’s case was that Mardiono bin Tukiman (“PW1”), a uniformed traffic warden, was carrying out enforcement duties at the material time. He saw the appellant’s car stop along Upper Serangoon Road, just outside a 
nasi lemak
 stall. After about ten seconds, PW1 waved to the driver of the car to move on. The appellant drove on and stopped for about 30 seconds at a second position, which was only a few metres further down the road. PW1 started to key in the registration number of the appellant’s car into his portable handheld terminal. The appellant subsequently moved to a third position along the same road and stopped for about 30 seconds, before finally moving away altogether. All three positions were along the same road with the double yellow lines. During PW1’s entire observation of the car, he did not see any persons, goods or luggage being taken up or set down. There was also no obstruction in front of the car, and the car could have moved off easily. PW1 observed that the appellant only signalled to filter out after he had stopped for the third time.
5
         
 The appellant, however, claimed that he had dropped off his wife, Malkit Kaur (“DW2”), and a family friend, Karthiani d/o Mani Nair (“DW3”), at the 
nasi lemak
 stall on the day of the alleged offence to buy dinner, and had driven off immediately after that. He did not see PW1 waving at him. However, as there was heavy traffic in the lane to his right and a stationary lorry in his lane obstructing his path, he had to stop at the second position, a few metres further down the road. He then saw PW1 approaching his car from behind, and waited because he wanted to tell PW1 that he intended to drive away and was not parking there. As PW1 did not reach his car, he again moved forward to drive away. However, he had to stop at the third position, as he still could not enter the lane on his right due to heavy traffic. He was only able to filter into the right lane from the third position.
The decision below
6
         
 The trial judge found PW1 to be an honest, forthright and candid witness, and believed his version of the events (see 
[2004] SGDC 279
). He found that the appellant had been at the three positions for ten seconds, 30 seconds and 30 seconds respectively. The trial judge reasoned that PW1 could have seen the appellant’s car after the appellant’s wife and friend had alighted. He found that after the appellant’s wife and friend had alighted, the appellant was probably waiting for them to finish purchasing the food from the 
nasi lemak
 stall, but when the appellant realised the presence of PW1, he had moved the car slightly further down the road and stopped again. The appellant had waited for PW1 to approach, but PW1 did not do so.
7
         
 The trial judge found that there was no obstruction blocking the appellant’s path, and there was thus no lawful excuse for the appellant to wait as he did at the first and second positions after his passengers had alighted. At the second position, the appellant’s wait in order for PW1 to approach him did not constitute a lawful reason for him to remain there. At the third position, illegal parking had also occurred until such time as the appellant had formed his intention to filter out. Accordingly, the appellant was sentenced under s 131(1A) of the RTA to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment.
Appeal against conviction
8
         
 I found it helpful to group the appellant’s grounds of contention into four broad categories, which were that:
(a)
       
 The trial judge had placed too much weight on the testimony of PW1, even though PW1 was evasive in his answers throughout his cross-examination and there were glaring inconsistencies in his evidence.
(b)
       
 PW1 had booked the appellant because he felt that the appellant was challenging him after he had waved him on, and PW1, in the circumstances, had over-reacted to the situation.
(c)
       
 The trial judge was biased.
(d)
       
 The trial judge had prevented the appellant from cross-examining one Esther Chong (“PW2”), by saying that the appellant was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by cross-examining PW1 and that he had done a fine job. This had raised the expectations of the appellant, thereby preventing further cross-examination of PW2.
9
         
 I now deal with each ground in turn.
Whether the trial judge was wrong to place too much weight on the testimony of PW1
10
       
 I found that although there were instances of evasiveness during PW1’s cross-examination and there were some inconsistencies in his evidence, the trial judge had made a finding of fact that PW1 was an honest, forthright and candid witness, and had chosen to believe his evidence. It is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or clearly reached against the weight of evidence. This is because an appellate court has not seen or heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings and his reasons: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
; 
Teo Kian Leong v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 147
.
 In particular, where findings of fact hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, an appellate court should be slow to overturn these findings of fact: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
 As a result, I could only overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact if they were plainly wrong or clearly reached against the weight of evidence.
11
       
 PW1 was evasive when he was asked whether he was behind the appellant’s car when he waved at the car to move away, and whether he thought that it was necessary to ask the appellant why he had stopped before taking down the appellant’s number. PW1 was also evasive when he was questioned as to whether it was possible that passengers had alighted from the appellant’s car before he saw the car. Further, PW1 had mentioned that when he saw the car, it was already at a stationary position, but with the brake lights still on. He was evasive when he was questioned as to whether he was suggesting that the brake lights were still on because the vehicle had just come to a stop.
 
12
       
 I was of the opinion that PW1’s evasiveness went towards facts that were not material to the appellant’s conviction. First, PW1 was not obliged to give the appellant a chance to explain himself before issuing a summons against him. Second, PW1 was clear in his evidence that he had not seen anyone getting into or alighting from the car at the three stationary positions that he observed the car to be in. Since that was the case, whether or not passengers had indeed alighted from the appellant’s car before PW1 saw the car was irrelevant. So long as the appellant had not driven away from the double yellow lines after he had allowed his passengers to alight, he would be guilty of the offence in question.
13
       
 As a result, I found that the fact that PW1 was evasive during his cross-examination did not show that the trial judge was plainly wrong in accepting his evidence. However, PW1 was inconsistent in his testimony on the crucial issue of whether the road in front of the appellant was obstructed. If the appellant had intended to drive away but was prevented from doing so because the road was obstructed, he would not be guilty of the offence of illegal parking. In this regard, PW1 first gave evidence that there was a vehicle about 25m to 30m ahead of the appellant’s car, and the vehicle was moving along the lane. He did not see a stationary lorry. He subsequently gave evidence that he was only concentrating on the appellant’s car, and that he was not sure if he could see the lane in front of the car. When PW1 later gave evidence in Malay with the help of a Malay interpreter, the trial judge again questioned him on this issue. PW1 then said that he could see the lane in front of the appellant’s car clearly up to a distance of about 30m. There was a bus stop in front of the car, and the nearest bus was about 25m away. There were no other cars in the lane. During his re-examination, PW1 reiterated that there was no obstruction in the lane in front of the appellant’s car, and the appellant was free to drive off.
14
       
 Although PW1 had given inconsistent evidence on the issue of whether the road in front of the appellant was obstructed, I bore in mind the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to determine the credibility of the evidence given by each witness, and he had found that PW1 was a credible witness. Moreover, I was of the opinion that the evidence given by the Defence on this issue was equally inconsistent. The appellant testified that there was a stationary lorry in the first lane on the left. This lorry was about 20 ft and some three to four car lengths away, and was involved in the unloading of goods. DW2, however, initially said that there were two vehicles within 1.5m in front of the appellant’s car, and passengers were alighting from these vehicles. She could not remember what these vehicles were. Subsequently, DW2 testified that these vehicles were cars, and she did not remember seeing a bus or a lorry.
15
       
 It was therefore clear to me that the evidence given by the Defence as to whether the lane in front of the appellant’s car was blocked was just as contradictory as the evidence given by PW1. In the case of the Prosecution, I also noted that after PW1 got a Malay interpreter, he gave clear evidence that he could see the lane in front of the appellant’s car, and that there were no obstructions. In these circumstances, I found that as the trial judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of the various witnesses when they gave evidence in court, he was justified in coming to the finding of fact that there was no obstruction in front of the appellant’s car. There was thus no reason for me to disturb this finding.
16
       
 There were also other discernible inconsistencies in PW1’s evidence. PW1 had given inconsistent evidence as to whether the appellant had seen him approaching the car when the car stopped for the first time along the double yellow lines. However, I found that this was an immaterial discrepancy that had no direct bearing on whether the appellant had committed the offence in question. Whether the appellant moved off because he saw PW1 waving him off or whether he had driven away of his own accord was immaterial, because PW1 was not obliged to give the appellant a chance to move off. As I noted in 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
, in such a case the trial judge was entitled to find that the immaterial discrepancy did not detract from the general veracity of the prosecution witness on the material issues.
17
       
 As a result, I found that despite the fact that PW1 was evasive and that there were certain inconsistencies in his evidence, it could not be said that the trial judge was plainly wrong in accepting his evidence. PW1 had given clear evidence about the other material elements of the offence: that the car had stopped three times, for ten seconds, 30 seconds and 30 seconds respectively; and that he had not seen anyone getting into or alighting from the car during these three periods. In this regard, I noted that although DW2 and DW3 initially testified that the appellant must have seen them alighting from the car, DW3 later agreed with the prosecuting officer that when she alighted from the vehicle, she could not be sure whether PW1 was looking at the appellant’s vehicle or at some other vehicle. As PW1 could well have been looking at something else when DW2 and DW3 alighted, I found that the trial judge was justified in finding that PW1 could have first seen the appellant’s car only after DW2 and DW3 had alighted.
18
       
 The highly unsatisfactory evidence adduced by the Defence fortified my holding that the trial judge was not plainly wrong in accepting PW1’s evidence. First, the appellant’s contention that he formed his intention to filter out of his lane after his passengers had alighted was clearly unmeritorious. The appellant had alleged that this intention could be seen from the fact that he had turned on his car’s signal light when he was at the first position. However, the appellant had not mentioned that he had turned on the signal light during his examination-in-chief and when he put his case to PW1. He only mentioned this when the court questioned him on this issue. If he had truly formed the intention to filter out from the left lane from the start, he would have mentioned the fact that he had turned on his signal light when he was cross-examining PW1, because he would then be able to show that PW1 was wrong in taking down his particulars when it was obvious that he was trying to filter out of the left lane. In this regard, I found that the trial judge’s reasoning was cogent and convincing. Also, if the appellant’s signal light were indeed turned on, he would not have had to wait for PW1 to walk over to tell PW1 that he was not parking and intended to move away. This would have been apparent from his signal light. The appellant’s further explanation that the signal was automatically cancelled when his steering wheel was straightened also did not fit in with his version of the events, because, as the trial judge reasoned, if the appellant had indeed maintained his steering wheel in a position ready to filter out, the steering wheel would not have been straightened, and the signal light would have remained turned on.
19
       
 Second, I found that the evidence given by DW2 was extremely dubious. I found that the trial judge was once again cogent in his reasoning that DW2’s evidence was unreliable. DW2 had given evidence that after she had alighted from the appellant’s car, she had seen the appellant’s car two lanes to the right of the extreme left lane. She also pointed out on a photograph the position where she saw the appellant’s car. However, as a matter of logic, it was impossible for the appellant to have reached that particular position, because that position was too near to the original position of the car when it had stopped to allow DW2 to alight. Further, DW2 had also claimed that she saw PW1 writing down the vehicle’s registration number on paper, but PW1 had in reality used his portable handheld terminal to key in the car numbers of motorists who had parked at the unbroken double yellow lines.
20
       
 Third, I found that there were also contradictions between the evidence given by DW3 and the evidence given by the appellant. The appellant had given evidence that there were no buses behind his car when he stopped, but DW3 had said that there were a few buses behind the appellant’s car.
21
       
 I was therefore of the opinion that the evidence adduced from the defence witnesses was contradictory and highly unsatisfactory. In these circumstances, I had no doubt that the trial judge was not plainly wrong, and it was not against the weight of evidence, for him to accept PW1’s evidence over the evidence of the defence witnesses.
Whether PW1 had booked the appellant because he felt that the appellant was challenging him after he had waved him on, and whether PW1 had over-reacted to the situation
22
       
 The reason why the appellant could have thought that PW1 had booked him for challenging PW1’s authority was because of a sentence that PW1 had said during his cross-examination. PW1 had stated, “It appeared as if the driver was challenging me.” PW1 had said this when he was trying to explain why the appellant had driven the car forward and then stopped at the second stationary position, after PW1 had waved the car to move on. However, I noted that upon further questioning by the appellant on this sentence, PW1 had made it clear in court that he did not feel any animosity towards the appellant, but felt that he had to be tactful in carrying out his duty. I therefore found that there was no basis to hold that PW1 had issued a summons against the appellant only because PW1 had felt that the appellant was challenging him, and he wanted to assert his authority over the appellant.
23
       
 In any case, I found that whether PW1 had over-reacted to the situation and booked the appellant only because he felt that the appellant was challenging him was irrelevant, as there was no obligation on PW1 to give the appellant a chance to move away before taking down his particulars. For the charge against the appellant to be made out, all that had to be proved was that the appellant had parked at the side of the road and that there was no lawful excuse for the appellant to have done so. As I held above, the trial judge was not plainly wrong in finding that the appellant had indeed stopped three times at the side of the road and that there was no lawful excuse for the appellant to do so. In these circumstances, I found that the charge against the appellant had been made out, and the motive that PW1 had in booking the appellant was irrelevant.
Whether the trial judge was biased
24
       
 The appellant argued that the trial judge had presided over the case with a “pre-judged mind” after having uttered the following sentence during the pre-trial conference: “If it is not parking then what is it?” The appellant also argued that the trial judge appeared to be “prosecution-minded”, as he claimed that his complaint about the prosecution officer’s conduct, as well as an inappropriate remark allegedly uttered in court by the prosecution officer, was dismissed without any queries.
25
       
 I found that the appellant’s claim was frivolous, and did not meet the high threshold required for an argument of bias to succeed. For the appellant to succeed in his argument, apparent bias would suffice and there was no need to prove actual bias: 
Mohamed Ferooz v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 345
.
 The test to be applied in order to determine if the judge was biased was set out in 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
 at 338: Would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the appellant was not possible?
26
       
 I found that the appellant made a wholly unsubstantiated allegation against the trial judge. It was evident from the Notes of Evidence and the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision that he had reached his findings through logical reasoning and a detailed examination of the evidence given by both parties. A reasonable person would not suspect that a fair trial for the appellant had not taken place. There was absolutely no basis for the appellant to ask for a re-trial based on the fact that the trial judge was biased. I therefore dismissed this ground of appeal summarily.
Whether the trial judge had prevented the appellant from cross-examining PW2
27
       
 PW2 was an investigating officer with the Traffic Police Division. The appellant submitted that during the trial, the trial judge had told the appellant that he was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by cross-examining PW1 and that the appellant had done a fine job. This had raised the expectations of the appellant, thereby preventing him from further cross-examining PW2.
28
       
 I noted that in the Notes of Evidence, there was no record of the trial judge telling the appellant that he was only required to raise a reasonable doubt by cross-examining PW1, and that the appellant had done a good job. In any case, even if the trial judge had indeed told the appellant that, there was force in the Prosecution’s submission that it was not surprising for a trial judge to offer a lay person who conducted his own defence appropriate guidance on aspects of trial procedure. Further, it was difficult to see what the appellant would achieve by a cross-examination of PW2, whose role was merely to prepare the charge, interview the reporting officer and prepare for trial. Given that PW2 had not actually observed the incident on the day in question, it was unlikely that her evidence would be able to assist the appellant in overturning his conviction.
29
       
 In light of the above, I concluded that the appellant’s grounds of appeal against his conviction were wholly unmeritorious. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.
Appeal against sentence
30
       
 The appellant also submitted that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive, in view of the appellant’s clean record and the fact that the offence was a minor one with no aggravating factors.
31
       
 A comparison of this case with sentencing precedents revealed that a fine of $700 was not manifestly excessive. Due to a dearth of authorities concerning the direct issue of parking at unbroken double yellow lines, I also examined similar cases on the issue of illegal parking.
32
       
 In 
Tan Soo Phuan v PP
 
[2001] SGDC 249
, the accused was charged with parking opposite double white lines, an offence under r 22(A) of the Road Traffic Rules read with s 83 of the RTA and punishable under s 131(1)(d) of the RTA. Section 131(1)(d) set out the same penalty as that found in s 131(1A) of the RTA. This case was not directly relevant to the present case, as the accused in 
Tan Soo Phuan v PP
 was a subsequent offender and was thus subject to a different sentencing tariff. What was relevant, however, was the fact that one of the accused’s antecedents was for parking at unbroken double yellow lines under r 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules. The accused was fined $1,000 for that offence.
33
       
 In 
Teo Kay Hoe v PP
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 248 of 2000, unreported judgment dated 21 September 2000), the accused was convicted of parking within a “Demerit Points No Parking” zone in contravention of r 24A of the Road Traffic Rules and punishable under s 131(1)(d) of the RTA. He was fined $600, and in default thereof, one week’s imprisonment, for the offence.
34
       
 In 
PP v Theseira Noel Edmund
 
[2003] SGDC 328
, the accused was also convicted for parking within a “Demerit Points No Parking” zone. Although the decision only dealt with the accused’s appeal against his conviction at the District Court level, the sentence imposed by the Magistrate’s Court in that case was instructive. The accused was sentenced to a fine of $700, and in default thereof, seven days’ imprisonment, by the Magistrate’s Court.
35
       
 It could be seen from these cases that the fine imposed in such cases of illegal parking was about the same or higher than that imposed in the present case. In light of these sentencing precedents, I was of the opinion that a fine of $700 in this case was not manifestly excessive, even though there were no aggravating factors and the appellant had no antecedents.
Conclusion
36
       
 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed both appeals against conviction and sentence.

10 March 2005
                                                                                                     
District Judge Lee Poh Choo
1          The First Plaintiffs are the Administrators of the Estate of C (“the Deceased”), and brought this action for the benefit of the dependents of the Deceased and  the estate of the Deceased.  The Second Plaintiff who was 3 years old at the time of accident, was the daughter of the Deceased.  Her claim is made by her father on her behalf.  The Deceased was a pedestrian crossing the Upper Paya Lebar Road near the junction of New Industrial Road on 2 March 2002 when she was hit by a car registration number [xxx] driven  by HB.
Background facts
2.         On 2 March 2002, at about 7.33 a.m., HB was driving along Upper Paya Lebar Road towards the direction of Paya Lebar Road. Near or within  the yellow box junction of New Industrial Road, HB’s car collided into a pedestrian (the Deceased) who was crossing the road from the centre divider. The Deceased sustained severe injuries and was conveyed to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. She died the following day without regaining consciousness.
3.         The Plaintiffs alleged that the accident was caused by or in the alternative, contributed to by the negligence of the HB in the driving, management and/or control of the car.  The particulars of the negligence were set out in the Statement of Claim :
(a)        Driving at a speed which was excessive in the circumstance;
(b)        Failing to keep any or a proper look-out/or to have any or any sufficient regard for pedestrians or other road users who were or might reasonably be expected to be on the road;
(c)        Failing to notice the Deceased at all or in sufficient time so as to avoid the collision;
(d)        Failing to sound the horn of the car or to otherwise howsoever warn the Deceased of her approach;
(e)        Failing to take any special care or to give any attention when approaching a junction in the said road;
(f)         Failing to take any or any special or sufficient care when approaching a left bend in the said road;
(g)        Failing to brake in time or at all so as to avoid the collision;
(h)        Colliding into the Deceased; and
(i)         Failing to stop, slow down, swerve or in any other way so to manage or control the vehicle so as to avoid colliding into the Deceased.
4.         In her defence, HB asserted that the accident was caused solely or contributed to by the Deceased. The particulars of the Deceased’s alleged negligence were :
(a)        Crossing at the stretch of the road that was within 50 meters from an overhead bridge;
(b)        Failing to use the overhead bridge for the purpose of crossing the road, in contravention of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossing) Rules [Rule 3(1)];
(c)        Emerging from behind the promotional signboard and the railing of the centre road divider suddenly and unexpectedly;
(d)        Failing to observe the traffic and the approach of the Defendant’s car before stepping off onto the road;
(e)        Dashing onto and across the road;
(f)         Crossing the road at the stretch where there was a right bend and where there was a promotional signboard which would have obstructed the Deceased’s view of the road and obstructed the view of the motorists travelling along the road of the Deceased’s presence at the centre road divider; and
(g)        Crossing the road in a careless and dangerous manner.
Features of Upper Paya Lebar Road and Other Factors
5.         This was a dual carriageway with 3 lanes of traffic in either direction. The opposing traffic was separated by a raised turf median with trees planted along the centre of the median.  In this trial, this turf median was referred to as the “centre divider”. There was a single row of metal railings running along the centre divider. Photographs “AB 123 to AB 130” captured the setting of the place.
Another  important feature was that the stretch of Upper Paya Lebar Road leading to the accident site was not straight. There was a  bend from left to right, then the road  straightened out and  led  to the junction where the accident took place. Defence tendered photographs “DB 1 to DB 6”  taken by E (DW1) to emphasize this bend. The Traffic Police also had  photographs taken of this same bend but from a different angle, these were “AB 123, AB127 and AB128”.   There were  traffic warning signs (seen in “AB 123”) which  warned motorists of the bend and to slow down their vehicle speed.  After the bend was the stretch of straight road leading to the accident scene. The two experts - Tay Beng Hee (DW 3) and  Liaw Leong San Jason (PW 5), gave different estimates of the distance of this stretch of straight road.  The accident site and the Uper Paya Lebar Road  had since been subject to construction and change and it was not possible to revisit the location to obtain precise measurements of the road bend and the stretch of straight road. The precise location at the junction where the car impacted the Deceased was also not known. At the time of the accident, the weather was fine, visibility was clear  and the road surface was dry. HB claimed that there were trees, promotional signboards and other structures along the centre divider which obstructed the driver’s view.  The brakes of the car [xxx]  were in serviceable condition, i.e. there were no mechanical defects.
6.         Other than the alleged obstructions at the centre divider, there did not seem to be factors that could have caused or contributed to the accident. Hence, the accident must have been caused by HB or the Deceased or by both.
Evidence
7.         There were no eye witnesses to the fatal accident. The witnesses who testified were after-fact witnesses who went to the accident scene after the event or who did not visit  the accident scene.   F  who was 10 years old at the time of the accident, was a passenger in the car but was asleep. He was awaken by a loud bang, then he glimpsed a “blurry black” and saw the cracked windscreen. HB could not throw much light either.  Essentially, her evidence was that all of a sudden a lady was there infront, she stepped hard on the brake but could not avoid hitting the lady. 
Evidence of Accident Reconstruction Experts
8.         Two experts in traffic accident investigations and reconstruction gave evidence. The 2 experts - Liaw Leong Suan Jayson (PW 5) and Tay Beng Hee (DW 3) gave markedly different views.
9.         In his Report, Mr Tay concluded that the road just before the collision point was a right bend and the motorcar driver’s view of a potential pedestrian on the center divider was likely to be blocked by the tree, lamp post, railings and other possible structures on the center divider.  However, in cross-examination, Mr Tay agreed that there were no obstructions that could have blocked the driver’s view. He also stated in his Report that the car was likely to be travelling within speed range of 31 kmph to 67kmph prior to the accident.  In fact, he felt it reasonable to conclude that the actual speed was well below 40 kmph.  Then, considering the time available for the driver to respond when she saw the pedestrian step onto the road, it was impossible for the driver to stop the car in time to avoid the collision. He felt that the Deceased caused the accident by suddenly stepping onto the road, onto the path of HB’s car.
10.       The other expert, Liaw Leong Suan Jayson, estimated the pre-impact speed of the car by considering the physical damage caused to the car, in particular, by the pedestrian’s head striking against the windscreen, causing it to shatter in a spiderweb pattern. Referring to the Luis Martinez Chart, he estimated the pre-impact speed to be in the region of 72 kmph. He also concluded that the single brake mark found on the road could not have been made or belong to [xxx]. There should be 2 parallel brake lines as this was a mechanically sound vehicle.  Chay Kim Pang (PW3), from the Police Logistics department held the same view. Jayson Liaw also concluded that the deceased could not have stepped out onto the path of the passing vehicle suddenly as she was already about 1.75 to 1.90 meters from the center divider when the car struck her. The Deceased’s obese weight and that she was pregnant were taken to be factors which must have slowed down her movements. He therefore, concluded that the Defendant was probably not keeping a proper lookout on the traffic conditions or exercising due care and thereby caused the accident.
11.       After careful consideration of their evidence, I accepted Mr Jayson Liaw’s Report and evidence over Mr Tay’s.  I felt that Mr Tay’s Report and evidence fell short on objectivity, and was very likely to be influenced  by other considerations.  As the Plaintiff’s Counsel noted, Mr Tay received specific instructions on what his Report was required to contain. I quote the relevant part of the email “DB 22” from the insurers who engaged K.K.Lau (Mr Tay’s employer) :-
“……………………
As the case develops, the plaintiffs (administrators of the estate of the deceased) has engaged an accident investigator and reconstructionist expert named Liaw Leong San Jayson to support their case who has concluded with an outcome which is 
not in our favour
[emphasis is mine]. He has quoted that “the Defendant must have been inattentive when driving.”
In order to rebut Mr Liaw’s allegation
]emphasis is mine] of the same, please proceed to handle the case on our behalf …………………..”
It was further revealed in  cross examination, that prior to putting up his Report, Mr Tay had separately met and discussed Jayson Liaw’s Report with his employer Mr K.K.Lau and Defence Counsel, Miss Adeline Chong.  Mr Tay read all the AEICs for this trial and Jayson’s Report before he started to prepare his own Report. In view of these, I felt that Mr Tay had a specific objective when he prepared his Report and I am doubtful that he was independent and unbiased.
Was HB driving at excessive speed ?
12.       The speed limit for this stretch of Upper Paya Lebar Road was 50 kmph.  Brake marks on the road as well as the distance between the body on the road and where the car came to a rest after the accident are information usually used for computation of the pre-impact speed of the car. In this case, such information could not be relied upon.  The Investigation Officer Pamela Goh Geok Lye (“Ms Pamela”)  testified that when she arrived at the accident scene, the car had been removed from the scene and was parked at New Industrial Road. She also did not see the Deceased’s body on the road, presumably, the body had been conveyed to the hospital. She saw only one brake mark on the road and 
suspected
 this mark was made by HB’s car and recorded this into her Sketch Plan of Traffic Accident “AB 72"" and AB 73”. It seems to me that  Ms Pamela  did not attempt to verify this and admitted that she did not know for fact if the brake mark was made by HB’s car.  Neither did she find out where the car was immediately after the collision and before it was moved.  Chay Kim Pang (PW 3) from the Police Logistics Department inspected  the car [xxx]  testified that it was unusual  for a car with no mechanical defects to cause only a single line of brake mark. According to him, there should be 2 parallel brake marks formed by the 2 front wheels, and the marks made by the 2 rear wheels will follow the marks made by the front wheels. These were the views propounded by the expert, Jayson Liaw.  Other than HB saying that she stepped hard on the brakes, there was no evidence that she did apply the brakes with such  force as to cause any brake mark.  Another consideration was  that her son, F,  was awakened from his sleep by a loud bang.  There was no mention by F or HB that they were thrown forward or jolted as they would have experienced if HB  did apply the brakes  forcefully. F was not  awaken from his sleep by a jolt or sudden forceful physical movement but was awaken by a loud bang.  In view of these, I find it highly unlikely  that the  single brake mark belonged to [xxx] .
13.       There was no measurement recorded of the distance between the Deceased’s body  and the car immediately after the accident. HB said  the Deceased’s body was 1 meter away from her car after the collision.  Evidence adduced showed she was in state of shock after the accident and she did not get out of the car to look where the Deceased laid on the road. Hence, I doubt the accuracy of  HB’s estimate of this distance of 1 meter. In addition, this estimate was made  months after the accident occurred.
14.       Hence, I accepted Jayson Liaw’s  method of estimating the pre-impact speed by the level where the Deceased’s head hit the car windscreen.  I accept that the large size and nature of the spiderweb shatter of the windscreen must have been caused by the head and not other parts of the body. I believe the car must have been speeding at over the permitted speed limit.  The impact  when the speeding car hit the Deceased caused the force sufficient to fling the Deceased who weighed 82 kg, onto about the mid level of the windscreen, shattering it. 
Could HB have avoided the accident?
15.       The defence’s case was that the Deceased suddenly appeared infront of her car, about 5 meters ahead,  and she could not avoid colliding into the Deceased.   From both experts’ Reports and their testimony, it  is accepted that the Deceased was 1.75 to 1.9 meters from the centre divider when the car struck her.  The Deceased was obese and pregnant.  I agree with Jayson Liaw that she would be slower in her movements and therefore would have taken longer time to cover the 1.75 to 1.9 meters. She could not have suddenly stepped onto the road and covered this distance in a flash.
16.       There were variations in the experts’ estimate of the distance of  the straight stretch of Upper Paya Lebar Road after the bend,  and which led up to the accident site. Mr Tay said it was about 25 meters while  Jayson Liaw estimated  it at about 30 meters. Photographs also show that after the bend, the driver’s view was not obstructed by tree, lamp post, railings or other possible structures.  Mr Tay also agreed to this fact when he gave evidence. After the road bend, HB had an unobstructed view ahead of her for a stretch of 25 to 30 meters.  During the trial, defence conceded that there were no promotional signboard at the centre divider as was pleaded in the Defence.  This meant that the Deceased standing at the centre divider, had an unobstructed view of on coming cars. I do not believe that the Deceased would suddenly step directly onto the path of and right infront of a car which  she had an unobstructed view of.  If HB had been attentive, she would, as she came round the bend, have seen the Deceased who was of a significant size, near the centre road divider. And, if she had been driving at the speed of 40 kmph as she claimed, she would have the distance of 25 to 30 meters  to react and avert the fatal accident.  HB’s evidence was that she stepped on the brakes and 
shut her eyes
. She admitted she did not take any other actions. She did not sound the horn, flash the headlights or swerve to avoid the pedestrian. 
17.       In view of the aforesaid,  there is no doubt that HB was driving much too fast, and certainly much faster than the 40 kmph she claimed or 31 kmph which the expert Mr Tay calculated.  I find that her manner of handling the car, her non attentiveness and her reaction on seeing the Deceased, was a cause of the accident. Clearly she had breached her duty to take care and was negligent.
Deceased contributed to the accident
18.       There was an overhead pedestrian bridge about 50 meters from where the Deceased attempted to cross the road but there was no evidence that it was boarded up with no access as suggested by Plaintiff’s Counsel. Walking across the road was undoubtedly a more convenient way of getting to the other side of the road than walking 50 meters away to climb the overhead pedestrian bridge. This however, did not reduce the Deceased’s culpability.  The Deceased by choosing to cross the road at this junction, must have been aware of the dangers of cars coming round the bend.   There is no doubt that she was also to blame for the accident. The question is the extent to which she was at fault. As is often said, there is no mathematical formula for apportioning liability between the Deceased and the driver. It is an exercise in discretion, taking into account the causative and relevant factors.  Both Counsel did not submit on the extent of the Deceased’s contributory negligence.
19.       Having carefully considered all the material facts, I made a finding that the defendant was the principal author of this accident. The defendant, could have avoided the accident, or avoided such a tragic accident, had she travelled within the speed limit, kept a proper lookout and taken actions to avert the tragedy instead of shutting her eyes. All circumstances considered, I am of the view that HB, the driver was far more at fault and has to bear a greater share of the responsibility for the accident. For the apportionment, I obtained guidance from  the  case of 
Tan Ngo Hwa & Anor v Siew Mun Phui (1998)SGHC 14,
 where the defendant knocked down a pedestrian who should have used a pedestrian crossing which was within 50 meters away. Rubin J ruled that the defendant was liable to the pedestrian for 70% of the damages.  I therefore held the defendant 70% responsible for the accident.
20.       I also assessed the damages. On a 100% basis, the quantum was as follows:
Special damages - $12,452.60/=
Bereavement    -  $10,000/=
Pain & suffering -  $1,000/=
Loss of Dependency for Deceased’s parents - $6,000/=
Loss of Dependency for 2
nd
 Plaintiff        - $86,400/=
The quantum was reduced by 30% in view of the Deceased’s contributory negligence.
I also awarded costs for the action in the Plaintiffs’ favour.
21.       The Defendant has appealed against the apportion of liability and that the Defendant was liable to pay costs.",2005-03-10 00:00:00,SG District Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1          The plaintiff is a company incorporated and having its registered office in Germany. It was at all material times the manufacturers of rolled steel which it sold and supplied to its customers, one of whom was the first defendant. The first defendant was subsequently placed under receivership by one of its creditors, the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC Bank”). The second and third defendants were the receivers and managers appointed by OCBC Bank. The plaintiff obtained judgment against the first defendant for breach of contract on account of unpaid bills.
2          The claim against the second and third defendants (“the other defendants”) was for damages for the tort of conversion. The plaintiff’s claim was based on a retention of title clause in the contract between it and the first defendant. By 26 January 2003, the other defendants had sold all the goods in their custody to a third party, but prior to that had released a portion to the plaintiff. This portion represented the goods identified in a joint inspection by the plaintiff and the other defendants (“the disputed goods”). The plaintiff claimed that apart from the disputed goods, the total goods converted were valued at €255,000 as at 26 November 2003, but prices for steel had since risen and the value claimed was now €331,000. The plaintiff was also claiming storage costs of the disputed goods, on the ground that it was unable to sell the goods because of the other defendants’ objections. The storage charges claimed amounted to $200,287.62, being $22,254.18 a month for nine months. The plaintiff was also claiming a sum of $5,037.23 for some other steel sold by the other defendants in November 2003.
3          The other defendants denied that the retention of title clause was a valid clause in the contract. Their defence was two-fold. Firstly, they argued that the clause was not validly incorporated into the sale contracts. Secondly, they argued that even if the said clause had been incorporated, it was not applicable because the clause was not “transparent, clear and comprehensible”. In the first case, Mr Lee Eng Beng, counsel for the defendants, submitted that the contract was a standard-form contract, and had not been validly notified to the first defendant in a commonly understood language, as required under German law. He submitted that the English version that the plaintiff produced as proof of notification, was, in fact, lifted from another contract to which the first defendant was not a party. Moreover, it was plagiarised from another German supplier’s standard form.
4          The contract in question between the plaintiff and the first defendant was in the German language and signed on 16 August 1999. The relevant part of the retention of title clause in the English version purportedly given to the first defendant reads as follows:
1.         All goods delivered shall remain our property (goods in which title is retained) until all accounts receivable from Purchaser are settled. This shall also apply to future and conditional claims, 
eg
 from acceptor’s bills of exchange.
2.         Machining and processing of the goods in which title is retained shall take place on our behalf as our being the manufacturer in the meaning of Art 950 BGB (Civil Code), without any obligation on our part deriving therefrom. The machined and processed goods shall be deemed to be goods in which title is retained in the meaning of para 1.
3.         If the goods in which title is retained are processed, combined and mixed with other goods by Purchaser, we shall have joint title to the resultant merchandise, proportionally in the amount of the invoiced value of the goods in which title is retained. If by such combining, mixing or processing our title ceased to exist, Purchaser shall hereby assign to us the proprietary/prospective rights to which Purchaser is entitled in the new products, proportionally in the amount of the invoiced value of the goods. In such case Purchaser shall keep the new products in custody for us free of costs. In proportion to our co-ownership rights the new products shall be deemed to be goods in which title is retained as defined under para 1.
5          According to the plaintiff’s Mr Holzapfel, the English version was only given in or about December 2001. There was no dispute that German law governed the contract and both sides called expert evidence in respect of that law. The plaintiff relied on Dr Christof Siefarth, and the defendants on Miss Birgitta von Dresky. The two German lawyers agreed that the contract in question was a standard-term contract and it was further agreed that in such contracts, the party who produced the standard terms was obliged to give the other party a reasonable opportunity to note the contents of the terms. The evidence of German law that was not in dispute is that the “text of standard form conditions has to be presented in the language of negotiations or in a world language by the presenter only if the opposing party explicitly requested to do so”. This is itself a translation of the Court of Appeals of Naumburg’s decision of 19 June 2003 (File No 2 O 68/02, published: NJOZ 2004, vol 01, p 14).
6          However, Dr Siefarth stated that the right to notification applied only before the parties had concluded the contract. Mr Lee Eng Beng, counsel for the defendant, accepted that this was so, but his argument was that the disputed goods were not sold in a single contract, but a series of contracts. Each sale was thus a separate contract. In this regard, he did not accept Dr Siefarth’s opinion that the contract document in question provided a “framework agreement” under which all the sales were carried out. Miss von Dresky also disagreed with Dr Siefarth. Her opinion was that the contract in question was a standard-form contract and not a “framework agreement”.
7          The proper English version of the relevant clauses, according to Miss von Dresky,
[1]
 
should be as follows:
1.         All goods delivered shall remain our property (“Goods in which Title is Retained”) until all accounts receivable, in particular also the respective balance in our favour regardless of its cause in law, are settled. This shall also apply if payment is made in regard to specifically designated claims.
2.         Machining and processing of the Goods in which Title is Retained shall take place for us as the manufacturer in the meaning of Act 950 BGB (German Civil Code), without any obligation on our part. The agreed goods are deemed to be Goods in which Title is Retained in the meaning of paragraph 1. If the Goods in which Title is Retained are processed, combined and mixed with other goods by purchaser, we shall have joint title to the new goods, proportionally in the amount of the invoiced value of the Goods in which Title is Retained to the amount of the invoiced value of the other goods used. If by such combining or mixing our title ceases to exist, purchaser hereby assigns to us already now the proprietary rights in which purchaser is entitled to in regard to the new situation or the goods, proportionally in the amount of the invoiced value of the Goods in which Title is Retained and shall keep the same in his custody for us free of charge. The co-ownership rights resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be Goods in which Title is Retained in the meaning of paragraph 1.
3.         Goods in which Title is Retained may only be resold by purchaser in the normal course of his business on his normal terms and conditions and only as long as he is not in default, always provided that:
a)         the claims from the resale shall be assigned to us according to paras 4 to 6. He shall not be entitled to dispose in any other way of the Goods in which Title is Retained, or:
b)         that he agrees with his purchaser a retention of title and that the claims from the resale shall be assigned to us according to paras 4 to 6. He shall not be entitled to dispose in any other way of the Goods in which Title is Retained.
4.         All claims of purchaser from the resale of Goods in which Title is Retained are hereby already now assigned to us. They shall serve as collateral to the same extent as the Goods in which Title is Retained.
5.         If the Goods in which Title is Retained are resold by purchaser together with other goods, not sold by us, the claim from the resale shall be assigned to us proportionally in the amount of the invoiced value of the Goods in which Title is Retained. In the case of resale of goods in which we have co-ownership rights in accordance with paragraph 2, we shall be assigned a part of the claim in the amount of our proportion of co-ownership.
6.         In such case that purchaser uses the Goods in which Title is Retained to perform contracts for works or contracts for works and materials, paragraph 4 and 5 shall apply in regard to the claims resulting out of such contract.
7.         Purchaser is entitled to collect claims resulting from the resale according to paragraph 3 and 6 unless we revoke this authorisation which we are entitled to do at any time. We will make use of our right to revoke only in the cases mentioned in paragraph A II 6. Purchaser shall in no event be authorised to assign the claims. At our request and unless we do so ourselves, purchaser shall notify his purchasers immediately of the assignment to us and furnish us with the information and records required to effect collection of payment.
8.         If the value of the existing collateral exceeds the secured accounts receivable by more than 10% in total, we shall be obliged, at purchasers’ request, to release collateral in the appropriate value according to our choice. In case of seizure of property or other interference by third parties purchaser shall inform us immediately.
8          I would note that the reference to “framework agreement” appears to be a reference to a technical legal term of which details were not given; but for the reasons following, I am of the view that it was not crucial to me in this case. I find that the intention of the parties was to enter into an indefinite term of dealing in which the plaintiff would sell and supply metal pipes to the first defendant as and when the latter places an order. Further, the parties agreed that the terms of the German contract document would bind the parties in such sale and supply. If by a “framework agreement”, Dr Siefarth meant it in this sense, then I would accept the written document to be a “framework agreement”. Assuming, for the moment, that notice of the retention clause was necessary, the issue thus concerned the adequacy of notice. In this regard, the question was whether the English version given to the first defendant was an adequate translation. Comparing the two, I am of the view that although the translations differ, as translations often do, the critical term was sufficiently clear, and that the first defendant would not be left in doubt as to whether the plaintiff retained title unless it was paid. Business between them thus proceeded on that basis and understanding.
9          I now turn to the next major issue in the trial, namely, whether the other defendants interfered with the plaintiff’s goods, and converted them. The other defendants were notified of the plaintiff’s claim under the retention of title clause on 21 November 2003. As a result, the other defendants took steps to identify the goods that belonged to the plaintiff. This was not easy because the first defendant had purchased such goods from other suppliers as well. Furthermore, the other defendants were not familiar with the goods, which were not distinctly marked out. The plaintiff made two inspections. The first was on 28 November 2003 and the second on 22 December 2003. The 28 November 2003 inspection was carried out by Mr Holzapfel and one James Ooi without prior arrangements with the other defendants. They sprayed paint on those pipes that they thought belonged to the plaintiff, but there was no verification by the other defendants or any independent person of the accuracy of this exercise. When the other defendants protested that the identification was inaccurate because the plaintiff had used marks identical to that found on the pipes of other suppliers, a joint inspection was held on 22 December 2004. This inspection was aborted and the plaintiff requested for a fresh date to complete the inspection. This was eventually done on 14 and 16 January 2004. A letter from the other defendants to the plaintiff dated 14 January 2004 set out some of the basis upon which the joint inspection was to be carried out. The identification of the goods would be done by the plaintiff’s representative based on the packing lists or invoices provided by him. The goods identified would be segregated from the rest of the first defendant’s goods. The inspection proceeded thus, after which, a “Final List” of the disputed goods was drawn up jointly by the other defendants’ representative, Justin Lim, with Low Ai Kok, a director of the first defendant, and James Ooi, on behalf of the plaintiff. I accept the other defendants’ evidence that the “Final List” represented the full identification of the disputed goods. It was only on 9 March 2004 that James Ooi deposed in an affidavit in reply that the “Final List” was not final because it was subject to verification by Mr Holzapfel.
10        I am of the view that the other defendants had acted properly and reasonably in response to the plaintiff’s claim over the disputed goods. I am thus persuaded that the “Final List” was an agreed inventory of the goods identified. No reason or evidence was given to suggest that either the list or the inspection of 14 and 16 January 2004 was incomplete. Consequently, it was reasonable for the other defendants to dispose of the other goods in discharge of their duties and functions as receivers, and there being no evidence that those goods belonged to the plaintiff, there was no conversion by the other defendants in respect of those goods. So far as the disputed goods were concerned, they were handed over to the plaintiff by consent pending the outcome of the trial. I am of the view that the other defendants had acted properly and reasonably in respect of the disputed goods at all times. They were under a duty as receivers to protect the goods of the first defendant and, until they could properly ascertain the ownership of those goods, they were entitled to assume that they belonged to the first defendant since the goods were in the first defendant’s premises. A claimant must satisfy the receivers with reasonable evidence of ownership, and until then, the receivers are obliged to retain possession of the goods.
11        Since the other defendants were unable to prove or otherwise dispute the goods identified by James Ooi as being the plaintiff’s goods, I allowed the goods in the “Final List” to be returned to the plaintiff. In respect of the plaintiff’s claim against the other defendants for conversion, that claim failed for the reasons I have set out in the preceding paragraph. The plaintiff’s claim for storage charges in respect of the disputed goods also failed. Mr Lim argued that the plaintiff was forced to keep the goods because the defendants were challenging the plaintiff’s title on the ground that the retention of title clause was not incorporated into the contract. An interim order for sale could have been made. And the plaintiff had only to ask for it. There was no reason for the other defendants to keep the goods either. I do not see how the plaintiff can justify not taking any action to dispose of the goods if it felt that that was necessary to avoid expensive storage charges.
12        For the reasons above, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim for conversion, but allowed its claim for the return of the disputed goods in the “Final List”. The defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed.

District Judge Wong Keen Onn
1          This is an appeal against sentence by the accused. The accused pleaded guilty before me to one charge of theft in dwelling of 15 assorted items valued at $190.10, an offence under section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Facts
2          The accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts (Exhibit A). The facts revealed that on 21
st
 Nov 2004 at about 9 p.m., one Krishnan Veru (complainant), a security officer of Mustaffa Centre, a building used for the custody of property, spotted the accused behaving suspiciously while she was patrolling at the supermarket. She noticed the accused carrying a shopping basket with several pieces of CD and two pieces of bulb which covered with newspaper. She then noticed the accused removing the plastic wrapping of CD and boxes of bulbs which was in the said shopping basket and placed into a black coloured bag. The accused was also seen taking three bottles of Garlic and Ginger paste and three packets of Maggi vegetable soup powder and placing them in a Mustaffa shopping plastic bag.
3          Investigation revealed that the accused then went to Basement one “Shoes” section and took one pair of “Adidas” shoes before going further down to Basement two “Sports” section. At Basement two, the accused took a cutter for the said section and tried to cut the alarm tag, which attached on the said shoes but he failed to do it. Later on, he went to Level two “Hardware” section and tried again with another cutter and managed to remove the alarm tag from the said shoes. The accused then went to the “Maggi Mee” section and shifted the said CD from the said black coloured bag to the said Mustafa Shopping plastic bag and placed the said Adidas shoes into the said black coloured bag. When the accused left the shop through the staff entrance at level one without paying for the goods, he was detained.
4          After his arrest, the accused was brought to Level three security office and the following items were recovered from the Mustafa Shopping plastic bag and the black coloured bag:-
a.         One piece of Gangs of New York English movies DVD valued at S$19.50
b.         One piece of the Very Best of Grateful Dead English CD valued at S$17.90
c.         One piece of The Bourne Supremacy English movie VCD valued at S$15.90
d.         One piece of The Bourne Identity English movie VCD valued at S$11.50
e.         One piece of Carole King English CD valued at S$18.90
f.          Two piece of Nasonik energy safe light valued at S$4.00 each
g.         Four packets of Maggi Mixed Vegetable Soup Powder valued at S$0.90 each
h.         One piece of Bath Gloves valued at S$2.50 each
i.          One bottle of Garlic Freshly Minced valued at S$2.70
j.          Two bottles of Laziza Garlic Paste valued at S$2.30
k.         One pair of Adidas Shoes valued at S$85.00
5          The total value of the unpaid items that were taken out of the possession of the Operation Manager Mr. Noordin was $190.10. Accused had admitted that he had the intention to steal the said items.
Antecedents
6          The accused admitted to a lengthy list of 19 previous convictions. These involved a range of property offences, forgery for the purpose of cheating and offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. His previous convictions are as follows:-
a.         On 24 January 1979, he was convicted of unauthorized consumption of controlled drugs under Section 6(b) MDA and was fined $1,000 in default 3 months imprisonment. He did not pay the fine and served the default sentence.
b.         On 13 August 1982, he was convicted of failing to display ‘L’ plate under Rule 15(3)(c) Motor Vehicles (Drug Licence) Rules 1976 and 1 charge of driving a motor vehicle without insurance against third-party risks under Section 3(1) Cap 188.
c.         On 1 November 1983, he was convicted of unauthorised consumption of controlled drugs under Section 6(b) MDA and served a 30-day default sentences.
d.         On 23 December 1983, he was convicted of 2 counts of theft under Section 379 Penal Code with two similar charges under Section 379 Penal Code taken into consideration. He was fined $2,000 each for the two offences and served a 8 months default sentence.
e.         On 25 February 1986, he was convicted of housebreaking and theft by day under Section 454 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.
f.          On 26 December 1986, he was convicted of forgery for the purpose of cheating under Section 468 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, with two similar charges under Section 468 of the Penal Code taken into consideration. His sentence was ordered to run consecutively after the expiry of his 2 years sentence that was imposed earlier on 25 February 1986;
g.         On 31 October 1988, he was convicted of theft in dwelling under Section 380 of the Penal Code, and sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment.
h.         On 2 December 1988, he was fined $80 for 1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under Section 37(1) Cap 184;
i.          On 12 April 1990, he was convicted of two charges of theft in dwelling under Section 380 Penal Code, and one charge under Section 8(b) Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and sentenced to 3 years and 1 month imprisonment, with 1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under Section 37(1) Cap 184, taken into consideration;
j.          On 30 December 1996, he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for committing two offences of theft-in dwelling under Section 380 of the Penal Code;
k.         On 8 September 1997, he was convicted of 3 counts of failure to report for urine tests under Regulation 12(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1976 and sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment.
l.          On 14 December 2001, he was convicted of one charge of theft in dwelling and sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment.
7          In addition to the above convictions, the accused was admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre on 4 occasions on 14.01.1977, 29.12.1977, 13.12.1985 and 17.07.1993.
The Mitigation
8          In his initial mitigation plea, the accused indicated that he realized what he had done was wrong. He pleaded for leniency and an opportunity to support his mother who is now in her 60s. He informed the Court that he thought he was a kleptomaniac and had acted impulsively and what he really need was psychiatric care. After the Court had called for a pre-sentence report under Section 12 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the accused engaged a counsel to further mitigate. Counsel sought two adjournments to obtain a psychiatric assessment on the accused and the Court allowed the requests for the adjournment.
9          Counsel subsequently tendered a psychiatric report dated 30 January 2005 prepared by Dr Brian Yeo (
Exhibit D
). According to Dr Brian Yeo, the accused had a relapse of his drug problems and the combination of the opiate substitute and sedative had adversely affected his cognition and ability to make sound judgments. In defence psychiatrist’s opinion, the “accused’s life had spiraled out of control due to his drug habit” and opined that the “accused is not a serial thief and the incident did not show any pre-planning nor elaborate concealment”.
10        It was stated in Counsel’s mitigation that the accused is aged 48 years and is the elder of three children. He was staying with his widowed mother and had been supporting his mother since 1996. He was working as a mechanic in the day earning between $1,000 to $1,200 per month and supplemented his income as a guitar player in the local bands in the evenings. After his release from prison in March 2004, he became dependant on heroin.
11        The accused penned a further written mitigation plea, in which he said he was contrite and urged the Court to be lenient as a long sentence would cause hardship to his mother who is a diabetic and did suffer from arthritis. Counsel urged the Court not to impose Corrective Training for two reasons. Firstly, unlike the offender in 
Kua Hoon Chua vs PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
, the present accused had the necessary skills to be useful to society as he was able to work as a mechanic repairing cars. Second, the accused is already 47 years of age and was too old for reformative aims of corrective training to be achieved. By the time he is released, he would likely be above 52 years of age and that would certainly be more difficult for the accused to find a job.
12        As for his previous theft convictions, it was said that the arose from his drug related problems. Counsel submitted that his client had change for the better from the time of his release from prison in March 2004 till his arrest for the present offence. Counsel urge the Court to impose an appropriate minimum imprisonment sentence and to backdate his sentence.
Prosecution submission
13        The prosecutor urged the Court to impose corrective training in view of the corrective training report. However, in the event that the Court is not inclined to impose corrective training, the prosecution would urge the Court to impose a substantial custodial sentence exceeding 40 months’ imprisonment, which was the length of the accused’s previous sentence in 2001.
Reasons for the Sentence
14        From the antecedent report, the accused had started his life of crime at the age of 17. As the accused had been convicted on ten previous occasions of offences which carry a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment and above, the Court called for a corrective training and preventive detentions report pursuant to Section 12 of the Criminal Procedure Code to determine his suitability for corrective training and preventive detention.
Pre-sentence report for corrective training and preventive detention.
15        In his pre-sentence report (the ‘CT and PD’ report) the Prison’s psychiatric report had assessed the accuser’s general risk of recidivism as in the moderate to high risk category with a 49 to 69 per cent chance of recidivism within two years of release. This was despite the few protective factors which included the fact that he had the support for mother. But this was of limited distance given his dependency on alcohol. The report also noted that the accused’s social circle consisted of friends that abuse tablets and drink alcohol regularly, especially with regard to his skill as a musician. In my view, this assessment is very consistent with his criminal records which shows a regular pattern of offending.  The accused also acknowledged to the psychologist that his addiction to tablets and indulgence in alcohol was the main cause of his crime. Although he was diagnosed to be suffering from asthma and insomnia, the prison doctor found the accused to be physically and mentally fit to undergo the sentence of corrective training or preventive detention.
16        The principal aim of corrective training is, as the name suggests, to reform the prisoner who is sentenced to undergo that regime. It is to turn an offender away from the easy allure of crime by putting him through a regime of discipline and by providing him with certain work skills. This is only appropriate and suitable where the offender shows that he is capable of reform and can be corrected, so to speak, and prevented from committing further crime:

Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
 at 389
, PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
 at para 13.
17        Having considered the Corrective Training and Preventive Detention report as well as his mitigation plea, I formed the view that the accused is capable of reforming. What he needed is a strict regime that would instill in him a stronger sense of discipline and his willingness to reform himself. Indeed, the counsellor had noted that the accused had “lacked knowledge of drug addiction and was ignorant of the inherent risk (and) his attempts at controlling his heroin use was to substitute with another drug.” Clearly a more regimented regime is desirable in these circumstances.
18        The Court also noted that the accused is an inveterate recidivist and had repeatedly committed many property offences. On the last occasion in 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment of 40 months. That did not deter him and he repeated this offence within a year of his release from prison. I also note that facts in this case had revealed that he was determined to steal from the shopping centre as he went about twice looking for a cutter to remove the electronic tag from the stolen items before he left the store.
19        As for his mitigation, I did not find much value in his plea of guilt. It was inevitable since he was caught red-handed and had admitted to stealing. Counsel had urged the Court not to impose corrective training as the accused was already 48 years old and did possess some skills. However, there was nothing to indicate that at 48 years of age, the accused was ‘too old’ for him to be reformed under the regime of corrective training. Indeed, there was no notional “age ceiling” for eligibility for corrective training: 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
 at para 6. As for the psychiatrist report from Dr Brian Yeo, I was of the view that it was consistent with the Corrective Training report in that the causes that led to his crimes was his drug consumption. There was nothing that suggests that the accused was not suitable for Corrective Training or Preventive Detention. As for Dr Yeo’s opinion that the accused “was not a serial thief”, I rejected that view as that was inconsistent with the accused’s antecedents. Instead, his criminal record clearly showed otherwise given that he had eight previous convictions relating to theft and fraudulent possession of property.
20        There was thus no special reason not to impose corrective training. In addition, the fact that the accused possessed some skills does not preclude the accused from being suitable for corrective training. Rather, the predominant consideration in corrective training is to reform the accused and to prevent crime. It is pertinent to note from the counsellor’s report that the accused’s skills as a musician had an undesirable effect as it had put him in contact with alcohol and drugs, which is the main contributing factor to his crimes. In my opinion, such a sentence of corrective training was indeed expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime. It was therefore fitting that the accused be kept out of public circulation for a considerable duration.
21        As for the length of sentence of corrective training, this Court is guided by the principles laid down in 
G Ravichander v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 4 SLR 587
.
 The High Court said that:
“[m]ore importantly,
 
when sentencing a person to corrective training, normal sentencing principles such as the gravity of the offence, tariffs, mitigating and aggravating factors, while still relevant, do not take centre-stage. Rather, the critical factor to be considered is the amount of time that the court feels is required to enable real reform to be attempted. Lord Goddard CJ’s comments in the case of 
R v Barrett
 [1949] 2 All ER 689 are instructive:
Since a person of 21 years or over who is in need of training … can no longer be sent to Borstal, it is a good thing, no doubt, to send him for corrective training. If his record shows that his tendency is to lead a criminal life, it is as well to make the sentence of corrective training of substantial length and to bear in mind that the usual remission will be granted if the prisoner behaves himself. In such cases, it is of little use giving a sentence of a length which will not enable real reform to be attempted.
Provided that the prisoner is capable of reform, a longer period of corrective training might be imposed if his antecedents reveal a more disturbing downward trend. On the other hand, if a prisoner only has a few previous infractions which are not very serious, and which do not reveal a dangerous frequency of recurrence, then a shorter period may be imposed since it might be thought that this would suffice to reform him”
22        As pointed out earlier, the accused had repeated the offence within a short period quite soon after his release from prison. Given that he re-offended so soon after his release from prison. I was of the view that period of 6 years of corrective training was necessary to reform him and for the prevention of crime. Considering all the circumstances of this case, I impose a term of six (6) years’ corrective training on him accordingly. The accused is dissatisfied with the sentence and has filed an appeal.",2005-02-03 00:00:00,SG District Court

Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:
1          This action is brought against QBE Insurance (Malaysia) Bhd (“QBE”) for failing to hold the plaintiff, Hub Warrior Sdn Bhd (“Hub Warrior”) harmless for its liability to pay, 
inter alia
, for a replacement crankshaft that had to be fitted after irreparable damage to the no 5 crankpin was discovered in July 2001. The plaintiff is the registered owner of the vessel, the 
Saipan Leader
. At the relevant time, the 
Saipan Leader
 was insured with QBE under a policy of marine insurance on her hull and machinery subject, 
inter alia
, to the terms of the Institute Time Clauses (Hulls) dated 1 October 1983 (“ITC”). 
2          The claim here under the ITC policy is for RM4,911,418.94 or alternatively, for damages to be assessed. Hub Warrior maintains that damage to the no 5 crankpin was caused by acts or acts of negligence of the chief engineer and therefore it has a claim under cl 6.2.3 of the ITC which provides:
This insurance covers loss of or damage to the subject-matter insured caused by negligence of Master Officers Crew or Pilots provided such loss or damage has not resulted from want of due diligence by the Assured, Owners or Managers.
3          Furthermore, there is a dispute as to the amount of the deduction agreed upon under cl 12 of the policy. Clause 12 of the policy stipulated that all claims are subject to a deductible of RM150,000 in respect of each accident. The cover included the Institute Machinery Damage Additional Deductible Clause. The deductible thereunder is RM100,000.
4          Hub Warrior contends that the amount of the deduction orally agreed upon under cl 12 was RM100,000 and not the amount of RM150,000 as stated in the policy. The plaintiff has asked for this mistake to be rectified.
5          QBE has denied that the damage to the no 5 crankpin was a result of the insured peril identified by Hub Warrior. At the same time as putting the plaintiff to strict proof that the loss or damage comes within the terms of cl 6.2.3 of the ITC, QBE advances an alternative case, contending that there can be no claim as the proximate cause of the loss or damage was wear and tear: see s 55(2)(c) of the Marine Insurance Act (Cap 387, 1994 Rev Ed). Alternatively, if (which the insurer denies) the damage was proximately caused by the negligence of the chief engineer, QBE argues that the damage was due to want of due diligence on the part of Hub Warrior or the manager of the vessel, Hub Marine Pte Ltd (“Hub Marine”). QBE has also alleged that the claim is fraudulent and must fail, as false documents were presented in support of the claim.
The first two incidents
6          The course of events that led to the discovery of the serious damage to the no 5 crankpin is uncontroversial. It is common ground that serious damage was discovered when testing the Brinell hardness of the no 5 crankpin. The steel had hardened to an unacceptable level and it was not possible to restore the crankpin. In the result, the crankshaft was condemned and thereby precluded from use. A new crankshaft had to be fitted.
7          The container vessel 
Saipan Leader
 sailed from India in the month of July 2001 on a voyage to Port Klang, Malaysia, laden with cargo for discharge at Port Klang. The 
Saipan Leader
 was built in 1982 and is powered by a single MaK marine diesel engine model 6M601AK, having output of 8,000hp at 425rpm. The MaK diesel engine works on a four-stroke cycle. It operates on heavy fuel oil at full power rating and marine diesel oil for manoeuvring.
8          The main engine has six cylinders, six pistons and a crankshaft with six cranks. The piston is connected to the crank by means of a connecting rod. The joint where the connecting rod connects to the crank at the crankpin, sometimes called the “big end”, is called a bearing which is in two halves and fitted into the connecting rod big end and clamped round the crankpin. The crankpin bearing shell comprises of three different types of metal bonded together, the steel shell (the outermost layer) housing the white-metal bearing layer with a bronze inlay between.
9          As the 
Saipan Leader
 approached the Port Klang pilot station on 24 July 2001, she experienced low lubricating oil (“luboil”) pressure, at which point the luboil low pressure alarm sounded at about 1636 hours (at 2.3bar) and automatic shutdown of the main engine occurred. The parties have referred to this shutdown as “the first incident”.
10        Following the shutdown, the crankcase was opened for inspection of the crankshaft and bearings. The no 5 crankpin bearing (also known as the big end connecting rod bearing) had failed and the bearing shells were found to be mechanically distorted and to have rotated in the connecting rod. Scattered around nos 4, 5 and 6 crankpins was white metal debris from the seized bearing. The chief engineer, Mr Khin Maung Aye (“Khin”) reported the incident to Hub Marine. Thereafter, he directed the vessel’s engineers to dismantle the connecting rod bearing. Some scoring marks were seen on the surface of the no 5 crankpin after the damaged bearing shells were removed. Also seen were bits of white metal that had adhered to its surface. The vessel’s engineers used oilstone and emery paper to clean and polish the surface of the crankpin before fitting bearing shells from spares on board.
11        Thereafter, Khin started the standby luboil pump to check the flow of lubricating oil. The standby luboil pump is used to circulate luboil through the main engine luboil system. This was reported to be normal. The engine was restarted at 0142 hours on 25 July 2001 to run at the normal idling speed of 300rpm. About two minutes later, Khin noted that the luboil pressure dropping and to rectify this, the engine speed was increased to the normal operating speed of 425rpm to bring the attached luboil pump into action. Some two minutes later, a knocking sound was heard coming from the engine in the area of the no 5 unit of the main engine. There was a reported drop of the luboil pressure whereupon the chief engineer stopped the engine manually. This second stoppage was referred to as “the second incident”.
12        On this second occasion, the replacement bearing also failed just as in the first incident. Crankshaft deflection readings showed that the deflection readings for nos 4 and 5 cranks had changed. The no 5 crankpin was found with five heat-related cracks on the piston crown and the fuel injector, when tested, was found to be dripping slightly. Operating pressure had only dropped to 290bar compared to the set value of 300bar. The alignment of the adjacent crankshaft main bearing pins was checked. Those on board found the crankshaft to be slightly bent.
13        On 28 July 2001, technicians from Goltens Singapore Pte Ltd (“Goltens”) and a representative of the engine manufacturers attended on board the vessel. The crankpin was found with heat cracks and deep pits. Depending on the seriousness of the damage, heat cracks and pits can be removed by 
in-situ
 grinding. Measurement of the crankpin was taken and the reading indicated that the surface had ovality to the order of 0.7mm. When testing the Brinell hardness of the crankpin, the hardness was in the range of between 250HB and 700HB, the normal allowable maximum reading being 350HB. Goltens reported an area of approximately 140mm by 175mm at the bottom of the crankpin had very high hardness readings. In an attempt to restore the crankpin, the diameter was reduced by 2mm by grinding. After grinding, Goltens found that one of the heat cracks was still visible. The surface pitting was also still visible and the hardness of the steel material still exceeded the manufacturer’s allowable tolerance, thereby resulting in the crankshaft being condemned. The 
Saipan Leader
 was towed to Singapore where she underwent permanent repairs.
The chief engineer’s negligence and the due diligence proviso
14        The contested issues are:
(a)        Whether the damage to the crankpin that led to the crankshaft being condemned was caused by negligence of the chief engineer within cl 6.2.3;
(b)        If so, whether that negligence was the proximate cause of the loss;
(c)        Again if so, whether the loss resulted from want of due diligence within the proviso to cl 6.2.3. In this regard, the following questions require consideration:
(i)         whether the lack of proper supervision or action by shore personnel amounts to “want of due diligence”;
(ii)        whether the loss or damage was a result of want of due diligence; and
(iii)       whether those who could be blamed for want of due diligence might be identified with the “Assured, Owners or Managers”.
If the answers to all these questions are in the affirmative, there is no claim.
Clause 6.2.3: negligence and proximate cause
15        It is convenient to deal with questions (a) and (b) together. Besides various witnesses of fact, both sides called an expert marine engineer (Mr Ronald M Pereira for the plaintiff and Mr Peter Thomas Nation for the defendant). No expert metallurgist was called.
16        It is also convenient to summarise the principles to be applied in determining this part of the case. There was little, if any, difference between the parties concerning these principles.
17        First, Hub Warrior has the task of proving on a balance of probabilities that the loss or damage was caused by negligence within cl 6.2.3 during the currency of the policy: see 
The Popi M
 [1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1. The defendant is entitled by way of defence to require the assured to prove its case and to call evidence to challenge the assured on each point: see 
per
 Cairns LJ in 
Palamisto General Enterprises SA v Ocean Insurance Co Ltd
 
[1972] 2 QB 625
 at 647; 
Templeman on Marine Insurance
 (6th Ed, 1986) at p 207. If “an examination of all the evidence and probabilities leaves the Court doubtful what is the real cause of the loss [or damage], the assured has failed to prove his case”: 
La Compania Martiartu v The Corporation of the Royal Exchange Assurance
 
[1923] 1 KB 650
 at 657, 
per
 Scrutton LJ and approved by the House of Lords in 
The Popi M.
 However, if Hub Warrior succeeds on that issue, QBE has to bring the case within the want of due diligence proviso.
18        Second, unless the policy of insurance otherwise provides, the insurer is liable for any loss proximately caused by a peril insured against: see s 55(i) Marine Insurance Act. Both sides accept that the term “caused by” in the opening words of cl 6.2 of the ITC is to be read as if the word “proximately” was inserted before it. Thus, the word “caused by” in cl 6.2.3 means that that clause can only be invoked when the negligence of the master, officer, crew or pilot is 
the
 or 
a
 proximate cause of loss or damage.
19        Whilst the concept of proximate cause is long established in insurance law, its application can be difficult. Proximate cause need not be the sole cause and it need not be the cause closest in time to the suffering of the loss. As Lord Shaw of Dunfermline stated in 
Leyland Shipping Company, Limited v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, Limited
 
[1918] AC 350
 at 370:
In my opinion, accordingly, proximate cause is an expression referring to the efficiency as an operating factor upon the result. Where various factors or causes are concurrent, and one has to be selected, the matter is determined as one of fact, and the choice falls upon the one to which may be variously ascribed the quality of realities, predominance, efficiency. Fortunately, this much would appear to be in accordance with the principles of a plain business transaction, and it is not at all foreign to the law.
20        The other passage where the principle is applicable to the case in hand begins at 371:
The true efficient cause never loses its hold. The result is produced, a result attributable in common language to the casualty as a cause, and this result, proximate as well as continuous in its efficiency, properly meets, whether under contract or under the statute, the language of the expression “proximately caused.”
21        With these principles in mind, I turn to the present case.
22        The pleaded case on negligence is in the manner in which Khin and the vessel’s engineers repaired the no 5 crankpin. The on-board repairs were said to be deficient and grossly inadequate in the way particularised in para 10 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim:
e.         The Plaintiffs aver that the Chief Engineer was negligent in ordering the polishing of No 5 crankpin with oil stone and emery cloth which resulted in the grinding down of the crankpin from 410mm in diameter to 409.26mm.
f.          The Plaintiffs further aver that the usage of oil stone and emery cloth to polish the crankpin resulted in the crankpin developing ovality which contributed to the occurrence of the 2
nd
 
Incident.
23        In support of the pleaded case, Mr Pereira’s view was that the ovality in the crankpin was the direct result of the negligent method of repair used by the chief engineer. According to Mr Pereira, in their attempt to dress up and polish the no 5 crankpin after the first incident, the chief engineer and vessel’s engineers caused severe ovality of 0.7mm in the crankpin. The repairs were improper in that oilstone and emery cloth (with a rough surface which is akin to sandpaper being used on wood by carpenters) would have the effect of grinding down the surface of the crankpin. Mr Pereira in his written testimony categorically stated that the second incident was due to ovality in the no 5 crankpin. He opined that the high hardness found in the steel crankpin, which resulted in the crankshaft being condemned, was likely to be due to the negligent repairs carried out by the chief engineer on 24 July 2001.
24        He stated that when the main engine was being tested at 300 rpm after repairs, the unsatisfactory lubrication of the no 5 crankpin bearing (due to ovality of the no 5 crankpin created by the polishing with emery cloth) caused rapid overheating of the crankpin bearing due to the metal-to-metal contact with the steel crankpin. This led to the melting of the white-metal bearing layer, and when the main engine speed was increased to 425rpm, the bronze inlay also melted. Consequently, there was direct metal-to-metal contact between the steel crankpin and the steel bearing shell and micro-seizure occurred between these components of similar material. During the micro-seizure, small sections of the no 5 crankpin would be stuck to the bearing shell. During the changes of direction from the downward strokes to the upward strokes of the piston, the no 5 crankpin would momentarily become unstuck in way of its bottom segment, and the almost instantaneous freeing of the crankpin and re-contact with the steel shell as the piston moved upwards produced the knocking force. There would have been one knock during the change of direction at each upstroke of the no 5 piston. As such, with the main engine operating at 425rpm, the steel bearing shell (with the upward momentum of the piston and connecting rod) would have imparted a knocking force on the bottom of the crankpin at a rate of 425 times per minute (or seven times per second).
25        Mr Pereira explained that to obtain optimum lubrication efficiency, the crankpin surface must be absolutely smooth and free of ovality. This is to enable luboil under pressure to form an oil wedge and prevent metal-to-metal contact between the steel crankpin and the white-metal bearing surface. The oil wedge will be significantly affected by ovality and crankpin roughness. With ovality of 0.7mm, there would be segments where there would be large clearances occurring between the crankpin and bearing surface, while other segments would have smaller clearances. What this means is that with a large difference in the clearance at the various segments of the crankpin, the luboil wedge would be affected and unsatisfactory lubrication would occur. In the event, some metal-to-metal contact between parts of the crankpin and the bearing surface would occur. A crankpin with an ovality of 0.7mm would have failed almost immediately when the main engine was run at full power rating. In the present case, the ovality was severe enough to cause the bearing failure, and the knocking of the crankpin before the drop in the luboil pressure activated the alarm and automatic shutdown function during the second incident
.
 In his opinion, the chief engineer should not have attempted repairs as he was already in a port with proper repair facilities. I have noted that this latter comment must be understood in the light of his opinion that the rudimentary repairs caused the ovality to develop.
26        Mr Nation’s views differ. He disagrees that the ovality in the no 5 crankpin was due to negligent repairs by the vessel’s engineers. It was a condition that was in existence prior to the first incident through wear and tear, which was further aggravated by deep pitting in the crankpin. Bearing failure arose out of the defective condition of the surface of the no 5 crankpin. Goltens found the no 5 crankpin to be in an oval rather than a perfectly cylindrical shape. This problem had to be repaired before the ship could return to service, 
ie
, there was a need to eliminate or reduce to within acceptable tolerances the ovality in the crankpin. The measurement provided by Goltens indicated that the ovality in the crankpin of 0.7mm was bad. The chief engineer did not improperly repair the crankpin because the repairs did not cause ovality in the crankpin. Mr Nation said that the majority of the hardness to the crankpin would have been sustained on the first incident. The mechanical defect that caused the first incident also caused the second incident.
27        As it happened, it was unnecessary to decide on the differing views of experts on this aspect of the case. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, during cross-examination of Mr Pereira, his opinion on the negligent repairs causing the crankshaft to be condemned came under attack and the plaintiff’s pleaded case took a disastrous turn. The plaintiff found that its own expert did not support the matters pleaded in para 10 of the Re-Amended Statement of claim.
28        Mr Pereira under cross-examination conceded that ovality in the no 5 crankpin could not have been caused by the crew’s polishing of the crankpin with oilstone and emery cloth with a smooth surface (and not one with a rough surface as he had initially thought) for two hours. In the circumstances, I accordingly find that the chief engineer and the vessel’s engineer were not negligent in the manner in which the on-board repairs were carried out.
29        I should mention that as an alternative fall-back argument, the plaintiff pleaded in para 11 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim that if the no 5 crankpin was damaged beyond repair after the first incident, the first incident was caused by the negligence of the chief engineer and crew who, 
inter alia
, failed to properly maintain the luboil filtration; failed to take appropriate measures to prevent entry of foreign particles into the luboil and to remove sludge build-up in the crankshaft luboil passage. The build-up of sludge in the crankshaft luboil passage resulted in the localised luboil starvation to the no 5 crankpin and the automatic shutdown of the engine on 24 July 2001. That fall-back argument also collapsed. Mr Pereira conceded in cross-examination that there was no sludge formation leading to luboil starvation as pleaded in para 11 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim. In addition, there was no negligence on the part of the crew in failing to removing water contamination in the luboil.
30        In the circumstances, Hub Warrior has not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that the high hardness in the no 5 crankpin was caused by the negligence of the chief engineer. That should have been the end of the matter. However, since Mr Pereira’s evidence took the turn it did at the trial, the plaintiff in its Closing Submissions now tried to present its case on a new footing. The broad structure of the revised argument on the claim under cl 6.2.3 in the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions is as follows: that damage to the no 5 crankpin, which led to the crankshaft being condemned, was due to the negligence of the chief engineer. The chief engineer was said to have been negligent in three respects.
31        First, he failed to seek the assistance of specialist repairers after the vessel’s main engine automatically shut down. Second, the chief engineer’s attempts at on-board repairs by “merely cleaning” to remove the white metal streaks using oilstone and emery cloth were inadequate. Third, after repairs, the chief engineer restarted the engine at about 0142 hours on 25 July 2001. On this occasion, the luboil pressure again dropped and the engine was manually shut down. The complaint is that the chief engineer restarted the engine without ensuring that the proper repairs and checks were conducted and that resulted in hardness to the no 5 crankpin that eventually led to the condemnation of the crankshaft.
32        In the Closing Submissions, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Joseph Tan, submits that the proximate cause of the loss or damage to the crankshaft was the negligence of the chief engineer in ordering the repairs to be done instead of calling for specialist repairers. In another paragraph, he submits that the proximate cause of the loss was the negligence of the chief engineer in deciding to carry out on-board repairs on 24 July 2001 and the inadequate repairs carried out by the chief engineer. There is now the further complaint that the chief engineer restarted the engine without ensuring that the proper repairs and checks were conducted and that resulted in hardness to the no 5 crankpin that eventually led to the condemnation of the crankshaft. Finally, in the concluding paragraphs of the Closing Submissions, he argues:
201.      On the facts ..., but for the [chief engineer’s] negligence in failing to realize the seriousness of the problem and ordering the repairs to the No 5 crankpin and subsequently re-starting the engine, the 2
nd
 
Incident occurred.
202.      If the [chief engineer] had called for specialist repairers after the 1
st
 
Incident, there would not have been any knocking between the crankpin and the bearings. And as shown by the evidence, it was the knocking which caused the excessive hardness to arise.
33        There are a number of things to be said about the case being put on the new footing in the Closing Submissions. My observations are as follows.
34        First, the case as brought to trial by the plaintiff was entirely based on the negligent manner in which the repairs were carried out, 
ie
, the repairs created the ovality in the crankpin that led to the crankshaft being condemned. The new footing it now advances in its Closing Submissions is fundamentally different. The plaintiff is in effect now saying that the on-board repairs were not good enough to rectify the serious problem that existed. The difficulty with that revised argument, besides departing from the pleaded case, is that the court is not told what exactly was the existing problem the on-board repairs did not rectify. Nor has counsel identified the alleged serious problem with the main engine the chief engineer is accused of being negligent in having failed to recognise. Counsel acknowledges that work knocking occurred because of excessive bearing clearance such that the luboil film was compromised. In other words, there was severe ovality in the no 5 crankpin. It is the plaintiff’s case that hardness to the no 5 crankpin was sustained in the second incident. What is unclear is the plaintiff’s case on when and how the ovality in the no 5 crankpin developed. On the one hand, the plaintiff does not accept the defendant’s contention that there was ovality of 0.7mm in the no 5 crankpin before the first incident. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s pleaded case that ovality of 0.7mm was caused by the on-board repairs had all but collapsed. It also did not pursue Mr Pereira’s other theory which he came up with during cross-examination.
35        In cross-examination, Mr Pereira came up with another theory which he had not mentioned in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief as he had not thought of it previously. In the witness box, Mr Pereira explained that on reflection, in his opinion, the ovality at the bottom of the crankpin was to a fairly large degree contributed to by hammering of the crankpin in its heated condition during the second incident. He said that the crankpin was heated and the hammering would be similar to the forging method where it would compact the outer layer of the material on the crankpin and that could have caused the “top/bottom ovality”. Mr Pereira did not, however, explain how lack of lubrication to the bearing came about in the first place and the resultant heated condition during the second incident. This new theory was not relied upon by the plaintiff and quite rightly so. Indeed, counsel for the defendant, Mr Lim Tean, objected to this second theory being given consideration on grounds that this theory had not been pleaded. Neither was an amendment to the pleadings sought. Further, the theory was not put to Mr Nation by counsel for the plaintiff. The objections raised by Mr Lim are valid.
36        Second, the new footing the plaintiff now advances in its Closing Submissions introduced a new issue that is not pleaded and not argued previously. On the pleaded basis, the contest was centred on causation and the damage complained of. The point I believe the plaintiff is now trying to make in the Closing Submissions is that the chief engineer should not have carried out on-board repairs with the vessel’s engineers. The second incident would then have been avoided, and the irreparable damage to the crankpin too. Now the standard of care expected of a person holding the rank of a chief engineer and whether Khin had in the particular circumstances discharged this standard of care are put in issue whereas previously they were not. Consequently, particulars of facts relevant to the standard of care should be pleaded and proper particulars given for where Khin has fallen short of the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent chief engineer. The standard of care expected of Khin in a case of this sort is that of a person holding the rank of chief engineer rather than Khin’s training and experience: see 
Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority
 
[1987] QB 730
 (reversed by the House of Lords on a different point). Counsel for the defendant relied on 
Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco
 
Ltd
 
[1992] 2 SLR 793
 as authority for the proposition that a court is not allowed to make a finding or give a decision on material facts which have not been pleaded.
37        The plaintiff contends that Khin should have recognised the seriousness of the breakdown. Yet, the plaintiff did not point to anything to indicate beforehand that the failure experienced was imminent. According to Allan Pang, the vessel’s superintendent, the vessel’s monthly performance records indicate that the main engine was operating normally and within its operating parameters from the time the plaintiff bought the vessel. On the evidence, Khin did not assess the bearing failure to be a major breakdown of the main engine. He was confident of putting the vessel back to service after the repairs. In his e-mail to the managers at 1822 hours on 24 July 2001, he reported the damage to the no 5 unit connecting rod bearing and said that he had started to dismantle the bearing for renewal and would be informing the managers of the status after he had dismantled and replaced the bearing.
38        Khin attended Yangon University between 1968 and 1970. He then joined the Institute of Marine Technology for the next five years. Khin started sailing as a junior engineer in 1975. He obtained his engineer first class in 1986. In 1987, he was promoted to chief engineer on board foreign-going vessels. At the relevant time, Khin has had a total of 26 years of seagoing experience as an engineer and then chief engineer. He was conscientious and well regarded by his employees. He signed off the 
Saipan Leader
 on 24 October 2001. Even then, the plaintiff and Hub Marine did not blame him for inadequate repairs. They still considered him, as can be seen from his discharge certificate, to be a very good chief engineer in terms of his ability and conduct during the time he served on board the 
Saipan Leader
 as chief engineer.
39        Mr Pereira acknowledged that it is not possible to check for ovality in the crankpin without disassembling the unit. Furthermore, the diameter of the crankpin has to be measured with a micrometer without which any ovality in the crankpin will not be evident. The crankshaft is primarily made up of component parts called crankpins and journals which must be perfectly round within extremely small tolerances measured in fractions of millimetres.
40        Mr Pereira’s statement in his written testimony, that repairs on medium-speed engines are something which the chief engineer should not have contemplated doing especially if the vessel was in a safe port where assistance of specialist repairers could be secured, was made in the context of his opinion that it was the repairs carried out by the chief engineer and the vessel’s engineers that caused ovality to develop. During cross-examination, he gave as the reason for the second incident the chief engineer’s attempts at repairs which he said should not have been done. Apart from the pleading point mentioned earlier, the testimony does not respond adequately to the standard of care issue. There are Mr Nation’s comments which are not critical of the chief officer’s repairs but are directed at the plaintiff and Hub Marine when he was discussing the want of due diligence proviso.
41        In the present case, the question is whether there was “negligence of Master Officers [or] Crew” for the purposes of cl 6.2.3. The plaintiff led no evidence that a reasonably competent chief engineer in the position of Khin would fault Khin’s views and decision. The plaintiff did not point to or lead evidence of a general and prudent practice to establish that the particular circumstances and condition in which the chief engineer found the crankpin to be in called for the attention of specialist repairers. In short, had Khin fallen short of the standard expected of a reasonably competent chief engineer? The court is unable in the circumstances to determine the appropriate standard of care and to hold the chief engineer responsible in negligence for the vessel breakdown on 25 July 2001.
42        Third, pleadings aside, I cannot see how each of the three strands relied upon as the alleged act or acts of negligence in the Closing Submissions in itself or the strands collectively constitute negligence or proof of negligence on the part of the chief engineer. The fact of the matter is that, on the evidence, the repairs by the chief engineer and the vessel’s engineers did not cause ovality to develop from 410mm to 409.26mm. It follows that no blame for the damage to the crankpin can be attributed to the chief engineer even though the repairs were undertaken, for in effect they have no causal link with the damage based on the expert evidence. In my view the plaintiff has not established on the evidence that if it had not been for the repairs carried out by the vessel’s engineers, the state of the crankpin would have been such that it would have been capable of being restored to within manufacturer’s recommendation after the first incident. At any rate, any criticism of the chief engineer is a matter of hindsight.
43        Fourth, the other argument, that the negligence was in restarting the engine, also cannot be acknowledged. It was also not asserted in pleadings that by restarting the engine the chief engineer was negligent. I am sceptical and am not moved by any submissions based on what the chief engineer should not have done. In so dealing with the breakdown, the polishing with emery cloth and oilstone did little to aggravate or possibly precipitate the result. On the evidence, the repairs and restarting of the engine were circumstances which would not, and did not in all probability, have mattered. The plaintiff did not lead evidence that the engine should not be restarted before the reason for overheating was identified and corrected. In this case, the chief engineer was confident that the engine would be put back to service after cleaning the crankpin and replacing the failed bearing with spares on board. If anything, the decision to carry out the on-board repairs, the order given, the repair effort itself and restarting the main engine and finally shutting it down were all part and parcel of one activity, namely the on-board repairs, and it is artificial to view each strand of the allegation of negligence as distinct and in isolation. The chief engineer was not asked whether he was aware that in restarting the engine, the replacement bearing would fail and cause the engine to knock. There was no evidence that a reasonable person in the position of the chief engineer would not have restarted the engine after completion of on-board repairs. There is no evidence that restarting the engine was in the circumstances negligent.
44        Furthermore, in my judgment, none of the three strands alleging negligence on the part of the chief engineer in the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions has any causative relevance. Any criticism that might be made was in any event non-causative in that the repairs did not result in the ovality as previously thought by Mr Pereira.
45        The experts accept that high hardness discovered after the second incident was attributable to ovality in the crankpin. Mr Pereira said that a correctly assembled crankpin bearing would have a 0.2mm clearance between the steel crankpin surface and the white metal-bearing surface. However, Mr Nation and Mr Pereira do not dispute that there was excessive bearing clearance that had affected the lubrication conditions between the crankpin and the bearing. In the result, friction between the crankpin and bearing led to heat damage. In the final analysis, the ovality in the no 5 crankpin resulting in excessive bearing clearance between the crankpin and bearing was the primary cause of the damage to the crankpin. In my judgment, there is no need to decide on the differing views on the precise mechanism of the hardening of the crankpin – whether it was “work hardening” (or “knocking”) or “quenching” that produced the hardness located at the bottom of the crankpin. Even on the plaintiff’s contention that the hardness was due to “knocking”, the real efficient cause operating throughout was excessive ovality in the circumference of the no 5 crankpin that produced the knocking between the crankpin and the bearing shell.
46        The debate is when and what caused the ovality. In that regard, the evidence is that the chief engineer in carrying out repairs to the no 5 crankpin did not cause ovality of 0.7mm to develop. So any criticisms that might be made as regards inadequate repairs were in any event non-causative.
47        Accordingly, in the present case, the questions whether there was “negligence of Master Officers” or “Crew” and whether such negligence caused the loss or damage for the purposes of cl 6.2.3 were not answered by the plaintiff. When things turned the way they did at the trial, the new footing advanced in the Closing Submissions only served to highlight the paucity of the plaintiff’s evidence and hence its negative effect on the plaintiff’s claim under cl 6.2.3.
48        The defendant offered an explanation for the bearing failure in the first incident. As stated, it is not necessary in the circumstances for the defendant to succeed on this point to carry the day.
49        Mr Nation’s testimony was that ovality of 0.7mm was due to wear and tear and the rate of development to 0.7mm since 1997 was due to the pitting corrosion found on the surface of the crankpin. In this disagreement between the experts on ordinary wear and tear, I prefer the evidence of Mr Nation, supported as it was by the publication 
Diesel Engine Reference Book
 (Butterworths). Besides, in cross-examination, Mr Pereira was shown an extract from the 
Diesel Engine Reference Book
 and he agreed that the crankpin is a component that is subject to normal wear and tear. Alan Pang, the superintendent of the vessel, concurred on this point after he, too, was shown the same extract.
50        The plaintiff argues that it is not possible to have a sudden increase in ovality in the crankpin between 1997 and 2001. The defendant’s explanation is that the presence of pitting corrosion on the crankpin would have accelerated the development of ovality of the crankpin. Mr Nation admits during cross-examination by Mr Kenneth Tan SC that absent pitting corrosion, the ordinary wear and tear on its own would not produce ovality of 0.7mm over a period of four years from the time the bed plate was renewed in 1997.
51        Mr Pereira explained that in 1997, the bed plate was replaced and the crankpins and bearings were passed as reusable by the manufacturer’s representative and class surveyor who was in attendance. Mr Pereira’s view is that any water droplets that had got onto the crankpin would have been cleansed. Mr Nation does not think it would have been detected. Mr Nation testified that in a shipyard environment, the crankpin could have been exposed to “water leakage, condensation dripping from air conditioners, somebody spilling a cup of coffee over it, even somebody using it in place of sanitary facilities”. That, he said, is “a very shipyard possibility”. It is to be noted that the bed plate replacement was done in the United Arab Emirates and not in a Singapore shipyard where the experts’ experience lay.
52        Crucially, the chief engineer did not note any pitting on the crankpin when he examined it after the first incident. Although the chief engineer admitted that he was not looking out for pitting, the crankpin was nonetheless examined after the first incident. On the evidence, the defendant’s theory on pitting is not entirely supportable. Even so, the outcome of the case is not affected. The fact remains that it is always for the plaintiff to establish that the damage comes within the peril insured against, and the burden is not arrogated to the defendant to prove the truth of an alternative cause. Consequently, as the plaintiff has not proved its pleaded case on a balance of probabilities, the action must fail.
53        In the light of the findings and conclusions reached above, there is no need to deal with the issue of want of due diligence and breach of s 17 of the Marine Insurance Act. Although not strictly necessary for this case, I should however say something about the relief of rectification sought by the plaintiff.
Rectification
The requirements for rectification
54        The plaintiff must show what was the intention of both Chee Keng Koon (“Chee”), the general manager of QBE Marine Underwriting Agency Pte Ltd who are the Singapore agents of the defendant, and Lui Yuen Kheng (“Lui”), the general manageress of Hub Marine, as to the applicable deductible, and that they also gave outward expression of this common intent in a manner which made plain, applying an objective test, that this was what they wished to achieve by the policy. In 
American Airlines Inc v Hope
 [1974] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 301 at 307, Lord Diplock stated, in the context of a claim to rectify a policy of aviation insurance:
Rectification is a remedy which is available where parties to a contract, intending to reproduce in a more formal document the terms of an agreement upon which they are already ad idem, use in that document words which are inapt to record           the true agreement reached between them. The formal document may then be rectified so as to conform with the true agreement which it was intended to reproduce, and enforced in its rectified form.
55        Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in 
The Demetra K
 [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 581 helpfully sets out the requirements for rectification. Lord Phillips MR said at [23] and [24]:
The antecedent agreement need not amount to a binding contract but there must be a common accord as to what the parties’ mutual rights and obligations are to be, to which they fail to give effect in their subsequent written contract ...
Where the parties have recorded their agreement in a written contract, convincing evidence is necessary to discharge the burden of proving that they made a common mistake in so doing, albeit that the standard of proof is the civil standard.
But as the alleged common intention ex hypothesi contradicts the written instrument, convincing proof is required in order to counteract the cogent evidence of the parties’ intention displayed by the instrument itself.
(Per Lord Justice Brightman in 
Thomas Bates & Sons Ltd v Wyndham’s (Lingerie) Ltd
 
[1981] 1 WLR 505
 at p 521, and see per Lord Justice Buckley at p 514.)
Alleged oral agreement
56        Was there an antecedent agreement as alleged between the plaintiff and the defendant that conflicted with the amount of the deductible? It is the plaintiff’s pleaded case that such an oral agreement was reached between Lui and Chee over luncheon on or about 15 June 2001. According to Chee’s testimony, the luncheon was on 12 June 2001 as indicated in his diary. Chee also disputes the conclusion of any agreement over lunch as he had to reconsider whether it was possible to substantially reduce the premium for the fleet. The original quotation for the fleet of 12 vessels was RM984,042 and the request was for QBE to reduce premium to about RM777,000 as the next available quotation was RM728,841.20. Even though Chee, as Lui said, was keen to underwrite this risk, it was not plausible that he would have straight away given the substantial reduction requested without further consideration. As a matter of business sense, he would have to see whether this request could be met unconditionally or on terms. In any case, the subsequent confirmation slip dated 19 June 2001 sent, advising total loss cover for two vessels (the 
Lotus
 and the 
Giwin
), shows the absence of a common intention, let alone the existence of a binding oral agreement as pleaded. At that stage, it was possible to keep to the cl 12 deductible of RM100,000 for each vessel, given the total loss cover for the 
Lotus
 and the 
Giwin
. Hoh Lai Fun (“Hoh”) of Steady Concept Sdn Bhd corroborated Chee’s testimony. Hoh is an associate director of LCH (S) Pte Ltd, insurance brokers. Steady Concept is associated with LCH (S) Pte Ltd. At the relevant time, Steady Concept was the plaintiff’s broker. Hoh said that on Lui’s instructions, she asked Chee on 19 June 2001 to cover the 
Lotus
 and the 
Giwin
 on full cover. Chee indicated to her that he would be agreeable to the request but he indicated some adjustments. Initially he said he might have to revise the premium for the two vessels. Furthermore, Hoh’s evidence is that she did receive Chee’s handwritten note where an adjustment was eventually made to the deductible and is not disputing what was said there. Hoh’s testimony is that she then prepared a fax which she said was transmitted to Lui. Lui’s contention that she did not receive Hoh’s fax dated 22 June 2001 does not help the plaintiff. That issue is entirely a matter between Hoh and the plaintiff and does not alter the fact that the plaintiff is impressed with the knowledge of its broker. Chee’s conversation with Hoh on 19 June 2001 and his handwritten note to Hoh all contradicted the alleged common intention or antecedent agreement.
57        In the end, the plaintiff, in my view, has failed to make out a case that there was an antecedent agreement that conflicted with the deductible clause in the policy. For this reason, the rectification sought by the plaintiff fails.
Result

5 November 2004
 
Choo Han Teck J:

 The accused, aged 59 years, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and a charge under s 427 of the Penal Code for the offence of causing mischief. He was at the material time working as a taxi driver. The circumstances relating to both offences were connected with and arose from the same set of facts. The wife of the accused was leaving him for a man called Koh Teng Beng (“Koh”). She had also filed for divorce against the accused. They have two daughters, aged 27 and 30 respectively. On 2 April 2004, the accused telephoned his wife and told her to remove her belongings from the flat. She arrived at the flat with Koh at 12.30pm. When the latter tried to accompany her into the flat the accused stopped him, saying that “outsiders would not be allowed into the flat”. At that point, Koh took out a knife, 19cm long, and threatened the accused with it. The accused ran to his kitchen to arm himself with a kitchen knife of 33cm in length. He then advanced towards Koh who, in his retreat along the external corridor of the flat, threw several flowerpots at the accused. Nonetheless, the accused got to Koh and stabbed him three times in the chest. Koh collapsed at the lift landing and died.

 Dr Clarence Tan performed the post-mortem examination and reported in the autopsy report that Koh had died from the stab wounds. Other medical reports indicated that the accused had also suffered some minor injuries such as abrasions and bruises. A psychiatric report on the accused by the examining psychiatrist Dr Tommy Tan stated that in the doctor’s opinion, the accused did not suffer from unsoundness of mind and was fit to stand trial. Mr Choo Si Sen, who represented the accused, did not object to the report, which, read in its context, indicated that the accused was not of unsound mind in the legal sense. This was made clear in the same report when Dr Tan stated that the accused suffered from a “moderate depressive episode with somatic symptoms” and thus qualified for the legal exception to murder under the nomenclature of “diminished responsibility”. The relevant portion of Dr Tan’s opinion is best set out in full:
In my opinion, the accused suffers from moderate depressive episode with somatic symptoms (F32.11, International Classification of Diseases, edition 10) since, at least, the beginning of this year. His mental disorder is characterised by a depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, somatic complaints, disturbed sleep, poor appetite, a diurnal variation of his mood, anxiety, histrionic (“illogical”) behaviour and agitation. His mental disorder had not been treated.
He was 
not of unsound mind
 at the time of the alleged offence according to the McNaughten’s Rules. However he was suffering form the above disorder at the time of the alleged offence. He was agitated with the presence of his wife and the deceased. He had partial amnesia for the alleged offence. He suffers from abnormality of mind, which would substantially impair his mental responsibility for the acts committed during the alleged offence. He qualifies for a defence of 
diminished responsibility
 for the alleged offence.

 In mitigation, counsel for the accused submitted that the accused had an unblemished record. He also explained the historical background that made the intrusion of Koh offensive and provocative. He stated that there was a period of time when the accused was not earning enough and his wife had to work to sustain the family. In appreciation and out of affection, the accused would regularly massage her aching joints, and cook for her. Her subsequent infidelity hurt him deeply. They had been married for more than 30 years and were hitherto a loving couple, well loved by their daughters, and liked by their neighbours and friends. The accused gave all his income to his wife because he believed that she was better at managing their domestic expenditure and savings. The accused consented to the second charge, namely, for causing mischief in smashing the windscreen of Koh’s car. This took place shortly after he had stabbed Koh. When it was over, the accused telephoned a radio station and declared his crime to the radio broadcaster.

V K Rajah JC:
1          The precepts of the criminal justice system are applied uniformly and even-handedly to all criminal offenders in Singapore. Singaporeans and foreigners alike, residents and visitors alike, employers and employees alike, the affluent and the impecunious alike – all face identical judicial considerations should they choose to run afoul of the law. No innate factors dictated by the identity of the victim or that of the accused will be permitted to colour or cloud judgment and impede the course of justice. A consistently unwavering and relentless application of this judicial remit is a fundamental and inalienable pillar of the Singapore legal system.
2          Foreigners, who commit offences, whether they are employees or transient visitors, should not expect to be treated any differently from Singaporeans in a similar predicament. They can, however, rest assured that their nationality and/or the nationality of the victim will not tip the balance when it comes to judgment and sentencing. Sentencing considerations are determined entirely and solely by the criminal act in the context of the established factual matrix.
Dramatis personae
3          The accused, Purwanti Parji, is an Indonesian national. At the time of the offence on 4 August 2003, she was 17 years and 10 months old and was employed as a domestic worker.
4          The deceased, Har Chit Heang, was 57 years old at the material time. She was a housewife and resided at a house in Tai Keng Gardens (“the Tai Keng house”) with her husband and younger son.
5          The accused was employed as a domestic maid by Ms Mok Wai Cheng (“Ms Mok”), the deceased’s daughter-in-law, in November 2002. Ms Mok is married to the deceased’s elder son and resides at a flat in Block 30 Woodlands Crescent, Singapore (“the Woodlands flat”).
6          The accused stayed with Ms Mok, her husband and their baby daughter at the Woodlands flat on weekends and at the Tai Keng house on weekdays, when the deceased was entrusted with caring for her granddaughter.
Factual overview
7          On 4 August 2003 at about 11.37am, the police received a call from the accused reporting that “just now my auntie give the baby and she go upstairs … since 1030hrs … she say she want to do something … she don’t want to open the door … I don’t know what she is doing … I cannot see her”.
8          When the police arrived at the Tai Keng house, they were let into the premises by the accused, who was carrying the baby. No one else was present in the house. The accused led the police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force paramedics (“SCDF paramedics”) to a bedroom on the second floor of the house. The door was locked from the inside. One of the police officers, Sgt Muhalim bin Rohimin (“Sgt Muhalim”), knocked on the door. There was no response.
9          Upon forcibly entering the bedroom, Sgt Muhalim found the deceased lying motionless on the bed. She was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. She had a knife in her left hand and there were some linear cuts on her right wrist which had bled lightly. The blood around the cuts had dried up. There were fingernail abrasions on the deceased’s neck. Her right eye was bruised. The SCDF paramedics attempted to resuscitate the deceased but to no avail. All vital signs of life were absent. The deceased was pronounced dead at 12.13pm by one of the attending SCDF paramedics.
10        There were no visible signs of any forced entry into the Tai Keng house or any indication that a burglary had been committed. On his arrival, the deceased’s husband informed the police that the family had recently received two anonymous handwritten notes advising them to monitor the activities of the accused and to securely keep the keys of the rear gate of the house.
11        Further enquiries failed to reveal the presence of any suspicious persons in the vicinity of the house at the material time.
12        The police officers, however, observed that the accused had neatly cut fingernails that appeared to have been very recently trimmed. The accused was subsequently arrested at about 9.55pm on suspicion of having murdered the deceased. She underwent a medical examination at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital later that evening. Superficial abrasions were noted over her right index and right middle fingers. When interviewed at the Criminal Investigation Department, she admitted that she had strangled the deceased on the morning of 4 August 2003.
13        On 5 August 2003, an autopsy was performed by a forensic pathologist, Dr George Paul. He found multiple abrasions on the deceased’s chin region and her neck. There had been extensive bleeding in the underlying neck muscles. In addition, the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage were fractured. There was a further haemorrhage under the scalp in the right temporal region, bruises on both eyelids and extensive subconjunctival haemorrhage in both eyes.
14        According to Dr George Paul, the abrasions were “consistent with those inflicted by fingertips and nails, from gripping the neck region and were sufficient, by causing damage to the neck structures within, to cause death in the ordinary [course] of nature by strangulation”. He was of the opinion that the “pattern of crescentric and somewhat transverse abrasions as well as the extensive circumscribed effusion of blood in the underlying muscles of the neck and the asymmetric fractures of the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage suggest these injuries to have arisen from manual strangulation”. In his view, the scalp bruising appeared to be the result of an impact with some linear blunt object. He certified the cause of death as “strangulation”.
15        Investigations revealed that on the morning of 4 August 2003, the deceased, her husband and younger son had all been staying as usual at the Tai Keng house. The deceased’s elder son, Ms Mok, their baby and the accused arrived at the Tai Keng house early in the morning, after which the couple left for work at about 8.15am. Her younger son departed at about 9.00am and the deceased’s husband left for work shortly thereafter, leaving only the deceased, the baby and the accused at home.
16        The accused claimed that she first contemplated killing the deceased while she was carrying out her household chores. She had become agitated and was extremely upset with the deceased for unjustifiably reprimanding her. When the thought first crossed her mind, the deceased was sleeping in her bedroom on the second floor of the Tai Keng house with the baby. The accused states that she twice approached the deceased’s bedroom with the intention of strangling her but failed to carry out the act. After the second occasion, she noticed a knife upon returning to the kitchen. She seized it and proceeded once again to the deceased’s bedroom clutching the knife.
17        However upon entering the bedroom she decided against using the knife and proceeded to strangle the deceased who was sound asleep. In the process of strangling the deceased, she used one of her hands to press the deceased’s eyes shut. Having been caught unawares, the deceased could only put up mild resistance. As a consequence of the deceased’s struggling, they both fell off the bed and the deceased hit her head against a small table standing beside the bed. Shortly thereafter, all resistance from the deceased completely ceased. The accused then carried the deceased and placed her back on the bed. In order to simulate the appearance of a suicide, the accused used the knife to cut the deceased’s right wrist and placed the knife in the deceased’s left hand.
18        The accused then calmly carried the baby out of the bedroom, shut the bedroom door and proceeded downstairs. She had earlier noticed her nail marks on the deceased’s neck. In an attempt to conceal her involvement, she trimmed her fingernails with a nail-clipper. She later proceeded to feed the baby after which she contacted the police (see [7] above).
19        The accused then left the house and sought the help of the neighbours. She told them that the deceased had not emerged from her bedroom for some time and that she had concerns about her well-being.
20        The accused was initially charged with the murder of the deceased pursuant to s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). Just before the proceedings commenced, the charge was amended to a lesser charge of culpable homicide pursuant to s 304(a) of the PC, which prescribes, 
inter alia
, a sentence of life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years. The accused admits having strangled the deceased and has now entered an unqualified plea of guilt to the amended charge.
The employer and domestic worker relationship
21        The privacy and sanctity of the home constitute a sacred right. Having said that, the relationship between an employer and a domestic worker is not a private matter in which public policy has no role to play or right to intrude. Domestic workers are not chattels to be abused and debased with impunity. The sanctity of hearth and home should be respected and preserved in such a manner that both household members and domestic workers enjoy secure expectations and total peace of mind that physical violence in any form is alien and wholly impermissible in the context of their relationship.
22        The court has repeatedly made it patently clear that employers who mistreat their foreign domestic workers will be severely excoriated, with such malfeasance entailing nothing less than severe deterrent sentences. In this context, Yong Pung How CJ emphatically stated in 
Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP
 
[2001] 4 SLR 610
 at [26]:
In imposing custodial sentences, the courts in cases like 
Wong Suet Peng v PP
 (MA 170/2000) and 
Chung Poh Chee v PP
 (MA 71/2000) have recognised the need for deterrence and the importance of public policy in this area.
23        While there may be instances of foreign domestic workers being maintained in a “prison without walls”, this would be unusual. Given Singapore’s highly built-up and urbanised neighbourhoods, domestic workers who are mistreated will, almost invariably, be able to communicate their distress to third parties or to have it noted. There are also mandatory medical check-ups for all foreign domestic workers semi-annually. One cannot deny, however, that there will sadly be instances where abuse of domestic workers carries on unhindered and unheeded. Members of the public have a role to play in stamping out such instances of domestic worker abuse. They can assist by drawing such cases to the attention of the relevant authorities. It is in the interests of the community at large that incorrigible employers be brought to task so that any abusive behaviour towards domestic workers be unconditionally curbed and condemned. Indeed, it has been observed that abusive conduct of this 
genre
 may damage Singapore’s international relations: see 
Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP
 at [26] and [28].
24        The employer and domestic worker relationship is a complex, intricate and delicate amalgam of mutual expectations, responsibilities and trust. Some employers fail or refuse to appreciate that this is a bilateral commitment with reciprocal rights and duties, necessitating a “give and take” approach on both sides. Many foreign domestic workers need a period of acclimatisation and adjustment upon joining a new household. They are completely reliant on their employers who have a solemn responsibility for their physical and mental well-being. In turn, domestic workers owe duties of honesty, loyalty and good faith to their employers. For instance, deception and fraudulent behaviour constitute a total anathema to the basis of their relationship with their employers. Fundamentally, just as employers cannot inflict violence on domestic workers for any perceived misconduct, domestic workers in turn cannot respond to any perceived unfair or oppressive conduct through violence or any insidious means and measures that may cause harm.
25        Unfortunately, foreign domestic workers are sometimes subjected to rigorous clockwork regimes without so much as a modicum of understanding or acknowledgement from their employers that they might be experiencing severe cultural, personal and emotional stress and tension. In addition, they might be victims of relentless belittling and verbal abuse in some households, at the mercy of inconsiderate, callous employers and/or other household members. This builds up resentment and a festering anger that sometimes unfortunately explodes into irrational retaliation.
26        While the reasons for such corrosive and explosive anger can on occasion be understood – 
retaliatory violence
 can under no circumstances be condoned or justified, save for the very limited and extremely narrow exceptions which have been explicitly recognised in the PC. Any physical violence in the context of a domestic worker-employer relationship, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator – domestic worker, employer or any other household member – must be emphatically and unequivocally condemned and denounced both through words and through severe sentencing.
The plea in mitigation
27        Counsel for the accused made an impassioned plea that a sentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed on the accused because of her relative youthfulness and hitherto “unblemished record”.
28        The accused has had a difficult and unpleasant life of poverty and hardship. She had been mistreated by her step-mother and at the tender age of 13 was sent to Jakarta to work as a maid. Soon after her seventeenth birthday, she arrived in Singapore to commence employment with Ms Mok. The income the accused earned was intended to supplement her family’s income.
29        Shortly after she arrived in Singapore, she had to work for two households – Ms Mok’s and the deceased’s. It is alleged that her household chores commenced at 5.00am and stretched until midnight. Ms Mok had no complaints about the accused’s work performance. Ms Mok also admitted that the deceased had reprimanded the accused in her presence and there were times when the “accused appeared sad”.
30        It is further asserted that the deceased “constantly nagged and cursed” the accused and on occasion assaulted her. The accused also claims she was not given sufficient food.
31        On the fateful morning, it is claimed, “the deceased chided the [a]ccused for not cleaning the toilet properly and tried to slap her. The slap was blocked by the [a]ccused. The deceased as usual abused and cursed her and then went up to sleep”. This was the proverbial “straw that broke the camel’s back”. The following extracts from counsel’s submission are at once illuminating and deeply disconcerting:
The Accused snapped and decided to kill the deceased for in her mind she saw no way out. She strangled the Deceased and tried to make it look as if it’s a suicide. 
She believed that with the Deceased gone, she can return to work for the employer
.
…
This crime was committed in despair and desperation. The Accused did not want to be sent back home neither did she want to go back home. She needed the income badly. 
In her mind, the only way she can survive is when the Deceased does not exist.
 Without the Deceased, she can continue to work. 
This explains why she wanted to make it look like suicide so that she can continue to work
. The Accused did not have a childhood. She became an adult at the age of 9. 
For the Accused, kindness and love were something alien
.
[emphasis added]
32        Counsel also instructively referred me to the Court of Appeal decision in 
PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
 where it was observed at [37] and [40]:
[W]e are of the view that the courts must now exercise caution before committing a young offender to life imprisonment. Contrary to traditional reasoning, in similar cases involving a youthful offender on the one hand and an older offender in the other, the youthful offender sentenced to life imprisonment would now be subject to a longer period of incarceration than an older offender, assuming they both lived to the same age.
…
In a situation in which the court is desirous of a sentence greater then ten years, but feels that a sentence of life imprisonment is excessive, we have no choice but to come down, however reluctantly, on the side of leniency. Otherwise, the punishment imposed would significantly exceed the offender’s culpability. It would, in our view, be wrong to adopt an approach in which the court would prefer an excessive sentence to an inadequate one.
The Prosecution’s submission on sentence
33        The Prosecution submits that the accused’s act of killing the deceased satisfies the legal requirements of the offence of murder pursuant to s 302 of the PC. The prescribed punishment for the offence of murder is death. By dint of s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), a sentence of death shall not be pronounced on an offender “if it appears to the court that the offender was under the age of 18 years at the time when the offence was committed”. In such cases, the court shall instead sentence the offender to be detained during the President’s pleasure. In the present case, the accused was under 18 years of age at the time of the offence, and is therefore not liable to suffer the death sentence.
34        After considering the accused’s representations, the Prosecution exercised its discretion to prefer a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder pursuant to s 304(a) of the PC, as the accused was agreeable to entering a plea of guilt to that charge. The Prosecution agreed to this course of action as it spared the deceased’s family members the pain and trauma of testifying in court.
35        The Prosecution submits that the accused bore ill feelings towards the deceased as a consequence of the deceased’s alleged abusive treatment of her. However, the facts reveal that the accused did not commit the killing due to any momentary loss of self-control or sudden rage. On the day itself, the accused had twice approached the deceased, who was sleeping in the bedroom, intending to strangle the deceased, but then hesitating each time. Finally, the accused acted on her intention to kill and retrieved a knife from the kitchen and once again proceeded to the deceased’s bedroom. This time, the accused strangled the deceased without any compunction.
36        It is further contended that even if the deceased had scolded the accused that morning, there was a lapse of time which would have enabled the accused to calm down. The accused’s repeated attempts to pursue her original intention to kill the deceased demonstrated that she was in full control of her actions. The Prosecution submits that when the accused did finally strangle the deceased, it was motivated by ill feeling, and was not a result of any loss of self-control. The Prosecution urged the court to pass a sentence of life imprisonment on the accused.
Sentencing considerations
37        The two principle sentencing considerations of particular relevance to the present factual matrix are 
retribution
 and 
deterrence
; see 
PP v Chaw Aiang Wah
 
[2004] SGHC 164
 at [18].
38        Without condescending into the particulars of counsel’s variegated catalogue of abuses allegedly inflicted by the deceased on the accused, it must emphatically be stated that this callous and heinous crime cannot by any stretch of imagination be justified or condoned on the pretext of “maid abuse”. I am prepared, however, to accept that there is some basis to assert that the deceased was at times unnecessarily severe with the accused. The fact that the accused did not make similar assertions of abusive behaviour against any other member of the household also lends some support to this assertion. The accused’s anger and hatred were focused solely and unremittingly on the deceased.
39        It is apparent that the accused did not act spontaneously or instinctively as a consequence of some grave and sudden or physical provocation She bided her time that morning until the deceased took a nap. She then wilfully executed her desire and intention to kill the deceased. The systematic attempt to cover up her involvement in the homicide fortifies my view that she had carefully thought through the consequences of her conduct and the need to meticulously conceal her role in the diabolical act.
40        I also take into account the fact that the accused had the presence of mind to craftily simulate the appearance of a suicide soon after remorselessly strangling the deceased. The accused with remarkable 
sangfroid
 telephoned the police feigning ignorance about the deceased’s death. She consciously sought out the neighbours and attempted to sow the seeds of a theory that the deceased had taken her own life.
41        Even assuming 
arguendo
 that the deceased had repeatedly abused the accused verbally, it strikes me that the accused was no shrinking violet unable to fend for herself or to communicate her difficulties or distress to the world at large. In killing the deceased and thereafter attempting to camouflage her involvement, she displayed considerable, albeit ill-conceived, resourcefulness and composure. It appears to me that the accused had a brittle and immature temperament and carried out her wicked scheme because of her professed long-standing resentment against the deceased. There does not appear to be cogent concrete evidence of physical “maid abuse” preceding the homicide. The accused appeared to be quite capable of fending for herself if push came to shove. She is clearly a resourceful and calculating person.
42        I take into consideration the fact that she did not harm the baby, and made no allegations of ill-treatment against any other member of the household, in addition to the other points raised by her counsel. In the circumstances of this case, however, these matters cannot be regarded as plausible mitigating factors.
Conclusion
43        This is a disturbing case with a number of aggravating features pointing unambiguously to a considerable degree of premeditation on the part of the accused. The accused has unjustifiably and abominably caused a tragic death.
44        It bears reiterating at this juncture that domestic workers who resort to violence and/or retaliatory conduct should, like violent and abusive employers, expect nothing less than severe condemnation and harsh deterrent sentences. They should instead always attempt to seek redress for their grievances through purely legitimate means. Self-help culminating in violent means and measures must and will be categorically deplored and denounced by the court. The primitive laws of the jungle cannot be justified or sanctioned in the context of the vulnerable relationships of mutual trust and reliance inherent in a domestic household.
45        An unequivocal signal has to be conveyed, through the meting out of an appropriate sentence, that premeditated violence, particularly in the setting of a domestic household relationship, will be severely dealt with. I am constrained to determine that, notwithstanding her relative youthfulness, the appropriate punishment for the accused will be a sentence of life imprisonment. A sentence of ten years’ imprisonment would in this factual matrix be wholly inappropriate and inadequate. The sentence of life imprisonment shall commence with effect from 4 August 2003.

The Prosecution’s case
 
2          The Prosecution and the Defence agreed on the matters set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts. The Statement reads:
 
Statement of Agreed Facts
 
1          On 7 Jan 2004, acting on information received, a party of CNB officers were deployed to look for the accused at the vicinity of Block 115 Yishun Ring Road.  When they were at the vicinity, they saw a taxi SHA 7670 going into the carpark leading to Blocks 110 to 115 Yishun Ring Road with a passenger at the rear seat.  The taxi was thereafter seen leaving the carpark of Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road without the passenger inside.
 
2          At about 10.15 am, the CNB officers spotted the accused standing behind Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road and using his mobile phone.  The accused was at that time seen holding a red paper bag.  He thereafter walked to the exercise corner near Blk 115 and sat down on a wooden chair.
 
3          At about 10.45 am, the accused was spotted walking to the void deck of Blk 115 carrying the red paper bag.  He was then seen walking along the void deck of Blk 115 towards Blk 110 carrying a yellow paper bag in addition to the red bag.  He then proceeded towards Blk 110 Yishun Ring Road and entered a provision shop there.
 
4          After a while, he emerged from the provision shop holding the red paper bag, the yellow paper bag and an additional white plastic bag.  He was then seen standing along Yishun Ring Road waiting for a taxi.  At about 11.10 am, the accused person boarded taxi SHA 3884 X which travelled along Yishun Ring Road, Yishun Avenue 2, Lentor Avenue and from there, entered the Central Expressway (“CTE”).
 
5          The CNB officers trailed the accused in the taxi SHA 3884 X.  Subsequently, they received instructions to intercept the said taxi, and did so at the first available opportunity, when the taxi exited the CTE at about 11.30 am, long Upper Serangoon Road near Woodsville Close.
 
6          The accused was arrested while seated in the rear of the taxi.  At the time of the arrest, the red paper bag (containing the yellow paper bag) and the white plastic bag were found beside the accused person.  The CNB officers then escorted the accused in the taxi SHA 3884X to Puay Hee Avenue.
 
7          At Puay Hee Avenue in the taxi SHA 3884X, Senior Station Inspector Siew Lai Lone recorded a statement from the accused, in which the accused admitted ownership of red paper bag and confirmed that he was told that it contained 4 pounds of heroin.  The accused also informed SSI Siew that he was residing at No 2 Topaz Road #03-01 Topaz Mansion.
 
 
8          At about 11.45 am, another party of CNB officers led by SSgt Tony Ng Sze Chiang arrived at Puay Hee Avenue to take over the custody of the accused and the following exhibits that were seized during the arrest:
 
a.         the red paper bag (containing the yellow paper bag),
 
b.         the white plastic bag and
 
c.         the accused’s handphone.
 
9          The red paper bag (containing the yellow paper bag) seized during the accused person’s arrest was found to contain:
 
(a)        A bundle wrapped in plastic, containing two packets of yellowish granular substance.
 
(b)        A yellow paper bag containing a bundle wrapped in plastic.  Two packets of yellowish granular substance were found in this bundle.
 
10         Upon the exhibits being sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis, it was ascertained that the four packets of yellowish granular substance together contained not less than 
149.1 grams of diamorphine
.
 
11         After this party of CNB officers took over custody of the accused and the drug exhibits, they brought the accused to his rented apartment at No 2 Topaz Road #03-01 Topaz Mansion (“Topaz apartment”).  They arrived at the Topaz apartment at about 12.05 pm and discovered that two male Chinese persons were present in the Topaz apartment.  The two male Chinese were then placed under arrest and they were established to be Boo Hang Guang and Tan Ah Leng.
 
12         The accused person then led the CNB officers to various places in the master bedroom and the master bedroom toilet where various drugs exhibits and drug paraphernalia were recovered as follows:

3          The accused did not challenge any of the statements made by him in the course of investigations on the ground of voluntariness. In the statement recorded by Senior Station Inspector Siew Sai Lone (“SSI Siew”) at Puay Hee Avenue, the accused admitted that there were four pounds of heroin in the red paper bag and said that he had taken the heroin from one Lau Tee at the void deck of Block 122 Yishun Ring Road. He paid Lau Tee $30,000 for it. He also admitted that that occasion was the second time he had taken heroin from Lau Tee. The first transaction also took place at the same location. SSI Siew, a CNB officer since 1978, testified that he did not notice the accused exhibiting drug withdrawal symptoms such as shivering, a runny nose or yawning.
4          In another statement recorded that day at about 12.15pm in the apartment in Topaz Mansion by Senior Staff Sergeant Tony Ng (“SSG Ng”), the accused admitted again that there were four pounds of heroin in the red paper bag and that he had obtained them from Lao Di in Yishun. He said he paid Lao Di $30,000 for the heroin. The apartment was rented by the accused. He maintained that the two men arrested by the CNB officers in the apartment had nothing to do with the drugs found therein. He explained that the two men went to the apartment occasionally to consume heroin and spent the night there in the other bedroom. SSG Tony Ng said the accused appeared normal when he was recording his statement. The accused did not appear to be suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and he did not complain that he was.
5          SSG Ng took custody of the drugs at Puay Hee Avenue and brought them to the apartment in Topaz Mansion. He also took custody of the exhibits seized in the apartment. He handed over everything to the investigating officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police Goh Boon Pin (“ASP Goh”), when ASP Goh arrived at the apartment later, after informing him of the various locations the exhibits were found in. Subsequently, he witnessed ASP Goh weighing the drugs back in the CNB office.
6          ASP Goh testified that in addition to the items listed above, two stacks of Singapore currency notes amounting to $6,600 were also found. There were more than 3,000 empty, small plastic packets among the exhibits. After directing the taking of photographs of the scene and the exhibits, ASP Goh took custody of all the exhibits, including the drugs seized in the taxi earlier, placed them into individual plastic bags with labels and then put all the plastic bags into a large plastic bag. He brought all these back to the CNB office for safekeeping in his safe and his cabinet. He locked the safe and the cabinet. He did not keep the exhibits in the CNB store as it closed at 6.00pm and he would not have been able to bring them out to weigh in the accused’s presence that evening.
7          Later that evening, he took out the drug exhibits and weighed them in the presence of the accused. He then returned the drug exhibits to the safe and the cabinet and locked them. Next, he instructed that the accused be brought to Alexandra Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination.
8          ASP Goh, who has seven years’ experience as a CNB officer, added that one pound of heroin could be repacked into 60 8g packets. Around 20 2cm straws could be made from each 8g packet. The market price in January 2004 was $8,000 to $10,000 per pound of heroin while the street value was $400 to $600 per 8g packet. One pound of heroin repacked into sixty 8g packets could therefore potentially reap in $24,000 to $36,000. The purity of the heroin found in the taxi was more than 8% while the purity of that found in the apartment was slightly less than 8%. As heroin was normally in packets of between 1% and 3% purity, the heroin here was therefore of a good quality.
9          Dr Choong Yih Li examined the accused at Alexandra Hospital at 10.50pm on 7 January 2004. He observed that the accused appeared slightly drowsy and was yawning persistently. The accused had tearing in both eyes and was shivering despite wearing a T-shirt and warm sweater. His gait was also unsteady. The doctor referred the accused to Changi Prison Hospital (“CPH”) for observation as he appeared to be suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms. The doctor was not able to comment on the severity of the withdrawal suffered by the accused.
10        The accused was warded at CPH after midnight. Peter Ho, a staff nurse, testified orally that he observed the accused and took down his medical history. He noted that the accused was yawning frequently and had an unsteady gait. The accused claimed that he had a runny nose, diarrhoea, nausea, body ache and pain but had no vomiting or gastric pain. There were goose pimples on both his upper arms and upper body. There was also mild trembling in both upper limbs. He was having a fever. The accused claimed that he consumed a “very small amount” of heroin at around 10.00am on 7 January 2004.
11        At about 7.00am on 8 January 2004, Peter Ho observed the accused while making his rounds before handing over duty. The accused was sleeping.
12        Dr Mohd Emran Mamat (“Dr Emran”), a medical officer at CPH, saw the accused on 8, 9 and 10 January 2004. He noted that the accused “exhibited signs and symptoms of mild drug withdrawal”. He based this finding on the notes made by the staff nurse. When the doctor examined the accused at 10.00am on 8 January 2004, most of the symptoms noted had subsided save for the accused’s claim about having diarrhoea. He spoke to the accused in English. The accused did not appear to have difficulty understanding the doctor. The doctor recorded that the accused said he smoked about one packet of heroin a day for the past two months and consumed three straws of heroin at about 10.00am on 7 January 2004. Over the next two days, the accused was alert and said he felt better. He was discharged from CPH on 10 January 2004.
13        Dr Emran, who has been a prison medical officer with the Raffles Medical Group for the last four years, has seen around 70 patients experiencing drug withdrawal symptoms. He explained that there were three categories of drug withdrawal. A mild withdrawal would occur within six to 12 hours after the last consumption of drugs, manifesting itself as flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, fever, chill and body ache. A moderate withdrawal would involve hot or cold flushes, profuse perspiration, muscular spasms, increased sensitivity to pain, abdominal cramps and severe diarrhoea. When the symptoms became intolerable, the patient would be having a severe withdrawal and medical intervention would be required. Usually, the major withdrawal symptoms would manifest themselves between 48 and 72 hours after the last consumption of drugs and might continue for seven to ten days. If the symptoms were prolonged, medication would be given. None was dispensed in the case of the accused.
14        Dr Emran said that there was a correlation between the symptoms and the rate of consumption. The higher the consumption, the more severe the withdrawal would be and the longer the time taken for the symptoms to subside. If the accused had been taking one packet of heroin a day for the past two months, he would expect the symptoms to be at the moderate level, 
ie
, worse than what he exhibited. However, he was not able to say what the accused’s rate of consumption was.
15        Dr Emran testified under cross-examination that the accused’s symptoms could be suggestive of a mild or a moderate withdrawal. The progression of the symptoms had to be taken into account as well. He agreed that symptoms could vary between different people. The purer the heroin, the more severe the withdrawal would be. However, based on his experience and observations over the three days the accused was in CPH, he stood by his opinion that the withdrawal was a mild one. He opined that it was unlikely the accused had consumed one packet of heroin a day.
16        While the accused was in CPH, on 8 January 2004 ASP Goh took out the exhibits from his safe and his cabinet to mark them before sending them to the Health Sciences Authority for analysis. After completing the marking, he placed the exhibits back into the safe and the cabinet and locked them up. Later that afternoon, he took out the exhibits again and brought them to the CNB Press Conference Room for the purpose of a press release. After that, he replaced the exhibits and locked them up.
17        On 9 January 2004, he took out the exhibits and sent them over to the Health Sciences Authority.
18        At about 10.40am on 10 January 2004, ASP Goh was informed that the accused would be discharged from CPH. He immediately arranged for the accused to undergo a pre-statement medical examination at Alexandra Hospital. Dr Paul See examined the accused at about 3.00pm. The accused did not complain that he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms. When Dr Paul See saw the accused again at 5.40pm for the post-statement medical examination, the accused also did not say anything about being in withdrawal.
19        In statements made to ASP Goh, the accused said that the heroin found in the taxi and in the apartment and the paraphernalia for consuming drugs belonged to him and had nothing to do with the other two men. They were friends whom he had met while in drug rehabilitation centres. They would go to the rented apartment frequently to consume heroin. The accused provided them the heroin free of charge but sometimes the two men would pay him some money. They also bought food for him when they went to the apartment.
20        The accused, described in the statements as unemployed, said that in or about October 2003, he decided to start selling heroin again as he owed about $200,000 to loan sharks. He went to Geylang and was told by a friend that Lau Di could supply heroin in large quantities. He subsequently met Lau Di and asked him whether he could supply heroin in pounds to him. Lau Di said he could help to check.
21        In early November 2003, the accused rented the apartment in question. The landlord and the property agent testified that the rent was $1,200 per month and that the accused handed over $2,400 for the first month’s rent and a deposit of one month’s rent. He also paid $600 to the property agent as commission. Around mid-December 2003, Lau Di called him on his mobile telephone. Lau Di told the accused that the supply of heroin of between two to four pounds would be arriving in a few days’ time. The agreed price was $10,000 for one pound of heroin. A few days later, Lau Di called to say the heroin had arrived. The accused took delivery of it at the Yishun public housing estate. That transaction was about two weeks before his arrest. The heroin found in the apartment on 7 January 2004 was the remainder of the four pounds received on the first occasion. The accused stated that he repacked one pound of heroin into about 56 smaller packets of about 7.5g each and used a lighter to seal them. He sold each packet for $300. He also consumed heroin whenever he wanted to. He would take the heroin from the small packets. He consumed about one packet a day.
22        One of the two men arrested in the apartment on 7 January 2004, Boo Hang Guang (“Boo”), testified that a friend informed him in November 2003 that the accused wanted to contact him. When he called the accused, the accused asked Boo whether he wanted to consume heroin. The accused arranged to meet him. He brought Boo to the apartment in Topaz Mansion and took out a straw of heroin which they then consumed together.
23        After that incident, Boo went to the apartment around once a week on seven or eight occasions and slept over two or three times. On all those occasions, the accused offered him straws of heroin free of charge. Boo wanted to pay for the heroin but the accused declined the payment. Boo therefore brought him food when Boo visited the apartment. Boo met the other man, Tan Ah Leng, in the apartment on two or three occasions.
24        At around 8.00am on 7 January 2004, Boo called the accused to ask whether he had any heroin. When the accused said he had, Boo went to the apartment. He saw Tan Ah Leng sleeping in the second bedroom (the master bedroom was occupied by the accused). The accused handed Boo a straw of heroin to consume. However, Boo also said he consumed two to three straws of heroin that morning. At about 10.00am, the accused told Boo he was going out for a while. At around noontime, the accused returned, escorted by the CNB officers. Boo did not know the accused had so much heroin in the master bedroom. Whenever he went to the apartment, the accused was there and the door of the master bedroom was open. However, it was closed that morning when the accused left the apartment.
25        Boo said that his average consumption was one or two straws of heroin a day. When he was at the apartment, he and the accused would consume heroin at any time of the day. He suffered from withdrawal symptoms for about three weeks after 7 January 2004. He is currently serving sentence for the offence of consumption of heroin.
26        Tan Ah Leng has known the accused since 1988. In October or November 2003, he contacted the accused and asked him whether he had any place for him to stay. The answer was in the negative. However, in late November, the accused told him he could sleep over on a few nights in the accused’s rented apartment.
27        Tan Ah Leng stayed in the apartment on seven or eight occasions. He saw the accused consuming heroin in the toilet of the master bedroom and asked him for some heroin. The accused gave him some without charge. Tan Ah Leng consumed about one straw of heroin a day or three to four per week.
28        On 6 January 2004, he went to the accused’s apartment and saw the accused sitting on the toilet bowl of the master bedroom consuming heroin. He joined the accused in the toilet to consume heroin. Before Tan Ah Leng went back to the other bedroom to rest, he asked the accused to give him more heroin. When the accused asked him to help himself to some, he filled two empty straws with heroin from a small container and then went to the other bedroom where he consumed some of the heroin from one of the straws. He then went to sleep. The next day, he was awakened when the CNB officers went to the apartment with the accused. He is currently serving sentence for the offences of possession and consumption of heroin.
29        Tan Ah Leng said in cross-examination that he considered the accused a heavier consumer of heroin than himself because the accused was consuming heroin whenever he went to the apartment.
30        Dr Ann Young, an analyst with the Health Sciences Authority, conducted an analysis of a urine sample taken from the accused on the day of his arrest. She found that the sample contained 16.5 micrograms of morphine per millilitre of urine which she said was a moderate amount. Another test done by another analyst on another urine sample showed 2.4 micrograms of morphine per millilitre of urine. Dr Ann Young said that there was no correlation between the amount of morphine in urine samples with the amount consumed because urine was a very unstable substance. The provider of the samples could have drunk varying amounts of water, perspired or gone to the toilet many times. Asked to comment on the discrepancies in the results of the two samples, she surmised that the samples could have been collected at different times or some water could have been left in the bottles after washing.
31        Dr Rasaiah Munidasa Winslow, a senior consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health, was called by the prosecution to testify orally about various aspects of drug withdrawal. He specialises in addiction medicine, which includes heroin abuse, and has been treating heroin addicts since 1992. Currently, he sees about a hundred such patients yearly.
32        Dr Winslow gave some guidance on the classification of the severity of addiction. Mild addiction would result from the taking of one to two straws of heroin a day, moderate addiction three to five straws a day and severe addiction six or more a day.
33        There are more than 20 different symptoms of heroin withdrawal. The symptoms vary depending on the severity of withdrawal. A mild case of withdrawal would include symptoms such as fatigue, yawning, some restlessness and tiredness, and sometimes goose bumps. The symptoms generally peak between 12 and 36 hours and disappear within 48 and 72 hours. The addict should be able to sleep unless he has also been abusing other substances like sleeping tablets. A moderate case would include the whole spectrum of symptoms, judged by when the onset of symptoms begins, how severe they are and how long they last. In the first few days, there is difficulty in sleeping. The symptoms peak between 24 and 48 hours and can last for four to five days. The most severe cases of withdrawal last five to ten days and involve symptoms like nausea, vomiting, restlessness, severe pain, diarrhoea and an inability to sleep well. The symptoms peak about 72 hours after the cessation of consumption.
34        Dr Winslow stated that the heavier the usage of drugs, the more rapid the onset of symptoms after cessation and the longer the symptoms last. There are, of course, some deviations from the norm. Looking at the notes of the medical examination of the accused at Alexandra Hospital on 7 January 2004, Dr Winslow was of the view that he could have been at any stage of withdrawal although the likelihood was that it was a case of mild to moderate withdrawal. Perusing the medical history taken at CPH, he agreed with Dr Emran’s assessment of the accused’s case as one of mild withdrawal. He was also of the view that if the accused had been consuming one packet of heroin a day in the two months before his arrest, his symptoms would appear unusually mild. Since his symptoms had subsided by 9 January 2004, taking into account the overall picture, it was probably a case of mild withdrawal.
35        Dr Winslow said there was no direct correlation between the amount of heroin consumed and the amount of morphine found in the urine. He could not tell how much heroin the accused had consumed as there were occasional cases of heavy users exhibiting mild withdrawal symptoms. Out of 100 patients that he sees a year, at most 5% to 10% would not show the severity of symptoms which was in line with the amount of heroin consumed.
The case for the Defence
36        At the close of the Prosecution’s case in the afternoon of 14 September 2004, the accused was called upon to make his defence to the charge. Defence counsel requested that the proceedings be stood down to the next day for the accused to reconsider his intention to remain silent.
37        The next day, after conferring with both his counsel, the accused elected to remain silent and to call no witness to testify in his defence.
The decision of the court
38        The Prosecution relied on the following to prove its case:
(a)        The presumption in s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed):
(b)        The statements given by the accused to SSI Siew Lai Lone, SSG Ng and ASP Goh.
(c)        The circumstantial evidence relating to the paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking.
39        The Prosecution’s evidence proved that the accused was in possession of the packets of the granular substance seized in the taxi and in the apartment in Topaz Mansion. The accused admitted as much in his various statements.
40        The Defence criticised the investigators for not having proved the chain of custody of the packets from arrest to analysis. However, I had no doubt that SSG Ng did take custody of the packets in the taxi and that he did bring them to the apartment where he handed them over to ASP Goh together with those found in the apartment after the latter arrived at Topaz Mansion and completed his investigations. No other drugs were seized before the CNB officers intercepted the taxi or while on the way to Topaz Mansion. There was therefore no issue of a mix-up somewhere along the way. Although SSG Ng could not recall the time when he handed over the packets to ASP Goh and although he did not record the handing over, I believed his testimony that the packets seized from the taxi were with him all the time until they were handed over. Similarly, there was no question of any mix-up where the packets found in the apartment were concerned.
41        SSG Ng was also criticised by the Defence for having brought the packets seized from “one crime scene to another” instead of bringing them back to the CNB store for safekeeping. It was argued that, by doing so, he could have caused a mix-up in the exhibits. As I have indicated above, I was satisfied that there was no mix-up. In any event, even if there had been a mix-up, it would have made no difference as the charge consolidated the drugs found in both places.
42        Similarly, I believed ASP Goh’s testimony that he took over the exhibits from SSG Ng and placed them into individual plastic bags before carting them back to the CNB office. There is no requirement that a written acknowledgement be given in respect of the handing over. ASP Goh has explained that he did not keep the exhibits in the CNB store because he wanted to bring them out later to weigh in the presence of the accused after the accused had gone through the administrative procedures and had his urine samples taken. I see no fault in that. When the drugs were weighed in the accused’s presence, there was no indication from him that there could not have been so much. When his statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) were recorded on 10 January 2004, he admitted that the drugs in the taxi and in the apartment were his without qualifying the amount.
43        ASP Goh’s testimony that he took care that nothing else was in the safe and in the cabinet when he placed the exhibits therein has not been discredited in any way. He was the only one handling them and he ensured that the safe and the cabinet were locked each time he put the exhibits back in. There is no requirement that exhibits can only be taken out in the presence of accused persons.
44        The Defence argued that ASP Goh had referred to the drugs as a yellowish granular substance while the analyst from the Health Sciences Authority had described those received by her as a granular or powdery substance without specifying the colour. It asked whether there could have been a mix-up with other drug exhibits from other cases. I do not see a material difference in the two descriptions. Further, the analyst was cross-examined by the Defence and she was not asked why she had omitted the colour of the exhibits.
45        I found no gaps in the chain of evidence relating to the drugs in question. There was no doubt as to the identity of the drug exhibits. As the drugs proved to be in the possession of the accused have been analysed and found to contain a total of 226.57g of diamorphine, the presumption in s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act applied. This presumption states that any person proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. The burden is therefore on the accused to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.
46        The Defence submitted that three points emerged from the accused’s voluntary statements to ASP Goh. Firstly, he was consuming from the stock of heroin in his possession in Topaz Mansion. Secondly, he consumed whenever he wanted to do so. Thirdly, he consumed about 7.5g per day. It was argued that it was clear from the evidence of the two friends arrested in the apartment on 7 January 2004 that the accused was a “severe addict” who consumed heroin daily and at all times of the day. It was submitted that Dr Emran was not able to ascertain the rate of consumption from the withdrawal symptoms manifested by the accused. Similarly, while Dr Winslow said that there was a correlation between the rate of consumption and the withdrawal symptoms in the sense that a heavier user would experience a more rapid onset of symptoms and symptoms that lasted longer, he accepted that there was a small number of heavy users who might not exhibit severe withdrawal symptoms.
47        The Defence pointed out that Rajendran J in 
PP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa
 
[1996] 1 SLR 783
 at 813, [125], doubted whether the position adopted by the prosecution there that the severity of drug addiction could be determined by reference to the severity of withdrawal was a sound one. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal: see 
PP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa
 
[1995] SGCA 87
. Since the accused was a severe addict who needed to consume about 7.5g of heroin a day, and considering the accused’s statement that he could not contact the supplier and that it was the supplier who would contact him, it was submitted that “it would be prudent to assume that the accused would want to hold on to his drug supplies and not be in a hurry to sell them off”.
48        It was clear that the accused was trafficking in heroin. His statements and the drug paraphernalia such as the weighing scale and the more than 3,000 empty plastic packets found in the apartment confirmed that fact. They buttressed rather than rebutted the presumption of trafficking. The Prosecution accepted that the accused was also a consumer of heroin. The issue, as I understand it from the Defence, was how much heroin was meant for trafficking and how much was meant for his consumption. In 
Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 29
, it was held that before any meaningful apportionment of drugs for the purposes of consumption and of trafficking can be made, there must be credible evidence that part of the drugs is meant for self-consumption. There must also be credible evidence of the rate of consumption as well as the number of days the supply is meant for. Credible evidence, the court held, does not mean the mere say-so of the accused.
49        The accused relied only on his statement to the investigating officer for the rate of his consumption and the fact that the heroin was from the stock that he possessed. This fell short of the test laid down in 
Jusri
’s case. There was therefore no evidence upon which a meaningful apportionment could be made of the heroin in his possession. On that ground alone, his defence failed.
50        I will nevertheless deal with the contentions raised by the Defence on the assumption that the rate of consumption was one packet of 7.5g a day. The accused’s statement indicated that he collected four pounds of heroin two weeks before his arrest on 7 January 2004. He accepted that the two pounds found in the apartment were the remainder of the four pounds obtained earlier. He said that each pound was repacked into approximately 56 smaller packets. Two pounds would have yielded 112 smaller packets. Assuming he did consume one packet per day for those 14 days, 98 smaller packets should have been left of the other two pounds. Instead, there were only eight smaller packets, two straws and a small container of heroin left. Even if these were regarded as comprising ten smaller packets, 88 smaller packets were still unaccounted for. The irresistible inference is that the accused trafficked in at least those 88 smaller packets. “Traffic”, as defined in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, includes “give” and therefore any gift of heroin to his two friends in the apartment would still be caught.
51        By the same token, the accused intended to and would have trafficked in some 88 smaller packets out of the 112 that he could repack from the remaining two pounds of heroin. He has chosen not to explain otherwise.
52        He would have done likewise with the four pounds of heroin that he was carrying in the taxi to the apartment. That had to be the case. He was unemployed. He owed money to loan sharks. He had to pay the supplier some $30,000 for the four pounds of heroin he was carrying in the taxi. Since each small packet of about 7.5g of heroin cost $300, he would have to sell at least 100 of such packets to raise $30,000. In addition, he had to pay the rent for the apartment and meet his other daily expenses. To pay the rent of $1,200 per month, he would have to sell at least four more of such packets every month. It would also be entirely commonsensical to presume he would sell a few more packets to meet his living expenses.
53        The minimum amount of heroin the accused had to sell for each batch of four pounds was therefore more than 104 packets of 7.5g each. That would amount to almost two pounds of heroin for trafficking. He had four pounds more on the second transaction. Those would yield 224 smaller packets (4 x 56). He could not have been hoarding for his own consumption more than seven months’ (
ie
, 224 days’) worth of supplies. The four pounds found in the taxi contained 149.1g of diamorphine. Even though the purity of the substance might not have been entirely uniform in the four packets, two pounds would contain about 74g of diamorphine. Although I accepted that he would consume some of the heroin, there was no chance that he was trafficking in only 15g or less of diamorphine, which would not attract the mandatory death penalty. I therefore amended the charge to include the words highlighted, much along the same lines as what was done in 
Yeo Hee Seng v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 193
.
54        In addition to its submissions on the facts of the case, the Defence also contended that the mandatory death penalty provided in the Misuse of Drugs Act offends Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) which stipulates that “[a]ll persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law”. The arguments on this point followed most of those canvassed in 
PP v Nguyen Tuong Van
 
[2004] 2 SLR 328
. In that case, Kan Ting Chiu J reasoned that the Defence there failed to establish that the mandatory death sentence was unlawful for contravening the Constitution or international law. The appeal against Kan J’s decision was heard before the Court of Appeal in July this year and judgment has been reserved. I agree with Kan J and adopt his reasoning in coming to the same conclusion in the present case.
55        Accordingly, I found the accused guilty on the amended charge and convicted him.

District Judge See Kee Oon:
The charge
1          On 1 March 2004, the accused was initially charged with one count of rioting armed with a deadly weapon, being a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt (s 148 Penal Code (Cap 224)).  On condition that he would plead guilty, the prosecution proceeded on the following amended charge under s 147 of the Penal Code:
DAC 8916/2004
You, DM, M/16 yrs, NRIC No: [xxx], DOB: 28 July 1987, Singaporean, are charged that you, on the 19
th
 day of July 2003, at or about 9.30 pm, at Blk 411 Pandan Gardens, Singapore, together with the following persons:
1.         Mohammad Sheikh Ismail bin Abdullah, M/19 yrs (DOB: 7 July 1985)
2.         Anandasayanan s/o Mohan, M/17 yrs (DOB: 18 Oct 1986)
3.         Ramesh s/o Kannan, M/19 yrs (DOB: 27 June 1985)
4.         Jasbir Singh s/o Paramjit Singh, M/20 yrs (DOB: 5 July1984)
5.         Ghajandran s/o Rajamaniam Manickam, M/17 yrs (DOB: 9 Oct 1986)

were a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Premsanjay s/o Pandian, Mohan Babu s/o Ramu, Senthil Kumar s/o Maslamany and Dinesh Kumar s/o Maslamany, and members of the Gi Hai Kim secret society, and in the prosecution of this common object of the said assembly, one or more members of the said assembly used violence by assaulting the said Mohan Babu s/o Ramu and Dinesh Kumar s/o Maslamany, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Background
2          On 23 July 2004, the date of conviction, the accused was almost 17 years old.  At the time of the offence on 19 July 2003, the accused was just a few days away from his 16
th
 birthday.  He had dropped out of [xxx] Secondary School in January 2003 after being retained at Secondary 3NA.  He did not resume schooling until January 2004 when he enrolled in [xxx] Vocational Institute to pursue an ITE certificate in mechanical servicing.
3          At the material time, his eight co-accused persons ranged in age from 14 to 19.  All of them were members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' Secret Society operating from different grounds.  B1 (Mohammad Sheikh) and B3 (Ramesh) had also pleaded guilty before me along with the accused on 23 July 2004.  After perusing pre-sentence reports for probation as well as reformative training for all three accused, I sentenced Mohammad Sheikh and the accused to reformative training.  As Ramesh was found to be medically unfit to undergo reformative training, I placed him on supervised probation for 24 months.
4          Mohammad Sheikh filed a notice of appeal against his sentence on 16 August 2004.  He applied through counsel for bail pending appeal, which I granted at $20,000 with one surety.  Two days later, on 18 August 2004, the accused filed a notice of appeal as well.  He has also applied for bail pending appeal, which I granted at $20,000 with one surety.  My grounds of decision for Mohammad Sheikh (in MA 120/2004) covers substantially the same factual background.  I have thus taken the liberty of adopting much of what is set out in that grounds of decision for present purposes.
Statement of facts
5          On 19 July 2003 at about 9.35 pm, the police responded to a '999' call informing of 'a group of Indians fighting with weapons' at Block 411 Pandan Gardens.  Investigations revealed that earlier that evening, sometime between 7.30 pm and 8.00 pm, the nine accused persons named in the charge had gathered at the Jurong East Bus Interchange together with some other male Indians.  They had intended to attend an Indian cultural show at the Ayer Rajah Community Club.  Some of the nine accused persons also intended to settle some old disputes with members of the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society, whom they presumed might also attend the show.  For this purpose, B8 (A) brought along two knives, and B5 (Ghajandran) had also brought along a knife.
6          At the Jurong East MRT station, B6 (Shanmugam) told Mohammad Shiekh, A, Ghajandran, B2 (Anandasayanan) and B7 (Kunasilan) that the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society members would be at the Indian cultural show at Ayer Rajah Community Club, and that if the 'Gi Hai Kim' members made trouble with them, they would start the fight.  The five of them acknowledged and agreed with Shanmugam.  Ghajandran then showed Shanmugam the knife that he had brought along, and handed the knife over to Shanmugam.
7          All nine accused persons proceeded by bus to the Ayer Rajah Community Club.  During the bus journey, Shanmugam handed over the knife that Ghajandran had earlier given to him to A.  The nine accused persons met up with other members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society who had arrived at the Ayer Rajah Community Club earlier.  Some of them managed to get tickets to enter the hall where the performance was to take place.  Those who could not obtain tickets stood outside the arena to view the show.  In the midst of the show, there was shouting of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society slogan.  At about the same time, members of the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society had gathered outside the community club and were also shouting their secret society slogan.
8          Shanmugam was inside the hall and he then stood up and turned to his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members and shouted 'Got fight outside' in Tamil.  All the co-accused followed him as he walked out the hall, along with many of the other 'Ang Soon Tong' members.  Shanmugam told his gang members that they were going to fight the 'Gi Hai Kim' gang members, who were seen walking away towards the HDB flats (at Pandan Gardens) located opposite the community club.  The 'Ang Soon Tong' members, including all the accused persons, then chased after the 'Gi Hai Kim' members and assaulted them.
9          One Premsanjay s/o Pandian ('Premsanjay') was a member of the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society, known to Shanmugam and A.  Shanmugam used a belt to strangle a male Indian believed to be Premsanjay.  A used a knife to stab the said male Indian once in the lower back.  Three other male Indians, namely Mohan Babu s/o Ramu ('Mohan'), Senthil Kumar s/o Maslamany ('Senthil') and Dinesh Kumar s/o Maslamany ('Dinesh'), were walking at the ground floor of Blk 411 Pandan Gardens after leaving the cultural show.  They were also attacked by the accused persons.  Mohan was attacked by about 20 persons who kicked and punched him, and also slashed him with a knife.  Senthil was not assaulted as he managed to hide in some bushes.  Dinesh was punched in the head by one or more of the assailants.  He managed to run away and hide. 
10        Mohan sought medical attention at the Alexandra Hospital.  He was examined by Senior Consultant A/Prof Aziz Nather on 20 July 2003.  He was observed ti have sustained multiple lacerations on his right arm, for which toilet and suture was performed.  Mohan was discharged from hospital on 21 July 2003.  On review on 13 August 2003, his wounds had healed.
Mitigation
11        Mr K R Manicka represented the accused as well as Mohammad Sheikh.  Both his clients pleaded guilty to their respective charges under s 147, along with Ramesh, who was represented by Mr Alargasamy.  Mr Manicka presented separate written mitigation pleas on behalf of his clients. 
12        The accused had no previous convictions.  He comes from a well-structured family.  His father works as a housekeeper and his mother is a housewife.  He has a younger brother who is a secondary 3 student at [xxx] Secondary School.  His parents offered their apologies for his misdeeds and prayed that he be given one last chance to reform himself.  
13        On his part, the accused had admitted to the offence and had cooperated with the police.  He was remorseful and also tendered his apologies for what he had done.  Since the commission of the offence, he had kept away from bad company and had shown keen interest to complete his studies by 2005.  He promised not to revert to crime.  Mr Manicka urged the court to call for a probation report.  A submission along substantially similar lines was also made by Mr Manicka on behalf of Mohammad Sheikh (see my grounds of decision in Magistrate's Appeal 121 of 2004).   
Pre-sentence reports for probation and reformative training
14        As the accused had no previous convictions, I was prepared to defer sentence with a view to obtaining pre-sentence reports to determine his suitability for probation as well as reformative training.  In any event, the fact that the court calls for a pre-sentence report does not inevitably mean that probation will be ordered, even if the probation officer takes the view that probation can be supported.  The court is not bound to adopt the probation officer’s recommendations.  Having perused the pre-sentence report(s), the court must still exercise its discretion judiciously in determining the appropriate sentence.  In the final analysis, the court may even conclude that the circumstances warrant an imprisonment term.
15        According to the reformative training report, the accused was certified to be physically and mentally fit to undergo reformative training, even though he had apparently suffered from asthma when he was younger.  He claimed that he was only affiliated to the '21' secret society group from 2002 to 2003.  The group operated in the vicinity of Block 303 Bukit Batok.  He tried smoking cigarettes in 2002 due to peer pressure.  He picked up the habit and continued to smoke about four sticks of cigarettes daily thereafter.  He did not abuse controlled drugs or consume alcohol.
16        The accused admitted that on the night in question, his friends had asked him to join them for a fight.  He accompanied them to the scene out of curiosity.  Subsequently, when a fight took place, he claimed that he had no intention to join in the fight and did not take part in it.  He said that he committed the offence because of peer pressure.
17        When interviewed for the purpose of the probation report, the accused initially informed the probation officer, Ms Ting Siew Ling ('Ms Ting') that he did not think he had committed any crime as he did not participate in the fight.   He conceded that two days before the incident, he had already known of the gang's intention to pick a fight with the rival members of the 'Gi Hai Kim' group. Nevertheless, he maintained that he had no intention to join in the fight.  He only followed his fellow group members there in order to watch the performance.  He maintained that he stood apart from the group throughout the night and neither chased the victims nor participated in the fight.  He only knew about the fight and the use of weapons after he was arrested by the police.  
18        From what the accused had allegedly said to Ms Ting, he would have qualified his plea of guilt and his admission of the statement of facts.  Had he maintained this position before me, I would have had to consider rejecting his plea of guilt.  Subsequently, however, the accused acknowledged to Ms Ting that he knew that it was wrong for him to follow the group members when he knew about their intention to fight with the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' group.  He accepted that his act of following the group and his presence at the scene was a show of support for the group.  He acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and his mistake of associating with his gang members.
19        Ms Ting voiced concern that the accused had initially tried to suggest that he was not involved in the offence.  However, through her sessions with him, he was able to gain insight into his role and involvement in the offence.  In Ms Ting's assessment, the parents of the accused had been ineffective in supervising him.  There was hardly any interaction between him and his father owing to the latter's long working hours.  His mother had tried to impose some boundaries on his conduct but she was largely unaware of his activities and peer associations.  His arrest and appearance in court had alerted the parents to the need to step up their supervision of him.  They expressed their willingness and commitment to work together with Ms Ting in his rehabilitation process.
20        Ms Ting opined that the accused had generally performed well since taking the initiative to resume his studies at [xxx] Vocational Institute.  Apart from attendance-related issues, he was generally well-behaved.  Ms Ting was of the view that he had the potential to do well in the course but would need to improve on his discipline.  He had since steered clear of any further offences.  Ms Ting therefore recommended that the accused be placed on 18 months of supervised probation, with attendant conditions, including an exclusion order to prohibit him from association with gang members in the Bukit Batok East area.
Reasons for sentence
i.          Status of co-accused's cases
21        As at 12 August 2004, when the pre-sentence reports were presented before the court, three of the eight co-accused persons had already been dealt with.  These were B2 (Anandasayanan), B7 (Kunasilan) and B8 (A).   A was charged in a juvenile court as he is still below 16.  He was sentenced to 30 months' detention in the Singapore Boys' Home. 
22        Anandasayanan and Kunasilan were both convicted in district court 8 on charges under s 147.  Like the accused, Anandasayanan  had no antecedents.  He was sentenced to reformative training even though he had been found suitable to undergo probation as well.   As for Kunasilan, he faced three additional charges under s 379 Penal Code.  He was convicted on one count under s 147 and one count under s 379, with two other counts under s 379 taken into consideration.  He had a previous conviction for s 379 and was also placed on record in 2002 as a member of an unlawful society.   He was sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of the s 147 offence, and 6 months' imprisonment in respect of the s 379 offence, with both sentences running concurrently.  Both Anandasayanan and Kunasilan have not appealed against their sentences.
23        I should also add that on 12 August 2004, along with the accused, Mohammad Sheikh and Ramesh, for whom pre-sentence reports had been earlier called for, another accused (B5 - Shanmugam) had pleaded guilty before me.  Ramesh had no antecedents, and as such I had also requested earlier for probation and reformative training reports.  He was found to be physically unfit and thus unsuitable for reformative training, on account of a kidney disorder.  Counsel had drawn my attention to a medical report from Dr William Hwang of the Singapore General Hospital dated 27 April 2004 indicating that Ramesh suffered from mild anaemia and thalassaemia.  Probation for a period of 18 months was recommended.   I placed him on 24 months' supervised probation. 
24        As for Shanmugam, he pleaded guilty to one count under s 147 and one count under s 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184).  The latter offence was completely unrelated to the s 147 offence, and his role was minimal. Another charge under s 427 of the Penal Code was taken into consideration.  Shanmugam had previously been placed on 18 months' probation by a juvenile court for being a member of an unlawful assembly (s 143 Penal Code).  Probation was revoked on account of a further offence of theft (s 379), committed while he was on probation.  He was sentenced to 2 weeks' imprisonment for the theft offence, and to reside at the Singapore Boys' Home for two months for breaching probation.  I proceeded to sentence him to 2 years' imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane in respect of the s 147 offence, and 3 months' imprisonment in respect of the s 22(1)(a) offence, with both terms running consecutively.
26        The remaining two co-accused, B4 (Jasbir Singh) and B5 (Ghajandran) elected to clam trial.  They have been assigned hearing dates.
ii          General considerations in granting probation
27        The following are some of the main considerations in determining whether probation can or should be granted.  First, what are the offender’s prospects of reform and rehabilitation?  Second, how serious are the offences in question?  Third, are there any other reasons militating against granting probation?  I have made reference to these considerations on at least two previous occasions (
PP v Tay Kee Guan Iskandar
 (MA 259/2001 – PP’s appeal dismissed) and 
PP v Wong Jia Yi
 
[2003] SGDC 53
 (MA 26/2003) – PP’s appeal discontinued).
28        The recommendations in the probation report indicated that probation might be viable in the present case, largely on account of the accused's family environment and his perceived ability to focus constructively on his studies.  On the other hand, probation is usually not considered appropriate for serious Penal Code offences such as robbery, rioting or other violent crimes: see eg. 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
.  The rationale for this is that such crimes are generally deemed too grave for probation to be considered as a workable alternative.  Public policy concerns demand general deterrence either by way of the imposition of a sentence according to the sentencing norms for adult offenders or a period of incarceration in the form of committal to a reformative training centre.
29        However, I would readily accept that probation can be (and has been) granted even where the accused has committed serious crimes, given the right circumstances (see eg. 
Lawrence Ang Kian Choon & anor v PP
 (MA 144/97 – unreported), involving a rioting charge under s 147 Penal Code).  In appropriate instances, where the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high, this may even outweigh the public policy concerns which are usually voiced in objection to probation for serious offences.
iii.        Aggravated offence and aggravating features - Probation not appropriate in the present case
30        As a general rule, the courts view an offence of rioting where hurt is caused as an aggravated offence.  Where weapons are used in the commission of the offence, this is a key aggravating feature.  Such offences are sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment of a substantial term.  Although caning is not mandatory, this is the norm for such offences: see eg. 
Lim Thiam Hor & anor v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
; 
PP v Diki
 
Zulkarnaini bin Saini
 (DAC 57026/2000 - unreported).  Irrespective of whether the charge is framed under s 147 or 148 of the Penal Code, the critical issue for the court to consider is the nature and gravity of the offence itself and its surrounding circumstances.      
31        I noted the following aggravating features.  It was not disputed that all the accused persons were members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society at all material times, and that the offence arose out of their intention to settle scores with members of the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society.  The offence was clearly premeditated.  This was not a spontaneous or impulsive outburst, motivated by a show of youthful bravado.  Two days before the incident, the accused was already aware that a fight was likely to take place if the 'Gi Hai Kim' members gave them any cause to do so.  Even if I were to accept that he was a mere 'follower', by his own admission, he had knowingly joined his fellow gang members that evening as a show of his support.
32        That the offence was premediated was evident from the fact that even in the midst of the performance, there was shouting of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society slogan.  Another telling indicator that the offence was planned was the fact that weapons were concealed by some of the members for the purpose of subsequent use in the gang fight.  It was not entirely clear whether each and every one of the accused persons (and the accused in particular) was aware that weapons would be involved.  Nevertheless, in the course of the fight, it was readily apparent that knives were being brandished by the 'Ang Soon Tong' gang members.  Despite his initial denials, the accused eventually conceded that he did nothing to dissociate himself from his gang members.
33        In my opinion, there were serious aggravating features in the present case.  Unless there were very exceptional reasons, these considerations provided ample justification for the court to rule out probation altogether.  Although there was no specific address on sentence, the DPP drew my attention to 
PP v Sim Teck Poh & Ors
 
[1997] SGHC 309
.  Rubin J made the following pertinent observations in respect of offences motivated by secret society affiliations:
Having now reviewed all the factors placed before me in mitigation, I am of the view that the manner in which the offence was committed, the planning involved, the harm inflicted, which in my view was not by foolish and confused youths under an act of sudden impulse or momentary outburst, but by secret society members committed to blind loyalty - all these warrant a sentence which would in some way bring home the message that corrosive, anti-social behaviour cannot be entirely tranquilised by eloquent mitigation pleas.  I can well imagine the terror and bedlam you might have caused on the evening in question to the innocent members of the public … when all of you went about charging your prey in utter contempt of law and order.
34        The accused persons in 
Sim Teck Poh's
 case were not facing charges under s 147 or 148, but far more serious charges under s 149 punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code.  Thus, the observations were made in quite a different context but are nonetheless still highly apposite.  The same observations would apply equally to the facts in the present case. 
35        The accused was there with his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members and he had known all along of the plan to settle whatever vendetta they claimed to have had against the 'Gi Hai Kim' members.  They did so in full public view, in complete and blatant disregard of the law and public order.  They proceeded right outside a community club across to a block of HDB flats where the gang clash took place.  In Rubin J's words, the accused and his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members must have caused considerable terror and bedlam among innocent members of the public.
36        I did not see any reason to depart from the reformative training sentence that was passed in respect of Anandasayanan.  Like the accused, Anandasayanan was also found suitable to undergo both probation and reformative training.  There may have been other reasons for the court's decision to sentence him to reformative training.  Nonetheless, the principal consideration common to all the accused persons' cases is that the offence they had all been involved in was an aggravated offence, marked by aggravating features.
iv.        Observations arising from the pre-sentence reports
37        In any event, I had serious reservations as to whether the accused had demonstrated real potential for reform.  In 2003, he had been warned by the Police Secret Society Branch for his involvement in gang-related activities.  After pleading guilty before me, he had attempted to deny responsibility for the offence when interviewed by Ms Ting.  Evidently, despite already being convicted, he was still not prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct.  This was indicative of his lack of remorse, despite Mr Manicka's assertions in mitigation to the effect that he was remorseful.  While I noted that he eventually did acknowledge that he was involved, his acknowledgment appeared to be reluctant and somewhat perfunctory.
38        The accused had also given differing information about his smoking and drinking habits when interviewed for the reformative training and probation reports.  In the reformative training report, he reportedly said that he did not consume alcohol and only smoked about four sticks of cigarettes daily.  Ms Ting was told instead that he started drinking in 2002 and once every two months, he would drink two bottles of beer with his friends at void decks and coffeeshops.  Ms Ting was also told that he smoked up to 10 cigarettes a day.  It was not clear why the accused chose to furnish differing information to different sources.
39        The accused's selectiveness in disclosure of information was also evident when one examines his instructions to Mr Manicka.  Mr Manicka had suggested that the accused might not have been aware of the facts admitted at para 5 of the statement of facts.  According to his instructions, he had gone off to buy titbits when Shanmugam was telling some of the co-accused about the impending fight that evening.  However, as disclosed to Ms Ting, he had already known about the impending fight two days before the incident (see para 1.1 of the probation report) and had chosen to follow his gang members as a show of support.
40        In addition, reports of his behaviour at [xxx] Vocational Institute were contradictory.  According to Ms Ting, his school reports painted a glowing picture of him as being matured, polite, respectful, well-behaved and cooperative in school, and 'very focused' in his training (see para 4.3 of the probation report).  I did not quite see how all this could be reconciled with other reports which indicated that he was a 'habitual latecomer' who had absented himself from training for 15 days, and had also been involved in a bullying incident in a short span of 6 months at the school.  These aspects did not speak well of his self-discipline or potential for reform.  With respect, I was sceptical of Ms Ting's assessment (at para 9.3 of the probation report) that 'apart from attendance-related issues, he was generally well-behaved'.  In my opinion, the school reports were seriously conflicting and inherently unreliable.
Conclusion
41        The seriousness of the offence taken together with the numerous aggravating features present would militate against probation being granted.  In addition, I was not convinced that the accused had demonstrated any real potential for reform.  As such, I sentenced him to reformative training.",2004-08-23 00:00:00,SG District Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1          The facts of this case are connected to those in Suit No 546 of 2003. Stratech Systems Ltd was the plaintiff in both suits. Guthrie Engineering (S) Pte Ltd, the third defendant here, was the sole defendant in Suit No 546 of 2003. The first and second defendants were former employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff and third defendant were business partners which became rivals and competitors. They had originally collaborated to secure a contract to design and install for the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) an automated electronic system for the collection of toll from foreign vehicles entering Singapore through three checkpoints. In that venture, the tender was awarded by the LTA to the third defendant and the latter, in turn, sub-contracted large parts of the contract to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and third defendant subsequently quarrelled over the sub-contract as well as the post-contract work done to maintain the system for the LTA. Consequently, the plaintiff sued the third defendant for breach of contract in Suit No 546 of 2003. That action has been tried and judgment handed down: see

2          The original vehicle entry permit system (“VEPS”) was commissioned by the LTA on 9 May 2000. On 6 February 2003, the LTA requested the third defendant to integrate the VEPS with the electronic road pricing system (“ERPS”). The plaintiff was initially asked to develop this link. It is important to note that in the previous development programmes in respect of the VEPS the plaintiff had been using the “V” series as its nomenclature for the software programmes and filenames. The last fully-established programme in the series was known as V115. The programme for the development of the VEPS-ERPS link was dubbed V116.
3          In March 2003 the plaintiff asked for payment from the third defendant in respect of the VEPS contract and the signing of a formal maintenance contract. This led to two civil actions. In the first, the plaintiff sued the third defendant in Suit No 546 of 2003 for breach of the sub-contract and for payment in respect of work done on the VEPS-ERPS link. The second was this present suit. In this action, it will be useful to note that the first and second defendants were programmers working on the V116 programme for the plaintiff. The first defendant was the leader of a team of programmers that included the second defendant, Armin Budiman, Frankie Tan and Ng Tiong Khoon. The plaintiff and the third defendant differed as to what the nature of the VEPS-ERPS work was – whether it was a new job or an enhancement of the old one – but this was not material to the true issues for reasons that will become apparent shortly. It is, however, relevant to note that the plaintiff’s case was based on the assertion that all the work done by the first defendant and her team to integrate the VEPS with the ERPS was done on a file named “V116”, and that that file was stored in the five computers that the plaintiff kept at the LTA’s console room. As far as the third defendant was concerned, the integration work was merely “work-in-progress”.
4          When the plaintiff was not paid in respect of its claims against the third defendant for the VEPS work and maintenance, it ceased all work, that is, the maintenance work in respect of the VEPS, and the development work in respect of the integration between the VEPS and the ERPS. It stopped work on the integration of the systems on 25 March 2003, and the maintenance work in respect of the VEPS on 28 March 2003. Armin was instructed to bring his computer from the LTA’s console room back to the plaintiff’s office and there to make a copy of his work on the integration programme (then titled “V116”) on to the plaintiff’s server as well as a copy on to a compact disk. After that was done, Armin made a copy of V115, re-installed it into his computer and renamed it “V116”. There were some contentious aspects at this point but they are not significant enough, in my view, to affect the outcome of this dispute. One of the disputes concerned the question whether the compact disk had been broken and discarded as Armin testified, or whether it was still in the possession of the defendants. It will be more helpful, presently, to see what all this has led to in so far as this suit is concerned. But first, it is important to note that on 25 April 2003 the first defendant terminated her employment contract by paying two months’ pay in lieu of notice to the plaintiff. About that time, the second defendant similarly terminated his employment contract with the plaintiff. Both of them were employed almost immediately by a company called Electrical Product International Pte Ltd (“EPI”), a subsidiary of the third defendant whose business as a cable trader was totally unconnected to that of its parent company or of the plaintiff. However, the first and second defendants were directly seconded by EPI to work for the third defendant on the VEPS-ERPS integration.
5          In this action the plaintiff claimed damages against the first and second defendants for breach of contract in that, contrary to an express term of contract of employment, they entered the employment service of a competitor before the stipulated nine-month mandatory restriction period was over. The specific clause in question is cl 9 which reads as follows:
9.         Termination
…
9.3        You shall not, during the continuance of your employment with the Company and after the termination of your employment with the Company, canvass, solicit, interfere with or entice away any person or entity who shall at any time during the continuance of your employment hereunder have been in the employment of or in the habit of dealing with the Company.
9.4        You shall not, during the continuance of your employment with the Company and for a period of nine (9) months after the termination of your employment with the Company, and whether on your own accord or as an employee, partner or otherwise, directly or indirectly engage or be concerned in any business in direct competition with the Company or be employed by any person or entity who shall at any time during the continuance of your employment hereunder have been in the employment of or in the habit of dealing with the Company in Singapore.
The first two defendants were also sued for damages for breach of their duties of fidelity and good faith for allegedly divulging “confidential information, trade secrets, and business information” to the third defendant in breach of cl 8, which provides as follows:
8          Confidentiality
8.1        You shall not either during the continuance of your employment hereunder or after termination of your employment except in the proper course of your duties with the Company divulge to any person and/or outside party any information as to the practice, business dealings or affairs of the Company or any of its customers or any company in the habit of dealing with the Company and shall use your best endeavours to prevent the publication or disclosure of any trade secret or any information concerning the business technology or finances of the Company or any of its dealings, transactions or affairs which may come to your knowledge during or in the course of your employment.
The third defendant was sued for inducing the first and second defendants’ breach of contract. It was also sued for wrongfully retaining and using confidential information belonging to the plaintiff, namely, the computer programme known as “V116”.
6          The evidence showed that some time about 10 April 2003 Foong Siew Peng, the third defendant’s manager, contacted the first defendant and asked if she would work for the third defendant and also to ask if her team members from the plaintiff would similarly join it. According to the second defendant as well as Armin (who was called as a witness by the first and second defendants) the first defendant contacted them and told them about the third defendant’s proposal. Armin said that he received a text message from her over his mobile phone. The team members had a meeting about the proposal. They were concerned by the plaintiff’s withdrawal from the VEPS-ERPS project, but were also worried about being sued if they joined the third defendant company. The evidence in court from the first and second defendants, which was corroborated by Foong, was that the third defendant agreed to indemnify the employees should they be sued successfully by the plaintiff. In the present case, lawyers were provided and paid by the third defendant in defending the first and second defendants. The first and second defendants also secured a 20% increase in pay when they joined the third defendant. Armin, who joined after the nine-month prohibition period was over, was paid a little more than $7,000 compared to the $2,000 to $3,000 he was earning with the plaintiff. Hence, Mr N Sreenivasan, counsel for the plaintiff, submitted that the increase was to cover the months of unemployment after he left the plaintiff. Furthermore, Foong candidly conceded that the first and second defendants were formally employed by EPI instead of the third defendant “in order to put more distance” between them (the employees) and the third defendant. It was obvious that the former employees of the plaintiff, as well as the third defendant, were worried about the restraining clause in the employees’ contract of employment. It is also clear to me that the third defendant initiated all the steps taken to procure the employment of the plaintiff’s employees. Given the circumstances of the case, the third defendant would thus be liable for inducing a breach of contract of employment if it could be shown that the first and second defendants, as well as Armin, were in breach of their contracts of employment. It is to this point that I now turn.
7          The employment contracts of the first and second defendants, as well as Armin (all of whom I shall, for this purpose, refer to collectively as “the employees”), with the plaintiff contain a termination clause to the effect that the employees can terminate the contract by giving two months’ notice of termination, or by payment of two months’ salary in lieu of such notice. In this case, the evidence was that the employees elected to pay the salary in lieu of notice because the third defendant was in a hurry to employ them. It was also proved to my satisfaction that the salary in lieu in each case was borne by the third defendant. This fact is relevant for the purpose of establishing whether the third defendant was liable for inducing the employees to leave their employer. But that by itself is not the same thing as inducing a breach of contract. A person cannot be said to have induced another to breach his contract of employment if all that was done by the employee was to tender a notice of termination or payment in lieu which was provided for as a term of the contract. The crucial question concerned cl 9 of the employment contracts. If that clause was valid and enforceable, then the third defendant would be liable on account of its enticement, procurement and assistance in the breaching of cl 9 with the knowledge that the employees would be in breach of the clause. It is important to state at this point that whether the third defendant knew it was assisting a breach is a finding of fact for this court. It is not a subjective matter which the third defendant may escape responsibility for by merely declaring that it did not believe that cl 9 was an impediment. Foong testified that he did not think that cl 9 prevented the third defendant from employing the employees and that the reason EPI was used to employ them was an act in excess of caution. While I find that Foong was frank and candid in his testimony, and I can accept that he personally (though not the third defendant) believed that cl 9 was not a problem, this could not validate the breach. The fact is that the third defendant was aware of cl 9 and suspected that it might be a potential problem. The fact that one of its principal officers (Foong) took it into serious consideration and concluded in good faith that it was not a problem (in other words, that he was wrong) does not absolve the third defendant because the test is an objective one. Was a breach of cl 9 a breach of the contracts of employment? If it was, then would a person who induced an employee into committing a breach of cl 9 be said to have induced a breach of his or her contract of employment? I think that it would be so. Otherwise, it is only too easy to provide an excuse from the effect of a reasonable restrictive clause and conclude that the term does not apply in a given case. Whether it applies or not is a question to be decided by the court. In this case, I must first determine whether the clause is valid and applicable and, secondly, whether the third defendant did an act that induced the employees to violate the terms of that clause. I have first determined the second part for convenience, and now turn to the first part.
8          The question here is whether cl 9 is a valid and binding term, and if so, whether it applied in this case. Mr Goh Phai Cheng, counsel for the third defendant, focused his submission on two points. First, he argued that because the plaintiff “walked out” on them (the third defendant and LTA), cl 43.4 of the main contract between the plaintiff and the third defendant obliged the third defendant to take such steps as were necessary to carry on with the maintenance of the VEPS. Counsel maintained that the contract provided a right to employ anyone, including the employees of the plaintiff. The relevant clause provided as follows:
43.4      In the event of termination of the Contract as provided for in Clause 43.1 or Clause 43.3 or in accordance with law, the following shall apply:
(a)         (i)         all payments that shall have been made under the Contract shall be refunded by the Contractor to the Authority forthwith Provided Always that such refunds as aforesaid shall not prejudice or affect any right of actions or remedy which shall have accrued or shall thereafter accrue to the Authority as a result of the termination of the Contract or as a result of the breach of the Contract by the Contractor;
(ii)         the Contractor shall upon written notice from the Authority be required to remove, at the Contractor’s expense, the System or any part thereof specified in the notice from the location at a date specified by the Authority, and in default the Authority may (without being responsible for any loss or damage) remove and sell the same, holding the proceeds less all expenses incurred to the credit of the Contractor;
(iii)        the Authority shall be entitled to recover from the Contractor any damages, costs and expenses which the Authority may sustain or incur in consequence of such termination; all such damages, losses, costs and expenses which are or become so recoverable under the Contract together with any sum payable by the Contractor as liquidated damages, may be deducted from any money that may then be due to the Contractor and if the money then due to the Contractor under the Contract or deposited by him under the Contract as aforesaid is not sufficient for that purpose, the balance remaining unpaid shall be a debt due from the Contractor to the Authority, and may be set off against any other monies which may be or become due to the Contractor from the Authority or may be recovered as a debt due from the Contractor in any court of competent jurisdiction;
OR, at the sole discretion of the Authority:
(b)         (i)         the Authority may carry out and complete the works on its own or employ and pay other person or persons to carry out and complete the works and he or they may enter upon the location and use all materials, software and equipment thereon, and may purchase all materials necessary for the purchase aforesaid;
(ii)         the Contractor shall if so required by the Authority assign to the Authority and without further payment the benefit of any contract for the supply of material and/or works intended for use under the Contract or for the execution of any works and the Authority shall pay the agreed price (if unpaid) for such material or works supplied or executed after the said termination;
(iii)        the Contractor shall during the execution or after completion of the works under this sub-clause as and when required remove from the location any materials within such reasonable time as the Authority may specify in a written notice to him and in default the Authority may (without being responsible for any loss and damage) remove and sell the same, holding the proceed less all expenses incurred to the credit of the Contractor;
(iv)        until completion of the works under this sub-clause no payment shall be made to the Contractor under the Contract; provided that upon completion as aforesaid and the verification within a reasonable time of the account added to the monies paid to the Contractor before such termination exceeds the total amount which have been payable on due completion, the difference shall be a debt payable to the Authority by the Contractor, and if the said amount added to the said money be less than the said total amount, the difference shall be a debt payable by the Authority to the Contractor; provided always aforesaid shall not prejudice or affect any right of action or remedy which shall have accrued or shall thereafter accrue to the Authority as a result of the termination of the Contract or as a result of the breach of the Contract by the Contractor;
(v)        in the event of the completion of the works being undertaken by the Authority, allowance shall be made, when ascertaining the amount to be certified as expenses properly incurred by the Authority, for the cost of supervision, interest and depreciation on equipment and all other usual overhead charges and profits, as would be incurred were the work carried out by the Contractor.
I agree that one possible reading of the above clause permits the third defendant to employ anyone, including an employee of the plaintiff, notwithstanding the restrictive covenant clause in the employment contract. However, a reasonable reading must include the interpretation that the third defendant is permitted to employ the employees only if it does not create a civil wrong (such as inducing a breach of contract) in the process. The next point advanced by Mr Goh was that the third defendant did not habitually deal with the plaintiff. The reference to habitual dealing in cl 9 must refer to the dealings between the two companies and not a habitual dealing between the employees of the two companies. The evidence from the third defendant’s witnesses, and indeed the record itself, indubitably showed that the plaintiff’s employees were dealing constantly with the employees of the third defendant in the VEPS project. That is as strong a compliance with the term “habitual dealing” as can be envisaged. That argument of counsel does not advance the defence any further. Counsel for the defendants also argued that the restrictive period was unreasonably long, but I do not think so.
9          I therefore find the third defendant liable for inducing a breach of contract by the first and second defendants. However, on the evidence, it seems palpably clear that the plaintiff suffered no real or substantial damage. If the third defendant had not induced the termination of employment by the first and second defendants, and they had proceeded to join the former of their own accord, there would have been no damage at all. Furthermore, there was no evidence of what damage the plaintiff suffered by the absence of the two employees (three, counting Armin). There will, therefore, be judgment for the plaintiff against the third defendant on this ground, but I only order nominal damages of $1,000.
10        I now turn to the issue of confidential information. The crucial question is whether there was any confidential information or trade secret belonging to the plaintiff that had been wrongfully taken or used by the defendants. This question was relevant to the defence of all three defendants. The plaintiff did not particularize what it had regarded as confidential information and trade secrets belonging to it. The basis and relevance of giving the necessary particulars have been amply discussed in cases such as 
Lock International Plc v Beswick
 
[1989] 1 WLR 1268
 at 1274–1275 where Hoffman J made the point that assertions of confidentiality are no substitute for evidence of what the plaintiff’s secrets really are. Mr Sreenivasan generated a veil of importance to the programme file known as V116. But all that we know about it is that it was the programme that was being developed by the first defendant and her team, principally Armin, to integrate the VEPS and ERPS. V116’s source codes were written in Pascal, a computer language. V116 enabled the VEPS and ERPS to integrate, but what aspect or part of it was confidential was not disclosed, let alone why it was confidential. Mr Sreenivasan alluded to the saving of time, but that was inadequate because not every time-saving device is a trade secret or is confidential in nature. It is also important to note that the plaintiff was not claiming a breach of copyright in the copying or use of the source codes, nor for trespass in accessing the file. Its case was strictly for damages for unauthorised use of confidential information and trade secrets. In this regard I find nothing in the evidence that required me even to adjudicate as to whether any particular piece of material was or was not confidential or a trade secret. The difficulties in making a list of matters that can be regarded as trade secrets were discussed by Neill LJ in 
Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler
 
[1987] Ch 117
. It was pointed out by him that not everything an employer tells his employee is to be regarded as confidential is, in law, confidential; and that includes instructions used in the course of employment and so on. What it all means, therefore, is simply that the court must decide on the evidence whether the facts alleged in the case amount to confidential information or trade secrets – the familiar and basic reminder of the court’s duty at first instance. Here, there was a clear conflict of evidence as to whether the third defendant was using V115 (as it alleged) or the confidential V116 (as the plaintiff alleged). On the balance, I accept the evidence of the defendants. Mr Sreenivasan made the obvious point that the evidence came from the defendants only because they – in particular the first and second defendants and Armin – were the only ones who had direct knowledge of these matters. He argued that these employees were serving their own interests. I think that that might well be so. The evidence of such witnesses might often be slanted or biased, if not entirely false. However, they might still speak truthfully or objectively. The first defendant might not have been as candid as the other witnesses of the defendants when it came to the question of whether she was being employed by the third defendant or EPI, but her evidence generally was plausible and consistent on the whole. The second defendant was a straightforward and forthright witness in all aspects of his evidence, and Armin was similarly plausible. Mr Sreenivasan challenged the credibility of Armin’s evidence in regard to the compact disk that the plaintiff said Armin used to copy V116 and which he said had been broken and thrown away. I am inclined to accept Armin’s evidence in this instance because his evidence impressed me generally and, which is equally important, I was unable to find anything that inclined me to think that his story was probably untrue.
11        I shall deal very briefly with the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert witness Mr Daniel Chong and that of the plaintiff’s employee, Nellore Siva Sai. These two witnesses testified as to the similarities between the files in the plaintiff’s version of V116 and the files found in the third defendant’s computers that were seized and studied under an Anton Piller order. The sum of their evidence is that there were some similarities in the files and source codes in the two materials under comparison but nothing to indicate that the one was copied from the other. Apart from the defendants’ denial, which I accept, it must be borne in mind that these were files and material written in a computer language by computer programmers and was something easily replicated without recourse to copying. There were some points that might lead one to the supposition that the defendants’ version was a copied one, but those were points based on the assumption that copying is quickest. That might be true in many instances, but the facts before me were a little more complex, and clearer proof was required – the burden of which was the plaintiff’s responsibility to discharge.
12        The plaintiff’s claim against the first and second defendants in respect of the alleged use of confidential information and trade secrets must therefore be dismissed. Its claim against the third defendant must also similarly be dismissed. I shall hear the parties on the question of costs at a later date if they are unable to agree on costs.
Plaintiff’s claim allowed in part against the third defendant, and dismissed as against the first and second defendants.",2004-08-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

Background and statement of facts
2          At the time of the offence, the accused had just turned 18 and was studying at Singapore Polytechnic.  His eight co-accused persons ranged in age from 14 to 19.  All of them were members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society operating from different grounds. 
3          On 19 July 2003 at about 9.35 pm, the police responded to a '999' call informing of 'a group of Indians fighting with weapons' at Block 411 Pandan Gardens.  Investigations revealed that earlier that evening, sometime between 7.30 pm and 8.00 pm, the nine accused persons named in the charge had gathered at the Jurong East Bus Interchange together with some other male Indians.  They had intended to attend an Indian cultural show at the Ayer Rajah Community Club.  Some of the nine accused persons also intended to settle some old disputes with members of the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society, whom they presumed might also attend the show.  For this purpose, B8 (B) brought along two knives, and B4 (Ghajandran) had also brought along a knife.
4          At the Jurong East MRT station, B5 (Shanmugam) told B, Ghajandran, B1 (Anandasayanan), B6 (Kunasilan) and the accused that the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society members would be at the Indian cultural show at Ayer Rajah Community Club, and that if the 'Gi Hai Kim' members made trouble with them, they would start the fight.  B, Ghajandran, Anadasayanan, Kunasilan and the accused acknowledged and agreed.  Ghajandran then showed Shanmugam the knife that he had brought along, and handed the knife over to Shanmugam.
5          All nine accused persons proceeded by bus to the Ayer Rajah Community Club.  During the bus journey, Shanmugam handed over the knife that Ghajandran had earlier given to him to B.  The nine accused persons met up with other members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society who had arrived at the Ayer Rajah Community Club earlier.  Some of them managed to get tickets to enter the hall where the performance was to take place.  Those who could not obtain tickets stood outside the arena to view the show.  In the midst of the show, there was shouting of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society slogan.  At about the same time, members of the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society had gathered outside the community club and were also shouting their secret society slogan.
6          Shanmugam was inside the hall and he then stood up and turned to his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members and shouted 'Got fight outside' in Tamil.  All the co-accused followed him as he walked out the hall, along with many of the other 'Ang Soon Tong' members.  Shanmugam told his gang members that they were going to fight the 'Gi Hai Kim' gang members, who were seen walking away towards the HDB flats (at Pandan Gardens) located opposite the community club.  The 'Ang Soon Tong' members, including all the accused persons, then chased after the 'Gi Hai Kim' members and assaulted them.
7          One Premsanjay s/o Pandian ('Premsanjay') was a member of the 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society, known to Shanmugam and B.  Shanmugam used a belt to strangle a male Indian believed to be Premsanjay.  B used a knife to stab the said male Indian once in the lower back.  Three other male Indians, namely Mohan Babu s/o Ramu ('Mohan'), Senthil Kumar s/o Maslamany ('Senthil') and Dinesh Kumar s/o Maslamany ('Dinesh'), were walking at the ground floor of Blk 411 Pandan Gardens after leaving the cultural show.  They were also attacked by the accused persons.  Mohan was attacked by about 20 persons who kicked and punched him, and also slashed him with a knife.  Senthil was not assaulted as he managed to hide in some bushes.  Dinesh was punched in the head by one or more of the assailants.  He managed to run away and hide. 
8          Mohan sought medical attention at the Alexandra Hospital.  He was examined by Senior Consultant A/Prof Aziz Nather on 20 July 2003.  He was observed ti have sustained multiple lacerations on his right arm, for which toilet and suture was performed.  Mohan was discharged from hospital on 21 July 2003.  On review on 13 August 2003, his wounds had healed.
Mitigation
9          Mr K R Manicka represented the accused as well as B7 (A).  Both his clients pleaded guilty to their respective charges under s 147, along with B2 (Ramesh), who was represented by Mr Alargasamy.  Mr Manicka presented separate written mitigation pleas on behalf of his clients. 
10        The accused had no previous convictions.  His father is a taxi-driver and his mother a housewife.  He has two sisters.  His parents were shocked at the accused's involvement in this offence.  Being concerned parents, they offered their apologies for what he had done and vouched to play their part in his reformation. 
11        The accused is a first-year student at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a course in Electrical Engineering.  He is due to graduate in 2006.  He had also been active in volunteer work with the Yuhua Community Club, and is a member of the Yuhua Indian Activity Group.  A testimonial from the Chairman of the Yuhua Community Club's Indian Activities Executive Council was tendered for reference.
12        Mr Manicka submitted that the offence was a one-off affair.  The accused was remorseful.  He was not a recalcitrant offender.  Given a chance, he would reform and reintegrate into the mainstream of society.  A custodial sentence would destroy his future, as he had managed to enrol in the polytechnic and had also been doing social work at the Yuhua community club.  The court was thus urged to call for a probation report.  A submission along substantially similar lines was also made by Mr Manicka on behalf of A, who has also filed a notice of appeal against his sentence (in Magistrate's Appeal 121 of 2004).   
Pre-sentence reports for probation and reformative training
13        As the accused had no previous convictions, I was prepared to defer sentence with a view to obtaining pre-sentence reports to determine his suitability for probation as well as reformative training.  In any event, the fact that the court calls for a pre-sentence report does not inevitably mean that probation will be ordered, even if the probation officer takes the view that probation can be supported.  The court is not bound to adopt the probation officer’s recommendations.  Having perused the pre-sentence report(s), the court must still exercise its discretion judiciously in determining the appropriate sentence.  In the final analysis, the court may even conclude that the circumstances warrant an imprisonment term.
14        According to the reformative training report, the accused was certified to be physically and mentally fit to undergo reformative training.  He claimed that he was only affiliated to the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society for a few months in 2000, when the group operated in the vicinity of Blk 289 Bukit Batok.  He tried smoking cigarettes in 1999 due to peer pressure.  He picked up the habit and continued to smoke about 10 sticks of cigarettes daily thereafter.  He did not abuse controlled drugs or consume alcohol.
15        The accused admitted that on the night in question, his friends had asked him to join them for a fight.  He accompanied them at the scene and a fight took place.  He admitted punching one of the rival gang members after he himself was punched.  He fled from the scene thereafter.  He claimed not to know the reason for the fight, and had only joined his friends because of peer pressure.
16        When interviewed for the purpose of the probation report, the accused informed the probation officer, Mr Yeo Ting Ming ('Mr Yeo') that he regretted his impulsive acts.  He claimed that he was not given an active role in the fight due to his size and non-aggressive nature.  He was merely a follower and his presence was perhaps a show of force to the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' group.  He accepted responsibility for his actions and appeared to understand the impact of his offences on the victims.  He had also cooperated during police investigations. 
17        In Mr Yeo's assessment, the accused enjoyed a good relationship with his family members.  His parents were concerned and supportive, if somewhat ineffective in disciplining him and setting adequate boundaries for his behaviour.  They gave him much leeway in his choice of peer associations and social activities, and were ignorant of his gang activities.  Since the commission of the offence, they were more aware of his associations and were confident of supervising him.  They had also taken steps to restrict his outdoor activities.  The family environment was thus assessed to be suitable for a community-based rehabilitation programme.
18        As for the accused, he had generally shown good behaviour in school, apart from isolated disciplinary issues in secondary school.  According to Mr Yeo, this could be attributed to negative peer associations and influence.  His conduct in the polytechnic thus far was good.  He had made new friends who appeared to be positive influences, and had been constructively engaged in his studies.  He had committed the offence because of indiscriminate peer association and a lack of respect for others.  He had since made a concerted effort to dissociate himself from his gang members.  As such, Mr Yeo recommended that the accused be placed on 18 months of supervised probation, with attendant conditions, including an exclusion order to prohibit him from association with gang members in the Bukit Batok East area.
Reasons for sentence
i.          Status of co-accused's cases
19        As at 12 August 2004, when the pre-sentence reports were presented before the court, three of the eight co-accused persons had already been dealt with.  These were B1 (Anandasayanan), B6 (Kunasilan) and B8 (B).   B was charged in a juvenile court as he is still below 16.  He was sentenced to 30 months' detention in the Singapore Boys' Home. 
20        Anandasayanan and Kunasilan were both convicted in district court 8 on charges under s 147.  Like the accused, Anandasayanan  had no antecedents.  He was sentenced to reformative training even though he had been found suitable to undergo probation as well.   As for Kunasilan, he faced three additional charges under s 379 Penal Code.  He was convicted on one count under s 147 and one count under s 379, with two other counts under s 379 taken into consideration.  He had a previous conviction for s 379 and was also placed on record in 2002 as a member of an unlawful society.  He was sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of the s 147 offence, and 6 months' imprisonment in respect of the s 379 offence, with both sentences running concurrently.  Both Anandasayanan and Kunasilan have not appealed against their sentences.
21        I should also add that on 12 August 2004, along with the accused and B7 (A), two other co-accused (B2 - Ramesh and B5 Shanmugam) were before me for sentence.  In respect of Ramesh, as he had no antecedents, I had also requested earlier for probation and reformative training reports.  He was found to be physically unfit and thus unsuitable for reformative training, on account of a kidney disorder.  Counsel had earlier drawn my attention to a medical report from Dr William Hwang of the Singapore General Hospital dated 27 April 2004 indicating that Ramesh suffered from mild anaemia and thalassaemia.  Probation for a period of 18 months was recommended.   I placed him on 24 months' supervised probation. 
22        As for Shanmugam, he pleaded guilty before me on 12 August 2004 to one count under s 147 and one count under s 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184).  The latter offence was completely unrelated to the s 147 offence, and his role was minimal. Another charge under s 427 of the Penal Code was taken into consideration.  Shanmugam had previously been placed on 18 months' probation by a juvenile court for being a member of an unlawful assembly (s 143 Penal Code).  Probation was revoked on account of a further offence of theft (s 379), committed while he was on probation.  He was sentenced to 2 weeks' imprisonment for the theft offence, and to reside at the Singapore Boys' Home for two months for breaching probation.  I proceeded to sentence him to 2 years' imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane in respect of the s 147 offence, and 3 months' imprisonment in respect of the s 22(1)(a) offence, with both terms running consecutively.
23        The remaining two co-accused, B3 (Jasbir Singh) and B4 (Ghajandran) elected to clam trial.  They have been assigned hearing dates.
ii.         General considerations in granting probation
24        The following are some of the main considerations in determining whether probation can or should be granted.  First, what are the offender’s prospects of reform and rehabilitation?  Second, how serious are the offences in question?  Third, are there any other reasons militating against granting probation?  I have made reference to these considerations on at least two previous occasions (
PP v Tay Kee Guan Iskandar
 (MA 259/2001 – PP’s appeal dismissed) and 
PP v Wong Jia Yi
 
[2003] SGDC 53
 (MA 26/2003) – PP’s appeal discontinued).
25        The recommendations in the probation report indicated that probation might be viable in the present case, largely on account of the accused's family environment and his perceived ability to focus constructively on his studies.  On the other hand, probation is usually not considered appropriate for serious Penal Code offences such as robbery, rioting or other violent crimes: see eg. 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
.  The rationale for this is that such crimes are generally deemed to be too grave for probation to be considered as a workable alternative.  Public policy concerns demand general deterrence either by way of the imposition of a sentence according to the sentencing norms for adult offenders or a period of incarceration in the form of committal to a reformative training centre.
26        However, I would readily accept that probation can be (and has been) granted even where the accused has committed serious crimes, given the right circumstances (see eg. 
Lawrence Ang Kian Choon & anor v PP
 (MA 144/97 – unreported), involving a rioting charge under s 147 Penal Code).  In appropriate instances, where the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high, this may even outweigh the public policy concerns which are usually voiced in objection to probation for serious offences.
iii.        Aggravated offence and aggravating features - Probation not appropriate in the present case
27        As a general rule, the courts view an offence of rioting where hurt is caused as an aggravated offence.  Where weapons are used in the commission of the offence, this is a key aggravating feature.  Such offences are sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment of a substantial term.  Although caning is not mandatory, this is the norm for such offences: see eg. 
Lim Thiam Hor & anor v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
; 
PP v Diki
 
Zulkarnaini bin Saini
 (DAC 57026/2000 - unreported).  Irrespective of whether the charge is framed under s 147 or 148 of the Penal Code, the critical issue for the court to consider is the nature and gravity of the offence itself and its surrounding circumstances.      
28        I noted the following aggravating features.  It was not disputed that all the accused persons were members of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society at all material times, and that the offence arose out of their intention to settle scores with members of the rival 'Gi Hai Kim' secret society.  This was not a spontaneous or impulsive outburst, motivated by a show of youthful bravado.  The accused in particular was fully conscious well before the incident that a fight might take place if the 'Gi Hai Kim' members gave them any cause to do so.  Even in the midst of the performance, there was shouting of the 'Ang Soon Tong' secret society slogan.  There was absolutely no basis to suggest that the offence was anything other than premeditated.
29        Another telling indicator that the offence was planned was the fact that weapons were concealed by some of the members for the purpose of subsequent use in the gang fight.   It was not entirely clear whether each and every one of the accused persons (and the accused in particular) was aware that weapons would be involved.  Nevertheless, in the course of the fight, it was readily apparent that knives were being brandished by the 'Ang Soon Tong' gang members.  The accused made no attempt to distance himself from the fight.  In his own words, as conveyed to the probation officer, he was there with his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members as a 'show of force'.  Even then, he was not merely a bystander.  He was involved in the thick of the action.  He admitted that he actually did throw a punch on one of the rival group members, albeit ostensibly because he was punched first.
30        In my opinion, there were serious aggravating features in the present case.  Unless there were very exceptional reasons, these considerations provided ample justification for the court to rule out probation altogether.  Although there was no specific address on sentence, the DPP drew my attention to 
PP v Sim Teck Poh & Ors
 
[1997] SGHC 309
.  Rubin J made the following pertinent observations in respect of offences motivated by secret society affiliations:
Having now reviewed all the factors placed before me in mitigation, I am of the view that the manner in which the offence was committed, the planning involved, the harm inflicted, which in my view was not by foolish and confused youths under an act of sudden impulse or momentary outburst, but by secret society members committed to blind loyalty - all these warrant a sentence which would in some way bring home the message that corrosive, anti-social behaviour cannot be entirely tranquilised by eloquent mitigation pleas.  I can well imagine the terror and bedlam you might have caused on the evening in question to the innocent members of the public … when all of you went about charging your prey in utter contempt of law and order.
31        The accused persons in 
Sim Teck Poh's
 case were not facing charges under s 147 or 148, but far more serious charges under s 149 punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code.  Thus, the observations were made in quite a different context but are nonetheless still highly apposite.  The same observations would apply equally to the facts in the present case.  As I have mentioned earlier, it was not open to the accused to claim that he had acted on a sudden impulse.  He had every intention to assist his fellow 'Ang Soon Tong' members in settling whatever vendetta they claimed to have had against the 'Gi Hai Kim' members.  They did so in full public view, in complete and blatant disregard of the law and public order.  They proceeded right outside a community club across to a block of HDB flats where the gang clash took place.  In Rubin J's words, they must have caused considerable terror and bedlam among innocent members of the public.
32        Moreover, while every case is considered on its own facts, I did not see any reason to depart from the reformative training sentence that was passed in respect of Anandasayanan.  Like the accused, he was also found suitable to undergo both probation and reformative training.  There may have been other reasons for the court's decision to sentence him to reformative training.  Nonetheless, the principal consideration common to all the accused persons' cases is that the offence they had all been involved in was an aggravated offence, marked by aggravating features.  In my view, this outweighed the cogency of any argument that the accused might have shown some potential for reform and rehabilitation.
Conclusion
33        The probation report suggested that the accused's parents were concerned and supportive, having recognised that they were ineffective in exercising proper supervision and control over him previously.  The accused himself had expressed remorse for his conduct and had made an effort to dissociate himself from his gang members.  I accepted that these are important prerequisites if probation is to work.  However, in the final analysis, the seriousness of the offence taken together with the numerous aggravating features present would militate against probation being granted.  As such, I sentenced him to reformative training.",2004-08-23 00:00:00,SG District Court

V K Rajah JC:
1          Staring incidents, regrettably, occur all too often. They are usually the consequence of a heady brew that may include drink, drugs, braggadocio, territoriality and, to borrow a word from the vernacular, “face”. A key feature of these incidents is the existence of a perceived affront – often unintentional or slight. This in turn precipitates a completely unwarranted response. The initial exchange of looks or words escalates into aggression and ultimately violence. A singular characteristic of these incidents is irrationality wedded to disproportionality.
2          It must be clearly understood by those who initiate, contribute or react to such staring incidents that they will find the law in turn “staring” back at them indignantly. Almost invariably, deterrent sentences ought to be meted out in response to such conduct. As in instances of “road rage” there are strong public interest considerations in castigating and discouraging such “face rage”.
3          In 
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
 at 748, [11], a “road rage” case, it was emphatically stated by Yong Pung How CJ:
Violent crimes are one of the curses of our society against which it is the primary duty of the courts to protect the public. This is especially so on a small island like Singapore
, where citizens live in close proximity to each other: our daily lives are unavoidably intertwined to some extent, making the preservation of order and harmony all the more important
. [emphasis added]
Instances of “face rage” are probably more prevalent than “road rage” considering that these incidents can happen anywhere and at any time, sprouting from inadvertent eye contact, accidental body contact or boorish conduct. It is imperative to convey a clear message that in Singapore, conduct of this nature that escalates into violence will be harshly dealt with.
Facts
4          A loss of face has in this case resulted in a loss of life. A few minutes of rage have caused permanent misery to at least two families: the victim’s and the accused’s.
5          The accused (“Chaw”) is a 27-year-old Malaysian. At the time of the incident, he was working as a kitchen assistant, as was the deceased. They did not know each other.
6          
On 24 October 2003, at about 11.00pm, the deceased and his friend, Ho Yuen Meng (“Ho”), decided to take a stroll in Chinatown.
7          On arriving, the deceased dropped into a provision store, the R M Muthu Store, located at the lift lobby of the People’s Park Complex. He intended to purchase a drink. Ho remained outside the store while the deceased went in.
8          Chaw was already in the store having a conversation on his mobile telephone with his girlfriend when the deceased entered. Inadvertently, Chaw bumped into the deceased while talking on the phone. They both then stared at each other. No words were exchanged. The deceased subsequently paid for his drink and returned to the lift lobby where Ho was waiting for him.
9          When Chaw emerged from the store the deceased confronted him, demanding to know why Chaw had been staring at him. Chaw replied that he had only looked at the deceased because of the accidental contact. He attempted to mollify the deceased, saying it was a minor matter that should not be blown out of proportion, especially since both of them were foreigners working in Singapore. The deceased took exception to this, claiming to be Singaporean, though this was untrue. In reality, he too was Malaysian. Chaw was taken aback and demanded whether this meant that a Singaporean could intimidate a Malaysian. Upon hearing the deceased’s affirmative response, Chaw became distressed. He started pacing the lift lobby agitatedly.
10        Ho suddenly noticed the handle of a knife inside a plastic bag Chaw was holding. This was a kitchen knife Chaw was bringing home to cut fruits. Ho, suspecting that Chaw might turn violent, urged the deceased to leave immediately. The deceased and Ho then began to walk away. Noticing this, Chaw asked them if they were leaving because they “had no guts”. On hearing this, the deceased turned back and walked towards Chaw.
11        Chaw had by then noticed two other male passers-by in the lift lobby. He shouted that Singaporeans were bullying Malaysians. As the two passers-by approached, Chaw told them that he had “bumped” into “two guys”, namely the deceased and Ho, and that they now wanted to assault him. One of the passers-by advised the parties not to exacerbate the matter any further; it was, after all, a storm in a teacup.
12        Chaw was by now enraged with the deceased and had worked himself into a frenzy. He took out a small bottle of “Tiger” beer and the knife from his plastic bag. Stricken by panic, the deceased turned on his heels and fled. Chaw immediately pursued him, chasing him along People’s Park Crescent towards Eu Tong Sen Street. Ho initially remained rooted to the ground, but eventually collected himself and ran after the deceased and Chaw.
13        While trying to catch up, Ho suddenly heard the sound of breaking glass. Upon approaching the deceased and Chaw, he saw the deceased approximately 20m away, lying on the ground with his back against the kerb. Chaw was crouching over the deceased. Ho saw Chaw plunging his knife into the back of the deceased’s neck two to three times. The deceased tried unsuccessfully to ward off the blows.
14        Ho was beside himself with anguish. Not daring to confront Chaw directly, he shouted “mata lai liao”, a combination of Malay and Hokkien words that meant “the police have arrived”. Chaw quickly stood up, looked at the deceased and fled from the scene. The deceased later passed away in hospital early in the morning of 26 October 2003.
15        Chaw returned to his flat, changed his clothes and wrapped the knife in some rags. Grabbing his passport, he hurriedly left the flat. Fearing that the police were on their way to apprehend him, he rushed to the open-air car park on the sixth floor of People’s Park Complex and jumped two storeys down to the adjacent rooftop of the Chinatown Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) station. Despite injuring himself in the process, he managed to reach ground level. He then hailed a taxi that took him to Johor Bahru. In the course of the journey, he threw away the knife.
16        On reaching Johor Bahru, with the help of his girlfriend’s brother, Chaw sought and received medical treatment for the injuries he had earlier sustained from jumping down two storeys. On 28 October 2003, persuaded by his girlfriend, he returned to Singapore and surrendered to the police. He has freely admitted his role in the incident.
17        Chaw initially faced a charge of murder pursuant to s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). This was subsequently reduced to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder pursuant to s 304(a) of the PC to which he pleaded guilty. It is undisputed that the stab wounds to the deceased’s neck caused his death. One of the stab wounds in particular was found by the pathologist to have penetrated the left posterior neck muscles, causing extensive intramuscular haemorrhaging. The depth of the track was about 7cm. This wound was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to have caused death. The pathologist opined that the knife had been used with “moderate force”.
Sentencing considerations
18        It is trite law that sentences normally reflect the classical principles of retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence and prevention: 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
 at [14]–[19]. These principles are to be evaluated against the backdrop of public interest and policy. Needless to say, the importance of each of these considerations will vary from case to case. Different facts merit different emphasis as these principles do not invariably complement each other.
19        In so far as deterrence is relevant it may be specifically focused on the offender and or generally serve to signify to the community at large that particular actions are offensive and violently conflict with acceptable norms of civil behaviour and good order. Culprits who resort to violent “self-help” to settle scores, real or otherwise, must be prepared to face deterrent sentences in view of the public interest in the prevention of such incidents.
20        The Prosecution drew my attention to the Court of Appeal decision in 
PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
 (“
Allan Tan
’s case”). In that case, the accused fatally stabbed the deceased in a secret society gang fight incident in front of Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. The Prosecution relies on the case to fortify its quest for a deterrent sentence, 
inter alia
, for the reason the attack took place in a public place. The Court of Appeal observed at [42]:
Though the reason why the respondent assaulted the deceased is readily understood, it is not readily justified. The assault was committed, even if on a rival gang member, on a harmless one. 
It was an assault with a dangerous weapon in a public place
. The victim was grossly outnumbered. [emphasis added]
The circumstances of that case are, however, quite different. There was a possibility that the incident might have conflagrated into a fracas threatening members of the public. Not all assaults in a public place merit the same sentencing considerations. I am however constrained to observe that while the court in that case may have “understood” the reason triggering the accused’s assault, I cannot say I understand or see any reason, let alone justification for Chaw’s behaviour. While he might legitimately have felt aggrieved by the deceased’s behaviour, any response beyond an exchange of words, at most, was unnecessary. The deceased had “assaulted” him only verbally and never physically. Furthermore, he had not even been physically threatened.
21        The Prosecution also submits that there are aggravating factors that ought to be taken into account:
(a)        Chaw gave chase when the deceased disengaged himself from the dispute.
(b)        Chaw had an undue advantage – he possessed a knife and a beer bottle.
(c)        The savageness of the attack – the deceased sustained four stab wounds on his neck in addition to defensive injuries on his hand.
These are, I accept, legitimate factors to be considered in deciding on the appropriate sentence.
22        Counsel for Chaw, on the other hand, has stressed in mitigation that Chaw had surrendered voluntarily, had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was genuinely remorseful. He further asked the court to note that Chaw had no previous history of crime or, indeed, of violence and had flown into a rage because of the deceased’s taunting. Chaw, counsel claimed, did not initiate the “incident” and had merely reacted to grave provocation. It should be pointed that this last contention collides with reason, as the requirements for provocation under the PC are not even remotely satisfied in the instant scenario.
23        It is amply clear that Chaw could have walked away from trouble. While it is evident that the deceased’s conduct had unreasonably aggravated the incident despite Chaw’s attempts to placate him, the tables soon turned. The deceased took flight despite his initial aggression. Chaw unfortunately, had by then worked himself into a frenzy. He deliberately chose to run into trouble and ultimately to court tragedy. From being the initial victim, he became the relentless and remorseless aggressor. He manifested a savage determination to grievously injure the deceased. The injuries to the deceased were directed to his neck – a vulnerable area. The deceased’s frantic attempts to ward off the attack were cold‑bloodedly brushed aside.
24        Considerations of retribution and deterrence are of particular importance in this case. Granting that Chaw’s counsel has referred to some salient mitigating factors, these alone cannot, in the final analysis, erase or even diminish the impact of the callous and wholly irrational attack. This case is, lamentably, an arresting example of “face rage”. Indeed, Chaw’s counsel himself submitted – as if this could entail palliative considerations – that “the accused had felt so belittled by the vulgarities and taunting” from the deceased. None of this can by any stretch of imagination remotely justify Chaw’s subsequent response. Such a savage assault must be denounced in the strongest possible terms, not just through words but through the sentence imposed. In my view, this incident clearly necessitates a deterrent sentence.
25        Section 304(a) of the PC prescribes a sentence of imprisonment for life or for a term not exceeding ten years and, in addition, a fine or caning. One has to bear in mind, though, that the range of circumstances involving such genres of culpable homicide can be extremely wide. Given the stark contrast today between a term of life imprisonment and a fixed term, considerable care and circumspection must be exercised in pronouncing the appropriate sentence. In 
Allan Tan
’s case the court also instructively stated at [40]:
In a situation in which the court is desirous of a sentence greater than ten years, but feels that a sentence of life imprisonment is excessive, we have no choice but to come down, however reluctantly, on the side of leniency. Otherwise, the punishment imposed would significantly exceed the offender’s culpability. 
It would, in our view, be wrong to adopt an approach in which the court would prefer an excessive sentence to an inadequate one.
 [emphasis added]
26        These observations inexorably emphasise that restraint should be exercised in choosing between a sentence of life imprisonment and a conventional fixed-term sentence. The spontaneity of this incident and Chaw’s crime-free history militate against the imposition of a life sentence. A sentence of life imprisonment would be inappropriate: it would be both disproportionate and crushing.
27        My attention was also drawn to the sentences meted out in some recent cases pertaining to s 304(a) of the PC. In 
PP v Mohamed Shaiful bin Mohamed
 Criminal Case No 19 of 2001, the accused accidentally bumped into the deceased in a discotheque. The accused did not apologise. The deceased then asked the accused, “What is the problem?” The accused refused to apologise as he felt that it was an accident. The deceased then abruptly beckoned the accused towards him. The accused instead rushed to his locker and retrieved a knife that he had brought along for protection against rival gangs. A fight broke out between the accused, the deceased, and their friends. The deceased was armed with a metal pole during the fight. In the midst of the fight, the accused lunged at the deceased and stabbed him once in the abdomen and once in the chest. The accused had previously been ordered to undergo reformative training at the Reformative Training Centre for theft, rioting and assisting in the disposal of stolen property. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
28        
PP v Lai Kah Seng
 Criminal Case No 5 of 2001 involved a dispute that broke out between the deceased and his neighbour. The accused advised the deceased that the police were nearby. The deceased retorted that he was the head of a secret society group, and told the accused not to frighten him with the word “police”. The accused was enraged and stabbed the deceased with a knife which he had kept in his letterbox. After the incident, the accused fled to Bangkok. Seven years later, he was apprehended for trying to re-enter Singapore with a forged passport. The accused’s criminal record included offences of robbery, theft and gaming in public committed more than ten years earlier. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
29        Each case comes with its own unique concatenation of circumstances. The sentences meted offer guidance but do not dictate adherence. The common and discernable thread in these cases is the disproportionate manner in which each accused responded to a perceived “insult”. I also note that the accused in the two cases cited had criminal antecedents. Nevertheless, I am constrained to take into account the aggravating factors which the prosecution has rightly identified and the need for a deterrent sentence for the reasons adverted to earlier (see [1]–[3] and [24]). In the circumstances, the appropriate sentence for Chaw is ten years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. The custodial sentence shall be backdated to commence on 28 October 2003, being the date Chaw was taken into custody.
30        Those who easily take offence to perceived slights and choose to be unduly affronted ought to take notice that the law not only frowns upon intimidation but also on wholly disproportionate responses to such conduct.

The action was based on contract and tort, and also on “an indemnity”. The claim was made on behalf of all the subsidiary proprietors in respect of defects and damage to the common property as well as individual units of the sub-proprietors. The list of defects was a long one and included leakage and seepage of water, the debonding of tiles, soil settlement, loose grille covers, obstruction of refuse chutes, and various other items. These defects were identified by the firm of building surveyors engaged by the plaintiff to study and review the alleged problems in the condominium.
2          Mr Christopher Chuah Chee Kian, counsel for the defendant, made an application to have some questions of law to be tried as preliminary issues. Mr Leo Cheng Suan, counsel for the plaintiff, strongly objected and I thus permitted the trial to proceed. The first witness for the plaintiff was a subsidiary proprietor. Her evidence related virtually to her personal complaint of water seepage, which she testified she once thought was caused by her dogs’ poor toilet training. In any event, she said that her claim for about $5,000 was strictly in respect of repair costs to her own apartment unit. At that point, Mr Chuah made a renewed application to have the issues of law tried first. Counsel submitted that the three questions of law will determine substantially all, if not all, the issues at trial. He is right in saying that a point of law need not be one that will dispose of the entire trial. If it will lead to a disposal of a substantial part of the trial then the court may, at its discretion, order a trial of the legal issues first. In this case, even Mr Leo agreed that the case will extend well beyond the five days allocated for the trial. Realistically, if all the factual issues are disputed, the trial might require about 20 to 30 days. The legal issues will, in any event, have to be determined. In these circumstances, I ordered the three questions posed by Mr Chuah to be tried as preliminary issues.
3          The three questions are as follows:
(a)        Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to sue on behalf of all subsidiary proprietors of units who have entered into sale and purchase agreements as pleaded in para 26 of the statement of claim
[1]
 
read with paras 3 and 4 of the document entitled “Yet Further and Better Particulars” dated 25 June 2004
[2]
 
and if so, which purchasers.
(b)        Whether paras 18, 19, 20, 24 and 25 of the defence filed in the proceedings would be a defence to the plaintiffs’ claims in tort as pleaded.
(c)        Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to seek a declaration of an indemnity from the defendants against claims by subsidiary proprietors as pleaded in para 30 of the statement of claim.
4          Mr Leo maintained that the plaintiff had two bases in support of its right to sue. First he relied on s 116(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) which provides as follows:
Where all or some of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in a subdivided building are jointly entitled to take proceedings against any person or are liable to have proceedings taken against them jointly (any such proceedings being proceedings for or with respect to common property), the proceedings may be taken by or against the management corporation as if it were the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned.
This is a provision empowering the management corporation to sue or be sued. Without it, it might be questionable whether the management corporation, as a separate legal entity, is entitled to exercise any right to sue that belongs to a subsidiary proprietor and, conversely, whether it is liable to a suit in respect of which the real and otherwise proper party would be the subsidiary proprietor. It is similar to other statutory provisions such as that empowering an incorporated company to sue and be sued in its own name. Section 116(1) does not, on its plain meaning, confer or create any cause of action. The power to “take proceedings against any person” is contingent upon a 
right
 or a 
cause of action
. Hence, the management corporation may sue (on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors) a defendant in contract only where there is a cause of action in contract that is available to the subsidiary proprietors. The same reasoning applies in tort or to any other cause of action. Mr Leo’s reliance on the words “where all or some” in the opening line of s 116(1) might have been the source of his misconstruction of this provision.
5          Counsel submitted that since “common property was badly maintained … this would entitle all the subsidiary proprietors to sue the defendant in contract.” Mr Chuah argued that s 116(1) empowers the management corporation to sue only in tort. I do not think that the plain words should be read as restrictively as that. If a cause of action accrues in contract to any or all subsidiary proprietors, the management corporation should be entitled to sue in their stead. However, it does not follow that every subsidiary proprietor will sue just because he has a right to do so.
6          This brings me to Mr Leo’s second ground. Mr Leo’s second basis in support of the plaintiff’s right to sue was the resolution passed by the members at their second annual general meeting held on 31 March 2002 that expressly authorised the plaintiff to sue. The 49 members who attended unanimously passed the resolution in the following terms:
12.0      Ordinary Resolutions
12.1      To consider and if deemed fit, to approve by ordinary resolution that the Council of the Management Corporation be duly authorised:
12.1.1   on behalf of subsidiary proprietors, to commence legal actions/proceedings against Seasons Park Ltd, including Architect, Engineer, Contractors and/or any concerned parties, relating to all latent defects to the common property; and
12.1.2   to negotiate, compromise, enter into mediation, finalise settlement with Seasons Park Ltd and/or relating parties [
sic
] and to defend proceedings; and
12.1.3   to appoint, retain and collaborate [
sic
] solicitors, consultant or other experts; and
12.1.4   to expend up to S$100,000.00 from the management or sinking funds to pay consultants’ and legal cost and other related expenditures.
Mr Leo strongly suggested that the fact that the general meeting ratified the plaintiff’s decision to sue supported the plaintiff’s standing in the matter. But this ignores the fact that a third party has no right to ratify or assert a contractual right that he does not possess. This is a different situation from one in which the general meeting authorises the management corporation to sue in tort in respect of the common property. Contractual rights are personal. Some of the subsidiary proprietors, as counsel conceded, were sub-purchasers who had no contract with the defendant. Thus, it behoves the plaintiff to identify all the subsidiary proprietors on whose behalf it is suing 
in contract
. The identity of the parties ought to be made out in the pleadings and the originating process. This is basic and requires elaboration only because the writ and pleadings in this case identified the plaintiff as “the management corporation representing 390 subsidiary proprietors”. As it transpired, this was not correct. Hence, Mr Leo submitted belatedly that the plaintiff represents the 49 subsidiary proprietors who voted at the second annual general meeting. Mr Chuah was entitled to ask, and had indeed asked in vain, for particulars of the subsidiary proprietors.
7          It is important to identify each principal or substantive plaintiff when a management corporation purports to act for him or her. One of the more practical reasons for this is that in the event that the opposing party has to enforce any personal orders or orders as to costs, he will know whom he may pursue. It is true, as Mr Leo pointed out, that costs are normally borne by the management corporation. However, in principle, a substantive party is not absolved from such responsibility should its agent default or be unable to pay. All that I have stated above in regard to the legal position was fully expounded by LP Thean JA in the Court of Appeal judgment in 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 113
 at 119, [11]–[12]. It was not disputed by Mr Leo that of the 49 subsidiary proprietors who voted at the second annual general meeting, only 40 of them were original purchasers. Mr Leo submitted that the subsidiary proprietors, being laypersons, would not have known what the distinctions between suing in tort and contract were. That is true, but that cannot be said of their solicitors. Where a cause of action is to be founded on contract every party bound by that contract must be identified, and thus every subsidiary proprietor who had a contract with the defendant had to expressly authorise the plaintiff to sue on his behalf, whether in respect of common property or in respect of his individual unit if the plaintiff was prepared to sue on his behalf in that regard. I need not deal with the question whether the resolution was originally to empower the plaintiff to sue for “patent defects” or as later amended, to “latent defects”. What the true resolution was may involve findings of fact. On the first question of law, I find that the plaintiff’s claim in contract must fail because it had no pleaded cause of action in contract. Section 116(1) of the Act does not provide a standing to sue where no cause exists.
8          The second issue involves the question as to whether the defence of independent contractor defeats the plaintiff’s claim as it is pleaded. This is a straightforward point. In law, a person is not liable in negligence if he employed an independent contractor and the damage was caused by the negligence of that contractor. The plaintiff’s claim in this regard was pleaded on the basis that the defendant was negligent in failing to exercise reasonable care and skill “in designing and/or building the [Seasons Park condominium] and/or supervising the construction and rectification works”. The defendant cannot be expected to adduce evidence to prove or disprove the handiwork of his independent contractor, architect or engineer, all of whom the plaintiff had for unexplained “strategic reasons” declined to sue. All that is required of the defendant to prove is that he used reasonable care and skill in employing his independent contractor. Of course, whether the defendant exercised such skill and care is a question of fact for the trial, but the allegation in the pleading does not require this. As Mr Leo submitted, on the basis of the plaintiff’s pleadings, the defendant is sued, not for failing to exercise skill and care in selecting his independent contractors, but for a 
direct and personal failure in the design and construction of the condominium itself
. If that can be proved, it will be a shattering development in the building industry. This innovative attempt may prove more heroic than realistic, especially on the pleadings as they stand, which are significantly deficient in particulars. The plaintiff’s case is echoed in its counsel’s submission that, “for a project of this magnitude, it is inconceivable that the defendant would just leave everything to its independent contractors”. Whether that is indeed so is obviously a question of fact, but no particulars were given. Counsel’s second proposition was that the contractors could not have been independent because they worked for such a major employer. This seems very much like a wild and hopeful swing in the dark. The plaintiff’s case looks very bleak, but if the plaintiff insists on its day in court it is entitled to it, though it may prove a very expensive day.
9          I now refer to the third question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of indemnity. Rights under an indemnity normally arise by reason of a contract or by operation of law. In so far as there is no contractual connection in the present case, there is no question of any right to an indemnity in contract. So far as the question relates to the tortious claim as pleaded, no such right arises either for the simple reason that an indemnity in respect of damage caused by a tortious act is relevant only where someone else caused the damage. In the present case, the plaintiff had chosen to plead and argue that the independent contractor defence does not apply because the contractor was not independent. If the contractor is not independent then liability against the defendant would have to be direct liability, in which event no question of an indemnity arises. Mr Leo argued that the plaintiff, as the management corporation, is obliged to rectify such damage that the subsidiary proprietors may complain of. Therefore, it must be entitled to an indemnity from the defendant on that account. The logic of this argument is slightly congested. No indemnity in contract or tort arises where, as here, the plaintiff is suing on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors.
10        For the reasons above, the plaintiff is only entitled to proceed to trial to determine the very narrow issue of fact in negligence as to whether the defects were caused by the defendant personally and, if so, whether it was an actionable wrong. That would be relevant only in the event that the plaintiff succeeds in showing that the defects were caused by the defendant; he must then proceed to establish that the faults were actionable and not, for example, that the defects arose from acceptable wear and tear. In the absence of a contract, the developer or contractor, or for that matter any other relevant party, cannot be expected to hold out a lifelong guarantee in respect of any work that is subject to wear and tear. I shall hear the question of costs at a later date.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was an appeal against the decision of District Judge Doris Lai-Chia Lee Mui. The appellant, Sim Teck Meng David, was charged under s 392 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”) for robbing one Hu Cheng Guo (“Hu”) of the following items:
(a)        16 pieces of IDD calling cards valued at $200;
(b)        one Nokia 3310 handphone valued at $200; and
(c)        one waist pouch containing $400 in cash.
The district judge subsequently amended the charge by deleting item (c), and convicted the appellant on the amended charge. The appellant was sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The appeal was brought against conviction and sentence.
Charge
2      The amended charge against the appellant read as follows:
You, SIM TECK MENG DAVID, M/43yrs NRIC NO S1347676D are charged that you, on the 1
st
 day of January 2003, at or about 9.25pm, at Lor 12 Geylang, outside Sen Loan Eating House, Singapore, together with one unknown male Chinese, and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit robbery of the following property;
a.         16 pieces of IDD calling cards valued $200/- and
b.         One Nokia 3310 handphone valued $200/-
In the possession of one Hu Cheng Guo and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 392 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The facts
3          Hu was a construction worker who also sold phone cards on a freelance basis. On 1 January 2003, he met his friend Hu Qi Yuan (“Qi Yuan”) in Geylang. Hu and Qi Yuan then walked towards Sen Loan Eating House in Lorong 12 Geylang (“the coffee shop”) and stood on a pavement near the coffee shop. While they were there, Hu held a stack of phone cards in his hand and showed them to some women who were standing nearby, with the intention of selling the phone cards to them.
4          Subsequently, the appellant, who was the owner of a stall within the coffee shop, came towards Hu. The appellant cried out “phone cards” to Hu and stretched out his hands to snatch the phone cards from Hu. Hu quickly passed the phone cards to Qi Yuan. The appellant then hit Hu twice near the eye and shouted to Hu to hand over the phone cards. At this juncture, an unknown male Chinese (apparently a worker at the coffee shop) came out, grabbed and pushed Qi Yuan next to Hu, and asked Qi Yuan to hand over the phone cards. Qi Yuan then held up the phone cards, and the appellant took them. The appellant then punched Qi Yuan on the face, after which Qi Yuan left the scene.
5          Thereafter, another struggle took place, in which there was an attempt made by the appellant and the unknown male Chinese to snatch away Hu’s waist pouch. In the process, the appellant hit Hu on his head and chest. Sometime during the assault, the appellant took Hu’s handphone from Hu’s front shirt pocket. Hu then fell into a drain, whereupon the appellant kicked Hu near his eye and told him to leave.
6          Hu stumbled in the direction of Lorong 4 Geylang. There, a passerby spotted him and called for the police. The police and an ambulance arrived shortly afterwards. One of the police officers at the scene was Sergeant Wong Chee Wai (“Sgt Wong”). Hu complained to Sgt Wong that he had been beaten up, and that he had back pain as a result. Sgt Wong observed that Hu appeared frenzied. Sgt Wong then patrolled around the vicinity, but was unable to find anyone connected to the case. Hu was then brought to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for medical treatment.
7          On 2 January 2003, Hu made a police report regarding the incident, stating that about 17 to 18 phone cards had been taken from him. An investigating officer then brought Hu to a shop, where a diverse assortment of unused phone cards were shown to him. Hu picked out seven cards (which were later determined to match exhibit P5). The investigating officer then advised Hu to go back to the coffee shop to see if the appellant could be spotted there.
8          Following this advice, Hu went to the coffee shop and spotted the appellant sitting in front of his stall. Hu called for the police. Staff Sergeant Lim Chye Kwee (“SSgt Lim”) arrived at the scene. Hu informed SSgt Lim that he had been beaten and robbed of his phone cards and handphone the day before, and pointed out the appellant as the culprit.
9          SSgt Lim approached the appellant and questioned him regarding Hu’s allegation. The appellant admitted that he had slapped Hu, but only because Hu was selling phone cards near his stall, thus badly affecting his business. The appellant denied Hu’s allegation of robbery, claiming that a disgruntled onlooker, who was not happy with Hu’s attitude, had assaulted Hu and stolen Hu’s property. Subsequently, SSgt Lim placed the appellant under arrest and brought him back to Bedok Police Division Headquarters.
10        On 3 January 2003, Station Inspector Tan Lee Teck (“SI Tan”), the investigating officer for the case, met the appellant in the lockup. SI Tan then brought the appellant to his stall at the coffee shop (“the Geylang stall”) and conducted a thorough search of it. During this search, SI Tan discovered a drawer filled with hundreds of phone cards. Among them, there were seven phone cards that had been separated from the rest (exhibit P5). While the other phone cards were stacked vertically and had new covers, the seven phone cards were bound together with a rubber band, were flat on their backs on top of the other phone cards, and had old covers.
11        The appellant explained that the seven phone cards were those returned by customers, as they were dissatisfied with the service provided by the vendors of the phone cards. Notably, none of the phone cards had been scratched to reveal the personal identification numbers (“PINs”). SI Tan then searched the rest of the stall, but confirmed that only one drawer contained phone cards.
12        Subsequently, SI Tan brought the appellant to his other stall at North Bridge Road (“the second stall”) and conducted a search there as well. However, nothing was recovered from the second stall and the appellant was brought back to the station. The charge was then served on the appellant. He denied the charge of robbery, but admitted to slapping Hu. SI Tan then called Hu for an interview. Hu provided a detailed description of 14 of the phone cards that had been taken away from him. Of the 14 descriptions, seven matched the seven cards (exhibit P5) that were taken from the appellant’s Geylang stall.
The trial below
13        At trial, the Prosecution called Hu, Qi Yuan, Sgt Wong, SSgt Lim and SI Tan as witnesses. Hu maintained that he was beaten and robbed by the appellant, while Qi Yuan testified that he did not know what happened after he was punched by the appellant, as he had left the scene. Sgt Wong was a formal witness who testified that he was the police officer who attended to Hu on 1 January 2003. SSgt Lim was another formal witness who testified in relation to the appellant’s arrest. SI Tan’s testimony pertained to his search of the appellant’s two stalls, and the discovery of the seven phone cards. Additionally, SI Tan testified that Hu had informed him that he discovered his waist pouch missing as he was about to leave the coffee shop. SI Tan added that Hu did not allege that it was the appellant who had stolen the waist pouch.
14        The witnesses for the Defence were the appellant, one Poh Lay Hwa alias Roland (“Roland”) and the appellant’s wife, Lee Meng Choo (“Lee”). The appellant also gave evidence. He maintained in his testimony that he did not rob Hu, but admitted to slapping him. In this regard, the appellant claimed that, after slapping Hu, he had returned to his table and did not know what happened thereafter. Additionally, the appellant testified that the seven phone cards found in the Geylang stall were those returned by dissatisfied customers, and were not taken from Hu.
15        Roland’s testimony matched the appellant’s, in that he saw the appellant slap Hu and return to sit at his table. Roland added that he observed that the accused had not taken anything from Hu. Notably, in cross-examination, the Prosecution put it to Roland that, apart from the slap given by the appellant to Hu, Roland was not sure what had happened that day. Roland accepted this, and also accepted that the other parts of his testimony were merely information suggested to him.
16        Lee testified that she saw the appellant quarrelling and slapping Hu, after which the appellant walked back to his table and sat down. She added that subsequently, she heard noises coming from a back alley and saw many people crowding around. The rest of the night was uneventful and she closed the Geylang stall and left at about 2.00 or 3.00am. Lee also testified with regard to SI Tan’s search of the Geylang stall. According to her, SI Tan did not open any other drawers and only opened the one drawer filled with the phone cards. With regard to the seven phone cards found in this drawer, Lee testified that she fetched invoices
[1]
 
from her van that served as evidence that the seven phone cards were purchases made for the Geylang stall. She claimed that SI Tan had initially insisted on seeing these invoices. However, according to Lee, SI Tan neither took the invoices nor saw them.
The decision below
17        At trial, the appellant’s contentions were factual in nature and pertained to the characterisation of the events by the respective witnesses. The district judge evaluated the various testimonies and concluded that there could be no reconciliation between the prosecution witnesses’ and the defence witnesses’ versions of events.
Findings relating to Hu’s testimony and demeanour
18        The district judge found Hu to be a simple and straightforward witness. Her evaluation of Hu’s testimony revealed that Hu had consistently refused to make an unfair allegation against the appellant, both in court and to the police, regarding the loss of the waist pouch. In this respect, Hu had maintained in court that he did not personally see the appellant taking away the waist pouch. Hu’s testimony was corroborated by SI Tan’s testimony in cross-examination, where SI Tan informed that Hu did not say that the appellant took the waist pouch. The district judge noted that the waist pouch was the most valuable item particularised in the unamended charge against the appellant, and yet Hu never placed the blame on the appellant.
Key findings of fact
19        The district judge also found that the invoices Lee spoke about were tendered in the course of the trial, taking the Prosecution by surprise. She noted that this late production was suspicious, as one would have expected that upon facing criminal charges, such crucial documents would have been produced immediately. The district judge therefore held that the invoices were an afterthought and an attempt to bolster the defence’s case. The district judge also held that the appellant’s explanation as to the seven phone cards, 
ie
, they were rejected by customers, was peculiar. In this regard, the district judge found that none of the phone cards had been scratched to reveal the PIN. As such, none of them had been used prior to their being returned.
20        The district judge also made key findings with reference to the search of the appellant’s Geylang stall. The appellant alleged that SI Tan failed to make a thorough check of the Geylang stall and if he had, he would have found more phone cards that matched the designs of the seven phone cards. The district judge found it difficult to accept the appellant’s contention, holding that if SI Tan had taken the trouble to also search the appellant’s second stall (taking into account the fact that the mobile phone and waist pouch were yet to be found), he would most certainly have made a thorough search of the Geylang stall from the outset.
Findings relating to the defence witnesses’ testimony
21        With regard to the appellant’s testimony, the district judge found that the appellant was highly evasive and produced disparate versions of the events of 1 January 2003. Given the discrepancies, the district judge found the appellant’s testimony unconvincing and unreliable, and was only corroborated by Lee and Roland’s testimonies. With respect to Lee, the district judge found that her testimony was entirely suspect and that she had been caught lying during the cross-examination. The district judge also found that Lee’s allegation that she had produced the invoices to SI Tan was a complete fabrication. Additionally, the district judge found that Lee’s evidence of the events of 1 January 2003 was sketchy and non-committal, and that Lee was prone to exaggeration. From these, the district judge held that Lee’s evidence was, of itself, unbelievable.
22        The district judge also found that Roland was an evasive and unreliable witness. In this respect, the district judge impeached Roland’s credit after she discovered that Roland had clearly lied in the course of his testimony. Accordingly, she attributed no weight to Roland’s testimony.
Findings of fact relating to Qi Yuan’s testimony
23        On another note, the district judge found the prosecution witness, Qi Yuan, to be an unreliable witness and accorded no weight to his testimony. In this regard, the district judge found that Qi Yuan was either not able or willing to explain how he could identify the appellant to be the one who assaulted him, when he had actually admitted during re-examination that he did not see the face of his assailant.
The district judge’s conclusions
24        The district judge evaluated the various testimonies before her and accepted the Prosecution’s evidence, while rejecting the Defence’s. Accordingly, she found that the appellant had indeed acted in concert with another person in order to rob Hu of the phone cards and the mobile phone. The district judge then considered the issue of sentence. She had before her the appellant’s antecedents, which consisted of a conviction for a traffic offence in 1982, affray in 1989 and bigamy in 1996. However, she did not give much weight to the appellant’s antecedents, as the previous relevant conviction for affray was some 15 years ago.
25        In mitigation, it was mentioned that the appellant was the sole breadwinner and had committed the offence out of impulsiveness. The district judge noted that the minimum punishment under s 392 PC is three years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. She observed that the sentencing norm for offences of such a nature is in the region of 42 months’ imprisonment and the mandatory 12 strokes of the cane. The district judge also took into account the fact that the injury sustained by Hu was not a minor one (a 2cm linear laceration above the left eye). Accordingly, the appellant was sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, in line with the benchmark sentencing for offences of this nature.
The appeal
26        Essentially, the appellant brought the appeal solely on the district judge’s findings of fact and her assessment of the veracity of the witnesses. In the process, the appellant canvassed several arguments. He alleged that the district judge erred in law and fact by:
(a)        relying on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses despite the discrepancies within these testimonies;
(b)        rejecting the appellant’s testimony; and
(c)        rejecting the testimonies of the defence witnesses.
27        Before I dealt with each of these arguments, I noted that the law with regard to when an appellate court will interfere with or overturn the findings of fact of a trial judge can be found in the case of 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 at 719, [32]:
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons therefor.
Additionally, I observed that, for this appeal to succeed, it must be shown that district judge’s findings of fact were either “plainly wrong” or “reached against the weight of evidence”: 
Teo Kian Leng v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 147
 at [24]. I then turned to the issues raised in the present appeal.
Appeal against conviction
Whether the district judge erred in relying on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses despite the discrepancies within these testimonies
28        The appellant argued that the testimonies of SI Tan and Hu were riddled with discrepancies and should not have been relied on by the trial judge in convicting the appellant. I first dealt with the arguments raised in the context of SI Tan’s testimony, followed by the arguments raised in the context of Hu’s testimony.
SI Tan’s testimony
29        The appellant argued that SI Tan had been less than thorough in his search of the appellant’s Geylang stall. However, to the contrary, I observed from the notes of evidence that SI Tan had testified that he examined all the drawers in the stall, and had even climbed to the top shelf to look for any stolen exhibits connected to the case
[2]
 
In fact, the appellant and Lee admitted that SI Tan did conduct such a search.
[3]
30        I observed that the district judge reasoned that this was an indication that SI Tan had shown ample diligence in his search. Additionally, the district judge noted that SI Tan had also gone to search the appellant’s second stall for exhibits, indicating an attitude of thoroughness in his search. I agreed with the district judge’s findings, which were based on cogent evidence that was corroborated by even the appellant and Lee themselves. In the face of such clear evidence, it was hardly arguable that the district judge arrived at her conclusion against the weight of evidence, or had come to a plainly wrong decision.
Hu’s testimony – Hu’s identification of the seven cards that comprised exhibit P5
31        The appellant claimed that the district judge placed too much emphasis on Hu’s identification of the seven cards which matched those in exhibit P5. In this regard, the appellant argued that the evidence adduced pointed more towards the fact that exhibit P5 
resembled
 the phone cards that were taken away from Hu, rather than that they 
actually were
 the phone cards that were taken from him.
32        I found that the appellant’s argument failed to take into account the fact that the identification process established that Hu was 
able
 to pick out or provide descriptions of the cards that were 
indeed
 taken from him. It could not then be a mere coincidence that these descriptions were the same as the card designs found in exhibit P5. This was a clear indication that Hu was truthful about his claim that he was robbed of these very phone cards. It also showed that Hu was so familiar with the phone card designs, to the point that he could provide an accurate description of them when asked. In comparison, the appellant was not even able to identify exhibit P5.
33        Faced with such conflicting evidence, and the fact that the appellant had proved to be a highly evasive witness (as compared to the more forthcoming Hu), I found that the district judge had arrived at a correct conclusion with regard to exhibit P5. I thus rejected the appellant’s arguments in this regard.
Hu’s testimony – inconsistencies between Hu’s evidence and SI Tan’s evidence
34        The appellant argued that Hu’s testimony and SI Tan’s testimony conflicted in relation to the manner in which exhibit P5 was identified. Hu testified that he had identified the seven phone cards, which matched exhibit P5, only after he was brought to a shop and shown a diverse assortment of phone cards. SI Tan gave evidence that Hu had described in detail 14 of the cards which were taken from him, of which seven descriptions matched the seven cards (exhibit P5) found in the appellant’s Geylang stall. The appellant argued that these testimonies were varied and inconsistent with one another.
35        I found that this inconsistency was immaterial. This was because the two testimonies only went to show that Hu was able to accurately identify the phone cards that were taken from him on two different occasions. This in fact buttressed the Prosecution’s case that it was not a mere coincidence that Hu was able to accurately identify at least seven phone cards taken from him, and that these seven phone cards were then found in the appellant’s Geylang stall.
36        Further, I also observed that the district judge found that there were discrepancies between Hu’s and SI Tan’s testimonies, but held that these discrepancies were minor. The district judge explained that it was not clear that both Hu and SI Tan were referring to the same incident in their respective testimonies. The district judge also observed that the incidents were not exclusive, in that Hu could have picked out seven cards at a shop, and could also have provided descriptions of 14 cards. I agreed with the district judge’s observations. Ultimately, the gist of the evidence was that Hu was able to pick out or provide descriptions of all the cards, despite the minor discrepancies between Hu’s and SI Tan’s testimonies.
37        At this juncture, I noted that in most criminal trials, there would occur minor discrepancies between the testimonies of two witnesses. One cannot expect perfectly compatible testimonies. Such expectations would negate the fact that between each witness there lay differences in perception, retention and recollection of events. These are factors that must be taken into account when a court is faced with discrepant testimonies. In this respect, I recollected my holdings in 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
 and 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
. The discrepancies in this case were minor and inconsequential.
Whether the district judge erred in rejecting the appellant’s evidence
38        The appellant essentially argued that the district judge had no reason to accord little weight to the appellant’s evidence. The appellant’s main bone of contention here was with the district judge’s ruling on his credibility, and her rejection of the invoices as evidence. In this regard, the appellant claimed that it was this rejection that ultimately resulted in his conviction.
39        I found that the district judge was justified in rejecting the appellant’s evidence. It must be understood that the district judge had the benefit of not just a first-hand observation of the testimonies of the witnesses, but the benefit of observing the demeanour of such witnesses as well. As such, she was the best person to analyse these testimonies in light of the manner in which the witnesses delivered them. Bearing that in mind, I held that the district judge was justified in finding that the appellant’s testimony was inconsistent and full of discrepancies. In fact, from my scrutiny of the notes of evidence, I found that the appellant was highly inconsistent and evasive. For instance, he gave different versions of the events of 1 January 2003. The appellant had first informed SSgt Lim that an onlooker had robbed Hu. Thereafter, in court, he flatly denied having told SSgt Lim the same.
[4]
 
This inconsistency within the appellant’s testimony, pertaining to a key event in the case, was highly suspicious, and suggested that the appellant lied in his testimony.
40        Next, I found that there was merit in the district judge suspecting the appellant’s motive in producing the invoices at such a late stage in the trial. In this regard, I noted that the district judge arrived at a logical conclusion on the matter, holding that the invoices were of such importance that they should have been more promptly tendered in evidence. I agreed with the district judge’s conclusion.
41        In any case, I also found that the invoices failed to advance the appellant’s defence, as the appellant himself conceded in cross-examination that the invoices did not prove that he had purchased the seven phone cards.
[5]
 
It was odd that the appellant conceded this point, especially considering his earlier stand that the invoices were crucial to proving that the seven phone cards belonged to him. In this respect, I held that the appellant probably sneaked the issue of the invoices in as an afterthought. However, upon realising that this issue was not going to advance his defence, he willingly dropped it. As such, the appellant’s initial raising of this issue was in itself reflective of the appellant’s tendency to be evasive and less than honest.
42        Faced with such testimony, it cannot be said that the district judge arrived at a wrong conclusion. The appellant had indeed been evasive and inconsistent in his testimony. Therefore, the district judge’s findings to this effect cannot be marked down as errors. Additionally, even if the district judge had erred in suspecting the motives behind the tendering of the invoices, I noted that the appellant’s own testimony in cross-examination revealed the irrelevance of the invoices to begin with. In light of the appellant’s lack of credibility and veracity, I held that the district judge was correct in placing little weight on his testimony.
Whether the district judge erred in rejecting the testimonies of the defence witnesses
43        In this part of the appeal, the appellant argued that the district judge erred in her findings pertaining to Roland’s and Lee’s testimonies, as she had not accorded any weight to their testimonies. I dealt first with the district judge’s findings pertaining to Roland’s testimony.
Roland
44        Contrary to the appellant’s claim, I found that the district judge had arrived at the correct decision by not according any weight to Roland’s testimony, considering that Roland had twice been caught lying during the course of his testimony. The first instance was when Roland claimed that he had never spoken or discussed the case with the appellant prior to giving a statement at the police station.
[6]
 
He later admitted that he had indeed called the appellant on a few occasions prior to giving his statement.
[7]
 
In fact, he even admitted that the appellant had approached him regarding the case.
[8]
45        The other instance involved Roland’s testimony with regard to whom the appellant sat with at the coffee shop on 1 January 2003. Roland claimed that the appellant usually sat with two other persons and even went on to say that the appellant was drinking with these two persons.
[9]
 
However, in cross-examination, it was brought to his attention that the appellant had actually denied being with anybody on 1 January 2003.
[10]
 
To this, Roland did an about-turn and claimed that it was actually usual for the appellant to sit alone.
[11]
 
In the face of Roland’s barefaced lies, I found that the district judge did not have much choice apart from impeaching Roland’s credibility, and according his evidence no weight at all. In fact, it was clear from Roland’s testimony that he was an unreliable witness who tailored his evidence to suit the appellant.
Lee
46        As for Lee, apart from the fact that she had a vested interest in testifying in favour of her husband, there were also other aspects of her testimony that clearly showed that she was not a reliable witness. For one, Lee parroted the appellant’s contention that SI Tan failed to conduct a proper search. This was despite the fact that SI Tan took all diligent steps possible to conduct a proper search of the Geylang stall, a fact that even Lee admitted to. From this, it was clear that Lee was probably ensuring that her testimony artificially corroborated the appellant’s.
47        Further, Lee’s claim in testimony that SI Tan categorically refused to look at the invoices despite having requested for them was highly surprising. This claim was plainly illogical. These strange testimonies, coupled with the district judge’s observation that Lee was non-committal with her answers, provided sketchy evidence of the events of 1 January 2003, and was prone to exaggeration (all of which were findings not disputed by the appellant), went to show that Lee was indeed an unreliable witness. As such, I could not find any merit in the argument that the district judge erred in according no weight to Lee’s evidence.
48        In all, I found that the district judge did not come to her conclusions against the weight of the evidence and also did not reach a plainly wrong decision. In fact, it was clear from her detailed grounds of decision that the district judge had scrutinised the testimonies carefully, and balanced them with her objective perception on the demeanour of the witnesses before arriving at her decision. As such, I held that the appellant failed to show that the district judge erred in her findings of fact pertaining to the appellant’s conviction. Accordingly, the appeal against conviction was dismissed.
Appeal against sentence
49        In this part of his appeal, the appellant made only a bare assertion that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The appellant, however, failed to explain why this was the case. As such, it was difficult to envisage what it was about the sentence that the appellant took issue with. In the event, I scrutinised the district judge’s decision on the matter of sentencing and was convinced that she had arrived at a cautious conclusion.
50        This was highlighted by the district judge’s meticulous balancing of the various issues that could have an impact on the sentence. These issues included antecedents, sentencing benchmarks, minimum sentence requirements for the offence, Hu’s injury and the mitigating factors. As such, I found that the district judge properly traversed the various relevant facts impacting upon the sentence and came to a proper conclusion on the matter. I found no reason to tamper with her decision. I therefore dismissed the appeal against the sentence as well.
Appeal against conviction and sentence dismissed.

2 July 2004                                                                                                           
District Judge See Kee Oon:
The charge
1          The accused was initially charged with one count of robbery with hurt (s 394 Penal Code (Cap 224)) and one count of criminal breach of trust (s 406 Penal Code).  On condition that he would plead guilty, the prosecution proceeded on the following amended charge under s 356 read with s 34 of the Penal Code:
DAC 15942/2004
You, CS, Male 16 years old, NRIC: [xxx], Nationality: Singapore Citizen, DOB: 25 November 1987 are charged that you on or about the 13
th
 day of March 2004, at or about 12.30 am, at the void deck of Blk 355 Tampines St 32, Singapore, together with A M/15 years old, Rajmohan M/18 years old and B M/14 years old, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit theft of one ‘Nokia 7250’ handphone valued at S$500/- in the possession of one WF F/22 years old, which she was then carrying with her hand, and in the commission of the said offence, did use criminal force on the said WF, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 356 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Background and statement of facts
2          The accused is a secondary five student of East View Secondary School. His three accomplices are A (‘B1’), Rajmohan (‘B2’) and B (‘B3’).  On 12 March 2004, from about 7.30 pm, the quartet walked around HDB blocks in the Tampines area with the specific aim of scouting for targets from whom they would steal handphones.  Each of them decided to arm themselves with a wooden stick measuring about 40 cm in length.  They placed the sticks in their jeans and tucked out their shirts to conceal the sticks
3          B2 subsequently instructed B3 to throw away his stick and to act as a lookout for the police instead, while the rest of the group continued their search for potential targets.  At about 12.30 am on 13 March 2004, while the accused, B1 and B2 were sitting at the void deck of Blk 355 Tampines St 33, the accused spotted WF  walking towards their direction.  He alerted B1 and B2.  B2 then told the accused and B1 to approach WF while he would keep a lookout for them.  
4          The accused approached WF on the pretext of borrowing her handphone to make an urgent call.   When WF handed over her Nokia 7250 handphone to the accused, B1 walked towards her and hit her on the head with his stick.  The accused, B1 and B2 fled with her handphone and hid themselves at the third level of an unknown block.  The accused then contacted B3 on his handphone and instructed B3 to hail a taxi and proceed to meet them at the said block.
5          Eventually all four accused persons travelled in a taxi to Lorong 12 Geylang.  B1 sold WF's handphone for $250 at a nearby handphone shop.  The accused, B1 and B2 each received $80 as their share while B3 received $10.  WF's handphone has not been recovered.  She was bleeding from the head but managed to make a police report immediately after the assault.  She was then referred to the Accident & Emergency Department at the Singapore General Hospital for medical treatment.
6          From the A & E Department’s medical report (marked ‘A1’), WF recounted that she did not lose consciousness after the assault.  She had attempted to block the blow delivered by B1 with her right hand.  The following injuries were noted.  She suffered a 2 cm laceration over the right frontal region of the scalp.  There was mild swelling and bruising over the dorsum of her right hand.  She required stitches for the scalp laceration and was discharged with analgesia and medical leave for 15 March 2004.
7          B1 and B3 were also students in secondary three and secondary two respectively.  They are both still below 16.  B1 has since pleaded guilty before the juvenile court and has been sentenced to 30 months’ detention in the Singapore Boys’ Home.  B2 was unemployed and waiting to be enlisted for national service at the time.  He pleaded guilty before me along with the accused on 7 June 2004.  Upon calling for a pre-sentence report for B2, he was found to be suitable to undergo reformative training and he was sentenced accordingly.
8          The accused admitted to a second charge under s 406 of the Penal Code in DAC 22666/04 and consented to have this charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  Together with B1 and B2 and in furtherance of their common intention, he had committed criminal breach of trust by dishonestly disposing of a Motorola C35 handphone valued at $100 at about 4.45 pm on 12 March 2004.  The handphone had been entrusted to one of them for their usage by one Nurul Fitriah Mohamad Syafti’I (‘Ms Nurul’).
Mitigation
9          Mr Gurdip Singh presented a joint written mitigation plea on behalf of both the accused and B2.  The accused had no previous convictions.  His father is an insurance agent and his mother a pre-school teacher.  His elder brother is performing his national service.  
10        The accused and B2 are cousins.  B2 had left home sometime in February 2004 after a quarrel with his mother.  His father was then working in Bangkok.  B2 came to meet B1 at a mutual friend’s home where B2 had been temporarily staying.  Around 12 March 2004, the accused met up with all three co-accused at a coffeeshop.  B2 then talked about his escapades with B1 and B3 in an effort to impress the accused to join them.  The accused did so.  Prior to this, the accused was not involved in any of the co-accused’s activities.
11        On 12 March 2004, the accused, B1 and B2 had committed theft of a Motorola C35 handphone from Ms Nurul (the subject-matter of the charge in DAC 22666/04 against the accused which was taken into consideration).  They sold the handphone for $20 and spent the sum on food and drinks.  Later past midnight on 13 March 2004, they committed the snatch theft from WF.  The accused was therefore only involved in two offences.
12        Mr Singh submitted that the accused, like B2, had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.  Their timely plea of guilt was a show of remorse and contrition.  They had cooperated fully with the police from the onset of the investigations.  They realised that they were very foolish to have committed these petty crimes.  B2 allegedly turned to crime as he needed the money.  The accused was immature and foolish enough to be persuaded to join in.
13        The accused and B2 regretted the pain, suffering and anguish they had brought upon themselves as well as their immediate families, relatives and friends.  They had spoiled their own good records and would bear the stigma of a criminal conviction for the rest of their lives.  They have promised to turn over a new leaf after their bitter experience and they had learnt their lesson.  Their parents had also promised to exercise greater care and supervision and to give them their unconditional support and encouragement to ensure that they would change their ways.
14        Mr Singh submitted in closing that both the accused and B2 ought to be given one last chance to redeem themselves into useful and responsible citizens.  As such, the court was urged to call for pre-sentence reports to assess their suitability for probation.
Pre-sentence reports for probation and reformative training
15        A s 356 offence is sufficiently serious to warrant mandatory imprisonment of at least 12 months.  Caning may also be imposed.  However, I was prepared to consider all available sentencing options in respect of the accused, given that he was still relatively young and had no previous convictions.  Along with a probation report, I felt it would be appropriate to consider whether the accused was also suitable for reformative training.
16        In any event, the fact that the court calls for a probation report does not inevitably mean that probation will be ordered, even if the probation officer takes the view that probation can be supported.  The court is not bound to adopt the probation officer’s recommendations.  Having perused the pre-sentence report(s), the court must still exercise its discretion judiciously in determining the appropriate sentence.  In the final analysis, the court may even conclude that the circumstances warrant an imprisonment term.
17        According to the RTC report, the accused was certified to be physically and mentally fit to undergo reformative training.  He denied any secret society affiliations.  He had tried smoking cigarettes in 2003 due to peer influence.  He did not abuse controlled drugs or consume alcohol.  He committed the offence only because of peer pressure and had only wanted to help a friend who was in need of money.
18        Invariably, probation reports contain much more relevant background information about the accused and his character than RTC reports, primarily because probation officers will enquire more fully into such matters and conduct more extensive interviews.  The accused informed the probation officer, Ms Nurmy Ibrahim (‘Ms Nurmy’) that he knew that what he had done was wrong but he did not think much about the consequences of his conduct at the time.  He went on to pocket $80 as his share of the money because by then he felt he was too immersed in the offence.  Otherwise he was usually amenable to parental control and discipline and had not posed serious disciplinary problems in school.
19        Ms Nurmy assessed that the accused came from a fairly close-knit family.  His parents were concerned and supportive and had promised to step up their supervision of him.  They were willing to work with others in ensuring that he did not break the law again.  As for the accused, he had generally shown good behaviour in school and had no history of delinquent behaviour.   However, he had committed the offences because of his inability to discern the adverse consequences of his actions.  This was his first offence and he did not possess entrenched delinquent traits.  As such, Ms Nurmy recommended that the accused be placed on 18 months of supervised probation, with attendant conditions.
Reasons for sentence
i.          General considerations in granting probation
20        Three key considerations should be taken into account in determining whether probation can or should be granted.  First, what are the offender’s prospects of reform and rehabilitation?  Second, how serious are the offences in question?  Third, are there any other reasons militating against granting probation?  I have made reference to these considerations on at least two previous occasions (
PP v Tay Kee Guan Iskandar
 (MA 259/2001 – PP’s appeal dismissed) and 
PP v Wong Jia Yi
 
[2003] SGDC 53
 (MA 26/2003) – PP’s appeal discontinued).
21        The recommendations in the probation report indicated that there were fair prospects for probation to work in the present case.  On the other hand, I was fully conscious of the fact that probation is usually not considered appropriate for serious Penal Code offences such as robbery, rioting or other violent crimes: see eg. 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
.  The rationale for this is that such crimes are generally deemed to be too grave for probation to be considered as a workable alternative.  Public policy concerns demand general deterrence either by way of the imposition of a sentence according to the sentencing norms for adult offenders or a period of incarceration in the form of committal to a reformative training centre.
22        Nonetheless, probation can be (and has been) granted even where the accused has committed serious crimes, given the right circumstances (see eg. 
Lawrence Ang Kian Choon & anor v PP
 (MA 144/97 – unreported), involving a rioting charge under s 147 Penal Code).  In appropriate instances, where the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high, this may even outweigh the public policy concerns which are usually voiced in objection to probation for serious offences.
ii.         Aggravated offence with aggravating features - Probation not appropriate in the present case
23        The Assistant Public Prosecutor submitted that probation ought not be granted for the accused in view of the seriousness of the offence as well as the fact that the accused persons had embarked on a plan to commit theft which involved targeting female victims.  I concurred with his submission.  As I have noted earlier, the s 356 offence in question was serious.  The prescribed mandatory punishment of 12 months’ imprisonment (and the prospect of caning) speaks for itself.  The offence was further aggravated by virtue of the use of a weapon to inflict injuries upon WF.  Fortunately for her (as well as the accused persons), her injuries were not life-threatening despite the fact that B1 had hit her over the head with the stick.  She required stitches for the laceration on her scalp.  She also suffered bruising and swelling of her right hand.
24        I was mindful that the accused was only convicted on one charge, with one other offence under s 406 taken into consideration.  There was no suggestion that he had been involved in any other offences, unlike B2.  There was also no indication that he had been personally responsible for the use of violence.  Nonetheless, he was instrumental in the commission of the crime.  He was the one who had picked out WF as their intended target and alerted the others to her presence.  He was also the one who practised deception on WF, thereby leading her to part with her handphone unsuspectingly for his ostensible use to make an urgent call.  This facilitated the unprovoked and vicious assault by B1. 
25        The offence was planned and deliberate.  They chose to target a female victim and struck just past midnight.  This was not a show of youthful bravado.  It was hooliganism at its most deplorable level.  All four accused persons knew their respective roles and had taken steps to arm themselves with sticks.  In any event, the accused would presumably have also resorted to the use of the stick if the circumstances had necessitated so.  It could not be said, therefore, that he was any less culpable than the other accused, with the exception of B3 who had only acted as a lookout. 
iii.        Other aspects for consideration from the probation report
26        I turn now to address certain aspects adverted to in the probation report which merit further consideration.  For instance, when asked to provide information as to why he had been involved in the present offence, the accused ‘admitted that he knew that stealing was wrong but claimed that he did not think much about the act nor its consequences at the time’.  He reportedly also offered the same reason when asked why he was armed with a stick.
27        The accused knew very well that what they were planning to do was wrong and against the law.  Any reasonable 16 year-old would have known that.  To say that he did not think about the act or its consequences was no excuse for the offence.  One key aggravating feature was that the offence was premeditated.  The decision to commit the offence was not simply made on the spur of the moment.  On his part, the accused had already been involved in a property offence earlier that afternoon with B1 and B2 (the s 406 charge that was taken into consideration).  He had then spent a good six hours loitering around together with his accomplices, armed with sticks and looking out for potential victims.  There was nothing rash, impulsive or spontaneous about his conduct.
28        Moreover, when the opportunity presented itself, it was the accused who first spotted WF.  He obviously knew what his role was - to lull WF into parting with her handphone on some pretext, thus affording B1 the opportunity to assault her before they made good their escape.  He also had no qualms in pocketing his share from the sale proceeds of the handphone.
29        In the probation report, the accused’s parents were assessed to be supportive and to share a close relationship with him.  The parents reportedly also said that they often discussed ‘societal issues’ with their children although it was not clear what the actual nature of such issues was.  Ms Nurmy was apparently also informed that the accused did not have a habit of keeping late nights.  However it was evident that the parents were not aware at all of the accused’s activities on the night in question; he had stayed out with his accomplices well into the early hours of the morning without their knowledge. 
30        Further, the accused’s parents described him as being amenable to their instructions and advice.  While some element of family support was demonstrably present, with respect, I was somewhat sceptical of the parents’ assurances that the accused would be amenable to their instructions.  He was said to ‘reason with them if he felt that he was in the right’ but ‘did not throw tantrums’.  Yet his mother had also revealed that the accused liked to meditate as this would ‘usually’ help to ‘quell his quick temper and impatience’.  This revelation may have been unintended but in my assessment, this was a telling indicator that the accused might well have certain rebellious traits which his parents had either consciously or unconsciously overlooked.
31        My suspicions were fortified by Ms Nurmy’s references to his school reports.  Detailed reports were not forthcoming from the accused’s primary and secondary schools to assist in the preparation of the probation report.  Nonetheless, from his secondary school report books, it was noted that he ‘can be quite playful’ and needed to ‘work much harder and be focused in studies to do well’.  At best, it could be said that the accused may have had some potential to do better in school.  There were no signs that he had done well.  His first semester results for 2004 were dismal, passing only one subject out of six.
32        His parents had informed Ms Nurmy that the accused was ‘mentally stressed during the first semester by the present case’, hence implying that his schoolwork had suffered as a result of his arrest.  In my opinion, this also suggested that the parents were quite oblivious to his conduct and performance at school.  He did not attend school for 23 out of 97 days.   I was aware that he was remanded for police investigations from 10 to 16 April 2004 after being charged in court.  Even then, he would still have missed school for another three weeks or so.  No explanation was offered by the accused or his parents for his absence over this lengthy period.  It obviously had nothing to do with the period of court-ordered remand, which commenced only from 7 June 2004.  By then, the mid-term school holidays had already begun.
33        As a final note, I did not discern any genuine remorse at any point for the commission of the offence, and more specifically for the injuries caused to WF.  The accused did however claim to be ‘regretful of his involvement’ when interviewed by Ms Nurmy.  Even in Mr Singh’s mitigation plea, there was only an expression of regret for ‘the pain, suffering and the anguish [the accused and B2] have brought not only upon themselves but also their immediate families, relatives and friends’.  There was nothing suggesting empathy for the victim.  His expressions of regret appeared more to be indications of self-pity rather than genuine signs of remorse.
34        The above aspects which are discernible from the probation report did not augur well in terms of his capacity for rehabilitation.  Perhaps Ms Nurmy had been of the view that they were outweighed by the considerations in support of probation.  With respect, I was not inclined to such a generous interpretation.  In my view, the aspects I have elaborated on, taken together with the aggravating features apparent from the statement of facts, tended to suggest that the accused would not be suitable for probation. 
35        I would also note that although the charge before me was one under s 356, the facts would equally support a charge of robbery with hurt, as originally framed.  In 
Lim Wee Liat v PP
 (MA 246/97 - unreported), the accused was a 16 year-old male who pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery simpliciter (s 392 read with s 34 Penal Code), with another similar charge taken into consideration.  The accused had no previous convictions.  The circumstances leading to the commission of the offence appear to be very similar to the facts in the present case.  There were four accused involved and the offence took place just before midnight.  There were however two crucial differences: in 
Lim Wee Liat
, no violence was actually used on the victim and the accused persons did not specifically target a female victim.  Even then, the accused was sentenced to reformative training and his sentence was upheld on appeal.
Conclusion
36        In the pre-sentence reports, the accused was considered to be a potential candidate for both probation and reformative training.  There is no rigid rule that in such circumstances, the court must invariably lean in favour of granting probation.  The seriousness of the offence had to be weighed carefully alongside the prospects of successful community-based rehabilitation.
37        The offence was undeniably serious.  There were also numerous aggravating features present.  For these reasons alone, there were sufficient grounds to warrant a sentence of reformative training.  Moreover, a detailed analysis of the probation report indicated that there were certain risk areas and appropriate weight had to be attached to these concerns.  I was not convinced that probation was viable as the accused had not shown a demonstrably high capacity for rehabilitation.  As such, I sentenced him to undergo reformative training.",2004-07-02 00:00:00,SG District Court

Tay Yong Kwang J:
1
         
 The accused pleaded guilty before me to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). On 5 November 2003, at about 11.15am, in front of Block 146 Teck Whye Avenue, he caused the death of a 42-year-old man, Keng Yew Cheng (“the deceased”), by stabbing him in the chest with a knife, with the knowledge that it was likely to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death.
2
         
 The accused was a durian seller operating from a makeshift stall at the wet market in the said Block 146. He is married to an Indonesian woman. The deceased was a part-time driver.
3
         
 The accused and the deceased were friends. The accused got to know the deceased when he was previously working for the deceased’s brother. Between September and October 2003, the accused borrowed a total of $2,000.00 from the deceased who charged him monthly interest of between 10% and 15%. At the time of the incident, the accused owed the deceased $1,800.00.
4
         
 At about 10.00am on 5 November 2003, the accused was with his wife at his durian stall. He telephoned the deceased to inform him that he was not able to pay back the debt and asked for more time to make the repayment. The deceased was unhappy and scolded him with vulgarities. The deceased then told the accused to wait for him at the market as he would be going there.
5
         
 At about 11.15am, the deceased arrived at the said market while the accused was at the durian stall talking with his friend, Pang Hock Guan. The deceased began shouting vulgarities at the accused who implored him in Hokkien to give him one or two days more to make the repayment. Nevertheless, the deceased went up to the accused and started hitting him with his fists. The accused tried to block the blows with his arms and backed away from the deceased. However, the deceased continued to advance towards him and to attack him.
6
         
 After retreating a short distance, the accused noticed a knife lying on a metal cabinet in a nearby vegetable seller’s stall. He grabbed the knife and pointed it at the deceased. He extended his arm and stabbed the deceased once in the chest. When the deceased collapsed, the accused threw the knife onto a grass verge.
7
         
 The accused then used a towel to press on the deceased’s wound. He also shouted for help and told Pang Hock Guan to call for the police and an ambulance.
8
         
 Subsequently, the accused went to the grass verge and covered the knife with a piece of newspaper. He then told his wife to throw the knife away. She wrapped the knife in the newspaper and discarded it near a lamp post some 29m away.
9
         
 At 11.34am that day, the deceased was pronounced dead by a paramedic. A post-mortem conducted on 6 November 2003 revealed that the deceased had died from acute haemorrhage due to a stab wound to the heart. The 2.5cm by 0.7cm stab wound was about 8cm deep.
Antecedents
10
       
 The accused had no criminal record.
The mitigation plea
11
       
 The accused was an odd-job labourer. He has a five-year-old son. He lived with his wife and his father, who is more than 70 years old, in a three-room Housing and Development Board flat in Teck Whye Avenue. As he was an odd-job labourer, he would often go to Mandai to pick durians and then sell them along the pavement of Block 146.
12
       
 When the deceased was assaulting him, the accused begged him to stop even as he retreated from the attack. He did not want to have a fight with the deceased. The knife was an old, rusty one used by the owner of the vegetable stall for his trade. He only wanted to use it to frighten the deceased.
 
13
       
 When the police arrived at the scene, he immediately admitted what he had done and told the police what had happened to the knife. He co-operated fully with the investigators. He asked his wife to retrieve the knife which he had told her earlier, while in a state of fright, to throw away in a nearby rubbish dump
14
       
 It did not occur to him to flee from the scene because he only wanted to save the deceased after he saw him collapse onto the floor. He got his friend, Pang Hock Guan, to go to a clinic nearby to get a doctor to attend to the deceased and the doctor did go to the scene.
15
       
 He was remorseful and pleaded for leniency.
The decision of the court
16
       
 Section 304(b) of the Penal Code provides for a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment or a fine or both. Many of the sentences meted out by the courts under this provision fall within the range of six to ten years.
17
       
 In this case, the accused was clearly not the aggressor. He was trying to make an honest living on the morning of 5 November 2003. He called the deceased over the telephone merely to inform him of his financial straits and to request more time for repayment of the loans for which he was charged exorbitant interest rates. He did not provoke the deceased in any way.
18
       
 It was the deceased who chose to go to confront the accused about the debt and who resorted to vulgarities and violence without provocation. He gave the accused no quarter and continued the punching despite the accused’s reluctance to retaliate by stepping backwards each time and in spite of his plea to talk things over and grant him indulgence of another two days. The deceased was of bigger build than the accused.
19
       
 The accused did not arm himself in advance despite knowing the deceased was going to his durian stall in a most foul mood. It was during this unprovoked and unrelenting attack that he saw, quite unfortunately, the rusty knife with a blade of some 9cm and took it to try to frighten the deceased away. The knife was not placed there as a weapon. The depth of the stab wound was probably contributed to by the deceased’s aggressive advance towards the accused.
20
       
 The accused’s instant and genuine remorse was clearly shown by his actions immediately after that one fatal stab. He was truly concerned for the deceased. He tried to stanch the bleeding although he had also suffered injuries inflicted by the deceased. He shouted to his friend to get medical help for the deceased. He did not try to flee from the scene.
21
       
 He did ask his wife to throw the knife away but that was probably said in a state of shock and panic rather than as a cold, calculated move to thwart justice. When the police asked him to co-operate with them, he told his wife to retrieve the knife from the rubbish dump.
22
       
 He was fully co-operative during the investigations and has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He also had a clean record.
23
       
 In these circumstances, although it is extremely sad that a life was lost over a debt of $1,800.00, the accused deserves whatever mercy the law is able to give him. I therefore sentence the accused to imprisonment of three years and six months, backdated to commence on 5 November 2003.",2004-05-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant, Kuan Cheng Poh, was convicted in the district court on a charge of driving otherwise than in an orderly manner and without due regard for the safety of others, an offence under r 29 of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R 20, 1999 Rev Ed). He was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000, and was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for six months. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed both appeals, and now give my reasons.
Facts
The Prosecution’s case
2          The Prosecution relied primarily on the evidence of two witnesses. The first witness was one Mohamed Yusop bin Haron (“PW1”), a Traffic Police Staff Sergeant who was on highway patrol duty at the material time. The second witness was one Ahmad bin Pee (“PW2”), a Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) Sergeant who was part of an SCDF team dispatched to the scene following the alleged offence.
3          At about 4.30pm on 13 February 2002, PW1 was alone on patrol duty in his police patrol car (“the patrol car”) when he received a call requesting that he attend to an accident at the slip road leading from the Seletar Expressway (“SLE”) to the Bukit Timah Expressway (“BKE”). PW1 arrived at the slip road at about 4.40pm. He saw an overturned car in the right-hand portion of the slip road. I will term this “the right lane” for convenience, as that is how it was referred to in the evidence and submissions, although there appeared to be no lane markings in the photograph exhibits.
4          PW1 parked the patrol car behind the overturned car, and got out. He switched on the patrol car’s flashing lights and police blinker lights. He also placed a few orange warning cones behind the patrol car. The accident had caused no injuries or damage, other than to the overturned car. It was subsequently towed away.
5          PW1 then checked the road conditions. He noted an oil spill about one car-length in front of the patrol car. He also noted that the road was wet due to rain, but that the rain had already stopped. He checked the road as far as two lamp-post lengths behind the patrol car, against the direction of oncoming traffic from the SLE. He found no further oil spills. PW1 stood in front of his patrol car. He made a call to SCDF, requesting that they send a team to have the oil spill washed off the road.
6          At this point, PW1 saw the appellant’s motor lorry GT 828 R (“the lorry”) coming on to the slip road from the direction of the SLE. In his evidence, PW1 was clear that the lorry was travelling “fast,” although he refused to estimate its speed when asked to do so by the district judge. The lorry skidded toward the left-hand side of the slip road (hereinafter “the left lane” for convenience), then to the right lane, where it hit the metal side railing, one of the orange warning cones behind the patrol car, and finally, the rear of the patrol car itself. Neither PW1 nor the appellant was injured. The appellant told PW1 that he had lost control of the lorry, and that the road was probably slippery.
7          PW1 testified that there was a scooter travelling on the slip road that had to manoeuvre to avoid the skidding lorry. In doing so, the rider of this scooter fell onto the road, but was not injured. PW1 said that he got back on his scooter and left before PW1 could take down his particulars. Finally, PW1 stated that the speed limit on the slip road was 50km/h.
8          At about 5.50pm, PW2 arrived at the slip road with his SCDF team. His evidence was that there was “a large quantity of oil spill” in front of the patrol car, but not behind it. PW2 checked the entire length of the slip road, from the point at which it began to turn off from the SLE into the BKE, but found no other spillage.
The Defence
9          The appellant appeared in person. His defence was that he had lost control of the lorry due to an oil spill on the slip road, which caused the lorry to skid, and subsequently collide into the patrol car. According to the appellant, it was still drizzling at the material time. He stated that he had been driving at a speed of approximately 40km/h. He also said that he could not have been driving at more than 50km/h. He slowed down as he was negotiating the bend and saw the patrol car. He was then travelling at between 30 to 40km/h. There was no scooter as PW1 had claimed.
10        The appellant had one other witness, one Zainuddin M Saleh (“DW2”), the investigating officer, who was offered to the Defence by the Prosecution. DW2 was not at the slip road at the material time. However, he confirmed in cross-examination that PW1 and PW2 had both told him that the oil spill was located in front of the patrol car, rather than behind it.
The decision below
11        The district judge was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. He made a finding of fact that there was only one spill. This was the oil spill left by the overturned car in front of the patrol car. The appellant had obviously lost control of the lorry, but this had not been because of the oil spill. As the road was wet due to rain, a careful driver would have taken extra precaution in driving, especially if he had sight of the stationary patrol car in his path.
12        As to sentence, the district judge considered that the appellant’s antecedents for speeding and for using a mobile telephone while driving showed that he had a “callous attitude on the roads and failed to accept that being allowed to drive on the roads was a responsibility which called for the highest regard for the safety of all other road users”. In his view, the degree of carelessness demonstrated on the present facts was “of a high order”. The appellant’s previous record, as well as the fact that considerable damage to government property had been caused, warranted a period of disqualification in addition to the fine of $1,000. The district judge considered that a disqualification period of six months was appropriate in the circumstances.
13        I should add that the appellant had originally been scheduled to appear in court on 14 October 2002. As he had failed to appear on that date, he was required to show cause under s 133(6) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed). The district judge was of the view that the appellant’s explanation that he had “mixed up” the dates was inadequate. The district judge found that the appellant had not shown cause, and imposed a fine of $500. This order was not appealed against.
The appeal against conviction
14        The appellant appeared in person before me. The 11 “points of clarification” put forward in his petition of appeal essentially disputed the district judge’s finding that the oil spill was in front of the patrol car, and not behind it. In particular, the appellant sought to attack the credibility of PW1, and concomitant with that, PW1’s evidence as to the location of the oil spill. At the hearing, the appellant took great pains to emphasise that the oil spill was behind the patrol car, and that this was what had caused the lorry to skid.
15        Before I turn to the appellant’s point, it is worth briefly revisiting the principle that an appellate court will be slow to disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they are either plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. The basis of this principle is simply that the appellate court does not have the advantage of hearing the witnesses and observing their demeanour. The appellate court will therefore generally defer to the lower court in that regard: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
. The appellate court must be convinced that the decision of the lower court was wrong. Mere doubt is not enough: 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
.
16        Bearing these principles in mind, I considered whether the finding of fact that the appellant sought to impugn met the necessary threshold. I was of the opinion that it did not, and that the appeal on conviction accordingly had to be dismissed, for two reasons.
17        First, the district judge’s finding rested significantly on the credibility of PW1, since it was he who gave evidence as to the events immediately before and during the alleged offence. It was PW1 who gave evidence that the only oil spillage on that slip road was in front of, and not behind, the patrol car. The district judge plainly accepted PW1 as a credible witness when he formed the opinion that PW1 was clear in his evidence, and that he remained unshaken in cross-examination by the appellant.
18        Second, PW1’s evidence as to the location of the oil spill was independently corroborated by PW2 when the latter gave evidence that there was “a large quantity of oil spill” not behind, but in front of, the patrol car. I noted from the record of proceedings that the appellant claimed that after the alleged offence, a “friend” of his arrived in a taxi to inspect the scene. However, I further noted that the appellant did not produce this “friend” in the district court. This was unfortunate, as it seemed to me that there was a chance that this “friend” might have provided some corroborating testimony of the appellant’s version of events. What weight would have been accorded to this person’s evidence was, of course, a matter of pure conjecture by the time this appeal came before me. Simply put, the unassailable truth was that the only evidence on record that the oil spill was behind the patrol car came from the appellant himself.
19        In my judgment, this sufficed to dispose of the appeal on conviction. However, there was another reason why the appeal was completely without merit. Even if I accepted the district judge’s finding on the oil spill as plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, I was of the view that it was unlikely at best, and ridiculous at worst, that the lorry would have careened in such a manner as to cause such significant damage to the metal side railing and the rear of the patrol car if the appellant had indeed been driving in an orderly and careful manner, and with due regard for the safety of others.
20        It was evident from the photograph exhibits before me that damage of this degree would have required the lorry to collide with the railing and the patrol car with considerable force. This would have been nothing short of impossible had the appellant been driving at less than 40km/h as he claimed. On the contrary, I agreed with the Prosecution that this only lent credence to PW1’s evidence that the appellant was travelling “fast” along that slip road. Therefore, it followed that the location of the oil spill could not assist the appellant unless he was also able to show that he was travelling at a conservative speed. This he could not.
21        For those reasons, I dismissed the appeal against conviction. I now turn to the appeal against sentence.
The appeal against sentence
22        While the appellant did not specifically address the issue of sentence either in his Petition of Appeal or at the hearing before me, I nevertheless went on to consider whether the sentence imposed by the district judge was manifestly excessive.
23        The offence under r 29 is punishable under s 131(1A) of the Road Traffic Act, which provides:
Any person who, by virtue of this section or any other provision of the Act or the rules, is guilty of an offence shall be liable on conviction, where no special penalty is provided in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.
Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act also empowers the court to impose a disqualification “for such period as it thinks fit”. The district judge imposed a fine of $1,000, and a disqualification period of six months.
24        I was of the opinion that in comparison with the sentences imposed in other cases under r 29 of the Road Traffic Rules, the sentence meted out to the appellant in this case was not manifestly excessive. The Prosecution drew my attention to three such cases, the facts of which I do not think it necessary to reproduce in full here, save to observe that comparable sentences were imposed in cases where little or no damage had been caused. In this case, the appellant had caused considerable damage to government property. He had two previous antecedents, also for road traffic offences, which the district judge rightly took into account. In the circumstances, the appellant’s failure to slow the lorry down while negotiating a bend on a wet road surface, and the fact that he had not done this despite having sight of the stationary patrol car, with its flashing lights and warning cones, fully warranted the fine and the six-month disqualification period.
25        I therefore declined to disturb the sentence, and dismissed both appeals accordingly.

Choo Han Teck J:
1
         
 The accused is 40 years old and was employed as an orderly in the Supreme Court. He pleaded guilty to four charges under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The first charge (the “1st charge”) concerned the act of fellatio on him by an 11-year-old boy (referred hereafter as “the first complainant”) on 29 May 2003. The second charge (the “9th charge”) concerned the same act but involved a 12-year-old boy (referred hereafter as “the second complainant”). The third charge (the “12th charge”) concerned the act of sodomy in which the accused was the passive partner. The active partner was a 17-year-old (the “third complainant”). The fourth charge concerned the act of fellatio by the accused on the third complainant (the “13th charge”). The three complainants were known to the accused, and their respective families had maintained a close relationship with each other. In pleading guilty, the accused also agreed to have 12 other charges concerning the same complainants be taken into account for purposes of sentencing. Other than these offences, the accused has no antecedents.
2          His counsel, Mr Subhas Anandan, pleaded for leniency and prayed that the court would be compassionate to the accused. However, I am of the view that compassion ought to have as little to do as possible with the sentencing of an offender. A court that is swayed by compassion will also yield to indignation when the opportune case is before it. Such sentiments are obstructive and distracting when reason alone should determine the sentence. The duty of the court is to measure and evaluate all factors that are relevant, whether they are against or in favour of the accused, and then determine a fair and appropriate sentence as punishment in the circumstances of that case before it. I should also mention that the fact that the accused was once an exemplary employee in these courts does not entitle him to any special tenderness on my part in sentencing him. That is a neutral matter.
3          The relevant facts in this case are obvious from the charges and the statement of facts. All three complainants were young; two of them were aged 11 and 12 years old. The third was 17 years old. The tender ages of the first two complainants belie their personal history of sexual conduct. Although this is an indication that they were not entirely innocent minds, it also shows how a chain of corruption is formed by a single act of corruption; and that is what makes the corrupting influence reprehensible. I take cognisance of the fact that the accused might not be the first person to corrupt the two younger complainants. According to the first complainant, it was the third complainant who led him into this kind of activity.
4          The fact that the accused had not been previously charged has been taken into account although in cases where, as in this case, there are other charges that are being taken into account for purposes of sentencing, and those charges cover different occasions, then the fact that he had no antecedents is of lesser value in mitigation. It only meant that he had not previously been charged and not that he had hitherto not engaged in criminal activity.
5          The facts of this case are highly unusual, and quite distinctive. The absence of precedent cases involving the conviction of a sodomised person adds to the unusual circumstances of this case. In sentencing the accused, it is also important to determine the punishment by taking the totality of the sentences into account. I therefore sentenced the accused to:
(a)        three years’ imprisonment for the 1st charge,
(b)        three years’ imprisonment for the 9th charge,
(c)        nine months’ imprisonment for the 12th charge, and
(d)        nine months’ imprisonment for the 13th charge.
Sentences for the 1st and 9th charges are concurrent but consecutive to the 12th and 13th charges which are to be served concurrently, making a total of three years nine months for the offences.",2004-01-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1
         
 The accused is a 30-year-old driver with a logistics company. He was charged for committing four sexual offences. He pleaded guilty to the first and fourth charges. The second charge was withdrawn by the Prosecution, and the accused agreed to have the third charge taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.
2          The first charge was for sodomy on an 18-year-old youth on 7 April 2003 at 9.00am in the flat where the accused was staying. The fourth charge was for making the same youth perform fellatio on the accused on the same occasion that the first offence was committed.
3          The facts were straightforward. The youth was having breakfast in a coffee shop about 9.00am on 7 April 2003. The accused was at the same coffee shop and he beckoned the youth to his table. The youth went over and the accused offered him a job. He offered to pay the youth $23 for washing the aquariums in his flat. The youth agreed and immediately followed the accused to the flat. There the accused stripped himself and told the youth to do the same or he would be assaulted. The youth complied. Thereafter, the accused committed the offences against the youth. In terms of sequence, the offence of fellatio was committed first followed by the offence of sodomy. After the acts were done, the youth washed himself in the bathroom and left. He immediately lodged a police report against the accused.
4          The accused had a long record of traffic offences but no antecedent relevant to the present offences. In mitigation, Mr David Rasif pointed out that the two offences were committed on the same occasion, and secondly, in respect of the sodomy charge, the medical reports indicate that there was but the barest penetration, perhaps sufficient only to constitute the offence. It does appear to me that the medical reports indicated that there were no disturbance to the anal canal and the two superficial tears were in the “anal verge”.
5          I accept that s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) encompasses a wide range of culpability. It also distinguishes vastly different conduct as falling within its ambit, and I accept that sodomy marks the high end of the range. But within this aspect of the offences under s 377, there is a range of culpability. We do not merely distinguish between the culpability of fellatio and sodomy but also between the degrees of culpability under each of them. In my view, there were no special aggravating factors apart from the fact that the youth was of low intelligence. Almost every offence will have some degree of reprehensive behaviour on the part of the accused. Hence, there must be some significant features to treat the case as having aggravating factors. On the other hand, the negligible penetration must be a mitigating factor. But for the two superficial tears at the anal verge, the act might have only been an attempt to sodomise.
6          On the above facts, and taking the broad view as to the totality of punishment, I imposed a sentence of six years’ imprisonment for the first charge and nine months’ imprisonment for the fourth charge, to be served concurrently with the imprisonment under the first charge.",2004-01-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

The charges
 
1          The accused pleaded guilty before me to three charges as follows:
DAC 51523/03
You, Sharil Denny bin Shafee, M/61 yrs NRIC No: S1216139E, are charged that you on the 2
nd
 day of September 2003 at or about 12.30 am at Apt Blk 11 Chancery Lane #04-06, Singapore, did commit housebreaking by night, to wit by breaking into the said premises belonging to one Hergge Raphael, and used as a human dwelling, after 7.00 pm and before 7.00 am, in order to commit theft of:
Two Nokia 7650 handphones valued at about &700/- each;
One ""Maurice Lacroix"" watch valued at about $1200/-;
Cash - S$600/-
with a total value of $3200/- in the possession of the said Hergge Raphael, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
DAC 52527/03
You, Sharil Denny bin Shafee, M/61 yrs NRIC No: S1216139E, are charged that you between 13 August 2003 and 15 August 2003, at or about 12.45 am at Blk 11 Chancery Lane #03-06, Singapore, did commit housebreaking by night, to wit by breaking into the said premises belonging to one Liew Yoke Chin, and used as a human dwelling, after 7.00 pm and before 7.00 am, in order to commit theft of cash of $250/-, in the possession of Liew Yoke Chin, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
DAC 52530/03
You, Sharil Denny bin Shafee, M/61 yrs NRIC No: S1216139E, are charged that you between the 13
th
 day [of] August 2003 and the 15
th
  day of August 2003, at or about 12.40 am at No 11 Chancery Lane Chancery Park, #03-05, Singapore, did commit housebreaking by night, to wit by climbing over the victim's balcony railing and entered into the premises, belonging to one Malher Nathalie Francoise, and [used as] a place for human dwelling, after 7.00 pm and before 7.00 am, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 456 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2          The accused admitted the statement of facts without any qualification.  On two occasions, the accused managed to sneak into Chancery Park condominium just past midnight.  He climbed over the condominium compound's perimeter fencing at a location away from the security counter.  He then proceeded to make his way up the common staircase of Blk 11, and climbed onto the balcony of each of the condominium units ('the units') in question.  As the occupants of the units had left their balcony doors unsecured, the accused entered the units and helped himself to the items listed in the charges.  None of the property has been recovered.
Charges taken into consideration
3          Another five charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, with the consent of the accused.  Three other counts were for similar offences of housebreaking by night (s 456 Penal Code) involving other condominium units at Blk 11 Chancery Park.  There were also two counts of voluntarily assisting in the disposal of two handphones, which the accused knew to be stolen property (s 414 Penal Code).
Antecedents and mitigation
4          The accused's list of previous convictions was prolific.  The antecedent report (CRO 60) tendered by the prosecution ran into no less than 17 pages, with a total of 85 documented offences.  His first documented offence dates back to 1954, when he was sent to a juvenile home at the age of 13 for an offence of theft (s 379 Penal Code).  His most recent conviction was in 1995.
5          I do not propose to enumerate all his previous convictions.  It suffices to note that he had previously been sentenced to three terms of preventive detention for similar or related offences.  In 1974, he was sentenced to 6 years' preventive detention for three counts of housebreaking under s 457 of the Penal Code, with a staggering 40 similar or related offences taken into consideration.  He reoffended soon after.  In 1980, he was sentenced to 8 years' preventive detention for another three similar counts of housebreaking under s 457 of the Penal Code.  This time, there were 16 similar offences taken into consideration.
6          Apparently undeterred by two successive terms of preventive detention, he went on to commit other minor offences from 1988 to 1993.  He was given a brief respite by the courts then, when he received sentences ranging from a $300 fine to short imprisonment terms of 3 weeks and 2 months.  By 1995, he was back at his old ways.  He was sentenced to another 7 years' preventive detention for two counts of housebreaking under s 457 of the Penal Code, with three similar counts taken into consideration.  He managed to avoid the mandatory sentence of caning prescribed under s 458A for repeat offenders only because he was already above 50 years of age.
7          In mitigation, counsel candidly admitted that there was very little he could say for the accused.  He emphasised that the accused had pleaded guilty and was remorseful.  He had not raised any spurious defence nor had he wasted the court's time.  He was cooperative with police investigations.  He was unable to find any suitable jobs because of his criminal record.  He was married in 1991 but he had no children.  He committed the offences out of utter desperation.  He begged to be given a final chance.
Reasons for sentence
8          I acknowledged that the accused must have given his full cooperation to the police to assist in solving all eight cases.  This was not a situation where he had been caught red-handed and apprehended at the scene of crime.  To his credit, he had pleaded guilty at an early stage.
9          However, the accused had committed the present offences barely a year after his release from his third term of preventive detention.  While he may have expressed remorse, in all probability, this was merely intended to be self-serving.  His three previous terms of preventive detention apparently did not have much of a deterrent effect.  In my opinion, he was already too accustomed to a life of crime.  In all likelihood, he would reoffend in due course. 
10        Evidently, the accused was not going to be reformed or deterred by long-term sentences.  My primary focus was therefore to ensure that the sentence would serve the purpose of preventing further crime by incapacitating him for a sufficiently lengthy period.  With great respect, perhaps this ought to have been considered by the court back in 1995 when he was last sentenced.  Unfortunately, he was only given the minimum term of 7 years' preventive detention, despite having already served two previous terms of preventive detention.  In effect (at least in the mind of the accused), this may have extended to him a licence to reoffend at the ripe young age of 61.  I noted nonetheless that the prosecution did not think then that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
11        I did not call for a pre-sentence report to determine his suitability for preventive detention.  He had previously been found suitable for such a sentence in lieu of imprisonment, and had already undergone three such terms.  He appeared to me to be mentally and physically fit to undergo the sentence for a fourth time.  As the statement of facts reveals, he was still athletic enough to be able to scale the perimeter fencing to enter the condominium compound, and sure-footed and agile enough to find a means of access to the balconies of the respective condominium units.  In any event, there is no mandatory requirement for the court to obtain a pre-sentence report: see 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
; 
PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
.
12        I was minded to allow the accused a 'final chance' as he requested, but only to the extent of refraining from imposing the maximum term of 20 years' preventive detention.  With a term of 14 years' preventive detention, he will be 75 years old by the time he is eligible to be released.  Perhaps by then the stresses of age would have begun to take their toll on him, and may help to quell his criminal inclinations.
13        I understand that counsel did not act for the accused in filing a notice of appeal on 7 January 2004.  The accused is presently serving sentence.",2004-01-12 00:00:00,SG District Court

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing
  – 
Revision of proceedings
  – 
Petitioner pleaded guilty to charge of entering Singapore without valid pass as an Indian national
  – 
Whether conviction and sentence could be set aside on the ground that petitioner could produce Malaysian passports and certificate of citizenship to show that he was a Malaysian citizen.
 
 
1
         
 This is a petition by Abdul Munaf bin Mohd Ismail (“the petitioner”), who was charged and convicted in the District Court on his plea of guilt to a charge of committing an offence under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed), to set aside his conviction and sentence. The petitioner says that he is a 58-year-old Malaysian citizen. His wife who is 44 years old is in India, but his father-in-law, Dawood Hamardin, who deposed that he is 72 years old, is a Singapore citizen. He is a retired hawker.
 
2
         
 The petitioner was charged in District Arrest Case No 55723 of 2003 as Kathar Abdul Gafoor. He pleaded guilty to the charge under s 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act for entering Singapore without a valid pass. He admitted, without qualification, the facts set out in the Statement of Facts, which is a short four-paragraph statement, reproduced here for easy reference:
1
         
 The Accused, an Indian national, 40 years of age, was detained by Enforcement Officers from Field Ops 2 Branch (ICA) on 11.11.2003 at the vicinity of Blk 248 Simei Street 1, Hola Cafeteria, when he was suspected of being in possession of a photo-substituted Malaysian Restricted passport.
2
         
 Investigations revealed that the Accused wished to enter Singapore in order to seek employment. As he was unable to obtain a visa to enter Singapore directly on his own Indian passport, Accused through some prior arrangement, was to be given a false Malaysian Restricted Passport to enable him to enter Singapore. Accused accepted the arrangement to enter Singapore unlawfully by passing himself off as one Malaysian named ABDUL MUNAF BIN MOHD ISMAIL. Sometime in August 2002, whilst in Malaysia, a male Indian known to him as “RAMU” gave him a Malaysian Restricted Passport No J675185. The said “RAMU” also assured Accused that he would not have any problem entering Singapore as his photograph was affixed on the said Malaysian Restricted Passport.
3
         
 Further investigation revealed that the Accused on 30 October 2003, used the said Malaysia Restricted Passport to enter Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. The Immigration officer unaware that the Accused had produced to him a photo-substituted [Malaysian] travel document that did not belong to him, allowed the Accused to enter Singapore on a 14-day Visit Pass, which was not lawfully issued to him.
4
         
 The Accused, by passing himself off as the said ABDUL MUNAF BIN MOHD ISMAIL had obtained a Visit Pass, which was not lawfully issued to him. As he is unable to show that he was in possession of a Visit pass lawfully issued to him, he is deemed to have entered Singapore unlawfully in contravention of section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) punishable under section 6(3) of the said Act.
3
         
 The petitioner was consequently found guilty and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and fined $2,000. He paid the fine and had been serving his term of imprisonment from 12 November 2003 but was scheduled for release on 23 December 2003.
4
         
 The petitioner’s counsel, Mr Skandarajah, produced six old passports dating back to 22 April 1967. They were passports bearing the name of Abdul Munaf and the photographs in these passports show what appears to be the man before me, in the various stages of ageing. The Prosecution produced the seventh passport which was the one seized by the immigration officers when they arrested the petitioner. This passport was issued on 2 September 2002. The seven passports were issued by the Malaysian authorities. A Malaysian identity card with the name and photograph of Abdul Munaf was seized together with the seventh passport. The petitioner also produced a document which he said was his certificate of registration of citizenship in Malaysia. Mr David Chew, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, submitted that the investigating officer needed time to verify the thumbprint on the identity card and obtain verification from the Malaysian authorities that the petitioner was indeed Abdul Munaf. Counsel conceded that this procedure was likely to take time and by the time confirmation came through, the petitioner would already have served his term of imprisonment.
5
         
 The petitioner had admitted to the Statement of Facts and the charge and this must be weighed strongly against him. His explanation before me was that he was coerced into making the admission. If there was no coercion the petitioner’s story is, of course, less likely to be true, but this is not the forum to inquire into the conduct of the investigating or arresting officers given the urgency of the matter. If the petitioner is indeed innocent, he ought not to spend a minute longer in prison; the court in such circumstances is bound to see if there is other strong or reliable evidence that can be taken into account without having to inquire into the issue of coercion.
6
         
 In this case, the seven passports as well as the certificate of citizenship appear to me have to the look, the feel, and the smell of authenticity about each of them. The testimonies of the petitioner and his Singaporean father-in-law, Dawood Hamardin, the 72-year-old retired hawker, sufficiently impressed me that they were telling the truth. Furthermore, they, especially the father-in-law who appears mentally alert and sharp, know that by this application, the petitioner is staking three days of imprisonment against a much longer sentence should they perjure themselves before me.
7
         
 On the evidence, I am satisfied that the petitioner before me is probably Abdul Munaf and not Kathar Abdul Gafoor. Given the circumstances, there was insufficient time or opportunity for counsel to address me as to whether the burden of proof on the petitioner in a criminal revision is that of a balance of probabilities or merely the raising of a reasonable doubt. The court in 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
 appears to have applied the balance of probabilities test, but it was a remark made in passing. In the present case before me, the petitioner was able to satisfy me on the higher test and so the issue of which is the applicable test need not be argued and considered.
8
         
 For the reasons above, I set aside the conviction and sentence of the petitioner who was convicted in the name of Kathar Abdul Gafoor.",2004-01-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

Offence of unauthorised consumption of norketamine under s 8(b)(i) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)
 
1                      The accused pleaded guilty before me on 10 December 2003, to one charge under s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (‘MDA’)(Cap 185), of unlawful consumption of norketamine.  A second charge under s 8(a) of the MDA, of unlawful possession of ketamine, was taken into consideration in sentencing.  The accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment.  She filed an appeal against her sentence on 17 December 2003.
The facts
2                      The statement of facts admitted by the accused revealed that she was arrested for suspected drug consumption at Zouk Disco at about 2 am on 28 June 2003.  She had been spotted by a party of police officers on duty in the vicinity, who had noticed her slurred speech & blood-shot eyes.  After her arrest, urine samples were taken from her which were later certified to contain norketamine.  Norketamine is a Class B controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act.
3                      As to the second charge taken into consideration, this related to a packet of 0.28 grams of powdery substance found on the accused, which was later certified to contain ketamine.  Ketamine is a Class B controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.
The mitigation plea
4                      The accused has no antecedents.  In mitigation, her counsel said that the packet of drugs had been given to the accused by an acquaintance who had urged her to consume some of the drugs.  She had consumed some of the drugs “due to the influence of alcohol and the urgings [of her acquaintance] and curiosity”.  She “did not notice any effects after consuming the powder” but then decided to hide the packet of remaining white powder in her brassiere as she was “suspicious of the nature of its contents”.  She subsequently went to Zouk Disco with some friends and was arrested after visiting the washroom in a neighbouring hotel.
5                      Counsel also stated that the accused’s family was in a poor financial situation and needed the accused to contribute to the family finances.   Her parents were also said to be unwell as her father suffered from hyperlipidaemia and hypertension while her mother had high blood pressure.  It was submitted that a long custodial sentence would “have a severe impact on [the accused’s] family finances” and be “a terrible blow to her father” whose heart condition might be affected.
6                      Counsel also tendered a letter from the accused’s former employer attesting to her “good negotiation skills” and “positive attitude”, as well as letters from the accused’s brother and sister pleading for “a chance” on her behalf.
The sentence
7                      In sentencing the accused, I took note of the punishment prescribed (maximum 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to $20,000 or both).  I also took note of the severity with which drug offences – including unlawful drug consumption – are generally dealt with in our courts.  This is because of the havoc which may be wreaked on society by the proliferation of various illegal drugs.  As the High Court has held in 
Chua Poh Kiat v
 PP 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
:
… a strong message needs to be sent to the public that our courts take such drug offences very seriously, especially in light of the fact that these forms of drug consumption and trafficking (for example in ecstasy and other ‘designer drugs’) are on the rise among today’s youth.
8                      In respect of ketamine, the Senior District Judge has noted in 
PP v Hong Hong Jia; PP v Chu Kiew Wen
 (DAC 10069/2000 & Ors.) that ketamine “is a designer drug and… is regularly used at night clubs and parties”.  Failure to deal sternly with unlawful ketamine consumption “will permit ketamine to proliferate in Singapore’s night spots and… seriously damage Singapore’s reputation as a ‘zero drug tolerance’ society.”
9                      In respect of first offenders, therefore, sentences for the offences of consumption and possession of ketamine tend to range between 10 to 16 months’ imprisonment per charge: see paragraph 17 of the Senior District Judge’s judgment in 
PP v Hong Hong Jia; PP v Chu Kiew Wen
.
10                    In the present case, I took into account the accused’s first-offender status and the fact that she had pleaded guilty.  I also noted, however, that a second charge involving an equally serious offence of possessing ketamine was being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing; and as pointed out by the High Court in 
PP v Mok Ping
 Wuen 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
, the “effect of taking into consideration outstanding offences is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be awarded”.  As this possession offence was apparently committed on the same occasion as the consumption offence, I was of the view that the accused’s sentence should be enhanced by only a small degree.
11                    As to the hardship which the accused’s incarceration might cause her family, whilst this was regrettable, it was not a valid mitigating factor: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
.  It cannot be open to offenders to claim that the unhappiness caused to their families by their own wrongdoing and subsequent incarceration is a factor by which they merit more lenient treatment: to accept such an argument would make a mockery of the sentencing process.
12                    Having taken into account the factors outlined above, I decided that a term of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate; and I sentenced the accused accordingly.
13                    The accused has not applied for any bail pending the hearing of her appeal.

District Judge See Kee Oon:
The charge
1        On 5 December 2003, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the following charge (DAC 52174/03):
You, Dorai Antoine, M/48 yrs, NRIC No: S1197824Z, are charged that you, on the 19
th
 day of October 2003, at or about 9.25 pm, at No. 1 Kim Seng Promenade, Great World City, Cold Storage Supermarket, Singapore, a building used for the custody of property, did commit theft of one bottle of ""Woodbridge"" valued S$22.05/-, in the possession of one Mr Joseph, the Manager of the aforesaid store, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2          The accused admitted the statement of facts without qualification.  The facts were simple and straightforward.  He was detained for shoplifting the bottle of ""Woodbridge"" wine by the supermarket's security officer.  Upon being brought to the store manager's office, he admitted that he had stolen the bottle, which he had placed in a 'Cold Storage' plastic bag before leaving the store. 
The additional charge in MAC 8175/2003
3
         
 Apart from DAC 52174/03, the accused also faced a second charge in MAC 8175/03 ('the MAC charge') of using threatening words towards a public servant, an offence under s 13D(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184).
 
 Initially, he had indicated his intention to claim trial to this charge.
 
 As such, I proceeded to record his plea only in relation to DAC 52174/03, and adjourned the MAC charge for a pre-trial conference on 29 December 2003.
4          Upon perusing his record of previous convictions (which I shall elaborate on in due course), I decided that it would be appropriate to obtain a pre-sentence report to consider his suitability for corrective training or preventive detention.  Sentencing was therefore adjourned to 26 December 2003 pending the completion of the pre-sentence report.  On 26 December 2003, the prosecution offered to allow the MAC charge to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  The accused agreed, and duly admitted to the charge and consented for it to be taken into consideration.
Antecedents and mitigation
5          The accused admitted to a lengthy list of 32 previous convictions.  These involved a range of offences, the bulk of which fall broadly within four main categories: first, public order offences under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) and the Penal Code (Cap 224); second, sex offences under the Penal Code (Cap 224); third, property-related offences under the Penal Code (Cap 224); and finally, offences under the Destitute Persons Act (Cap 78).    
6          Including his maiden conviction in March 1980, the accused has been convicted six times for drunkenness in a public place, an offence under s 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) (previously s 22 of the 1970 Edition (Cap 102)).  He has also been convicted three times for disorderly behaviour, an offence under the present s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) (previously s 24 of the 1970 Edition (Cap 102) and s 23 of the 1985 Revised Edition (Cap 184)).
7          As for related 'public order' offences under the Penal Code, the accused has three previous convictions of voluntarily causing hurt (s 323 Penal Code) and one conviction of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from performing his duty (s 332 Penal Code). 
8          Among the second category (sex offences), the accused has numerous previous convictions.  He has five previous convictions of outraging modesty (s 354 Penal Code), for offences committed between 1982 to 1997.  The sentences ranged from a fine of $400 to imprisonment of 12 months.  He had never been caned for any of these offences despite his persistence in offending.  In 1996, he was also convicted on one count of having carnal intercourse against the order of nature (s 377).  He was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. 
9          In more recent years, the accused has taken to repeatedly doing obscene acts in public places (s 294(a) Penal Code).  His last four convictions from November 2000 to May 2001 were all for such offences.  For each charge, he was sentenced to the maximum punishment of 3 months' imprisonment.  All told, the accused has been previously convicted ten times for sex offences.
10        I turn next to the third category of offences.  For property-related offences under the Penal Code, the accused has two previous convictions for house trespass (s 448 Penal Code) and one for house trespass in order to commit an offence (s 451 Penal Code). 
11        Finally, in respect of the last category of offences, the accused has six previous convictions under s 16(c) of the Destitute Persons Act (Cap 78).  The offences were committed over a period of five years, from 1990 to 1994.  He had either left a welfare home without permission or had failed to return to the home after expiry of leave.   
12        In mitigation, the accused informed me that this was the first time he had been convicted of a theft offence.  He hoped to see his aged parents, and pleaded for a lenient sentence.  He also requested that his sentence be backdated to the date of remand.
13        I was of the view that the only worthwhile point standing in the accused's favour was the fact that for two years after his release from prison in 2001, he had not been arrested for any other offence until the present offences came to light.  He had also apparently managed to secure some form of full-time employment.  There was no mitigating value in his plea of guilt.  It was inevitable since he was caught red-handed and had admitted to stealing.
Reasons for sentence
14        Despite being an inveterate recidivist, the longest term of imprisonment the accused has served is only 15 months, for the s 377 Penal Code offence in 1996.  I found it odd that he was not apparently considered at any prior point for corrective training or preventive detention.   He was eminently qualified for both sentences.
15        Even without any prompting from the prosecution, I would have considered corrective training or preventive detention as sentencing options.  As rightly pointed out by the APP, the accused had apparently not learnt much from his frequent spells in prison.
16        I was mindful that there is no notional 'age ceiling' for offenders who may be considered for corrective training: see 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
.  As was the case in 
Kua Hoon Chua
, the prisons medical officer and psychologist had examined the accused and certified him to be physically and mentally fit to undergo corrective training or preventive detention.  Perhaps the accused, at 48 years of age, was within the 'upper age' range of offenders to undergo corrective training.  Nevertheless, I did not think this meant that corrective training was entirely inappropriate.
The pre-sentence report
i.          The psychologist's findings
17        In the pre-sentence report ('the CT report'), the prisons psychologist had assessed the accused’s general risk of recidivism as being in the 'medium to high risk' category, with a 54% chance of recidivism within a year or release.  In my view, this assessment was very consistent with his pattern of offending.  There were also other very pertinent observations made by the psychologist, which I shall proceed to set out below.
18        The psychologist noted (at Part Four, page 2 of the CT report) that the accused 'showed a low level of personal accountability for his criminal conduct' across offence types.  For example, he had 'strong and unfounded denial' over his repeated commission of the sex offences, claiming that he had been 'framed' by his victims.  He was also noted to be 'not forthcoming, particularly regarding his offending behaviours' (see Part Five, page 2 of the CT report).
19        By his qualifications and denials, the accused had demonstrated 'strong levels of denial of high criminal conduct', thus accentuating his risk of reoffending (see Part Seven, page 3 of the CT report).  According to the psychologist, this reflected poor motivation to exercise restraint or to seek help for these areas.  There were few protective factors.  While he had received support from his brother, this was of limited use in view of his chronic alcohol dependence, which had apparently re-emerged. 
ii.         Attempts to qualify the plea of guilt
20        The accused reportedly informed the psychologist that he was intoxicated at the time of the offence (see Part Two, page 1 of the CT report).  This was never mentioned when I recorded his plea of guilt on 5 December 2003.  According to the psychologist, 'he also claimed that he did not know what was going on but also reported needing more alcohol to drink then, thus making it likely that his intent to steal was present'.  I concurred completely with this assessment.  
21        The accused's claim that he was intoxicated was highly dubious.  He had not qualified his plea of guilt in any way when I recorded his plea on 5 December 2003.  The plea was unambiguously voluntary and unequivocal.  He even had the presence of mind to maintain that he would claim trial to the MAC charge.  He could easily have also informed me hat he did not possess the necessary 
mens rea
 for the offence of theft.  In all probability, he had made the claims at the eleventh hour before the psychologist only because he realised that he could be facing long-term incarceration of at least five years.
22        In any event, even accepting what the accused had claimed, he would still have committed an offence of theft.  If he had indeed been intoxicated, this could only have been self-induced.  Moreover, he was obviously not intoxicated to such an extent as to render him temporarily insane.  After all, by his own account, he committed the offence because he needed to get more alcohol to drink.  This was totally at variance with his claim that he did not know what was going on when he committed the offence.
23        Indeed, when one scrutinises the accused's own explanations alongside the objective facts, as the psychologist did, the ineluctable inference was that the accused was fully conscious of what he was doing and had every intention to steal.  I had no doubt that the offence was deliberate.  In all likelihood, it was premeditated: there was no other reason why he would have concealed the bottle taken from a 'Cold Storage' supermarket shelf with a 'Cold Storage' plastic bag, other than to facilitate his planned commission of the theft.
24        There are strict preconditions laid down in s 85 of the Penal Code for the defence of intoxication to apply.  The accused was not able to avail himself of such a defence.  In this regard, the observations of the Honourable the Chief Justice in 
Balasubramaniam Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 314
 are pertinent.  All the accused had raised was a bare assertion that he was intoxicated, unsupported by any other evidence. 
25        On 26 December 2003, I afforded the accused a further opportunity to mitigate before I passed sentence.  This time, he maintained that he had merely forgotten to pay for the item and he was absent-minded.  There was no further mention of intoxication.  I found no mitigating value whatsoever in his suggestion that he had forgotten to pay for the item.  This was but another barefaced attempt to qualify his plea of guilt.  He was obviously still harbouring hopes that I might feel compelled to reject his plea.
26        The accused may have been unrepresented, but there is no principle that pleas of guilt by unrepresented persons should be more easily vitiated: see 
Packir Malim v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 429
.  He was a seasoned campaigner when it came to court proceedings.  I was confident that if his claims were genuine, he would not have hesitated to raise them immediately at the outset, just as he had sought to challenge the MAC charge initially.
27        In the final analysis, there was absolutely no basis to set aside his earlier valid plea of guilt.  At any rate, his subsequent efforts to qualify his plea were clearly calculated to suit his own objectives.  They were an abuse of the court's process.  It was telling that he brought up his claims of intoxication and forgetfulness only after I had determined that he was a potential candidate for corrective training or preventive detention. 
Conclusion
28        The psychologist had noted in his concluding remarks at Part Eight (page 3 of the CT report) that the accused had 'poor levels of accountability for his criminal conduct, was not forthcoming and was poorly motivated to receive treatment for his behaviours'.  The accused had apparently also professed to harbour suicidal thoughts in the event that he was sentenced to corrective training or preventive detention.  As such, the psychologist recommended close supervision upon sentencing to manage any such suicide risks.
29        The psychologist had acted prudently and responsibly in proposing close supervision for the accused's suicide risks.  Nonetheless, I felt that it was also highly possible that the accused had pointedly expressed such thoughts in a self-serving effort to avoid a long-term sentence.  His belated attempts to qualify his plea of guilt were equally self-serving.  These attempts confirmed his inability or unwillingness to come to terms with the consequences of his crimes.  They also revealed that he was not averse to manipulative conduct when it suited his purpose.
30        The CT report I had obtained in the present case was useful in shedding light on the accused's criminal proclivities as well as his general character.  He was patently unremorseful as he would not accept responsibility for his own actions.  His 'strong and unfounded denial' over his previous convictions was a particular cause for concern.
31        The accused had pointed out that this was his first theft offence.  In all fairness, the accused had not yet displayed a marked penchant for property-related offences.  Nevertheless, I was not inclined to wait for such tendencies to manifest themselves.  His wide-ranging criminal record and the assessment in the CT report were sufficient to convince me beyond doubt that long-term incarceration was necessary in the public interest. 
32        In my view, the risk that the accused would reoffend was high.  Thus, I sentenced him to six years' corrective training.  I would hasten to add that a term of preventive detention would not have been inappropriate either.  I understand that the accused filed a notice of appeal on 3 January 2004.  He is presently serving sentence.",2004-01-09 00:00:00,SG District Court
