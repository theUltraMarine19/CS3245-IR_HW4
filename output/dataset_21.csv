Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against an order of the district judge confiscating a sum under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A) (DTA).
 Brief facts
The respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of two charges of trafficking in a controlled drug contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (MDA) and one charge of consumption contrary to s 8(b) MDA. Following his conviction, the prosecution made an application under s 4 of the DTA for the confiscation of benefits derived by him from drug trafficking. The respondent did not oppose this.
In support of the application, a financial statement prepared by an officer of the Financial Investigation Division of the Central Narcotics Bureau was tendered by the prosecution pursuant to s 6, DTA, and was accepted by the respondent. The calculations were as follows. First, the net worth of the respondent on 10 February 1996, the date of his arrest, was ascertained to be $32,719.08. In contrast, his net worth on 1 October 1995, when he first started trafficking, was only $13,455.49. Thus the change in net worth was $19,263.59. Various sums spent by the respondent, including the downpayment, rent, and cooking utensils for a coffeeshop food stall run by his niece, were discovered to total some $29,736. The wealth accumulated by the respondent was thus the sum of his expenditure together with his change in net worth, and came to $48,999.59. His known sources of income throughout that period only totalled about $5,081.49. The difference between his accumulated wealth and his known income came to $43,918.10. The prosecution contended that this amount represented the benefits derived by the respondent from drug trafficking. It was further found that the realisable assets in the hands of the respondent came to about $31,944.11.
Below, the prosecution argued that, because there was a shortfall in the amount realisable compared to the amount derived from drug trafficking, there was a default in payment of the amount to be confiscated, requiring a further term of imprisonment to be imposed under the DTA.
 The decision
The district judge held the confiscation order would have to be in terms of the realisable amount and that was only $31,944.11. In his view, the object of the Act is not to punish convicted persons who for valid reasons do not have assets equal in value to the benefits derived by them from drug trafficking. Section 7(3) DTA recognises that an accused may have a shortfall in the value of the assets which would not be available for confiscation. The judge relied on an English case, 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 562, which interpreted provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (UK) in pari materia with s 7 of the DTA.
 The appeal
The prosecution appeals, arguing in court that the confiscation order is not necessarily limited to the value of the actual assets known to be in the possession of the defendant in an application. It was pointed out that the definitions of `realisable property` and `the amount that might be realised` in the Act included gifts to third parties. 
 R v Horst Reiner Ilsemann 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 398, 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) and 
 R v Carroll 
 [1991] Crim LR 720 were cited. The only relevant local decision, 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
(OS 1064/94) (unreported) was also referred to by the prosecution. The prosecution further contended that what is confiscateable is not property derived from drug trafficking, but the value of the benefits however they might be represented: 
 David Dickens 
 (1990) 91 Cr App R 164 cited. Applying that proposition, the prosecution contended that the gift of money made to the respondent`s niece of about $24,000, which was used to set up the food stall, should be caught as well. It is said that the trial judge erred because he had limited the amount to be confiscated to the amount actually held by the respondent, and that he had placed the burden of proof wrongly: 
 Ilsemann 
, 
 Comiskey 
, 
 Carroll 
, and 
 R v Johnson 
 
[1991] 2 QB 249
 cited.
The respondent maintains that the district judge was correct in his decision. The submitted arguments of his counsel were directed, through no fault of theirs, to the contentions made by the prosecution below. It was said that all the assets that could have been seized had been seized. In the alternative, the court was informed that the respondent`s family would be willing to pay up any difference, should the decision go against the respondent.
 The issues
The DTA has not as yet received full consideration by the courts save for the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J in 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
. It is necessary then for this court to lay down, as guidance for the subordinate courts, the procedure to be used in determining confiscation of benefits, and the principles to be weighed in deciding whether any and what amount should in fact be confiscated. Following that, the correctness of the decision of the trial judge will be examined.
 The procedure
The starting point for confiscation is s 4(1), which reads: 
 
... where a defendant is convicted of one or more drug trafficking offences, the court shall, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, make a confiscation order against the defendant in respect of benefits derived by him from drug trafficking if the court is satisfied that such benefits have been so derived.
 
 
 
The court is thus obliged to exercise the power to confiscate the benefits derived from drug trafficking upon an application by the Public Prosecutor, but this is subject to the condition precedent that the defendant has in fact obtained benefits from drug trafficking. In determining whether the defendant has in fact obtained any benefits, the court applies a presumption, under s 4(4), that a person who holds any property or any interest therein which is disproportionate to his known sources of income which cannot be explained, has derived benefits from drug trafficking. If the court is satisfied that benefits have been derived from drug trafficking, it shall determine the amount to be confiscated: s 4(2). Such an order for confiscation should be made before the defendant is actually sentenced.
The benefits derived from drug trafficking are assessed by the court in accordance with s 5(1): 
 
... for the purposes of this Act -
 
 
 
 
(a) the benefits derived by any person from drug trafficking shall be any property or interest therein held by the person at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, being property or interest disproportionate to his known sources of income and the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the court; and 
 
(b) the value of the benefits derived by him from drug trafficking shall be the aggregate of the values of the properties and interests therein referred to in paragraph (a).
  
 
 
Section 5(1) operates as a presumption - it is for the defendant to show that his property was derived from innocent sources. The quantification of the concealed income may be made by taking the sum of the assets of the defendant together with his expenditure less the sum of his liabilities and legitimate income.
In this appeal, the prosecution put forward that the benefits derived from drug trafficking totalled some $43,918.10. This was correctly obtained by determining what was termed the respondent`s concealed income, which was property or interest therein which was disproportionate to the known sources of the respondent`s income, and which they contend he could not explain satisfactorily.
In assessing such benefits, the court may have the assistance of statements tendered by the prosecution under s 6(1). If the defendant accepts such a statement or any part of that statement, the court is entitled to treat the statement as conclusive. The court is also entitled to require the defendant to indicate any disagreement that he may have, and what he will rely upon to support such disagreement.
The court having assessed the benefits derived would then be in a position to determine the amount to be confiscated under s 7. Section 7(1) reads: 
 
Subject to subsection (3), the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
It is possible that an amount different from the benefits derived will be recovered, for s 7(1) is expressed to be subject to s 7(3), which reads: 
 
If the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking, the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised.
 
 
 
In determining what the realisable amount is, the court will have to consider the value of the realisable property. Section 8(2) reads: 
 
For the purposes of sections 6 and 7, the amount that might be realised at the time a confiscation order is made against the defendant shall be -
 
 
 
 
(a) the total of the values at that time of all the realisable property held by the defendant; less 
 
(b) where there are obligations having priority at that time, the total amounts payable in pursuance of such obligations,
  
 
 
together with the total of the values at that time of all gifts caught by this Act.
 
 
 
Realisable property is defined by s 8(1), as covering both property held by the defendant as well as gifts made by him. It is significant that s 8(2) speaks of the value of the realisable property rather than the realisable property - this indicates that the realisation need not operate on a particular piece of property (
 R v David Dickens 
 (1990) 91 Cr App R 164, 172). Under s 6(4) the defendant may tender a statement indicating the amount that may be realised, and the prosecution may accept such a statement from the defence. The burden lies upon the defence to show what the realisable amount is. Section 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) provides that: 
 
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.
 
 
 
Here, it is the defendant who would desire the court to believe that the realisable amount is some other amount other than the value of the benefits derived. The position in England is similar (
 R v Horst Reiner Ilsemann 
, at p 403). The standard of proof required is proof on the balance of probabilities (s 46, DTA).
Where the court is satisfied that the realisable amount is less than the value of the benefits, it is obliged under s 7(2) to issue a certificate to that effect. As a matter of course, such a certificate should be issued by the court upon its decision. In contrast, if the realisable amount is larger than the benefits derived, the application of either the Public Prosecutor or a receiver appointed under the Act is required before a certificate to that effect is issued: s 7(4). That larger amount may be substituted into the confiscation order.
Thus the court would have to perform the following calculation: 
(a) benefits derived = unexplained property or interest 
(b) realisable amount = (value of realisable property - obligations) + value of gifts.
The confiscation order will prima facie be for the value in (a), but the realisable amount may be less than the amount of the benefits, and in such a situation, the confiscation order would be for the realisable amount only, rather than the value of the benefits derived from drug trafficking.
That this should be the correct approach is seen in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
 David Dickens 
, interpreting the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (DTOA). The DTOA is the legislative model for our own DTA: 
 
The provisions of this Bill are based largely on the United Kingdom Drug Trafficking Offences Act with modifications to suit local circumstances. [Minister for Home Affairs, (1992) 59 Parliamentary Debates 1375.]
 
 
 
The DTOA has been amended several times, and its provisions as well as those in, inter alia, the Criminal Justice Act 1993, are now found in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.
In 
 Dickens 
, Lord Lane CJ, delivering the judgment of the court said at p 167: 
 
The sequence of the events as appears from the Act is as follows.
 
 
 
 
(1) ... If it is a case where the defendant may have benefited from drug trafficking, sentence must be postponed until after the necessary inquiries and determinations have been made. These are threefold: (a) whether he has benefited from drug trafficking ...; (b) the extent to which he has benefited ...; and (c) the amount the defendant shall be ordered to pay ... (2) The court determines ... the amount which represents the benefit he has received from drug trafficking. (3) The court determines the amount that the defendant shall be ordered to pay in accordance with s 4 of the Act [the equivalent of s 7 DTA].
  
 
 
Lord Lane then dealt with the assessment of the benefits, and said at p 169: 
 
The judge then hears the evidence on either side and reaches his conclusion (1) as to whether the defendant has successfully rebutted any provisional assumptions ...; (2) as to the existence of any benefit from drug trafficking; and (3) as to the value of such benefit.
 
 
 
That is however not the end of the matter. Section 4 provides that: 
 
` 
(1) Subject to subsection (3), below, the amount to be recovered in the defendant`s case under the confiscation order shall be the amount the Crown Court assesses to be the value of the defendant`s proceeds of drug trafficking ... (3) If the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than the amount the court assesses to be the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking, the amount to be recovered in the defendant`s case under the confiscation order shall be the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised.`
 
 
 
Thus, although the two exercises may overlap, where it is satisfied that the amount that might be realised is less than the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking, the court has then to carry out a further exercise to determine what the `amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised` is. If that amount is less than the proceeds of drug trafficking as found, the confiscation order will be for such lower sum.
 
 
 
The same should apply to the DTA, and in this regard, the district judge, with respect, was broadly correct in his approach. He referred for support to the case of 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 562. Tucker J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that the equivalent provisions of s 8(1) and (3) indicated that: 
 
what the court has to have regard to in determining the amount of the order is the actual property held by the defendant or by a person to whom he has given it [p 568].
 
 
 
However, it should be noted that in the case of 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
 (OS 1064/94) (unreported), Kan Ting Chiu J said in the course of his grounds: 
 
... it is useful to understand what a confiscation order covers, and how the benefits are to be confiscated. When a court decides whether to make a confiscation order under s 4, it does not identify the property to be confiscated. Instead it sets out to `determine in accordance with s 7 the amount to be recovered` (s 4(2)).
 
 
 
In this determination, the court is assisted by the presumption in s 4(4) ...
The amount to be recovered is the amount which represents the benefits derived from drug trafficking. It does not relate to specific assets, eg proceeds from the sale of drugs or property bought with the money. Neither does it necessarily reflect the value of the property that the defendant has, as sub-s (4) covers property he holds or has held at any time. If a defendant cannot explain an excess of property of $1m over his known sources of income, a confiscation order for $1m will be made even if the total value of his property is only $100,000 when the order is made.
A few points have to be made about this statement by Kan Ting Chiu J. It is true that the amount to be recovered need not relate to specific assets, since the courts are concerned with only the money value of the benefits. It is also true that s 4(4) imports a presumption that assets disproportionate to known sources of income are derived from drug trafficking, and that expenditure is first met from such benefits as well. However, with respect, s 4(4) is only a presumption concerning whether benefits have been derived, and not the quantification of the benefits. It states that 
 a person who holds ... any property ... which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the court ... shall be presumed to have derived benefits from drug trafficking. 
 The presence of the proviso to s 4(4) strengthens this interpretation. It states: 
 
Provided that any expenditure by such person (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been met out of his benefits derived from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
It is a circular proviso, assuming as it does the existence of derived benefits, but its effect is clear: it is presumed that any expenditure met by the defendant comes from money consisting of benefits of drug trafficking. It assists in the determination of whether the holding of a particular piece of property can be explained satisfactorily: in the absence of proof that the expenditure arose out of lawful income, the property acquired by that expenditure would be regarded as not being explained satisfactorily, which thus leads to the conclusion that benefits have been derived from trafficking.
It would also be strange for s 4(4) to be a presumption of quantification of benefits since it is s 5(1) which deals with the assessment of benefits derived. Indeed, the whole of s 4 is concerned rather with the precondition of a confiscation order - that is that benefits have been derived from drug trafficking.
Further support for this approach is derived from s 24 of the Act. Sections 4(4) and 5 do not apply to s 24, which deals with the position of a deceased defendant. Instead, there are ss 24(4)(a), (b) and (c). It is noteworthy that s 24(4)(a) is a presumption of derivation of benefits, corresponding closely to s 4(4). On the other hand, ss 24(b) and (c) correspond to s 5. The arrangement of the subsections of s 24 indicate that a clear line is drawn between ascertaining, firstly, whether benefits have in fact been derived, and the quantification of such benefits. Given the correspondence between s 24 on the one hand, and ss 4 and 5 on the other, it follows that ss 4 and 5 each serve different functions.
The approach in Singapore contrasts with that in England under the DTOA. In the English equivalent of s 5 DTA, s 2 DTOA, various assumptions are listed, which apply to the process of quantification unless rebutted by the defendant. These assumptions serve a different purpose from the presumptions contained in s 4(4).
The quantification of the amount to be recovered is governed by s 7. It follows then that, with respect, it is incorrect to say that: 
 
If a defendant cannot explain an excess of property of $1m over his known sources of income, a confiscation order for $1m will be made even if the total value of his property is only $100,000 when the order is made.
 
 
 
The true position is that if a defendant has property worth $1m that cannot be explained, under s 4(4) he is presumed to have derived benefits from drug trafficking. It is under s 5(1) that such property is considered to be benefits derived from drug trafficking: the benefits derived would be $1m. That would prima facie be the amount ordered to be confiscated: s 7(1). But this quantification is subject to the determination of what the realisable amount is: s 7(3). The realisable amount is determined to be the value of the realisable property held by him at the time of the order - that is $100,000 plus any gifts made and caught by the Act - less obligations having priority. In short, a confiscation order may well be made for the $100,000 only, if there are no gifts that are impugned. It is to be noted that such an order for the value of $100,000 would be made even if the actual property worth $100,000 that was derived from drug trafficking were no longer in the defendants` hands; it is sufficient that there is some property, however innocent, worth that amount.
 Application to the facts
The trial judge accepted that this was a situation in which a confiscation order had to be made. The statement tendered by the prosecution, and accepted by the defence, clearly indicated that the benefits derived from trafficking totalled some $43,918.10. No evidence or statement was adduced by the respondent to show that the realisable property was less than the benefits derived. In the court below, the prosecution apparently contended that the court had to order the confiscation of the full amount of the benefits derived, which accords with the 
 Goh Joon Tong 
 approach, though that case was not cited. For the reasons given, this contention could not be accepted.
In view of that lower amount, as disclosed in the prosecution`s own statement, the district judge held that s 7(3) applied - that is the realisable amount was less than the benefits derived. Thus, the amount ordered to be confiscated had to be restricted to the realisable amount.
There was an error in the quantification by the trial judge of the realisable amount. The prosecution`s financial statement listed the known realisable assets of the respondent as totalling $31,944.11. This the judge took to be the realisable amount. However, as noted in the discussion above, what may be confiscated consists of the value of the realisable property, which is the property held by the respondent and the value of any impugned gifts, less obligations having priority. Thus the realisable amount consists of the total assets of the respondent, that is the sum of $32,000 odd, together with gifts made and caught under the Act.
Here, the respondent had made a gift to his niece of the downpayment, rent and equipment for a food stall. Section 8(8) defines what gifts are caught by the Act: 
 
A gift ... is caught by this Act if -
 
 
 
 
(a) it was made by the defendant at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years ending when the proceedings for a drug trafficking offence were instituted against him ...; or 
 
(b) it was made by the defendant at any time and was a gift of property which is or is part of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking. (1)[gt ]The gift to the niece was made within the six year period specified in s 8(8)(a). It was then for her to challenge, if she desired and was able to, an order affecting any interest that she may have in the property (s 9). That was not done here, though it is still open to her to do so after the confiscation order is made (s 9(3)).
  
 
 
The realisable assets should have taken into account the gift made by the respondent to his niece. That gift consisted of the initial deposit, payment of rent, and the purchase of cooking utensils, amongst others. The total amount was some $24,000. Under s 8(2), the amount that is realisable consists of the value at the time of the making of the order of all the realisable property held by the defendant. The realisable property held by the defendant consisted, according to s 8(1), of the property held by him and any property held by a person to whom the defendant had made a gift caught by the Act. It is not necessary that such property remain in the hands of either the defendant or the recipient if it is an impugned gift from him. All that is required is that at some point it was in fact held by either, and that the proceeds of such property or gift remains with either. This approach is in accord with that in 
 Dickens 
, where the court had to deal with a gift of a car to the wife of the defendant, which car was subsequently sold to an innocent third party. The court held that the value of the car ought still to be taken into account, notwithstanding that the vehicle had been disposed of. This should be interpreted as catching the money obtained from the sale of the car: see 
 Mitchell, Hinton and Taylor on Confiscation 
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 1992), [para ] 5.100.
The equipment given to the niece was undoubtedly property held by the niece. The downpayment and the rent though were not clearly caught as property. But assistance is derived from s 2 of the DTA, where the term `property` is defined as: 
 
... money, and all other property, movable or immovable, including things in action and other intangible or incorporeal property.
 
 
 
The downpayment and rent conferred upon the niece contractual rights against the owner of the coffeshop where her stall was located. These rights were in fact what was really given to the niece. Such contractual rights were things in action, and hence, property for the purposes of the DTA.
The full sum of the gift to the niece would thus be caught. The value of such realisable property then has to be taken into account. On the facts of this case, the realisable property consisted of the assets actually held by the respondent plus the gift made to his niece, and these totalled some $55,944.11. That was larger than the benefits derived from drug trafficking.
Under s 7(4), where an application is made by the Public Prosecutor or a receiver appointed under the DTA, the court may certify the larger amount, and under s 7(6), the Public Prosecutor may in fact apply for a variation in the amount to be confiscated or in the default sentence. However, no such application has been made here thus far, and this court will not go into the question whether such a variation should be made.
Section 10 requires a default sentence to be imposed. That section reads: 
 
 
(1) ... where a court orders the defendant to pay any amount under section 4, section 224 of the Criminal Procedure Code shall have effect as if - 
 
(a) that amount were a fine imposed on him by the court; and 
 
(b) the term for which the court directs the defendant to be imprisoned in default of payment of any amount under section 4 shall be as follows: ... 
 
(ii) if the amount exceeds $20,000 but does not exceed $50,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years. 
 
...
  
 
 
 
(3) A District Court may, notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, impose the maximum term of imprisonment on the defendant in default of the payment of any amount ordered to be paid under section 4. 
 
...
  
 
 
 
 Conclusion
 
The confiscation order should have been made for the amount applied for by the prosecution, or $43,918.10. As the amount falls within s 10(1)(b)(ii), a default sentence of four years will be imposed upon the failure to pay that amount, pro rated for any amount actually paid. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
